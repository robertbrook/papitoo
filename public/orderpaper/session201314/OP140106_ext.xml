      <p class="BusinessSub-SectionHeading">WESTMINSTER HALL DEBATES: CHANGE TO ALLOCATION PROCESS</p>
      <p class="AnnouncementText">From January 2014, for a trial period anticipated to continue to the summer recess, the Backbench Business Committee will be able to nominate subjects for the 9.30 to 11.00am debate in Westminster Hall on Tuesday mornings.</p>
      <p class="AnnouncementText">Applications from backbenchers for debates to take place in this slot can be made to the Backbench Business Committee using the application form available at <span class="WebAddress">www.parliament.uk/bbcom</span>. Guidance is available from the staff of the Committee (contact details are on the form). The Committee meets at 3.00pm on each sitting Tuesday to hear representations from Members on their applications.</p>
      <p class="AnnouncementText">The first occasion on which the Committee will meet to consider nominating for this slot is Tuesday 7 January, and the first such debate, if nominated, will take place on 14 January. Applications for this date should be made by Monday 6 January (in future weeks the deadline will be noon on Fridays, as for other backbench debate applications).</p>
      <p class="AnnouncementText">If the Backbench Business Committee does not nominate a subject for a particular Tuesday, it will be filled from the Speaker’s ballot in the usual way. Members can, therefore, continue to submit such applications to the ballot. Arrangements for the other Westminster Hall slots on Tuesdays and Wednesdays will continue as before.</p>
      <p class="AnnouncementText">The department rota for answering in Westminster Hall will apply to these debates. Please refer to the information about the rota contained in the Announcements section of the Order Paper before making an application. Applications may be made for the Tuesday morning slot in any future week for which the departmental rota has been announced.</p>
      <p class="AnnouncementText">This pilot arrangement was proposed by the Procedure Committee in its Review of the Backbench Business Committee, published in November 2012. It has been agreed by the Speaker, the Chairman of Ways and Means and the Backbench Business Committee. The results of the trial will be assessed by the Procedure Committee, and any comments on the trial should be sent to that Committee at <span class="WebAddress">ProcCom@Parliament.uk</span> or through the Clerk of the Procedure Committee, Journal Office, House of Commons.</p>
