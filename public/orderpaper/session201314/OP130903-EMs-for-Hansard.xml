      <OrderTitle>transparency of lobbying, non-party campaigning and trade union administration Bill: Second Reading</OrderTitle>
      <Text>
         <p>That this House affirms its belief in the need for a Bill on lobbying; declines to give a Second Reading to a Bill which requires further pre-legislative scrutiny and consultation; and considers that a Special Committee of the House should be set up with the remit of producing an improved Bill to be presented to the House within six months.</p>
      </Text>
      <Text>
         <p>That this House affirms its belief in the need for greater transparency in the lobbying industry and in British politics, and considers that there should be a universal register of all professional lobbyists backed by a code of conduct and sanctions, clear rules on third party campaigning, and real reform to get the big money out of politics; but declines to give a Second Reading to the Transparency of Lobbying, Third Party Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill because the proposals on lobbying cover only a tiny minority of the industry and will make lobbying less transparent, and the proposals on third party campaigning amount to a gag on charities and campaigners who have a democratic right to participate in important debates in the run up to elections; and strongly believes that the publication of such a Bill should have been preceded by a full process of pre-legislative scrutiny and consultation with affected parties.</p>
