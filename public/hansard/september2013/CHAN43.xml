see, made on an assumption of stable public sector employment. Owing to
the size of the public sector deficit that the coalition Government
inherited, public sector employment has been falling since then by more
than 400,000, and the size of the civil service is down by about 73,000
since the election, so the priority has been to reduce the amount of
property we occupy, rather than moving employment from one part of the

Actually, vacant space in the central Government estate is running at
about 2.5%, compared with the national average of over 10% across the
public and private sectors, so in fact Government Departments and
agencies are not finding it impossible to surrender leases—they
are doing so very effectively—or to sell properties where that
makes sense, although our preference is to occupy the freeholds and get
out of the
leaseholds<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:36:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090424000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090424000026"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:36:50"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Mr Philip Hollobone" PimsId="4744" UID="13090424000150" xid="858" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090424000150"><B>Mr

Syria. That is what our engagement with them has been all about. We go
further than that, however, because we recognise that the so-called
rebels who back those views also deserve our support through training,
assistance and advice. The truth is this: we will not get a peace
process in Syria unless President Assad realises that his regime is

Britain should use all its diplomatic muscle in discussions with those
countries that have backed the regime and by joining with countries

I come back to this point: it is all very well the countries that
support either side wanting peace talks to take place, but we also need
those involved in the conflict in Syria to recognise that it is in
their interests for a peace process to begin. I think that we can
convince the Syrian National Council that it is in its interests,
because a transition could lead to genuinely free elections and change
for Syria. However, we need Assad himself to realise that it is in his
interests, because there is no victory that he can win against his own
people. For that to happen, we need to take, and the world needs to
take, a very tough response to things such as chemical weapons attacks.
I accept that Britain cannot be and will not be part of any military
action on that front, but we must not in any degree give up our utter
revulsion at the chemical weapons attacks that we have seen and we must

What I said to the Prime Minister was, given the difficulty of getting
direct talks moving between the Syrian Government and opposition, is
there not a case for getting the regional partners involved? We all

Tehran, we will want to see some action so that we can build that sort
of relationship. I have reached out by writing to President Rouhani,
congratulating him on his accession to power and wanting to discuss
those issues. As I have said, however, if we believe there is just some
magical key to the Syrian conflict by suddenly adopting a totally
different posture towards Iran, I do not think we will be making a very
good decision.</hs_Para>

ignored the warnings and cut 500 staff from the Border Force before the

Border Force officers, and searching by the port authorities also takes
place, using equipment supplied by us. We also have contractors, who
were absolutely excellent and very successful when I visited in the

checks were not being conducted as they should have been in all cases,
it would be fair to say that in responding to the chief

was clearly necessary to increase the resources going into the

something that we keep under review, and it is a challenge for all
operational managers. 
<?notus-xml column=321?>I refer back to the National Audit Office’s last report, not the

intelligence. Obviously, as I said in my response, we use it to guide
the efforts that we put into freight checking. My hon. Friend has also
made the sensible point that there are peaks and troughs in the number
of passengers crossing the border. As well as our permanent work force,
we have staff on whom we can call at those peak times to ensure that we
continue to deliver a secure border, but we are also mindful, of the
need to deliver value for money, which the National Audit Office

the appalling financial legacy that we were left by the Labour

stress on the quality of border checks. As he will know, at the end of
the last Session I was privileged to be elected chair of the all-party
parliamentary group on human trafficking, and in that role I have been
meeting groups who work with trafficked people. Kalayaan tells me that
it has yet to meet a holder of an overseas domestic worker visa who,
under the new visa system, has actually carried his or her own passport
through the passport check. The passport is always held by the visa

the matter. In the meantime, given her position as chair of the

We hope that they will come back, in which case we will welcome them
warmly again. However, is it not time that there were separate 
<?notus-xml column=324?>streams at our airports and ports—one for UK nationals with UK
passports who are returning to the country, one for EU entrants and one
for everyone else? Would that not enable us to streamline the whole
process?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090431000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090431000049"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13090431000120" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090431000120">Mr

obligations as members of the European Union is to deal with European
passport holders together with those from the UK. Secondly—this

remodelling all our airports and ports, which I do not think would be
very sensible at present.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend’s point, however, is the need to ensure that
British citizens returning home, EU nationals coming to Britain and
people coming here from outside the EU all have a good experience at
the border. The NAO report suggests that we are performing the
necessary checks to make certain that the border is secure, while
processing people within the provisions of our service level agreements

very clear on my visits, as does the director-general, that we must
deal with both those challenges—people crossing the border and
freight. As I said in response to the shadow Home Secretary, there was
no suspension of freight checks at Calais. We adopt a multi-layered
approach. Even when Border Force officers are not searching vehicles,
the staff at the port and our contractors are doing so. I am confident
that there are proper checks on people coming into the United Kingdom,
and proper intelligence-led checks on freight and goods as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090431000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090431000053"><Member ContinuationText="Jackie Doyle-Price" PimsId="5689" UID="13090431000123" xid="1152" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090431000123"><B>Jackie

Harper:</Member></B> My hon. Friend asks a two-part question. The first
part was whether everyone trying to enter the UK illegally is
necessarily in France illegally. That is not necessarily the case.
France is in Schengen, of course, and there are people who are entitled
to be in France but who do not have the right to enter Britain
illegally in the back of a lorry, so we stop them entering. Some of
them are, of course, in France illegally, however, and we work with our
French colleagues by doing what we can to help them to make sure they
are removed from France. Not all of them will be in France illegally,
however, and I reiterate what I said in response to the Chair of the
Home Affairs Committee: partnership-working with our colleagues in
France is very important and works very well, and we want to make sure
that that strong relationship continues because it is how we keep our

hundreds of millions of cigarettes. We work with our colleagues
overseas to intercept where they are being manufactured and brought

thanking Members from all parts of the House, many of whom are present,

Lucy Herd and the Jack’s Rainbow campaign she established after
the loss of her 23-month-old son, Jack, in tragic circumstances in
August 2010. After his son’s death, Lucy’s partner was
given just five days’ compassionate leave before having to
return to work. Like many Members of the House I have spoken to, Lucy
was surprised that parents did not already have a legal right to paid
leave after the loss of a child, and I want to pay tribute to her for
working tirelessly to get paid bereavement leave for grieving parents
on to the statute
book.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090432000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090432000017">Most
of us can imagine nothing more distressing than losing a child. Yet at
this traumatic juncture in a parent’s life, there is no
guarantee of paid statutory leave in the event of a child’s
death. The physical and emotional toll on parents demands such a
provision. In the immediate aftermath of a child’s passing,
bereaved parents must cope not only with their own grief, but with that
of their family. Siblings must be comforted, and family and friends
informed. To add to the burden, a great deal of administrative work and
other arrangements must be undertaken: a funeral needs to be organised,
and schools and benefit offices must be notified. And in the case of a
sudden or accidental death, a post-mortem or inquest is required. That
may take many months to conclude, prolonging the
anguish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090432000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090432000018">At
present, all employees have the right to take immediate “time
off for dependants” under the Employment Rights Act 1996. That
is a legal right to unpaid leave to cope with family emergencies.
However, there is no set limit on how many days can be taken, only a
vague definition of a “reasonable amount of time”. Each
employer will have their own bereavement policy, which typically
provides for just three to five days’
leave.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090432000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0001.htm#13090432000019">In
response to an e-petition calling for statutory bereavement leave,
which has received almost 23,000 signatures, the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills stated that all requests for leave
related to bereavement are best left to employers and their employees
to decide between themselves. I understand that the amount of leave
needed can vary from one individual to another: some parents will not
be able to face going back to work, whereas others may find returning
to work a welcome distraction. Grief is not uniform—it affects
people in different ways—and each person will need a time
specific to them to deal with it.

employers act admirably and offer significant amounts of paid
bereavement leave. Regrettably, however, some do not. In a large number
of cases, employers have fallen far short of their duties. In one case
that was recently televised on an episode of Channel 4’s

daughter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T13:20:01"></hs_TimeCode>. In

was told to resume work or lose his
job<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T13:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>. On yet
another occasion, a parent was given just three days off after the
death of his four-year-old son. The funeral was arranged on the fourth

proceed. I fully acknowledge that long-term staff absenteeism can hit
productivity, particularly for small companies, but considering that
parents are given paid maternity and paternity leave, it is difficult
to argue why grief-stricken parents should not be afforded similar
statutory rights. A mother is afforded up to 12 months’ leave
for the birth of a child, but is given just three days for her loss.

intend the measure to place unaffordable costs or unwanted regulation

employers already choose to recognise their responsibilities to their
workers. I know the current economic climate is pushing many businesses

Responsibility and the Institute for Fiscal Studies have said, budget
deficit reduction has now stalled, not because the Government have not
cut public services or put up taxes for ordinary people but because
unemployment remains too high and economic growth too weak to get the
deficit down.</hs_Para>

the past three years taking whatever work he could get through
employment agencies, often on the minimum wage and often on zero-hours

today’s debate is about what has happened to those on average

whatever recovery is eventually secured—all economies eventually

below-average wages. The fall in wages is significant; it is the
largest in any of the major economies and I think the largest in the UK

drag on our ability to recover if we remain in a low-wage, low-skill

There is time enough. Even China is now coming under pressure from
Indonesia and Vietnam. If we try to get down to the levels of wages
there, we will not do it; the recovery must be about a higher skilled,
more productive economy in which rising incomes play a vital role.

to the future. What do we need to ensure we sustain this recovery?
First, we need the Government to accept the role of real incomes
rising—a vital element in sustaining the recovery—and
higher productivity to accompany that. Although we have done well in
some areas of employment, productivity has gone down. We need the
Government to accept the £10 billion infrastructure
recommendations by the International Monetary Fund, and we need a
housing programme and for building to get under way. All those things
remain to be done. We need direct action. We should get rid of Ofgem,
bring in a new regulator, and have direct action on energy and
transport prices. Such a programme could sustain the recovery and we
would see a slow build-up of real wages, which have been so
devastatingly hit by Government policies.</hs_Para>

under the Labour Government was far bigger. It was outrageous. Indeed,
it was Lord Mandelson who suggested that he was very relaxed about
people getting “filthy rich”. That was the legacy of new
Labour: 
<?notus-xml column=354?>debt, credit, massive bonuses and a totally irresponsible way of running
the economy. Such irresponsibility is largely responsible for the
situation we are in. We have had to follow a deficit reduction
strategy. That is working and the deficit has fallen by a third over
the past three years, from £160 billion to about £115
billion. That is a signal success. We see not only deficit reduction,
but—the jury is out on this, but I am confident—economic
recovery. This is very successful stewardship of the economy. It is not
only Government Members who agree with that assessment. Let us look at
the opinion polls. Even though it is true that Labour is maintaining a
slim lead, on the economic question and the question of the credibility
of economic policy, Labour, and the shadow Chancellor and Leader of the
Opposition as a team, consistently under-poll the Chancellor and Prime
Minister as economic stewards, because the public have not forgotten
the appalling mess that Labour left behind. Despite three difficult
years, the public refuse to accept that Labour has any ideas or
solutions to our difficult problems. They are well aware of the
appalling fiscal situation that Labour Members left
behind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090432000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0002.htm#13090432000196">Let
us look at some of the figures on fuel duty increases. We have
suspended the fuel duty escalator and prices have not gone up. We have
taken many low-paid people out of the tax system. People will recognise
that the Government’s efforts have been partly successful. We
have not reached the promised land and the goal that we set, but we are
getting there. People realise that any return to the Labour policies of
spend, borrow and spend even more will be fatal to the recovery.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:31:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Coventry North West (Mr Robinson) mentioned killing off the
recovery. The quickest way to kill off any recovery would be a return
of the Labour party to government. In my view and the view of many of
my constituents, that would be a form of national economic suicide. As
a nation, we must address and debate living standards, but we must also
put them in the context of the appalling economic and fiscal situation
that Labour Members left behind. It is hypocritical and disingenuous of
them to blame the coalition Government for the mess they created and
bequeathed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090432000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0002.htm#13090432000197">Finally,
I should say a few words of optimism. It is clear that there is a
renewed sense of optimism in the economic community. I am not rash
enough to suggest that the path ahead will be smooth. There will be
checks and times when there are doubts, but the general trend and
direction is clear. The latest Office for Budget Responsibility
forecast, from March—it seems likely to be
upgraded—predicted that average earnings in 2014 would increase
faster than consumer prices index inflation. It also predicts that, by
2016, living standards will be growing twice as fast as inflation. We
might well have reached an inflection point that will prove the success
and wisdom of the Government’s
polices.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_04_PT_1/C94D23F530014694A9F102EE10353EE7244148FA" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 September 2013">Wednesday

bill that they have to pay each month—on pain of imprisonment if
they do not pay it—is their income tax bill. In 2007, people had
to start paying income tax once their income rose to just over
£5,000. By the end of the next tax year, people will be able to
take home £10,000 before they have to pay income tax. That is a
halving of the income tax bill for the hard-working person who works
full time on the minimum wage. It is also a 20% real-terms reduction in
the tax bill of someone on median income. That is the action that a

broadly steady, which has meant a 9.5% real-terms reduction. Under the
previous Government, fuel taxes were increased on 12 separate occasions
for my constituents. Indeed, the previous Chancellor legislated for a

was telling the House about the indignity, anguish and anxiety that
afflict many of my constituents, and that daily grind people down.
There are a number of things the Government could do, and I want to
address them in the short time that I have. First, the Government
should and could take immediate action to create jobs by investing in
infrastructure. We badly need new schools, we badly need new homes and,
in some areas, we badly need new hospitals. Constituencies like Wigan,
where the construction industry has always been important to the local
economy, need that investment, not just because we will get the
buildings we need but because it will provide jobs and apprenticeships
for young people.</hs_Para>

used to be one of the key routes for young people leaving school to get
into the labour market and learn skills that could take them beyond the
sort of low-paid work that hon. Members have described. If the
Government were to take action immediately, it would be a huge relief
not just to me but to the 1 million young people who are out of work
and who ought to be a national priority. We know that this should be a
national priority, because we know what happens when young people are
left out of work: they suffer prolonged periods of unemployment,
insecure employment and wage- scarring effects well into their 40s.
What we are seeing at the moment is limited action to create
apprenticeships. I am seeing young people in a revolving door of
apprenticeships, taking on work experience, internships and
apprenticeships over and over again. These do not lead to a real, paid,
lasting job. Government Members heavily criticised the future jobs fund
for being expensive, but I say to Ministers: please recognise that
investing money in young people up front is repaid in droves. It is the
right thing to do morally; it is the right thing to do
economically<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:54:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0002.htm#13090435000044">Many

about the increasing casualisation of the work force, something that
the workers in the Hovis factory in my constituency are rightly
standing up against at the moment. People on zero-hours contracts

evidence of widespread exploitation. I would be grateful if the

Gentleman on a history course. If he looks more closely at what
happened under the previous Government, he will see that not only youth
unemployment fall, but that at the one point in the mid-2000s when it
rose it was because there were more young people compared with jobs. It
was due to an increase in young people, not a shortage of jobs. The
previous Government immediately took action to reduce youth
unemployment, something I hope Ministers revisit and learn from in view

constituency on below the living wage. I say to Ministers that low pay
is not a ladder for most people. They are trapped in low pay, which is
why we need action on the living wage. It is not just important for
individuals and their families; it is important for the local economy.
If people are not spending, small and medium-sized enterprises fold and
the cycle continues. I ask Ministers this: where is the pressure?
Condemn those multinationals, implement a living wage and refuse to do
business with companies that will not take action. It is time for us to
take concrete action. Our families and our young people simply cannot
afford for us not to do

which will help with the cost of child care for people with children
under the age of 12. We are ensuring that energy customers are placed
on the lowest tariff. We have introduced the triple lock for the state
pension, to ensure that we never again have the national scandal of our
pensioners being given a derisory pension increase each year. We are

uniform increase, which might price some people out of the labour
market. However, there is a case for asking whether larger companies or
those that are making healthy profits should not be paying their staff
more, because at the moment we are subsidising some employers to pay
low wages, through the tax credit system that the previous Government
introduced. I very much hope that the 
<?notus-xml column=364?>Government will look at how we tackle the issue of quality of life for
people on low pay from both ends, by raising the personal allowance, so
that we do not tax them so much, but also seeing whether we can ensure

the Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy) on the need for a history lesson. It
is absolutely right that we focus on the needs of young people.
However, Government Members in this debate somehow seem to have
forgotten that a previous Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer had to
rescue modern apprenticeships from the history books in order to give
this country a proper industrial skills policy again. I am glad that
Government Members support that and that it has been kept going, such
that young people will still have the chance to get an apprenticeship
in this country, but let

that proper industrial skills policy was put back.</hs_Para>

us completely. Those of us on the Labour Benches believe in investing
money in housing, for example. I have just mentioned the huge rents
that people have to pay, and how difficult it is for people on average
wages to live in London without relying on housing benefit. If we could
build more houses in central London and the south-east, house prices
would not be as high as they are now and people would not need to rely
on benefits in the way that they do. That makes sense. If we build
homes, we also provide jobs and infrastructure, lower our dependence on
housing benefit and lower housing prices generally. We will offer hope
and opportunity for the next generation. I have no idea why the
Government will not do this, but they are refusing to invest properly.

to my original brief, those in part-time work do not earn enough money
to be able to afford a good standard of living and that applies even to
some of those in full-time work, so some have to rely on benefits. We
have seen that 60% of new jobs since the last election are in the
low-paid sectors of our economy—retail and residential. Between
1997 and 2010, 25% of the new jobs established were in those sectors.
Why is this difference occurring? A Resolution Foundation study has
shown that 4.8 million Britons—20% of all 
<?notus-xml column=369?>employees—earn below the living wage, which is a leap from 3.4
million—14%—at the height of the recession. Why is that

is happening because our economy is unfair and unbalanced. What are the
Government going to do about it? How are they going to address the
problem? They cannot simply keep sailing on and hope that things are
going to be all right. Things are not going to be all right. The
evidence shows that there will continue to be people who just manage to
grab on to work by their fingertips, but not by enough for them to be
able to sustain themselves and their families. Even those in full-time
work, particularly in areas such as London and the south-east, cannot
afford to live without being supported by benefits. In the end, this is
unsustainable; we must raise wages in real terms.</hs_Para>

Islington. The problem is not just the obvious and manifest cost of

admit that we have seen growth of 0.6% in the last quarter. However,
according to the TUC, 80% of the new jobs that have been
created—it has been claimed that there are 1.3 million, but that
figure is contested by the director of the Office for National

low-wage, low-investment, falling-productivity economy, with living

Government Members said “Oh dear, it will be all over. We will
lose the triple-A rating if Labour gets in.” Well, we have lost
it, and why has that happened? It has happened because objective
observers have seen that productivity is falling, not rising, that the
jobs that are being created are low-grade jobs, and that the
distribution of investment is skewed towards the next general election,
with 80% of all infrastructure investment being made in London and the
south-east—which needs the least investment—and most of
the cuts being made in the north and in Wales: in places such as my
constituency in Swansea, where 40% of people work in the public sector.
Yes, we want investment in the private sector, but the way to boost
local economies is not to cut people’s wages, jobs and services,

providing more funding for firms so they have more cash flow and can

banks is about the same as it was—it is 0.3% less than in
2008—but lending to business is 32% down. It is massively down
in all the major sectors. In January lending to business was 3% lower

responsibility when that is due, but it seems as though for this
Government the past three years have not happened. In my constituency,
a coal-fired power station has closed down. That is good for the
environment, but Scottish Power and the Spanish firm, Iberdrola, cannot
invest the necessary money to convert that into a gas cylinder plant
because the Government are not giving clarity on the charges for
connecting to the grid. We should all share the responsibility.
Unfortunately, in opposition, there is less that we can do about it,
whereas the hon. Gentleman has the privilege of being in government. I
wish the Government would use the little time that they have left in
office to get on and make a difference to the lives of my

That is a catastrophic fall in income for many households at  a

Government’s actions. One of the Government’s very first

families can afford that, especially given the downward pressure on
wages? In part, that is a result of the Government’s decision to
cut the early intervention grant by 40% in real terms, so limiting the
capacity of councils to contribute towards child care provision. The
cost of child care in Britain is the highest in Europe, and instead of
demonising parents who cannot work as skivers, how about the Government
considering the costs that they have allowed to pile up to such an
extent that parents cannot afford the child care that would allow them
to go back to
work?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0002.htm#13090435000156">More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:49:42"></hs_TimeCode>

the Tories in national and local government have made the problem
worse, Labour in local government is acting to solve it. I commend
Edinburgh city council, ably led by its Labour leader Councillor Andrew
Burns, for using co-operative values to explore setting up a city-wide
child care co-operative, aiming to reduce costs and increase
accessibility for parents with young children. The council is working
with parent-led, out-of-school care providers to set up after-school
clubs and mutual child care services, helping them to achieve
co-operative status and setting up a service level agreement to bring
stability and sustainability to the sector. That is Labour offering

daily bus fares for every Oldham resident. It worked up the business

Lambeth’s Labour-led council, which I am very familiar with. It
worked with the community to set up a microgeneration co-operative

working people. It is the equivalent of a year and a half’s

with a new 10p starting rate to be paid for by a mansion tax on
properties worth more than £2 million. However, they will not go
that extra mile. Why? Because they do not understand the pressures that
household budgets are under. After all, how could they? Government

this House recognises the importance of the energy industry to the
security and prosperity of the UK economy; notes that the average
household energy bill has increased by over £300
since the 2010 general election; further notes that the big six energy
companies have had a £3.3 billion uplift in profits over the
same period; welcomes the recent report on Energy Prices, Profits and
Poverty from the Energy and Climate Change Committee (Fifth Report, HC
108) which found that Ofgem is failing consumers; regrets that the
Government has halved support for people in fuel poverty, and that as
of 20 August 2013 only 132 households had signed up for a Green Deal
plan; further regrets the Prime Minister’s broken promise to
legislate so that energy companies have to give the lowest tariff to
their customers; and calls on the Government to bring forward
amendments to the Energy Bill to make the energy market more
competitive and transparent by requiring energy companies to pool the
power they generate and to make it available to any retailer, to create
a tough new energy watchdog with the power to force energy companies to
pass on price cuts when wholesale costs fall, and to put all over-75
year olds on the cheapest

this afternoon, we heard from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:45:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friends
the Members for Leeds West (Rachel Reeves) and for Nottingham East
(Chris Leslie) about the full scale of the cost-of-living crisis
unfolding in Britain. For 37 of the 38 months in which this Government
have been in power, real wages have fallen. At the same time that
people have seen their incomes squeezed, the cost of living has also
increased sharply. In the last three years alone, the average household
energy bill has increased by over £300. It is no wonder that
Which? research has shown that 79% of people now worry about how to pay
their energy bills. With nearly four in 10 people saying they are
likely to have to cut back on their energy spending in the coming
months, and with warnings of more price rises coming later this year, I
make no apologies for returning to a topic that we have debated a
number of times in the last couple of
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:46:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000761" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000761">As
we know, energy companies claim that there is a whole raft of reasons
why energy bills are going up—wholesale costs, network charges
and social and environmental obligations. With all those extra costs,
one might think that profit margins would have come down, but quite the
opposite. It is now clear that, regardless of those costs, these
companies have seen a substantial increase in their profits. We know
that because since 2009, energy companies have been required to publish
information on their financial performance, including their profits.
The information shows that in 2009, Britain’s big six energy
companies made just over £2.2 billion in profit. In 2012, by
contrast, they made more than £3.7 billion in profit—an
increase of nearly 70%. Overall, over the last three years,
Britain’s big six energy companies have seen a huge profits
uplift of more than £3.3 billion. If anything, this is likely to
be an underestimate because it excludes their profits on trading and
from gas

The companies that keep the hospitals warm, factories working and the

the British economy. They employ hundreds of thousands of people and

power stations, pipes and wires.</hs_Para>

Carrington in Manchester, is scheduled to open before the next

Minister told the House that the scheme would be “bigger and
better” than any schemes that had preceded it. It would be
groundbreaking, revolutionary, and the envy of countries all over the

Department of Energy and Climate Change, the right hon. Member for

have set out the first problem. The second problem is that if energy
problems can source most or all of the power that they need for their
customers from their power stations, there is much less need to trade
in the open market. According to one estimate from the London Energy
Brokers Association, average daily market traded volumes were just 6%
of total generation. For those reasons, we have proposed the pool to
which the motion refers. A pool would be a single mechanism
bringing  all generators and suppliers together to buy and sell
all their power.</hs_Para>

put it simply, in a pool—or an open exchange, or whatever else
we might call it—all generators will be required to sell all the
power that they generate on to an open market, and all suppliers will
have to buy it from there, too. That would do two very important
things: it would put a break between generation and supply; and it
would result in much greater volumes being traded openly. Indeed, that
is one reason why the markets in other countries where there is a more
exchange-based trading system, such as Nord Pool, are more liquid, more
transparent and have more market participants. I believe that such a
market would be more attractive to invest in, particularly for
independent generators or companies wishing to enter the supply

pool or open exchange would have one other big advantage over the
current market arrangements. The Energy Bill introduces contracts for
difference to encourage investment in low-carbon sources of
electricity. Those are essentially contracts with low-carbon
electricity generators to pay a fixed price for the power that they
produce. If the price that the generator receives in the market is less
than the agreed strike price, consumers are liable to make up the
difference. At the moment, with such little trading happening on the
open market, there is no reliable way to work out what the market price

our proposals for a more competitive open energy market, the motion
calls for a much tougher regulator than we have had in the past. As I
said earlier, in its report the Select Committee echoed many of our
criticisms of Ofgem over the past year. I do not intend to rehearse all
those criticisms, as it could take some time, but I want to urge the
House to support one important change. In a properly competitive
market, cost reductions should be passed on as quickly and as fully as
cost increases. At the moment, when wholesale costs increase, bills go
up like a rocket, but when wholesale costs fall, bills fall like a
feather, if at all. That is why our motion calls on the House to
support the establishment of a tough new regulator with a statutory
duty to monitor the relationship between the prices that energy
companies pay for their energy and the bills that the public pay and
the power to force the companies to cut prices when wholesale costs
fall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000826" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000826">Why
is this all so important to the public? Rather than never having had it
so good, as the Government try to tell them, rising energy bills are
one of the main reasons why they are finding it harder and harder to
make ends meet. Even in better times, though, the public deserve a fair
deal. This problem is not confined to the poorest. Millions of people
are facing real hardship because of a cost-of-living crisis reinforced,
I am afraid, by the Government’s complacency over soaring energy
prices, incompetence in helping the public to insulate their homes and
indifference to the plight of our oldest citizens paying over the odds
for the energy that they use. Last year, there were 24,000 excess
winter deaths in our country. Even on the Government’s revised
definition, well over 2 million households are in fuel poverty, and the
gap between their bills and what they can afford to pay is growing ever
wider.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000827" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000827">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T17:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>

return on that investment—some profit—and she was
commendably clear that she believes that profit is needed. But when I
asked her what she thought excessive profit—unfair
profit—was, there was no answer. Yet given her motion, her
speech and her press release, one would be forgiven for thinking that
she had a view on what prices were fair and what profit levels were
right. The problem is that it is not clear whether she wants any more
competition or regulation. At times, she seemed to be advocating a
wholesale re-regulation of Britain’s energy markets, with price
controls—perhaps profit controls. Is she advocating price and
profit controls? We need to know. What exactly is Labour proposing? If

I talk about the action that I and the Government are taking to help

already demolished its first proposal to abolish Ofgem. The House might

that Labour put in place after it abolished the pool, things have not
got much better. Labour’s abolition of the pool produced the
vertically integrated energy markets that we see today. Independent
generators find it tough to get into the wholesale market because of
the changes that Labour made. Independent suppliers do not find the
wholesale market competitive enough to supply their customers.
Electricity prices are therefore likely to be higher than they should
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000853" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000853">The

want to reintroduce the pool, because that would be an expensive
distraction and would not tackle the real problem, which is liquidity
in the forward markets. We are going to tackle that with a well thought
through package that is designed to drive competition to help
consumers. Ofgem’s “secure and promote” proposals
include the idea of a market maker and mandating the six vertically
integrated companies—the big six—to publish the prices at
which they will buy and sell up to two years in advance. That will help
independent suppliers and large power

an independent regulator. The proposals that have been made are
Ofgem’s, 
<?notus-xml column=407?>but I am on the record as supporting them strongly. As I have explained,

about the third element of Labour’s package? It is a bit vague,
talking about tackling the big six. The House should know from what I

I have made clear, we have policies to help hard-pressed consumers and

market. We now have our “offtake of last resort”
mechanism through an amendment that I introduced into the Energy Bill
in the other place, and we are supporting Ofgem’s reforms to the
retail market to deliver tariff simplification and get a better deal
for more consumers. Labour failed to do that even when pushed to do so
in the House. The confusing array of tariffs—there were a huge
number—got to such a point that it was hindering competition and
hurting consumers, not helping them and driving competition. We are
right to back Ofgem with more reserve powers so that we can ensure that
vulnerable people are not left being fleeced on so-called dead tariffs,

to the energy market is at the heart of the problem. Following the
recent report, which was a forensic examination of how the market
works, it disregarded the recommendations of the independent
consultant, and the Select Committee says that it should reconsider the

back then, but nobody listened. We knew there would be a shortage in
delivery of electricity and gas, and that we would run out of North sea

that we were not going to build any nuclear power stations, but we have
gone back on that as well, because we have realised that we have to
have a base load so that people can keep their lights on. If we do not

also regret what happened before that, because in the 1980s and early
1990s we knew that we had to build new power stations, but we did not
do a lot about it. We built some gas-powered stations, but we knew that
we would run out of gas unless we went to the middle east or Africa to
get it. The one issue that struck home with everyone was security of
supply. When Tony Blair stood up and said that in this Chamber, people
asked, “What has happened? He has changed his mind.” But
he understood that something had happened in the world that meant that
we had to ensure we had security of supply.</hs_Para>

privilege to follow my colleague on the Select Committee, whose passion
for the concerns of his constituents about their energy bills I share,
both because my constituents also rate this the most important issue in
their cost of living and because I had the privilege of visiting his
constituency at his invitation and meeting many people there. Their
incomes are lower—temperatures are lower too—and so it is
even more important for him to get the costs down. That is why we have
to address these issues objectively and

motion is disgraceful in two respects. First, it does not mention the
one item of energy bills that is within the control and discretion of
the House—the additional costs that we impose on people through
the switch from fossil fuels to renewables. It is the only factor that
we directly control, but the Opposition ignore it. We know that the
least costly renewable, onshore wind, is at least twice as expensive as
fossil fuels in generating electricity. Offshore wind is three times as
expensive. I suspect that photovoltaics are a multiple of that.
Already, the cost of renewables adds 5% to gas bills, 14% to
electricity bills and 9% overall. That is a lot and it is expected to
rise, but people might be surprised that it is not even higher still,
given that wind is so much more expensive than fossil fuels. The reason
for that is that the figures hugely understate the extra costs that 
<?notus-xml column=412?>every household in the country is bearing because of the switch to
renewables. I have a letter from the Secretary of State in which he
acknowledges that only a third of the cost of renewables falls directly
on households’ energy bills, while two thirds falls on the
non-domestic sector. In other words, that two thirds leads to a rise in
the cost of all the other products that we consume because of the rise
in the cost of
electricity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T17:50:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000895"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davey" PimsId="2851" UID="13090435001696" xid="154" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435001696">Mr

Overall, if one third of the cost of renewables is falling on
households directly, the other two thirds also falls on households.
There is no such thing as industry in this case. All costs are borne by
individuals: by consumers and employees, and by pensioners through the
impact on the value of shares and profits that are held largely by
pension funds. We should not allow the costs we are imposing on people

second disgraceful aspect of the Opposition motion is the pretence that
the rise in energy bills we have experienced in recent years is largely
or entirely due to a rise in profits. I wish that were true. If it were
true that the rise in profits accounted for the 41% rise in gas prices
and the 20% rise in electricity prices, undoubtedly those profits would
be excessive and we could bring down profits and prices by greater
competition or better regulation. Sadly, however, it is not true. Table

to—but a critique of the Government, as well as previous
Governments. I stand by social tariffs. It is right to help the poorest
in our society, who are suffering. That is important. The Secretary of

to the Energy and Climate Change Committee report on prices, profits
and poverty. The inquiry discovered the complexities of the current,
vertically integrated system and found it difficult to establish the
profits and losses on the companies’ balance sheets. It is not
that the

is also mistrust between the public and the energy companies, as we
have discussed in a number  of debates. It remains a concern
that prices are rising quickly, and that the price to the consumer goes
up considerably when the global price of oil increases but does not go
down nearly so quickly when the global price is reduced. I believe that
there is consensus between the Government and the Opposition that we
should examine that issue with the regulator, to establish how 
<?notus-xml column=415?>best to deal with it. Ofgem has done some good work on that already.
However, <hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:01:15"></hs_TimeCode>I have
to take issue with the Secretary of State’s comment that he was
putting pressure on the regulator and that all the good results were
coming from that Government pressure. When things do not work out quite
so well for the consumer, the regulator is described as independent.
The Secretary of State cannot have it both ways. The regulator is
independent, and I believe that it needs more teeth. It also needs to
use some of the powers that it already has.</hs_Para>

prices went up, but for those who are not on the grid, they went up
considerably more. That has become a huge issue. The alternatives to

do not have much time left, and I want to develop this important point.
I have raised it with the Secretary of State and with the Ministers who
have appeared before the Select Committee. They have always tried to
push the subject away by saying that it is a matter for Ofgem. In the
Select Committee, however, I have put questions to the chief executive
of the regulator, and he says that it is a matter for the Government.
It is time for us all to sit down and look at this together, because
the rise in prices is causing great anxiety and hardship for many of

want to see the establishment of a champion for those customers who do
not have mains gas or electricity, as well as for those who do. Those
customers do not benefit from dual fuel deals. We can talk about an
average price for a household, but they will be paying more.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:03:12"></hs_TimeCode> would
appreciate a straight response from the Secretary of State on this. A
Back-Bench Committee and an all-party group have looked into it and
made recommendations. I am sure that he has seen their report on the

champion.</hs_Para>

want to make a few more brief points. We talk about the domestic
customers who have been severely hit by the uprating in prices, but
businesses, including small businesses, are also affected. I would like
businesses to be able to compare prices in the same way that domestic
customers can. When small businesses are set up, they are hit by rates
and start-up costs, and they then get hit by high energy bills.
However, it is difficult for them to switch from one company to
another. To be fair, the Government are looking at this issue and
trying to do something to help, but I believe that if those businesses
could use a price comparison—instead of receiving bespoke prices
from each individual energy company, as they do at present—they
would have a greater choice. Businesses are telling me loud and clear
that excessively high energy bills are resulting in a lack of
investment in their
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:04:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000920" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000920">My
final point is on the cost and impact of the transmission of
electricity and gas to the regions. The National Grid Company is a
private, American-owned company that passes all its profits to
shareholders.  
<?notus-xml column=416?>It passes any extra costs on to its customers via the generator. I would
like to see National Grid acting in the British national interest, not
in shareholders’ interests; I would like to see a not-for-profit
organisation distributing our electricity. We could then have a bigger
impact and reduce the transmission costs, which are
considerable—about 16% of the energy prices that customers
pay.</hs_Para>

problem is that people pay more for gas and electricity on peripheries

Government’s errors of omission and commission with respect to
energy policy. If we look at energy policy in the long view, its impact
on energy prices and the effect of those prices on fuel poverty, we

trebled as a direct consequence of the energy price
increases—largely gas prices, which went up by 42% in the Blair
years between 2003 and 2007, and by a whopping 74% by 2009. The Leader
of the Opposition, who tabled today’s motion, should be somewhat
embarrassed to remember that for some of that time he was Secretary of
State for Energy and Climate Change, so that happened partly on his
watch, as he watched and saw 2.8 million more people being trapped by
the scourge of fuel

Labour’s solution, which was to spend more and more money to try
to alleviate fuel poverty was like sticking a plaster on a gaping

line with a feeling of consensus, we certainly need to find some new
solutions. There are more, but I shall mention four of them, some
already mentioned today. The first is to deal with the complexity of
energy bills; we all agree that they are far too complex. Many
consumers—possibly the poorest and the least
educated —do not feel confident about switching their
bills. About 75% of consumers have not switched their energy provider
in the past two years, while 55% have not even looked to try. We
certainly need to make the bills much simpler, so that consumers become
more confident about switching. Tariffs, too, need to be made simpler,
and we need to ensure that people are put on the lowest tariff that is
best for them. The Energy Bill commits to that, and the Prime Minister
is committed to it. I am sure that it will happen.</hs_Para>

the hon. Gentleman has been saying is very relevant. Now that he has
referred to the role of the regulator, let me ask him this. At a time
when wholesale prices were falling rapidly but that fall in prices was
not being passed on to the consumer, the best that Ofgem could say on
Hogmanay—which is before new year’s eve—was that
if the six companies continued to operate in the same way, they would
have jam on their fingers. Does he think that that was
enough?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000931" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000931"><B><Member ContinuationText="Christopher Pincher" PimsId="5624" UID="13090435001713" xid="1162" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435001713">Christopher
Pincher:</Member></B> I can certainly tell the right hon. Gentleman

fourth way in which I think we can help consumers to pay less and can
deal with fuel poverty is by reducing our over-reliance on imported gas
and oil, and hence our exposure to the fluctuations in international
hydrocarbon prices, which is one of the reasons why bills have gone up
like rockets, causing so many consumers so much pain.</hs_Para>

easy solution to the problem of developing home-grown energy, much as
its proponents may like to think that there is. Wind is not the
solution in either the short or the long term, because it is
intermittent. In the short term, nuclear is not the answer, because
building it takes so long and is so costly. However, we could profit
from proper exploration of the 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas
that is buried beneath our feet—some 60 years’ worth of
supply according to the current trajectory—to help to reduce our
exposure to international prices and the cost that that
implies.</hs_Para>

States, which I realise is not a perfect mirror image of our country,
the shale gas revolution has cut wholesale energy prices in half. Gas
in the US now trades at a price five times lower than the price in
Europe, and seven times lower than the price in Asia. That is of
massive benefit to American industry. It gives it a competitive edge,
so it can create more jobs and the people who become employed have the
income with which to pay their power bills. It also reduces the cost to
hard-pressed consumers. I therefore hope that we will pursue shale gas
with a vengeance. I commend the Government for what they have already
done in ending the moratorium, increasing the number of licences

Wilson</B> (East Antrim) (DUP):</Member> This is an important debate.
Many of our constituents are affected by the increase in fuel bills and
by fuel poverty, and businesses throughout the United Kingdom are
affected by the fact that they are up against competition from those in
countries with lower energy costs and are unable to compete with them.
We have lost thousands of jobs as a result of high energy prices in the
United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

measures proposed in the motion are, of course, desirable. If we can
redistribute the costs to help those who are in the greatest fuel
poverty, we should of course do so. If an industry which is not totally
competitive can be better regulated, that should of course
happen—although regulation that is inconsistent or changes the
rules too often will add to costs. A huge amount of investment that is
needed, but capital markets will not make money available for
investment if the rules are continually changing, so we must be very
careful when we talk about the degree of regulation that should be
applied.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000940" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0003.htm#13090435000940">Like
the right hon. Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley), I want to
make some comments about the element of our energy costs that is not
dealt with in the motion. That part is the cost of
decarbonising—as it is now called—our energy supply.
Despite what people have said, it has added costs to the consumer and
is going to continue to do so. We cannot be schizophrenic about this by
on the one hand condemning the increase in energy prices and on the
other hand supporting policies that are contributing to that.</hs_Para>

us look at the costs. Because renewable energy is so expensive, there
is a compulsion to purchase electricity under the renewables obligation
at much higher prices than fossil fuels. The figures have been quoted
today. Offshore wind is now the favoured option. It is three and a half
times more expensive than gas, and that will probably change further,
especially as gas prices will come down with fracking.</hs_Para>

are also the increased costs of distribution to link up all the diverse
sources. The National Grid recently published a consultation document,
“Demand Side Balancing Reserve and Supplemental Balancing
Reserve”, in which it talks about linking into generators across
the country which could lead to electricity being bought at 30 times
the cost of that generated by gas. 
<?notus-xml column=419?>There is the question of all the back-up and infrastructure that will be
required for when wind drops off, too. All those things need to be

take a moment to look at how we got into this position. GCSE economics
tells us that demand and supply drive prices. If there is low supply
and high demand, prices inevitably go up, and electricity prices have
been rising by more than inflation for a long time now. That is because
we as a nation have not addressed our electricity supply. We did not go
to the trouble of building power stations when we should have done, but
we cannot build a power station overnight. It takes a long time to get
it through the planning process and to put the funding in place, and
that process should have begun under the last Labour Government. We
should now have been turning on nuclear power stations that could
supply the base load to keep the lights on in this nation. We are
having to pick up that difficult position and try to deal with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090435000947" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090435000947">At
the same time that was happening, our coal-fired power stations have
been going downhill. They have not been upgraded and repaired. We are
therefore now in a situation in which the renewables sector is not
growing fast enough, the nuclear power stations have not been built,
and our coal-fired power stations are about to come to the end of their
natural life. Dealing with that will be an enormous problem, and the
impact on consumers will be

are we going to do to deal with that? Credit is due to this Minister
for starting to deal with some of the problems. He is trying to get the
green deal moving so people can insulate their homes. He is trying to
reduce their energy bills and educate them about how they can reduce
their energy bills and consumption, and he is working with Ofgem to try
to put pressure on the energy companies to reduce the tariffs so
people’s bills can be squeezed lower. He has also addressed the
need to build new power stations to get new electricity supplies on
stream. This is not easy, because not only are energy bills increasing,
but some of those new technologies are not very popular, certainly with
my constituents. Some new technologies, such as anaerobic digestion,
are palatable and people will tolerate them. However, people are not as
enthused about wind turbines and they are certainly not enthused about
energy recovery plants, such as the one proposed in my constituency at
Bilsthorpe; people 
<?notus-xml column=420?>do not want incineration. I hope that the Minister
will talk to his colleagues in the Department for Communities and Local

build it.</hs_Para>

I wish to mention one thing that will have a big impact on some
specific constituencies: the loss of concessionary coal for consumers
who used to work in the coal industry. The collapse of UK Coal means
that they will lose their right to free coal. I hope that the Minister
will take that on board and talk to the Treasury to try to support
those people, because that will have a big impact on them as the winter

Mike Weir</B> (Angus) (SNP):</Member> We must never forget that it has
been estimated that for every 5% rise in energy prices a further 46,000
households go into fuel poverty. The Department’s own figures
show that between 2010 and 2012 average domestic energy bills rose by
an average of £250, with 78% of that increase resulting from
higher gas prices and 22% from higher electricity prices. The
escalation in energy prices cannot be looked at in isolation: just as
energy bills are rising, so is the cost of road fuel, food and another
essentials. Clearly, that has a serious impact on families, who cannot
continue to absorb such large increases at a time when wages are, at
best, static. I accept what the Secretary of State said about the
energy companies having to make profits, but the issue is the amount of
these profits and their substantial rise at a time when everybody else
is having to tighten their belt. That needs to be examined more
closely.</hs_Para>

the Energy Bill, the Government sought to take powers to implement the
Prime Minister’s promise to put everyone on the lowest tariff,
but, unfortunately, as I have said many times, the Bill does not seem
to have that effect. The wording does not require the energy companies
to put people on the lowest tariff, but only to make an offer, which
may be lost in the mass of paper we receive from them already. I
suspect that many people are still not on the cheapest tariff. Even
these changes fail to do anything to help some of the poorest in our
society, who have to rely on pre-payment meters. Someone on a direct
debit tariff may be fine, but someone on a pre-payment meter will still
be stuck on a higher tariff, as meters are generally on a higher tariff
than someone paying by direct debit. If the Government are truly intent
on ensuring that everyone has the lowest possible bills, they need to
ensure not only that that applies within the type of contract that
people already have, which is what is happening at the moment, but that
people can move to a cheaper type of contract.</hs_Para>

problems are faced by those with pre-payment meters. It has always
seemed to me slightly perverse that such meters are one of the few
examples where consumers end up paying much more by paying cash in
advance. The issue is important, and the Minister and I have debated it
previously. Citizens Advice Scotland issued a report on energy
recently, which showed that it had dealt with a massive number of
people who had different energy issues. It said:</hs_Para>

cases highlighted by bureaux regarding difficulty paying are more

problem is that not only does the tariff tend to be higher—to be
fair, many companies now fix it at their standard tariff—but it
is higher than the tariffs that can be achieved by, for example, direct
debit. That is coupled with the fact that many, but not all, of these
people on pre-payment meters are put on them because they have a debt,
part of which is recouped every time they top up the meter. Because
this debt is added on, they are, in effect, pushed further into debt.
The report cites the case of a single parent with two children who
currently loses £7 towards the arrears every time she puts
£10 in the meter—the remaining £3 is simply
insufficient. That situation has to be dealt with.</hs_Para>

tariffs between companies and it seems to me that that will not really
hit the problem. We used to have a higher winter fuel allowance for
more elderly people. We cannot go back to that, but perhaps we should
be telling the energy companies that we should have a standard tariff
across all the companies especially for elderly people to ensure that
every one of them gets the lowest tariff irrespective of the company

Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden said, are the part of the
debate that we in this House can affect. RWE npower issued a report in
July on what will happen to energy prices in the United Kingdom in the
coming years. It predicted all sorts of interesting things, but the
commodity and production costs that make up 45% of an average bill will
reduce by 2020 to 35% of an average bill as rising policy and
transportation costs become more significant. Supplier
costs—their cut, their profit—will remain about 16%, so
where is the big increase? Transportation costs and the costs of
updating the UK’s network of infrastructure to accommodate lower
carbon and more distributed generation technologies are expected to add
an extra £114 to the average domestic bill by 2020—a 124%
increase on 2007 prices. That is the money for connecting turbines and
other dispersed energy to the grid.</hs_Para>

and regulation costs are expected to rise by 78% between 2013 and 2020.
That is meant to pay for the low-carbon economy and significantly
improve energy efficiency, as we have heard. Those are worthy aims but
have huge costs attached. There are also huge costs for the consumer,
who will end up paying for all those things. In 2011, National Grid
produced a report entitled “Operating the Electricity
Transmission Networks in 2020”. It talked about wind turbines
and said that during periods of demand renewable generation output is
likely not to be enough, but because it is a must-take resource, wind
power will need to be constrained in some way.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:29:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Angus (Mr Weir) made the point that when the Prime Minister
announced the Energy Bill policies on the hoof at Prime
Minister’s Question Time, he told us that he would legislate to
put customers on the cheapest tariff. That promise was reduced to a
promise to simplify the tariffs that energy companies offered. I am
sure that everyone would welcome simplification as an
important tool in enabling customers to make a choice between different
companies, but simplification by itself does not reduce energy
prices.</hs_Para>

simplification process now underway has in some cases led to people
having to pay more for their energy, rather than less. I want to draw
attention to those low users of energy, often those on low incomes, who
are now worse off because of the insistence, as a result of the Ofgem
review, on companies having both a standing charge and a unit rate.
After years of trying to get standing charges reduced or abolished
because they are particularly damaging for those on low incomes, we
are now seeing pressure on companies to bring them
back.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:30:41"></hs_TimeCode>A
constituent who contracted me was told by npower—this applies to
other companies and is more the fault of Ofgem trying to implement
Government policies—that if he spent less than £27 on gas
and £12 on electricity a month, he would see an increase in his
overall costs. Indeed, he has worked out his energy costs and found
that his bill would rise by between 50% and 60% as a result. That is an
example of how, bluntly, inventing policy on the hoof, not thinking it
through and then 
<?notus-xml column=423?>attempting to deliver it is damaging constituents. That is just one
example of where I think the Government have to monitor carefully the
effects of the policies to standardise tariffs that are being
implemented. They must also ensure that companies do not end up
profiting as a result of the way the tariffs have been
introduced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000012">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T18:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>

one—of customers now being worse off as a result of the way
simplification has been put into effect. The Government need to review
that straight away. We need to look at that to ensure that low energy
users, particularly those on low incomes, do not lose out as a result
of the Government’s

want to offer a Northern Ireland perspective. Northern Ireland’s
biggest energy company, Power NI, increased its household electricity

pay, on average, an extra £90 a year. That might be an
inconvenience for some, but the reality for some of our elderly people
is that it will mean sacrificing a luxury or a basic item to cover the

deaths were older people was 14 years ago. It was high then, but in
2012 it was higher still. It is clear that older people are being hit
hardest by the rising cost of energy and the reduction in their
incomes. As other hon. Members have suggested, energy providers must
ensure that our elderly are on the cheapest tariffs possible. Let us do
something for those elderly people. By the way, I say for the benefit
of all parties here that the elderly are consistently the people who

UK estimates that 1.5 million people aged over 65 and living in rural
areas in England are reliant on oil. In other parts of the UK reliance
on oil is even higher: it accounts for 11% of households in Wales and
70% in Northern Ireland. The price of oil is prohibitive. Few elderly
people can afford to fill their tanks, even with the winter fuel
allowance, and therefore cannot heat their homes. It is little wonder,

hit and need the money more. I saw in the <I>Metro</I> newspaper that
the profits of the big six energy companies have shot up by 74% since
2009, dwarfing the 13% rise in inflation. British Gas, E.ON, EDF
Energy, npower, Scottish Power and SSE have enjoyed a £3.3
billion surge in profits as households have been hit by a 29% rise in
bills. Profits from these groups, which provide energy to 98% of homes,
rose from £2.15 billion in 2009 to £2.2 billion in 2010,
£3.87 billion in 2011 and £3.74 billion in

of the systems that have been set up seem unduly complicated. When I
first heard about the concept of the green deal, which preceded this
Government—it was discussed under the previous
Government—I wondered how we encourage people to put in the kind
of long-term investment that will radically improve the energy
efficiency of their homes. For many people, the pay-back time seemed
too long. They took the view that they would probably be moving on and
that their home might not be a permanent one—even if it
eventually turned out to be so. The idea that people could get help
through loans that could be secured to the property and pass from one
household to another seemed to tackle some of those difficult
problems.</hs_Para>

can always come up with a good concept, but the implementation is often

lot of people appear to have been interested enough to seek an
assessment, but having done so, concluded that the deal was not good
enough and would not give them the kind of pay-back that would make it
all worth while, and thought, therefore, “I won’t bother
with it after all.” Unless there is yet to be a dramatic level
of take-up, that is the pattern that has occurred. It is a pity that a
good idea has been let down in this way. We should be looking at ways

are also finding it increasingly difficult to find out how to get their

best placed to know where the problems are in their areas—where
the types of housing are that need the most help. That is not just
because councils are landlords. They know about all the other
properties in the private rented sector where the problems are at their

second of two Energy Bills is currently making its way through

issue in her speech, we heard lots of chuntering from Government Front
Benchers but no interventions to share with the House exactly what the

this point it is important that I highlight the crucial differences
between a pool that we would seek to introduce and that which was in
operation previously. When the old pool was put in place, there were
just two generators, which meant that they were able to exert
disproportionate influence on the pool price. Today there are many more
generators, so it would be much more difficult to do that. The old pool
was also a one-way pool, which meant that only generators could place
bids for how much they were prepared to sell their power

The UK currently has two power exchanges where trades can take place:
N2PX and APX. The volumes that are traded on the day-ahead exchanges
are already increasing. If all generators and suppliers were required
to trade 100% of their output and supply via those exchanges, it would

government allowed real competition in the market to shrivel. Labour,

its green energy programmes  to spiral out of control but
failed to take real steps to decarbonise the sector; Labour that, after
13 years in power, left office with nearly 5 million vulnerable people
living in fuel poverty; and Labour that, in the last Parliament, saw

abolish the regulator that Labour created in 2000 and replace it
with—yes, you’ve guessed it—another quango. It
also wants to bring back the electricity pool, the same pool that it
abolished back in 2001, and put all over-75s on the cheapest

winter fuel allowance is helping 12 million pensioners with up to
£300 this winter. Cold weather payments have been permanently
uprated to £25 per week, and the green deal ECO programme has
already made more than 100,000 homes warmer and cheaper to heat and
run. The first proper, independent, thoughtful review of our fuel

shrunk the domestic energy market and presided over massive corporate
consolidation, we are unleashing a decentralised energy revolution on
new distributors of energy on an unprecedented
scale— 2.5 GW of solar alone under this coalition.

on the up. At the same time we have begun the first new nuclear
programme in a generation. Our Green Investment Bank, created by this
coalition, is now up and running and transforming the energy investment
landscape. No wonder Ernst and Young last week moved the UK from fifth
to fourth in the global league table for renewables, and called the UK
the best place in the world to invest in onshore
wind.</hs_Para>

is unacceptable that the EU budget has been given a qualified audit by
the EU oversight body, the Court of Auditors, every year for the past
eighteen years; agrees with the Government that when domestic
governments are facing severe fiscal constraints and making tough
decisions on national spending, efficient spending of EU money in a
targeted way is more vital than ever; supports the Government’s
decision to oppose granting discharge to the EU budget for the second
time; encourages the Government to continue to work with other
like-minded Member States to put pressure on the
Commission and other Member States to take their responsibility for
managing EU funds more seriously and to push for clear steps to be
taken towards much needed improvements to the quality of EU financial
management; and supports the Government’s approach of ensuring,

my constituents, I thank you for granting me this adjournment debate,
Mr Speaker. I thank the Minister in advance for his response. I hope
that we can achieve a positive outcome. I realise that this is a very
specific topic. It is a technical and perhaps quite dry subject, and I
doubt whether millions of people are at home, glued to BBC Parliament
right now, but it is vital to small and medium-sized businesses whose
working practices are now affected by this
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:14:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000593" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000593">The
issue that I want to raise and discuss is not the directive itself,
which in principle I have no issue with and which does make sense. It
will improve safety standards across Europe, and open up a wider market
to UK manufacturers—both things that are, of course,
advantageous. I want to focus on its implementation in the UK, which I
believe could be done much better. In particular, I am very concerned
that no further assessment or scrutiny has been carried out since the
initial impact assessment back in 2009, just before the first part of
the directive was due to come into effect.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:14:24"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:14:38"></hs_TimeCode>,
I do not simply want to criticise; I want to work with the Minister, to
tackle some of the issues. I hope that the process can be made much
easier for businesses in my constituency of Stalybridge and Hyde that
have contacted me about it. I would like the Government to carry out
another assessment on the directive now—this is
paramount—before it is fully implemented next year, to address
the issues that I will present this evening.</hs_Para>

Parliamentary Manufacturing Group, I work with colleagues across the

Reynolds:</Member></B> There is no doubt that my motivation in seeking
this debate has been the news communicated to me about the impact that
the implementation of the directive will have on businesses in my area.
The goal of the directive is not a bad one, but if it is implemented
incorrectly, there is no doubt that some manufacturers and some jobs
might go.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090440000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000597"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>The
directive was introduced to ensure that automotive
goods—including cars, vans, lorries, trailers,
caravans and so on—meet a minimum EU-wide set of
regulatory, technical and safety requirements. That is entirely
understandable and a good thing, in terms of both safety and
potentially opening up a bigger market for our manufacturers. However,
the directive has meant that manufacturers have to do much more to
ensure 
<?notus-xml column=437?>that their products meet the standard, drastically altering their
previous processes. Instead of needing approval to work on a certain
manufacturer’s product, businesses now need approvals for
different vehicles from the same manufacturer, even though the
differences between models might seem minor. In the original impact
assessment, back in 2009, the previous Government had two options. They
chose the right option by offering a lower-cost approval scheme to
businesses that wish to sell only in the UK. I am pleased that the
current Government stuck to that. However, four years later, more
issues are appearing, which I shall now explain in more
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000598" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000598">The
first issue, unsurprisingly, is the increased costs that the directive
has imposed on businesses. The number of approvals needed has spiked
massively, and obtaining each type approval costs money. Whereas costs
were managed by needing only a few approvals, with the new European
Community whole vehicle type approval, as well as the number of
approvals that come with it, costs have risen sharply and quickly. Many
SMEs are struggling. I have heard reports of businesses that will
either scale down the products that they offer or simply pack in
altogether when the directive is fully implemented next year. That is
not encouraging manufacturing—quite the opposite—and that
should concern us
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000599" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000599">The
staff hours involved in obtaining new approvals have also risen due to
the complexity, the amount of new approvals needed and the length of
the process to obtain just one approval. The Federation of Small
Businesses has told me that its members feel that the process is
confusing and burdensome. That is particularly true of SMEs, which find
the paperwork—something that they have to go through every time
they want to start work on a different product, even if the differences
are fairly minor—demanding and discouraging. Other areas of the
business then suffer, as staff are taken away from other roles to spend
what they believe to be a disproportionately large amount of time on
securing type
approvals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:18:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000600">A
lack of communication to businesses by Government and government
authorities such as the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency and the
Vehicle Certification Agency is another issue. Some businesses were not
even aware of the initial impact assessment in 2009. They feel
ill-informed and still in the dark about what is required from them and
any help that they can receive. Businesses have told me that they feel
abandoned. Some businesses have also told me about what they feel to be
a lack of consistency, with the process frequently changing. One
managing director described it as the “goalposts constantly
being moved”. There is a lot of confusion and worry out there in
the industry at the moment, which needs to be
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000601">Let
me present the House with a case study from my constituency. This issue
was brought to my attention by Truck Craft Bodies Ltd—a small to
medium-sized business in Stalybridge. It is deeply concerned about the
effect that the directive will have on its business once it is fully
implemented and about the ability of such SMEs to survive. The business
has told me that it has gone from simply needing one approval per
manufacturer to needing up to 30 approvals for just one
manufacturer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para> 

<?notus-xml column=438?><hs_Para UID="13090440000602" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000602">Like<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:25:02"></hs_TimeCode>
me, the company agrees with the premise of the directive, but it is
particularly concerned about the resulting costs and increased staff
hours. It is also unhappy about the lack of help and support on offer.
The help that it could receive from organisations such as the Society
of Motor Manufacturers and Traders  has so far been
inadequate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:19:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Government should be speaking to companies such as Truck Craft
Bodies. They are the ones in the field, and what they have to say on
implementation is
invaluable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:20:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000603">That
leads me to my main point, which is the lack of scrutiny or assessment
of the directive’s implementation since the initial impact
assessment more than four years ago. I am concerned that as
the date for full implementation—November 2014—looms
closer, the answers to a number of questions are still not known,
purely because of the lack of scrutiny. First, does the system provide
value for money? The Vehicle Certification Agency is the UK’s
designated approval authority, and it needs to be cost-effective for
the businesses that use
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:20:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Secondly, do
the Government know how the implementation of the scheme is going,
given that no assessment has been carried out since 2009? Are the
Government aware of the problems that are being experienced by many
businesses? How will they address those issues and provide further help
to businesses that need
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>? We need to
know the answers to those questions if we are going to help the SMEs
that are facing a testing and uncertain
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000604">The
point of this debate, however, is not for me to stand here and
criticise the Government. That would be unfair, especially on a matter
that is so technical and complex. I want the debate to achieve positive
outcomes and improvements, as my ultimate aim is to help businesses
that are struggling and that are worried about the effect of the
directive on their trade and their ability to survive. I have no doubt
that the Minister shares that view. There are potential solutions to
the problems that I have outlined so far, and I hope that the Minister
will give them serious
consideration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:21:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000605" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000605">Most
importantly, I firmly believe that the Government need to carry out
another impact assessment before the directive is fully implemented in
2014, and I call on the Minister to do that at the earliest
opportunity. The lack of scrutiny so far worries me deeply. This cannot
wait until after the full implementation of the directive; it needs to
be done as soon as possible. If we wait until 2014, it will be too
late, especially as some businesses are planning to stop their current
operations once the directive comes into full effect, unless there are
changes. An impact assessment now would help properly to identify the
hurdles that businesses are facing because of the directive, and it
would do so in far greater detail than I can describe in the debate
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:22:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

out a new, updated assessment now would have numerous benefits, and I
hope that I can convince the Minister to do so. It would offer
solutions and ways of dealing with the problems that the directive has
caused to businesses, not to mention giving the Government an idea of
how the directive’s implementation is going and an opportunity
to improve it. Most importantly, it would involve the manufacturers and
businesses. After all, they are the ones that are most affected;
t<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:25:02"></hs_TimeCode>hey currently
feel abandoned and are not sure where to turn. This is of course their
industry, and they are the ones that know it
best<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:22:42"></hs_TimeCode>. Overall, I
believe that a new assessment should be carried out as soon as possible

<?notus-xml column=439?>and definitely before full implementation. I sincerely hope that the
Minister will give that suggestion some serious
thought.</hs_Para>

specific suggestions are worthy of consideration. Indeed, any new
assessment might come to similar conclusions. They include changes such
as making the granting of licences easier. As previously mentioned, the
VCA is the only body in the UK that can grant type approvals to SMEs
that want to operate only in the UK. There is scope to funnel down the
process, which at present appears top-heavy and cumbersome, to give
manufacturers and businesses more involvement. That would take some of
the work load off the VCA and run down costs on both
sides<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:23:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
Businesses that I have spoken to are unhappy with the current process
that the VCA operates. For example, the agency already has a lot of the
information that manufacturers have to supply. The duplication that the
companies have to undertake costs money and time, and seems
unnecessary. Perhaps this has been overlooked, and it could be
identified by a new, updated
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:23:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000608" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000608">Furthermore,
a common complaint from the industry is that the support offered to it
has been found wanting. Manufacturers feel left out of the loop and
abandoned, and are unhappy with the general lack of communication about
a matter that is so vital to their continued existence. The Government
need to communicate their plans
better<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
also imperative that the Government look at the UK system and make it
as easy as possible for small and medium-sized businesses, in
particular, to comply with the new regulations. The FSB supports that
proposal and believes that that should
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000609" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000609">Mr
Speaker, I thank you once again for allowing this debate, and I look
forward to the Minister’s response. I am sure that he and I both
want the same thing: for manufacturing to thrive in the UK. The
directive does not necessarily have to hinder manufacturing by firms
such as Truck Craft Bodies. Improved safety and access to bigger
markets are of course in everyone’s best interests. However,
because the directive involves such a radical change from how
manufacturers have previously operated, it is imperative that it should
be monitored closely. That has not happened so far, as we have seen
from the lack of any real assessment or scrutiny by the Government
since the initial impact assessment in 2009. I sincerely hope that the
Minister will take on board the suggestion to hold another assessment
soon, before full implementation in
2014.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_04_PT_1/12EB23560E15ADDFD9CE87B93E400448472F69CF" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 September 2013">Wednesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Stephen
Hammond):</Member></B> I congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:25:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stalybridge and Hyde (Jonathan Reynolds) on securing this debate.
He said in his opening remarks that he had a passion for manufacturing
and for small and medium-sized enterprises, and he was generous enough
to suggest that he suspected I shared those passions. He was right. He
was also right that tonight’s debate provides an opportunity for
us to discuss the effect on businesses of directive 2007/46/EC. I would
like to thank him and his office for their assistance on some of the
thoughts he might express tonight; I hope that my response will thus be
more informed.</hs_Para>

that the hon. Gentleman has recently asked a number of questions about
this directive, so I am pleased to respond to this evening’s
debate. Before  
<?notus-xml column=440?>I talk about the directive, it would be right and proper to reflect on
the significant progress made by the UK automotive sector. This is
explained in the automotive strategy that was published in July, which
was the culmination of work led by the Automotive Council. It is very
encouraging for all of us to note and learn that the UK car industry is
currently vibrant, particularly at a time when other European markets
face significant
challenges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000613">The
UK produced 1.58 million vehicles in 2012, with £6 billion of
investment in the industry by vehicle manufacturers over the last two
years. That is good news for the UK. Some challenges have been
presented at ports, and I am pleased to help the industry overcome
them. I am sure that the hon. Gentleman—and, indeed, the
Associate Parliamentary Manufacturing Group—would welcome
that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090440000614" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000614">I
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>, if I may,
to the matter in hand. Clearly, the hon. Gentleman is concerned that
the directive could have a detrimental effect on businesses. Just as he
set out his concerns, I shall set out exactly how I think on the issue
and briefly explain what the directive is all about. It concerns the
approval of new road vehicles at EU level. It covers new road vehicles
with four or more wheels, and there is a mandatory obligation on the
UK, as on all member states, to apply its provisions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090440000615" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000615"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:27:25"></hs_TimeCode>The
directive was implemented in the UK on 29 April 2009 by the Road
Vehicles (Approval) Regulations 2009, SI No. 717. The hon. Gentleman
was right to point out that the key element of the directive was to
establish a single European market for motor vehicles, meaning that a
vehicle approved to pan-European standards can be registered anywhere
within the European Union, without further testing or obstruction to
placing it on the market anywhere within the EU.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:28:06"></hs_TimeCode> dates of
application depend on the vehicle category: it has already been
implemented for most vehicles, and will be fully implemented in October
2014, as the hon. Gentleman rightly said, for the largest goods
vehicles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000616" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000616">Approvals
under the directive are available from member states’ approval
authorities. In the UK, this means the Vehicle Certification Agency,
supported by the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency and the Driver
and Vehicle Agency in Northern Ireland. Approvals are enforced through
the registration scheme operated by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing
Agency. Only motor vehicles with the appropriate certificate can be
registered for use in the UK. Manufacturers can choose whether to use
the UK approval authority or one from another member state for the
pan-European
approval.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000617" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000617">Approval<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:29:06"></hs_TimeCode>
of the directive is a regulatory simplification matter, as it avoids
manufacturers having to comply with potentially 28 different sets of
national regulations and requirements. On that basis, it was supported
at the outset by the high-volume producers. Producers of specialist and
low-volume vehicles are also covered by the small series or the
individual approval schemes created by the Department. These are
essential provisions and are key to helping overcome the burden of
EU-wide rules for UK SMEs, and throughout the process the Department
has always sought to provide clear advice and assistance to such
companies. If the hon. Gentleman has evidence that companies, including
SMEs, have not considered that to be the case, I shall be delighted to
consider his representation.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=441?><hs_Para UID="13090440000618" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000618">Prior to
implementation, during 2007-08, officials worked closely with the
various sectors affected by the new requirements. That included
hosting, in conjunction with the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders, a road show involving 12 events around the United Kingdom to
build engagement with
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000619" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000619">At
the time of the implementation of the national regulations, a full
impact assessment was undertaken and published by the Department. Its
objective was to determine how to implement the directive in a way that
would minimise the burdens on UK businesses while maximising the safety
and environmental benefits. Two options for implementation of the
recast framework directive were assessed, the first being to implement
only the pan-European scheme and to accept and issue only European
approvals, and the second being to implement the pan-European scheme
together with national schemes for small series approval and individual
approvals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000620" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000620">A
“small firms impact test” considered the financial and
business implications for the companies. Some 250 SMEs were
consulted as part of a telephone survey, and face-to-face interviews
were conducted with 20 members of an overall group of 35 SMEs that had
been carefully selected from the sub-sectors to provide a
representative and balanced assessment. In addition, the Department
sought the views of the Small Business Service and its successor, the
Enterprise Directorate, in the Department for Business, Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform, as well as the views of the Federation of Small
Businesses and a number of other
stakeholders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000621" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000621">The
SMEs that were consulted advised the Department that type approval
would be too onerous for some companies, and it was therefore important
to have the option of national approval schemes. It was clear that the
EU-wide scheme could have a fairly major adverse impact on SMEs, which
are defined as businesses with fewer than 250 employees, so UK
regulations were developed to incorporate option 2—the national
approvals option—alongside the mandatory pan-European
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000622">I
accept that, on the face of it, the provision of national schemes under
option 2 would appear to be gold-plating, as it goes beyond the EU
minimum. However, I agree with the hon. Gentleman that the last
Government adopted the correct course of action, which the present
Government have continued. It does have a beneficial impact on
SMEs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000623" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000623">I
have engaged in correspondence with the hon. Gentleman about Truck
Craft Bodies Ltd and the effect that the directive has had on its
business. As he will recall, I explained in a reply to him in May that
the cost that the company had incurred for the approval of its vehicles
was significantly less than the original estimate. I think he will
accept the macro-point that the cost burden on UK business of accepting
option 2 is significantly lower than the pan-European option would have
been.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000624" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000624">Officials
at the VCA met representatives of Truck Craft Bodies Ltd on 8 November
2012. I believe that they have supported the company and helped it to
prepare the relevant documentation for its product range. Two more
other site visits were made to the company’s premises in April
and May 2013 to carry out approval work. The company now has seven
vehicle types approved, with a fee cost for work by VCA of less than
£11,000. On the basis of its current rate of production, that 
<?notus-xml column=442?>indicates an average certification cost of £18 per vehicle over
three years. It is worth noting that the VCA fees are set on a cost
reimbursement basis, following the public consultation. That reflects
the cost of providing the approval service to
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000625" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000625">The
hon. Gentleman made several comments about the impact assessment. I can
assure him that the VCA does not request information that it already
holds. Again, I make the offer that if he can produce evidence that the
VCA has asked for information that he believes it already holds, I will
be happy to consider that. However, we do not believe that the agency
requests information it already holds. It is also true that every
vehicle converter must have a commercial relationship with the original
vehicle manufacturer, and there are competition and confidentiality
issues if information supplied to one company is made freely available
to another. That would have an impact on any decision to undertake a
further impact assessment.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090440000626" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000626">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:36:07"></hs_TimeCode>
is a matter that the wider motor industry and trade associations may
wish to address, rather than  have Government create more rules
or regulations. The Department and its agencies continue to work with
industry, both directly and through its trade bodies, to identify any
matters where there is a lack of clarity in the application of
regulations or a need for administrative adjustments.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090440000627" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000627">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to recognise that the directive was finalised six years
ago and the UK regulations were created four years ago, so
the opportunity for any changes before the regulations are fully
implemented is relatively minimal. However, the Government are not
complacent about our commitment to removing unnecessary regulatory
burdens, and if there is evidence that that is not happening I will
instruct officials to redouble their efforts. Indeed, there will be a
meeting between the VCA and the industry trade bodies to discuss that
on 30
September<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:37:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000628">The
hon. Gentleman should also by now have received a reply from my
colleagues at the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills about
whether any funding was available to help mitigate the costs that Truck
Craft Bodies Ltd has incurred. I understand that information has been
provided on checking for possible sources of funding and on the
business link helpline, which provides advice to those who wish to
improve and grow their operations.</hs_Para>

summarise, under its European obligations the UK had to implement the
directive. The Department worked towards doing that in a manner which
offered a high level of consultation and of assurance in respect of
safety and environmental aspects, while limiting the burdens on UK
businesses. There is a long history of regulating certain aspects of
safety and environmental protection on road vehicles to provide a level
playing field for industry, and in order to protect consumers, road
users and society in
general<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T19:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000630" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000630">I
hope I have satisfactorily explained the Government’s position
on the approval of new vehicles. I have invited the hon. Gentleman to
write to me about any evidence he feels he has about any specific
occasions, and I will be delighted to see it. We are aiming to limit
the impact of the directive wherever possible. We are aiming to limit
the burdens on industry, and I hope the hon. 
<?notus-xml column=443?>Gentleman will be reassured by what I have said, but if he has any
further issues he wishes to raise, I will gladly respond to
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090440000631" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/debtext/130904-0004.htm#13090440000631"><I>Question

2012. Within a few months of taking power, the Government introduced
that Bill to Parliament to slash legal aid and remove many areas of
civil legal aid from scope, which has already denied many of the most
vulnerable access to justice. We saw the effects in our surgeries when
the changes kicked in, in the spring. I have seen a huge increase in
the number of people at my surgery who cannot get a lawyer, but who are

Members of Parliament are not competent to give legal advice. One
option that had been open to us was to signpost people to citizens
advice bureaux and other pro bono clinics, but due to budget
cuts—local authorities and charities being slashed—they
have closed or are buckling under the pressure of reduced resources and
vastly increased referrals. Local authorities are desperately
struggling to provide advice services as they try to absorb cuts of
more than 30%, while charities and authorities up and down the country
are being forced by the Government to withdraw vital funding for local
projects simply to ensure that they can sustain basic, statutory
obligations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T09:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000017">During

600,000 people have been denied access to advice on many aspects of

civil legal aid and a 12% fall in providers of criminal legal aid, yet
the most recent consultation paper, “Transforming Legal Aid:
Delivering a more credible and efficient system”, which was

I address the caricature that the Government have peddled, which is
that all lawyers earn salaries like that of the Prime Minister’s
very wealthy brother? It is not true. The vast majority of legal aid
lawyers, up and down the country, earn a modest wage; often, they will
take home less than a nurse or a teacher. I wonder what information the
Government have on that issue, because I think that the Bar Council
could provide them with information about average salaries at the Bar,

access to justice in the way that the consultation proposes seeks to

everything that the Conservatives allegedly stand for. It is contrary
to all that they say they are doing to promote growth on the high

me. Do the Tories not believe that small private firms are the backbone
of our economy? It beggars belief that this policy will without doubt
break the backbone of the legal profession and, in my submission,

clear financial incentive for the defendant to plead guilty as quickly
as possible, even when a trial would be in the client’s best

solicitors always act in the best interests of their clients and always
advise based on evidence alone and the strength of the evidence

plead guilty to an offence when the evidence is strong and
overwhelming, but there might be a later discussion, perhaps in the

was paid the same money whether they did their best for you in a trial

for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter), arguing against slashes to
legal aid and actions that would deny access to justice, rather than

the Minister accept that price-competitive tendering must always lead

but must be seen to have a fair trial, the latter is incompatible with
the prosecuting body limiting the defendant’s choice, or even
choosing the person employed to defend them. If the Department plans to
put contracts that guarantee an equal share of work out to
tender—as stated in the document it has produced—by
necessity, choice is being limited. The central concern about choice
therefore remains.

system. The system proposal means that firms will be forced to compete
on price rather than on quality, and I do not want lawyers doing that.
The lower firms bid, the fewer resources they can commit to each case.
That is why, when we went down that road with those who would provide

review, because it knows that it will lose—there may be no
opportunity for the lawyer ever to be paid. I did not know until

having to pay the fees. If the Government and the local authority will
not pay the fees, the people with the strongest

work makes it much more akin to civil public law. That deeply concerns
me, because where there will still be  an entitlement to access
legal aid in prisons—that will be severely curtailed, in any
event—it is likely that  the national or international
firms receiving many of 
<?notus-xml column=92?>the contracts will simply lack those skills. I ask the Minister to
comment on how that expertise will be protected

am particularly concerned about children and young offenders.
Thankfully, the number of young people in custody is falling. I pay
great tribute to the Youth Justice Board and the criminal justice
system for that achievement. Young people, in particular, need good
quality representation with a specialist advocate who is used to
working with children and can recognise that they often arrive in
prison in particularly difficult and chaotic personal circumstances.
The advocate needs to have the time to build a relationship with the
child or young person, and I am very concerned that we could lose that
for young offenders. I wanted to ask the Minister about that in the
debate earlier in the summer. I am keen to hear from him that special
arrangements will be put in place to protect the interests of children
and young offenders, and I really hope that he can say something
reassuring.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000127">As
time is so limited, I will make my final point, which is a similar one
about older prisoners and those who are disabled or very unwell. They
form an increasing part of the prison population, as the Minister will
know. I have a constituency case of a prisoner who is very unwell, has
disabilities and, as a result, is unable to participate in the
programmes that are part of his sentence plan. That means that he
cannot be moved, on successful completion of his programme, to a
lower-security prison. That is mad for the Prison Service, and it is
bad and unfair for him. I again invite the Minister to say what special
arrangements could be put in place for such particularly vulnerable and
disadvantaged disabled and older
prisoners.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13090425000258" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000258">10.34

access to justice. I feel strongly that steps should be taken to
address the problems of very high cost cases, although I recognise that
there are very few of them. I support efforts to root out inefficiency
in the court system, as well as in prosecutions and the wider criminal
justice system. I cannot, however, support cuts that might lead to an

question the first plank of the Government’s plan, which is to
replace the current model and reduce the number of providers from 1,400
local providers to  400 larger ones. The Secretary of State has
claimed that that will be a more efficient model of criminal legal aid
procurement, but I do not follow that logic. For example, if someone
has a solicitor from Berwick at the other end of my region, that will
add at least an hour and a half to 
<?notus-xml column=93?>the time for them to get legal advice. The ideology that bigger means
more efficient and that local means wasteful is part of a trend with
this Government, but it is

and medium-sized legal aid firms will be obliterated by the changes;
yet it is those very local firms that have the strong links with local
courts, the police and the Crown Prosecution Service that larger
companies simply do not have. Indeed, they often have relationships
with repeat offenders, and sometimes a bit of common sense can be used
in a situation, rather than letting it escalate into a massive legal
case. With no pilot, no monitoring and no quality control, the lowest
cost provider will win out, regardless of quality. Tendering time
scales are so tight that many existing providers will not have
sufficient time to restructure themselves into larger
consortia.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000133">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:37:27"></hs_TimeCode>

price firms out of the legal aid market, and may even increase pressure

threaten universal access to justice, and I therefore urge the

controversial and should have been the subject of primary legislation

return to the issues in other debates, but such debates all seem to be

the residency test. Some have pointed out the appalling consequences of
such a test for the relatives abroad of those who have died in custody,
the Gurkhas or other groups for whom justice should be done.

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:48:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull East (Karl Turner), practised in the criminal
courts for some time, and I, like him, was very much a thin cat. I
recognise and agree with the comments that he has made about the
quality of advocates who practise in our criminal courts. I also agree,
of course, with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:49:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier) on
that.</hs_Para>

congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East on securing the debate and
thank all Members who have spoken or intervened in it. The hon.
Gentleman knows that this is a debate and a discussion that has been
ongoing for a considerable time and that the Government have listened
to a variety of different contributions. He knows that, for example,
Ministry of Justice officials have travelled across England and Wales
and met approximately 2,500 practitioners, members of the judiciary and
members of the public.</hs_Para>

and considered views expressed by the hon. Members who participated in
a previous Westminster Hall debate on these proposals, secured by my
hon. Friend the Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams), and of course the
views expressed in the Backbench Business Committee debate, which has
also been referred to today and which I had the pleasure of responding
to. There have also been meetings of the Justice Committee; a moment or
so ago, we heard from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:49:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Winchester (Steve Brine) about those. In addition, there

Ministers have met a variety of different stakeholders. We have
received just under 16,000 responses to the consultation, which have
all been considered in order to inform the development of the policy.
We have also had a variety of letters from the public and from
parliamentarians, a multiplicity of parliamentary questions and debates
in the other place, which Lord McNally has responded to. Of course,
there is also what has transpired in the media. So there has been a
good deal of engagement and that process will continue. I certainly
welcome the contributions that have been made to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000159">Let
me be clear on one or two points in general. I think that the first
point is recognised; I welcome  the fact that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:50:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hammersmith (Mr Slaughter) referred to it late on in his
remarks. It is that we have to make savings in the legal aid budget.
There is simply no getting away from that; in fact, I 
<?notus-xml column=97?>think that it is also well understood within the legal profession. So
that point is not in dispute; it is a question of
how we make those savings.</hs_Para>

process, it is important that we listen to all the people I have
mentioned, and to those in the legal profession.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:51:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull East asked us to sit down with those in the
legal profession and listen to what they have to say to us. Well, we

possible.</hs_Para>

me try to deal with some of the other points that the hon. Gentleman
made. As he will understand, I will not be able to respond to
everything he said in the time that I have—indeed, I will not be
able to respond to everything that other Members have said in the
debate. However, I will do my best to pick out some of the things that
he referred to.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman and others referred to inefficiencies in the legal
system and in the courts process that need attention. They are all
absolutely right about that.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:51:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier),
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:51:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Cambridge (Dr Huppert) and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:51:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott) all referred to such
inefficiencies, as did the hon. Gentleman. Of course, it is an area
that we must look at, but it will not exclude the need to find savings
within the legal aid budget.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090425000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000163"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:52:12"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) and others said that we
should look at the very high-cost cases, and they are absolutely right.
We are looking at the issue; our proposals include a 30% reduction in
the fees paid for cases of that nature. Again, however, dealing with
those cases on their own will not do the necessary job of delivering
savings.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090425000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000164"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>Many
Members who have spoken in this debate have been concerned about
quality, and of course they are right to be. No part of the proposals
that we are making suggest that quality is not important in the
provision of legal aid services, and any system that we institute will
require those providing those services to maintain standards of
quality. In addition, those standards must be properly
monitored.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090425000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000165"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:52:59"></hs_TimeCode>It
is important when we talk about eligibility for legal aid that we are
clear about what these proposals actually are. It is not sensible to
refight all the battles over the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment
of Offenders Act 2012; we certainly do not have the time to do so and
you, Mr Davies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:53:04"></hs_TimeCode>,
would not let me. However, in relation to the particular proposals
about criminal legal aid, the argument over eligibility is limited to
whether it is right to set an eligibility threshold at a disposable
income of £37,500 a year. The only people who will not have
access to legal aid for criminal cases will be those who have a
disposable income of that level or above. That is a generous level, and
I think that the majority of our constituents would consider it right
that people with substantial wealth should pay up front for their legal
fees, which of course will be refunded to them if they are, in the end,
acquitted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:53:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> I am afraid that I do not agree with the hon.
Lady, because we are not talking about changing that presumption of
innocence. What we are saying is that people with the means to
pay—sometimes, very substantial means to pay—should not
have access to taxpayer-funded subsidy for their legal fees if they
are, in the end, found guilty. If they are found innocent in the end,
the amount that they have paid for their legal fees will be considered
for refund. That is important, but it is not about a presumption of
innocence, which remains intact, as—of course—it
should.</hs_Para>

people have raised.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:54:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stretford and Urmston (Kate Green) asked some sensible and detailed
questions about it. If she will forgive me, I must say that in the five

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:55:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Friend the Member for Harborough is entirely right that the
nature of the case that is being considered and that may be litigated
is crucial. It is not the case that every instance of grievance raised
by a prisoner should be litigated through the courts. Also, the changes
that we are proposing say that it is important that when a
prisoner’s liberty or the length of their sentence are
considered, they should still have access to legal aid. However, there
are a whole range of other complaints that can be more properly and
more effectively dealt with through other methods, rather than
involving the courts and costly lawyers.</hs_Para>

will also say something about the residence test, because
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:55:48"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Tottenham and others expressed concern about it. Again, I
think that in principle it is right that those who have a strong
connection with the United Kingdom should have access to
taxpayer-funded legal aid, and that those who do not have a strong
connection to the United Kingdom should not have access to it. There
are exceptions to that principle, which we have made clear. For
example, these changes will not apply to refugees or asylum seekers. In
general, however, applying that principle is the right thing to do, and
I think that it will have the support of the public.</hs_Para>

review has also been referred to. We absolutely support the principle
of judicial review. Those who have spoken up in favour of it were right
to do so; it is a crucial tenet of our system that the public should be
able to hold Government to account through the judicial review system.
However, it is equally important that that system should not be abused,
and we simply have to face up to the fact that there has been a huge
increase in the number of cases pursued through the judicial review
process that are not found to have merit.</hs_Para>

important that the crucial pre-court phase does not cover the initial
preparatory work on a judicial review case. In that phase, lawyers
should think carefully about whether a case has merit, and they should
have something at stake when they do so. That is the basis for the
proposals that we are making.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:57:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

submission—and that the Government will respond to the
consultation that we have held. In addition, he knows that there will
be a further period of consultation on some of the proposals. I hope
that he will be a little more patient and see what those responses
entail, because we will want to consider carefully a number of things

are crucial points to be considered—they have been raised again
in this debate today—about the nature of rural areas and the
advice to be provided to people there. As I say, hon. Friends and hon.

understood.
Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T10:59:01"></hs_TimeCode>, the

I stress that this process is an opportunity for people to contribute
their views about what we have set out. With our legal aid reforms, the
intention is to do two things: first, to address the real financial
challenge that we face; and secondly, to reinforce public confidence in
what is a very important system of providing taxpayer-funded subsidy to
those who need it in our courts. Our proposals have those twin
objectives. We will listen to the submissions that have been made to
us, but in the end those objectives are what we seek to

that, during these difficult economic times, we recognise the fantastic
work that the UK has done and continues to do in promoting and
supporting international development. We are all rightly proud of that
work. Let us not forget that the Department for International
Development does exactly what its title suggests. Yes, one of its roles
is to respond quickly to crises—to feed, to clothe and to
provide emergency health supplies—but, crucially, it is designed
to help and support developing countries to lift themselves out of
poverty, grow their economies and create prosperity and opportunity for
their own citizens. That is why DFID is a force for good in the

than my fair share of criticism of the Government, be it on the economy
or on welfare, but we must all recognise and pay tribute to the efforts
of successive Secretaries of State to protect DFID’s budget. It
is the perfect example of how we can maximise our impact by pooling and
sharing our resources. It demonstrates the positive and powerful voice

the UK’s positive influence on international development? Not
only do we play our part, but we lead the way shaping global
priorities, fighting poverty and creating opportunity. That is one
example, among many, of how our collective voice is
stronger—stronger in the UN, stronger in the EU, stronger in the
G8 and stronger in the G20. Let us not forget that it was a Scot who,
in 2005 as Chancellor of the Exchequer, got the G7 group of leading
economies to agree to cancel up to 100% of the debt that was owed to
them  by developing countries. As a result, the debts of 18 of
the world’s poorest countries to the World Bank and the

Are we likely to have large bases of civil service jobs in France,

those in any other part of the UK. That is not simply a Scottish value;
it is a Labour value. By contrast, the SNP likes to paint a picture of
independence in which, free from the shackles of the UK, Scotland can
pursue its natural preference for progressive politics. Scotland does
not need to look to an independent future to achieve a progressive
contribution to international development. We can be proud of our

we talk today, the International Development Committee is, as the hon.

chance, however, to set out the Government’s plans for the
UK’s international development programme and to consider the
role Scotland plays in it. Let me be clear at the outset: the UK
Government want Scotland to remain an integral part of the UK, because
that is what is best for all of us. Scotland benefits from
being part of the UK, and the UK benefits from having Scotland in the
UK. The UK Government are hopeful that, when people in Scotland come to
make their choice, they will choose to remain
part of the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:17:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000218">On
the evidence and analysis available so far, I am very clear that the
UK, with Scotland in it, can continue to have a significant
international development impact, providing excellent value for money
to taxpayers at home and making a significant difference to the poorest
and most vulnerable people across the world. Scottish taxpayers, like
all UK taxpayers, can be proud of the contribution they make to the
UK’s official development assistance—otherwise known as
ODA—and I see no case for changing
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:18:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000219">The
UK is one of the world’s leaders in the fight against poverty.
On provisional data, the UK provided £8.6 billion of ODA in
2012. That places us second only to the USA, just ahead of Germany and
then France. This year we will do even better, as the first G8 country
to achieve the global 0.7% target. That is a tremendous achievement,
which brings with it great responsibility for
DFID<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:19:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000220">The
size and reach of DFID’s programme enable UK aid to have a huge
impact. We are proud of the results we have delivered towards the
millennium development goals. To give just a few examples, since 2010,
UK aid has supported 5.9 million children—half of them
girls—to go to primary school; given 19.6 million people access
to clean water and sanitation; prevented 12.9 million children and
pregnant women from going hungry; and enabled more than 30 million men
and women to work  
<?notus-xml column=106?>their way out of poverty through access to financial
services.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:19:33"></hs_TimeCode> I am
sure we can agree that those figures are very impressive
indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000221">DFID
delivers major results through its significant funding of multilateral
organisations, which helps draw in other donors who add their
contributions to those effective multilateral organisations. In 2012,
for example, the multilaterals supported by DFID gave food assistance
to more than 97 million people and immunised 46 million
children against preventable diseases. The UK, together, has a
significant impact on the lives of the poor as a responsible 0.7%
donor. We can always do better, but the Government believe that we are
stronger and more influential when we work
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:20:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000222">I
will now analyse why size and reputation help the UK make a bigger
impact. First, DFID’s size and global reputation create
opportunities to shape international efforts in ways that are
consistent with UK values. The Prime Minister’s pivotal role in
shaping the framework that follows the MDGs and the co-chairing of the
Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:20:59"></hs_TimeCode> Secretary of
State for International Development are examples that ultimately aim to
give global development more impact per £1 spent. That is about
being clear on what we are trying to achieve, measuring and reporting
on it and working with the right partners. The UK as a whole, together,
is leading the way on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000223">Alongside<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:21:21"></hs_TimeCode>
that, we have real influence within the multilateral system. The World
Bank’s International Development Association, a major provider
of interest-free loans to the world’s poorest countries, is an
effective example. UK aid typically accounts for between 10% and 14% of
donor contributions, giving us a powerful voice in fund governance
structures. IDA was assessed in the groundbreaking DFID multilateral
aid review as very good value for money. It is poverty focused,
provides quality technical expertise and has a huge global reach.
Because of DFID’s size and reputation—something that
would be reduced if we were fragmented—the World Bank works
closely with us to keep improving the impact on matters that reflect UK
values, such as addressing the needs of girls and women and delivering
better in fragile
states<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T11:22:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090425000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000224"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Whiteford" PimsId="5544" UID="13090425000340" xid="1003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090425000340">Dr

regulation that is sensible and proportionate and ensures a level

want to touch on four specific key areas; first is the definition of an
SME. According to European Union law, the main factors determining
company size are the number of employees, the turnover and the size of
the balance sheet. Those factors can then be divided: micro-businesses
have fewer than 10 employees, turnover of less than €2 million
or a balance sheet of €2 million; small businesses have fewer
than 50 employees, turnover of €10 million or a €10
million balance sheet; and medium-sized businesses have fewer than 250
employees, turnover of €50 million or a €50 million

sheet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:42:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

however, varying definitions in the UK, with one under the Companies
Act 1985 and a different one under the business bank scheme. For the
purposes of research and development schemes, Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs defines SMEs in a different way again. In fact,
depending on which definition is used, an SME can have anywhere between
10 and 500 employees or a turnover of between £1.7 million and
£86
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090438000033">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:43:22"></hs_TimeCode>
real issue is that the actual definition of an SME is not helpful. It
would be far better to break the definition down into different sizes
and types of businesses with their own reference. A clearer idea of
exactly what type of businesses we are discussing is necessary, rather
than lumping them all together.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090438000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090438000034">More
definitions would be beneficial and help to target support to the right
businesses in the right circumstances. For the manufacturing sector,
that would demonstrate and recognise the importance of companies and
raise their profile, and identify a sector as important in its own
right. Any definition needs to acknowledge that larger manufacturing
companies often have little in common with smaller ones and they should
therefore not necessarily be linked together.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=113?><hs_Para UID="13090438000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090438000035">Size and
numbers matter: they have an impact on how businesses structure
themselves, how they function and what type and level of support they
seek<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:44:19"></hs_TimeCode>. I
certainly find it hard to equate a manufacturing company with a
turnover of several million pounds and, for example, 200 employees,
with a two-man engineering business with a turnover that does not even
exceed the VAT threshold. A better group of definitions, certainly in
the manufacturing sector, would help to simplify a business’s
ability to access the correct support, help and guidance that it may be
seeking. That might also help Government to steer a business of a
particular size or industry towards the appropriate
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:44:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090438000036">My
second issue is simply what support there is, and whether it reflects
the actual needs of manufacturing. What can Government actually do?
What is the real support and help that Government can give to the
manufacturing sector? Clearly, small businesses have their own
particular issues; large businesses that want to expand are likely to
have different requirements and problems; and there are individuals who
want to start their own small manufacturing
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T14:45:20"></hs_TimeCode>es.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0001.htm#13090438000037">A
significant number of issues therefore need to be addressed for
businesses of different sizes and complexity within the manufacturing
sector: strategic advice and business plans will vary depending on the
size of the business; procurement, too, is different for small and
large businesses; there is involvement with UKTI—UK Trade &amp;
Investment—for exporters; skills and qualifications depend on
the needs of the different sizes of businesses; there is the issue of
funding, grants, loans and, as mentioned, banking facilities; there is
involvement with trade federations, because larger organisations
invariably hold greater sway and influence, or relations with the
chamber of commerce; there is legal, accountancy and intellectual
property rights advice; there is dealing with relevant regulation,

policy instruments may affect a business’s ability to engage

not even aware of what they can offer. Real feedback should include
those who have not applied for funding and support, but companies that
have not applied should also be contacted to find out why not and what

the past couple of weeks, there has been euphoria about manufacturing.
There has been a revival, but we must put that in context because the
current level is below what it was in 2010, when it was described as a
disaster. There are welcome signs of a significant upturn that might be
sustained, but the situation is still not
good.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000058">In
so far as it is possible to discern what has provoked the sudden surge
in confidence and production, it is led partly by an increase in
confidence in the housing market, which is rising largely because of
the funding for lending scheme, and an improvement in exports. Both are
welcome, particularly the increase in domestic construction in the
housing industry. However, exports are particularly difficult at the
moment with the problems in the eurozone, although there are welcome
signs of revival. There is a danger in basing a rise in domestic
consumption and confidence on a housing boom that may be temporary and
is fragile. Many of the criticisms levelled at the previous Government
were that consumption was based on that.</hs_Para>

reiterate our debates at that time, but although there is a welcome
revival, the long-term sustainability of a manufacturing industry must
be based on two things, or three if exports are included. First, a
sustained and rising standard of living domestically will underpin
demand for manufacturing products in this country. Secondly, an
appropriate level of investment in the manufacturing industry in the
private sector will ensure that we remain competitive, that value is
added to improve exports and our domestic consumption, and that cheap
foreign imports are resisted.</hs_Para>

guarantee scheme and other well-intentioned Government schemes designed
to boost bank lending to small business, that is not yet happening.
When I talk to banks about that, their reaction is that they want to

Blunkett:</Member></B> I will not detain the Chamber long. Surely one
of the difficulties with the enterprise finance guarantee
scheme—which, in theory, is an extremely good idea—is
that many major banks are asking of small businesses, and particularly
of the owners, far more than they can give in personal guarantees,
given that the banks can recover not only from the individual owner,
but the 75% from the guarantee scheme, if they believe that the
business is no longer viable. I think that the term is the
“going west route”, whereby the banks end up owning the
business. That is bound to put the fear of God into entrepreneurs, no
matter how brave and confident they are.</hs_Para>

talked about the risk profile. A huge body of evidence demonstrates
that banks are excessive in the security they demand in order to lend
to businesses, and that is one of the main barriers to businesses
wanting to apply for loans. If there is a criticism of the Government,
it is that while the Government have provided cheaper money for banks
to lend to businesses, I do not think that has addressed the obstacles
that are far more significant in terms of getting the money out where
it is needed, into investment in small

In fact, one of the unintended, beneficial by-products of the problem

to the whole of the west midlands and the black country—other
west midlands MPs may refer to this, too. First, I pay tribute to the
Tata brothers for their investment in Jaguar Land Rover, which, I think
it is fair to say, has transformed manufacturing prospects 
<?notus-xml column=118?>in the west midlands in a way that we have not known for 30 years. It is
an indication of the value of our relationships with the Indian
subcontinent and that growing market and growing access of capital, and
of the historic association between the Indian diaspora in this
country, and of course, the native India.</hs_Para>

Lefroy:</Member></B> I entirely agree with the hon. Gentleman. It is
also testament to the wonderful co-operation between Wolverhampton city
council and Staffordshire county council, which, together, put
£40 million forward to build a motorway junction on the M54,
without which that project might not have been able to go
ahead.</hs_Para>

Bailey:</Member></B> I pay tribute to both of them. All the players in
the i54 development on the borders of Staffordshire and Wolverhampton
deserve credit for the united way in which they have seized the
opportunity. For the benefit of non-west midlands MPs here, it is a
huge expansion in the engine production capacity of JLR that will
result in 1,400 jobs. It has really transformed the supply prospects of
foundries in the area.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:04:28"></hs_TimeCode>In that context,
I would also mention the £45 million that the Tata brothers have
invested at Warwick business school’s centre for research and
innovation. Collectively, they have transformed the prospects for
manufacturing in the west midlands.</hs_Para>

constituency still has the highest number of foundries—I
think—of any constituency in the country, but there are plenty
in the surrounding areas as well. The prospect offered to them of being
part of the supply chain to Jaguar Land Rover is very significant. In
the regional growth fund applications, there have been a number of
successful bids from JLR and companies locally. However—I
mention this to the Minister, because it highlights some of the
problems that we have with the support that the Government give
industry—I understand from the Cast Metals Federation that the
engine blocks for the new Jaguar Land Rover development at the i54 will
have to be made in Germany, because there is not, would you believe it,
the capacity for foundries to produce them
locally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000072">I
also understand that Jaguar Land Rover is happy to look at repatriating
some of its supply chains, where it has to source from abroad at the
moment, but obviously, that will depend on the capacity of local SMEs
to deliver. Despite all the Government sources of support, the regional
growth fund and the grants that it has given, a crucial gap still
remains in the potential economic benefits that will accrue to the west
midlands because of the failure to secure this vital market. Aluminium
engine blocks for that development will be
crucial<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:06:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000073">The
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders has identified something
like £3 billion worth of potential extra business in the supply
chain—if the Government and the industry can get together to
maximise that potential. Although I do not condemn any of the attempts
that have been made to provide finance for business and for SMEs so
far—but certainly with the regional growth fund, there are all
sorts of issues relating to length of time and so on—I ask the
Minister to look at working with the Automotive Council to develop some
sort of package that would enable the existing gaps in provision to be
filled. The potential benefits, both for regional policy and for our
overall national economic situation, are absolutely enormous.</hs_Para>

small marketing business since I was 19 years old, which is sadly many
more years ago than I would care to admit. I would like to echo my hon.

latest data show that we have seen the biggest jump in output and new
orders for almost two decades. That is great news for Britain, but
there is no room for complacency. Speaking as a business owner, I would
say that the key things the Government need to facilitate to allow
other small businesses to flourish are: a skilled work force, the
availability of finance, a solid infrastructure, ease of access to both
domestic and international markets, and the reduction in red tape and
bureaucracy.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:06:44"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

I support the many steps the Government are taking to boost access to
finance, and there has definitely been a marked improvement, many
businesses, sadly, still find it difficult to obtain credit. A concern
all too often voiced by local business owners in my constituency is
that, despite their best efforts to weather the economic storm, and no
matter how thriving their order book, the failure to secure meaningful
credit and the regular hits to their cash flow that result from late
payment leave them on the brink of
collapse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000080">I
am still concerned about the regulatory burden on small and
medium-sized businesses. The country’s 5 million SMEs
provide 60% of jobs and generate more than 50% of GDP, and we must do
everything we can to ensure that their chances of growth are not
strangled by bureaucracy. I therefore welcome the work the Government
have done on cutting red tape; indeed, through the red tape challenge,
they have committed to scrapping, improving or simplifying at least
3,000 regulations. The one in, one out rule has saved businesses about
£1 billion in regulatory costs, and I am glad it has been
stepped up so that it is now one in, two out, although I will resist
any pressure to enforce that in my shoe cabinet.</hs_Para>

bugbear, and one area where we still need to see progress, is the
procurement of Government and other public sector contracts. That is
one thing I know about, because, as I say, I have owned a business for
more than 20 years. The paperwork involved in trying to get considered
for a Government contract can 
<?notus-xml column=120?>still be overwhelming. The tendering process for private sector
contracts is still significantly less complex than for public sector
contracts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000082">Although
I warmly welcome the scrapping of many of the pre-qualification
questionnaire requirements, as do businesses in Gosport, there is still
room for such processes to become even more efficient. John Allan, the
chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, quotes research showing
that only about a fifth of SMEs have bid for public sector contracts in
the past year, in large part because it simply is not worth the effort
and because of the intrusive amount of company information that needs
to be supplied<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:11:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
A contract my business recently looked at bidding for required
financial details of not only my company, but every company I was
thinking of subcontracting to, which is hugely bureaucratic for a small
business. There is still more to do on this issue.</hs_Para>

the drivers of prosperity in this country, and we should give them
every opportunity to overcome obstacles and to expand. I welcome the
Cabinet Office announcement in August that there will be a shake-up in
Whitehall procurement and that the Government want to loosen the grip
of an oligopoly of large suppliers and let in more SMEs. However, we
must do more to cut bureaucracy in the application process.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:12:32"></hs_TimeCode> we move from
rescue to recovery, our economic success depends on a vibrant,
innovative private

innovative private sector must have the Government’s backing
when it develops new and exciting products. The Government rightly take
great pride in our country’s innovation, and they invest heavily
in R and D; indeed, globally, we are second only to the US
in terms of our scientific knowledge base, but we slip down the chart
when it comes to turning that innovation into economic prosperity and
jobs. The Government’s enthusiasm for helping to develop new
ideas is, sadly, not matched by an enthusiasm for buying the results.
Unless we become earlier adopters of innovation, British R and D tax
credits will continue to deliver German and American manufacturing jobs
and profits, as those countries invest in making the things that
originate in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:13:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000085">SMEs
are often cited as the lifeblood of our economy. We must match those
words with action and eradicate the lethargic culture of bureaucracy,
which sometimes clogs the procurement process and holds back British
business. We must celebrate all that the Government and business,
working together, have done in that regard, and we must ensure that
SMEs continue to

I said, Bradford never really stopped being a producer city. It
suffered dreadfully in the 1980s recession, which almost decimated the

the less, Bradford is still a producer city. Although we still lost

is that that is not getting through to our small manufacturing and
engineering businesses, and they are still struggling. Despite
Government schemes to provide finance for those businesses, they are
waiting, their energy is pent up and they are ready to explode, but
they are being held back by a lack of finance. The money is there, but
it is clearly going to the bigger companies, which can always access
finance from other sources. The companies that critically need the
finance to enable them to carry out the investment intentions I
mentioned are simply being denied it. Whatever the reasons for that, we
need to crack this nut if these companies are to achieve their full
potential and we are to carry out the rebalancing of the economy we are
all so desperate to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:19:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

that is all about the largest companies, which have access to the

hon. Friend the Member for Gosport (Caroline Dinenage) talked about
oligopoly in procurement. It is not just in manufacturing companies;
among service companies it seems that the Government will procure only
from a very small number. For instance, there are the big four
consultancy firms. In my constituency, health administration is being
carried out by Ernst and Young. I should prefer some specialist
medium-sized consultancies to do that work if, unfortunately, it should

as they do

apprentices to start. I welcome the idea of training networks, which
could operate under the employer ownership pilots that BIS has started

have also heard about the supply chain in the debate. Yes, that is an
area where small businesses can do things for each other, but there is
an increasing realisation of the benefit of having suppliers on the
doorstep. The previous Government supported programmes in relation to
the automotive sector supply chain, and the present Government are
considering the aerospace sector in that regard. I should like to know

want to spend a little time discussing exports. There has been an
increase in the services offered by UK Export Finance. Indeed, just
this week BIS announced a direct lending scheme of £1.5 billion

very much focused on large businesses, although I was glad to see from
its last report that it was used to enable British companies to export,
for example, cheese to Greece, a hospital to Ghana and tractors to
Israel. However, those were the exceptions rather than the rule. UKEF
tends to be dominated by Airbus, Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems. That is
welcome—we need those exports—but in the past year the
total was only something like £4.3 billion, compared with
£29.1 billion under the Hermes scheme in Germany.
Under that scheme, Kenya had €156 million of credit, South
Africa had €461 million and India had €1 billion. Those
are all developing countries, to which our businesses need to

importance of the availability of long-term, patient capital and equity
finance. It is ironic that Britain has a major institution that deals
with that, which has nearly £3 billion of investments throughout

of my concerns, given the welcome news about the upturn in growth in
the UK economy, is that politicians—and we are politicians in
this Chamber—may move away from a focus on manufacturing and the
good results that it could produce for the rebalancing of the economy.
We could move back to property booms and financial services, which I
think all those present 
<?notus-xml column=124?>would agree would be a very bad thing. We have a window of opportunity
to establish policies to get manufacturing growing strongly once
more.</hs_Para>

small and medium-sized businesses. The Government need to take steps
now to prevent manufacturing from being neglected as growth returns to
the economy. They need to ensure that incentives are set up for lenders
to support our manufacturers, rather than pouring investment into quick
returns in sectors such as property or financial services.</hs_Para>

of the simplest and easiest ways to get support to those manufacturers
is through changes to capital allowances. The Chancellor rightly
increased the annual investment allowance, which will enable them to
upgrade plant and equipment in the next two years. However, if we are
to attract more significant manufacturing activity, and enable small
and medium-sized businesses to integrate into supply chains, we need to
make the capital allowance structure more competitive, and encourage
larger manufacturers to base themselves in the UK, which will in turn
help the small and medium-sized
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:27:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000110">According
to the Oxford university centre for business taxation, the present
value of capital allowances as a percentage of cost for capital
investment is just 46.5% in the UK. That is lower than in Japan,
Germany, the United States, Turkey, France, South Korea and virtually
all our major competitors. It makes investing in the UK far more
expensive for manufacturing businesses than it is elsewhere, and we
should not be surprised that, despite a strong skills base and
depreciation in sterling, manufacturers are still not flocking as
quickly as they
might<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:27:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000111">Like
the rest of the economy, manufacturing is an ecosystem that requires
diversity. To increase the number of small and medium-sized
manufacturers, we need to increase the number of larger manufacturers
in the country, to create resilient supply chains that can weather
global economic storms. That, I think, is the key to what has happened
in Germany and the United States. We should not ignore small
and medium-sized manufacturers while we go about it, but we will need
to continue a generous regime of investment allowances for the
businesses in question, so that they can compete and provide a base on
which large manufacturers can build supply
chains<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:28:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000112">Another
area where we can help businesses is through the availability of skills
and apprentices. There has been a fantastic, massive surge in
apprenticeship applications in the past 12 months, but manufacturing
and engineering are still not the main destination. Business
administration, child care and customer service are still the three
most popular areas. Perhaps that has something to do with the image of
manufacturing in society, which those present for the debate are trying
to help to promote.</hs_Para>

combat the current situation might be through the creation of
apprentice training agencies, similar to those deployed in Australia.
Apprenticeships are advertised by the agencies, which then hire them
out to small and medium-sized manufacturers. The agencies take on the
burden of administration, payroll support and supervision costs, and
merely charge the manufacturers something similar to normal agency
costs. That will hopefully boost the supply of labour to SMEs and
potentially attract young people to work with the companies in the long
term.</hs_Para>

delighted that EEF has announced that the domestic market is at its
strongest in almost three years and export sales are at a two-year
high. That marks a significant growth in confidence and provides some
reassurance that the industry is on the right track. However, although
that shows a short-term improvement, it is set against the long-term
trend that has seen manufacturing’s share of the economy fall
from 23% in 1997 to about 10% currently. That sits alongside the
Government’s ambitious target to double UK exports to £1
trillion by 2020—manufacturing currently makes up about half the
market. I would be interested to hear my hon. Friend the

manufacturing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000117"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:30:59"></hs_TimeCode>How

we should consider finance. Simply put, without strong, reliable and
consistent funding, we cannot expect SMEs to grow and thrive. There are
some strong incentives to help SMEs involved in R and D. From April

qualifying costs, corporation tax is not paid on an additional
£125 income that would be liable for corporation tax. It is

Government schemes such as the advanced manufacturing supply chain

story of decline we will gloss over, except to note that by 2010 new
apprentices were virtually extinct in Gloucester. The specialist
Gloucester training group was down to 20 engineering apprentices in one
year. Small engineering companies were almost dying on their feet.
Science was disappearing from school exams, and 6,000 jobs in business
had been lost during the 13 years of the previous
Administration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000127">Today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>,
the story is rather different. We have created 2,000 new jobs in
business—not all of them in manufacturing, but many—and
last year alone 1,240 new apprentices started in our city.
Nationally, of course, manufacturing is now going through its fastest
growth, in terms of order books, for more than two decades. The output
index is the highest since 1994, and non-EU exports have risen by 10%
according to the latest figures. The rebalancing is full steam ahead,
but we must not run ahead of ourselves. There is still much more
reinvestment to be done to see a sustainable increase in manufacturing.
We need confidence to spread more widely across the country and in
manufacturing businesses, and of course we need banks to provide
support and schools to give more time for manufacturers to tell their
story and inspire
youngsters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000128">I

got her NVQ level 3 in business administration and won a good job in
business. Clearly, that is not manufacturing, but manufacturers can
also take on apprentices in non-manufacturing subjects, such as
business admin. I am delighted that, for example, EDF Energy, whose
operational headquarters for its nuclear power stations is in my

Indeed, manufacturing is essential to any advanced economy that wishes

policy, based on innovation, is the means by which productivity and
wage rates will grow. It is equally clear from listening to hon.

have dynamic, enterprising manufacturers—Mallinson Fabrications
in Carlisle or Burgon and Ball in Hillsborough, among

chain resilience is key. Over the past 30 years, with
de-industrialisation, we have seen the hollowing out of the UK

relation to aluminium foundings—I think I have that right.
He<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:48:43"></hs_TimeCode> pointed out
that the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders stated that the
lack of an adequate supply base is forcing some vehicle manufacturers,
such as Jaguar Land Rover, but also Nissan and others, to limit their
activities in the UK to final assembly operations, relying on foreign
R&amp;D and component development and manufacture. The Automotive
Council concluded that at least 80% of components in vehicle assembly
could be sourced from UK suppliers, but at present only about 36% are.

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000148">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:49:18"></hs_TimeCode>

points. I will address the points as well as I can in the time

who began their career in a small business, albeit a software business
rather than a manufacturing one. I understand the difficulty of
engaging with the Government—they are a large
organisation—and the importance of putting in place an improved
environment in which small businesses can succeed in a way that is
appropriate to their size and to the amount of time that the people
running them

decline over many years of manufacturing in the UK, from about 23% to
barely more than 10% of the economy, but it is on the rise again.

finally, we have a national infrastructure plan, on which we are
beginning to deliver. The earthwork along the M54 is not alone; across
the country there is infrastructure development, not least for
Crossrail, which is the largest construction project in the whole of

funding for lending scheme, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:56:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for West Bromwich West said, has been helpful, and in April we
announced that we were extending it to SME lending. I note that lending
to small businesses rose by £262 million in July, which is
positive news. On skills, the increase in engineering apprenticeships,
which my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T15:57:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) mentioned, is vital and
is something into which I personally have put huge effort. We have
apprenticeship training agencies in the UK, but there is the potential
for more because they can ensure that we draw together the needs of
different companies to guarantee that training is co-ordinated and
bureaucracy taken away from small businesses. We are also considering
more radical changes to how we 
<?notus-xml column=133?>fund apprenticeships, to make them easier for small businesses to
access, one option being to introduce funding through the tax

experience to the debate. The question of simplifying procurement
bureaucracy is absolutely vital, and the hon. Member for Hartlepool
made a point about procurement almost with the zeal of a convert. The
target of awarding 25% of public contracts to SMEs is important and the
fact that, according to his figures, only 10% of them go to SMEs at the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:01:06"></hs_TimeCode> Institute
for Fiscal Studies report published in May. The study found that,
relative to children born in September, those born in August are 6.4
percentage points less likely to achieve five GCSEs or equivalents at
A* to C, and about 2 percentage points less likely to go to university
at 18 or 19. It is staggering just how long term the effects appear to
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:01:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000167">Following
the Rose review, the previous Government required local authorities to
provide a full-time school place for all four-year-olds in the
September following their fourth birthday. One could argue that that
change tackled one problem faced by summer-borns—that they
receive less time in formal education than their peers, which for some
has a long-term effect on their school
performance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000168">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:02:24"></hs_TimeCode>
argue that any such benefits are cancelled by the impacts on individual
children who are simply not ready in their emotional, social and
cognitive development to start formal school. A good nursery or
pre-school can obviously help with school-readiness in some respects,
but certain aspects of an individual child’s development can
progress only when that child is ready. By definition, many
summer-borns will not be as ready as their older counterparts.
Furthermore, an unhappy experience may lead to behavioural problems and
a lack of confidence and self-esteem as a child tries to cope within
the school setting, and may therefore have further impacts on long-term
achievements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:02:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000169">The
statutory school starting age remains five. In principle, parents have
a choice about which term their child starts school within that time

families’

question of the cost of any extra child care needed by working parents.

to delay entry to reception by a year was rejected by the local
education authority. I also have a story of twins. The tragedy is that
the parents felt that they had to put their children into the reception
class. Sometimes the whole experience is of a totally broken down

is accepted that they have to start reception in another school year. I

who perhaps want to get their children to the top of the class. I want
to reiterate that that is not the case. Unfortunately, it is about
trying to shoehorn individuals into a one-size-fits-all system, and
that is the problem. We must all love and make the most of the
individual differences of our children both in our families and in our
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000190">We
must consider whether some of the issues of summer-born children can be
overcome with a play-based curriculum and excellent teaching in the
reception class, where the needs of individual children are being taken
into account. I would like the answer to be yes, but we have changes in
the primary curriculum and assessment and testing regimes, which put
constraints and pressures on schools and teachers. Even with an
excellent teacher, the individual interests of the child may require a
start in reception at the age of five. I do not think that such a move
would open floodgates because most parents want their children to fit
into the system as it is. Not all summer-born children are adversely
affected by being the youngest in their year and there will be
variations in any effects. It is difficult to see that age-adjusting
test results, as proposed by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, is an
entirely valid

the early start to formal schooling and the testing regime in this
country compound the summer-born problems, which leads me to conclude
that, ideally, we need to rethink our approach to the all-important
learning settings and experiences for the four to seven-year-olds. The
school experience should suit the individual child; the child should
not be made to fit the school because of the potential adverse outcomes

we have to do the best we can. We must identify the problems and cope
with them within the existing system. We must have more flexibility in

interests of the child can be ignored in favour of slotting everybody

hon. Friend made a variety of points, encompassing some of the overall
issues about the school system and the early-years system, as well as
the specific issue of the admissions code. What we are seeking to do
with our education reforms is to increase the level of flexibility that
head teachers and teachers have—for example, over how they
implement the school curriculum—so that children are not pushed
through material that they are not yet ready for and so that more care
is taken about the individual’s level of capacity at a stage of
learning.</hs_Para>

trying to remove some of the barriers between early years and school,
so that there is not a sudden jump between them but rather a continuum
of age-appropriate learning for children. Those changes are also
important in ensuring that each child is treated as an individual
rather than as part of a block of children who are pushed through the
system.</hs_Para>

school admissions code allows for flexibility in school starting dates,
as my hon. Friend pointed out. It requires school admission authorities
to provide for the admission of children in the September following
their fourth birthday, so that the maximum amount of reception
education is available to all children. However, children do not reach
compulsory school age until after their fifth birthday, and no parent
is obliged to send their child to school before

my hon. Friend pointed out, we released new guidance this summer,

that all local authorities and schools understand
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-04T16:21:47"></hs_TimeCode>.

of the reasons why we issued the new guidance is that we felt that
earlier guidance was misunderstood and that it was not necessarily
clear enough. I also agree with my hon. Friend’s comment earlier
about the “floodgates”. Like her, we do not think that
the new guidance will open the “floodgates”; we think
that it is about schools being responsive to parental needs and that
there are not a massive number of complications in doing that. We want
schools to be responsive to parental needs. However, only the parents
of a limited group of children—those born between April and
August—can lawfully delay entry by a full year. It is those
children we are talking about in this debate.</hs_Para>

agree with what my hon. Friend said about the research evidence on
summer-born children. We know that they have lower average attainment
than their older peers. The attainment deficit decreases over time as
they progress through the key stages, but it persists throughout their
schooling. Absolute age is the dominant reason for that but it is not
the only reason, and there is a statistically significant effect from
the starting age or the length of schooling. That is why we want to
give maximum flexibility.</hs_Para>

note from my hon. Friend’s comments that she feels that some of
that guidance should be clearer, and that is certainly something we can

child of entering year 1 without having first attended reception class;
whether a prematurely born child would naturally have fallen into the
lower age group if they had been born on time; and whether delayed
social, emotional or physical development is affecting the

continuing effects of spinal cord injuries are important, and I want to
concentrate on those today. Spinal cord injury results in a combination
of the loss of motor, sensory and continence function, making it unique
among long-term conditions. It is also a non-improving condition. Once
rehabilitation is completed and health care needs have been identified,
they are unlikely to decrease. Indeed, they are likely to increase over
time, with complications brought on by ageing and as the condition
continues. It is essential, therefore, that needs are well managed by a
dedicated and trained team who understand spinal cord injuries. That
will ensure that health complications and significant cost implications
for the national health service are avoided or minimised.</hs_Para>

some extent. The interpretation of rules has always varied somewhat
across the country. Indeed, the Coughlan case was brought because of a
failure to apply rules properly. I will return to that in due course,

research is making important strides in developing new techniques to
help spinal cord injury patients regain as much function and
independence as possible. In 2011-12, the Medical Research Council
spent £900,000 on research directly related to spinal cord

hon. Gentleman appropriately raised NHS continuing health care for
individuals with spinal cord injuries. NHS continuing health care is a
package of health and social care that is arranged and funded solely by
the NHS for individuals outside the hospital setting who have complex,
ongoing health care needs. It is important to say that eligibility for
NHS continuing health care is dependent not on an individual’s
condition or diagnosis—it is important to maintain this
point—but on the individual’s specific care needs. That
must be appropriate, so that what is assessed is what the individual

assessment for NHS continuing health care is complex and involves a
multidisciplinary team co-ordinated by the relevant clinical
commissioning group looking at an individual’s needs across 12
care domains and assessing how those needs interact. The process
determines whether individuals have what is called a primary health
need. If they do so, they will be entitled to continuing health
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090438000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/halltext/130904h0002.htm#13090438000258">The
hon. Gentleman specifically referred to concerns about specialist
involvement in continuing health care assessments. The national
framework, which underpins the assessment and decision making for NHS
continuing health care, makes it clear that someone with specialist
knowledge is involved in the process, with other highly skilled
professionals, such as doctors, nurses, social care staff and
therapists. If that is not happening in an area, 
<?notus-xml column=148?>that is a failure to follow the national framework and should be
challenged. I am interested to hear about cases in which that is not

receiving NHS continuing health care will have their case reviewed
three months after the initial decision and annually thereafter. It is
important to remember that the focus of the review is not only whether
the individual remains eligible, but whether their needs are being

clear, however, that an individual must be kept fully informed about
the process and any proposed change to the care

health care or the package being drawn too narrowly, suggesting that
the Coughlan judgment was not being followed and that cases more
serious than the Coughlan one were being refused—I think I have
put that correctly, from what he said. I again make the point that if
any areas are failing to follow the national framework, that must be
challenged. I appreciate that families may not always understand or
know how to go about challenging, or what they are entitled to, but we

spinal cord injuries and should always be treated as a medical
emergency. The needs of individuals experiencing autonomic dysreflexia
are to manage both the risk of episodes occurring and the risks
involved if and when such episodes occur. Such risks, and therefore the
needs, vary from one individual to another. It would be relevant to

duplicate services or to choose ones that are not right for them.
Beyond being efficient, however, it is simply what we should be doing:
we should be putting the individuals in charge and allowing them to
determine their priorities. On that basis, CCGs are already able to
offer personal health budgets to people on a voluntary basis, if they

Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change (Mr Edward
Davey):</Member></B> Gas will continue to be a crucial part of our
energy mix to the 2030s and beyond. It is therefore essential that we
have secure supplies at competitive prices. Great Britain has a
well-functioning gas market with high levels of liquidity, and
comparatively low wholesale gas prices. Previous independent
assessments<Sup>1</Sup> show that we enjoy high levels of gas supply
security provided by a diverse range of supply sources, including our
own production, pipeline imports from Norway and the EU, imports from
global markets via LNG and storage. These sources have provided
reliable gas supply over recent challenging winters, including our
highest ever daily gas demand in January 2010 and the protracted cold
spell earlier this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090427000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/wmstext/130904m0001.htm#13090427000010">At
the same time, new challenges are emerging, including our increased
dependence on gas imports, and greater demand volatility. We therefore
already have a range of measures in hand to promote our gas security.
We also asked Ofgem to report to us on the outlook for gas security of
supply and whether there is a case for further interventions in the gas
market. Ofgem’s report, published last November, confirmed the
resilience of our gas market. Since then, my Department has been
working to assess whether the potential benefits of a further
intervention in terms of more secure supply and effects on gas prices
might outweigh the associated costs and
risks.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090427000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/wmstext/130904m0001.htm#13090427000011">We
have analysed three interventions in the gas market to establish
whether they might improve our gas security cost-effectively. Our
analysis shows that, although such interventions could enhance our gas
security, under most scenarios they would not do so cost-effectively.
If considering only the direct benefits in terms of avoided costs of
disruption against the cost of building the storage, the costs outweigh
the benefits in all cases. In addition, all options risk unintended
consequences through distorting a well-functioning GB gas market or
crowding out investment in alternative gas supply sources. These
effects could undermine any additional security of supply intervention
might bring. Therefore, we see no clear case for a further intervention
in the gas
market.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13090427000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/wmstext/130904m0001.htm#13090427000012">Given

than five scheme users who used the scheme for several years had a
closure notice issued with no amendment. The closure notices were
issued in error and related to only one of the years under inquiry in
each case. It is not correct to say that because an inquiry was closed
for reasons other than the disputed tax claim, HMRC has accepted the

Benyon:</Member></B> All UK fishermen will benefit from the reforms to
the common fisheries policy (CFP). In addition to the ban on the
wasteful practice of discarding fish, we have secured a legally binding
target to set fishing levels more sustainably. This will increase
biomass in the sea, resulting in improved fishing yields. This has the
potential to have a huge positive impact, not just on stock levels and
the marine ecosystem, but on the bottom line for UK fishing
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090455001587" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/text/130903w0002.htm#13090455001587">UK
fishermen will also benefit from improved fisheries management with a
move away from the one size fits all approach under the current CFP.
The regionalisation process that we secured allows decisions to be made
closer to the fishery, with fishermen playing an important role to

advisory
councils.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13090455000050" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/text/130903w0002.htm#13090455000050">Greyhounds</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13090455001588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/text/130903w0002.htm#13090455001588"><B><Member PimsId="3249" UID="13090455002706" xid="200" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/text/130903w0002.htm#13090455002706">Jim

Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) Act 2003 in England and Wales. There
may be a number of barriers to prosecution, including pressure from the
family or wider community to remain silent. Multi-Agency Practice
Guidelines on handling cases of FGM were published by the Home Office
in February 2011 and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) published
guidance for prosecutors in September 2011. In November 2012, the
Director of Public Prosecutions published a CPS action plan on
improving prosecutions for
FGM.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090455001659" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130903/text/130903w0002.htm#13090455001659">Due
to the hidden nature of the crime it is difficult to quantify how many
women and girls have been taken abroad for the purposes of FGM. The

that over 20,000 girls under the age of 15 could be at high risk of FGM

basis that the deployment was both necessary for a human rights purpose

national security, and was proportionate. The Home Office does not
normally receive notifications of police authorisations. Statistics on
the authorisation of covert surveillance are published in the annual

report on the Trident Alternatives Review, which the Government
published on 16 July, is intended to inform public debate on this
important topic. The review examined the option and costs of an interim
procurement of two Successor submarines to supplement the reducing
fleet of Vanguard-class submarines during the transition to a different
system in 2040. The review did not examine a long-term fleet of two
Successor submarines because such a force would be unable to sustain
back-to-back patrols over an extended period of time, unlike a three
boat fleet. Neither the hours nor costs of the review are centrally

review was conducted over the course of two years and involved an
extensive and highly-classified analysis of policy, intelligence,
scientific, capability and cost issues. It is the most comprehensive
examination ever conducted by British officials of non-continuous
postures. The review thoroughly tested the effectiveness of a wide
range of future nuclear cruise missile systems and explored in depth
the time scales associated with developing cruise missile warhead
designs and the challenges involved in transitioning from the current
Trident system to any alternative system. It reported to the Prime
Minister and Deputy Prime Minister in the second half of June this
year. Officials then worked intensively to de-classify and to produce a

galvanise the NHS trust sector and drive improvement. However, in light
of Robert Francis' report, we have allowed the NHS Trust Development

foundation trust status that go beyond 2014 on a case by case basis. In

remains strongly associated with poorer academic performance. That is

premium, showed a larger than expected narrowing of attainment gaps

Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), carried out in April each

estimate for median full-time gross weekly earnings of female employees
in the Vale of Clwyd constituency in 1997 is £264.20, while the
estimate for 2012 is £484.60, Consequently, the increase over
this period is 83 per cent. In comparison, the corresponding increase
for full-time female employees in the UK is 69 per
cent.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="1309053000895" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/text/130904w0001.htm#1309053000895">Clearly,
much of the increase in earnings is attributable to inflation. For
example the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) shows an increase of 37 per
cent over this period. In addition, changes in average earnings may be
influenced by various factors in the labour market. For example median
earnings may increase if there is growth in the number of high-paid
jobs or a loss of low-paid jobs. Beyond this, the Office for National
Statistics has not made an assessment of the reasons for the increase
in median full-time gross weekly earnings for female employees in the
Vale of Clwyd constituency between 1997 and 2012.</hs_brev>

multi-annual framework of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) the UK
will receive £17.8 billion in Pillar 1 for direct subsidies for
farmers, and £1.84 billion to spend in Pillar 2 on the
environment and rural development. It will be essential to ensure we
implement the CAP in a way which is as simple as possible, affordable
and effective in delivering the outcomes we all want to achieve. The
ideal will be to devise a scheme which is as straightforward as
possible for both farmers and the delivery bodies, thus ensuring
administration costs are kept to a minimum for both farmers and the UK

the Single Payment Scheme (SPS), the proportion of funds allocated to
each region is broadly consistent with the historic distribution of
agricultural subsidies. Hill farming plays a crucial role in
maintaining the social, environmental and economic fabric of the
uplands. It also has the potential to deliver ecosystems services. For
these reasons, Ministers' initial view is that hill farming could be
additionally supported through a level of redistribution of basic
payments from the lowland region to the Severely Disadvantaged Areas
(SDA) and moorland regions. We will welcome the views of consultees on
this issue before we make a final
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309053000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/text/130904w0001.htm#1309053000230">We
have the option to use a proportion of the amount available for direct
payments to fund coupled support schemes to maintain levels of
production in certain sectors; 'headage payments' would be an example
of such payments. A key achievement of the 2005 reform of the CAP was a
progressive move away from coupled support schemes in order to promote
a more market oriented farm sector, and in England the last coupled
schemes ended in 2011. Ministers' initial view is not to reintroduce
any coupled support

commands the support of all member states to facilitate talks aimed at
resolving the Sejdic-Finci constitutional issue. The onus remains on

principal tool for pre-empting and responding to conflict in the wider
world. Its funds are used for a large number of projects concerned with
conflict resolution, response to security threats and the establishment
of good international practices in terms of democracy, human rights and
the rule of law. It operates in Africa, Eastern Europe, Latin America
and Asia. None of the Instrument's current projects is explicitly
concerned with wildlife and forestry protection. However most of the
Instrument's work is designed to improve the capacity of authorities in
fragile states to police their territories effectively, including the
lawful use of natural resources. Wildlife poaching and trafficking and
illegal logging undermine the rule of law and flourish in the types of
lawless environments which the use of the Instrument is intended to
improve. Negotiations between the Commission and the European

donation of brain tissue by meeting the costs of collecting brain
tissue through the NHS, so smoothing the pathway to donation. In

they do not include future deliveries or assets in the course of

in the following table. The values reflect the Net Book Value (NBV) of
the fleet; they do not include future deliveries or assets in the
course of construction. NBV is calculated by adding the cost of any
major upgrades to the original capital cost of each asset and deducting
depreciation to reflect the decrease in value of an asset over time.
The values quoted bear no relation to the replacement costs of the
assets and capabilities, nor can they be used to calculate an accurate

offenders who have received a sentence of imprisonment or detention for
public protection must serve the minimum custodial term imposed by the

Under the 1998 Act, the court could impose an extended sentence where
the offender was convicted of a sexual or violent offence. The

term and, in serious cases, may serve the whole of the custodial term,

monitor the effectiveness of third party certification under Part P in
a similar way that they monitor the effectiveness of self-certification
by installers by carrying out periodic assessments of certification
work by their registered third party certifiers. Scheme operators will
provide the Department with biannual statistics on the number of
registered third party certifiers and the number of certifications
issued. The scheme operators themselves will be required to meet

Tony Baldry:</Member></B> The Church Commissioners are advised on
ethical investment policy by the Church of England’s Ethical
Investment Advisory Group. In directly held investments, the Church
Commissioners avoid investment in companies involved in indiscriminate
weaponry and, if their strategic military supplies exceed 10% of
turnover, in companies involved in conventional weapons. The Church
Commissioners do not invest in companies that derive more than 3% of
revenues from the production or distribution of pornography, nor
companies a major part of whose business activity or focus (defined as
more than 25% of group revenues) is tobacco, gambling, alcoholic
drinks, high interest rate lending or human embryonic cloning. Where
the Church Commissioners are not able to invest in an asset class
directly they do so indirectly (in pooled funds). In indirectly held
investments, where the Church Commissioners usually cannot fully
implement their ethical restrictions, exposure to businesses operating
in 
<?notus-xml column=418?>excluded sectors is monitored. If the level or nature of exposure to
excluded sectors in any one fund becomes unacceptable, the Church
Commissioners review the options for remedial
action.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_04_PT_1/7DC8EAA66D63133A488CB79640567EB0C025FEA2" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="4 September 2013">Wednesday

believe that any attempt by Abu Qatada to return to the UK by seeking

his deportation would outweigh any article 8 grounds for visiting. Abu
Qatada did not make any representations under article 8 during the
recent deportation proceedings, and since his wife and children have

remote.</hs_Para>

Green:</Member></B> Damping is a means of ensuring stability in funding
for police and crime commissioners (PCCs) between years. After
considering the responses to an informal consultation on damping, the
Government decided that every police force area in 2013-14 (and in
2014-15) will face the same percentage reduction in core central
Government funding. The cash reduction in this funding for 2013-14 is
1.6%. This mirrors the approach taken for the first two years of this

is only one part of the police funding picture, which is driven by the
Police Allocation Formula (PAF). The Government will conduct a
fundamental review of the PAF (including damping) to begin in due
course. Until this review of the PAF is completed, it would be
inappropriate to change existing arrangements, as this is the basis on
which many PCCs have made their financial
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309054000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/text/130904w0003.htm#1309054000392">In

south of Crewe as having the strongest economic case and delivering the
widest strategic benefits for a larger proportion of passengers. As
well as enabling services to run to and between key markets of Crewe,
Liverpool, Runcorn, Wigan and Warrington, it also offered the potential
to serve Chester and North Wales (subject to
electrification).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309054000451" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130904/text/130904w0003.htm#1309054000451">A
connection north of Crewe would have significant sustainability
impacts, incur substantial infrastructure costs and mean that some of

the proposed route is part of the Phase Two consultation which ends on
