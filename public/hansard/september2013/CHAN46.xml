Taking Part survey, but the Opposition and the hon. Gentleman have to
make a decision soon about where they stand on school sport, and
whether they are going to join the consensus that recognises that
intervening early in a child’s life and making sport, through
the work that we are doing with primary schools, an integral part of
their life is the way forward. I am happy to discuss with him how he
can join us to make sure that the huge amount of investment that we
have made in school sports, which is ring-fenced and will be inspected
by Ofsted, will have a real impact in the long term. I am open to those
conversations, but he has to make a choice as to whether he is going to
continue to carp from the sidelines or engage in the real

this. Next year only one in three of the free schools that will open
will be primary schools. How does that solve the problem? Will he
change course even at this stage and give top priority in capital
spending for new school places in areas that need extra school

system is failing too many vulnerable children, and it cannot continue.
The previous Government introduced in legislation exemptions to the
status quo to allow social work practices to develop, which is
outsourcing some of the children’s services functions. We think
that that is an encouraging way to look at innovative ways of bringing
people into working with vulnerable children, so that they get the best
possible care. The hon. Lady should look carefully at what we are
doing, because it is in the interests of children. That is why we need

me take Syria first. The G20 was never going to reach unanimity on what
action is needed on Syria, but the case made by those countries who
believe in a strong international response to the use of chemical

statement, sponsored by the US and signed by 12 members of
the G20, that condemns the horrific chemical weapons attack, points to
the clear evidence of the Assad regime’s responsibility for that
attack and calls for a strong international response to this grave
violation of the world’s rules. This statement from St
Petersburg was reinforced on Saturday, when the 28 EU Foreign Ministers
unanimously condemned the chemical weapons war crime and called for a

such crimes.</hs_Para>

military action, but we will continue to press for the strongest
possible response, including at the UN. We will also continue to shape
more urgent, effective and large-scale humanitarian efforts, and we

support efforts by the United States and others to reinforce the

Arabia and America. We agreed to work together through the UN to secure
unfettered humanitarian access inside Syria. We agreed to increase the
focus of that humanitarian assistance on dealing with the dreadful
impact of chemical weapons, including providing medicines and
decontamination tents. And we challenged the world to 
<?notus-xml column=686?>make up the financial shortfall for humanitarian aid by the time the
United Nations General Assembly meeting takes place later this month.
Britain, Canada, Italy and Qatar have made a start with contributions
totalling an extra £164
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090914000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0001.htm#13090914000207">Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T15:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>

Gentleman’s questions about Syria. We do not have a date for the

an early report. I think that that would be useful. We

UN has said is necessary. Britain wanted to get the ball rolling, and
that is why we ensured that some money was pledged at the meeting in

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T15:51:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
is right that minds have become much more focused in recent months.
There is an argument, which the Russians make, that the Syrian regime
would be content to attend talks, but it is very important that we have
some things set out about what those talks aim to achieve. In order to
have proper transition, there is a need to know what we are going to
get out of those talks. We need to know who is going to take part and
who could be part of a transitional Government before those talks
begin. Those issues are as important as an in-principle agreement to

maintaining free trade. The G20 has had a prohibition year

Secretary have an opportunity to say to Secretary Kerry, “Stop
spending all your energies flying desperately around Europe and north

Iran, Russia and all the neighbouring countries, most of whom do not

Gentleman. First, it is hard to think of anyone who has made greater
efforts than Senator Kerry to try to bring about a peaceful resolution
to the Syrian crisis. He has worked incredibly hard to do that. He
knows something else—if chemical weapons are used on that scale

appalling message to the

chemical weapons use in Syria. I was glad that Pope Francis made an
intervention on world leaders calling for peace; it is not the first

because it is in our national interests. We are a trading nation. We
have British people living in countries all over the world. It matters
to us whether the middle east is stable and whether markets are open in

question. Let me be clear about humanitarian access as opposed to
humanitarian corridors. Humanitarian corridors might require, according
to some, wide-scale military action to bring them about, so that is not
under consideration. What is under consideration is what Baroness Amos
set out, with her role at the UN, about what is necessary to get aid to
the Syrians who are in need. That is about reducing border checks,
reducing bureaucracy, making sure that there can be pauses in the
fighting, and making sure that major cities can be accessed. Those are
the things that need to be put in place, and that is what we are
putting the pressure on for. As I say, if we have to go to the UN for
further action, we will.</hs_Para>

argue that if we care about getting things done in the world that are

Members of Parliament had listened to their constituents who were
hugely concerned about the situation in Syria. Clearly, the British
public are deeply sceptical about getting more involved in the Syrian
conflict, but as politicians I think we all have a responsibility to
try to separate from that, for a moment, the issue of chemical weapons
and point out the dangers of not upholding that international taboo.

rise in long-term interest rates, has taken a lot of money out of
developing countries and contributed, they would argue, to some
instability. A year ago at the G20, the question was rather different.
The argument was that because of accommodative monetary policy, the
west was trying artificially to reduce its exchange rates. I understand

renders to the British people at home and abroad. As the Prime Minister
also said, each<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T16:44:13"></hs_TimeCode>

one day be our Head of State. I think that is a rather fine thing. We
have to ask ourselves why the monarchy is so popular. I think it is

precisely because she never asked for the job—she never
campaigned for it. She just sees her role in terms of duty—not

monarchy modernises itself in a way in which the essential structures
are always kept. I was reminded of that when I went to Portsmouth the

on the day of the battle of Trafalgar, but not many people know that in
fact the masts are made of steel and virtually every plank has been
changed. In the same way, the monarchy is constantly changing and
modernising itself. No doubt the monarchy will be very different indeed
when Prince George becomes King, but it will still be essentially the

Social and Democratic Labour party. We have not decided to absent
ourselves, to a man and a woman, this afternoon. In fact, there is a
most unusual meeting taking place: the Northern Ireland Grand Committee
is meeting in the Senate Chamber in Stormont. It is good for the people
of Northern Ireland to see their MPs, of all parties, in action there.
However, I wanted to put on record our very good wishes. As the only
Independent MP from Northern Ireland here, it is wonderful to be 
<?notus-xml column=712?>able to speak for those from other parties and to send our
congratulations to the wonderful Queen, her wonderful husband and to
the parents of Prince George. We are delighted with Prince
George’s safe arrival in this

David Anderson</B> (Blaydon) (Lab):</Member> Any birth is a joy, and
this is a joy for the people of this country. I am particularly happy
because a great grandfather in the Duchess’s family was a coal
miner in the area where I worked for 20 very happy years. I hope that
the inherent spirit and generosity of miners and their care for others
will flow through this child’s blood, so that he can play his
part, along with whoever takes over from us in this House in years to
come, to prevent such things as I heard about on Saturday morning: a
13-year-old girl in my constituency who has just had a spinal operation
is sleeping in a camp bed, because of over-overcrowding, in her
grandmother’s house. I hope that whoever takes over from us will
be able to work together, along with the royal family, to make
something like that a thing of the past.</hs_Para>

the leading charities. I have also met with representative
organisations of the leading charities, and I have made two things
clear to them. First, if they employ lobbyists according to the
definition that we want to introduce, they will have to be registered.
Even the large representative organisations say that that is the right
thing to do. We are talking about professional lobbyists. Throughout
the country, in every neighbourhood and constituency, there is much
excellent community and charitable work that is undertaken voluntarily,
and that is not professional lobbying. We do not expect people who
lobby us at our surgeries with a particular problem in their
neighbourhood to have to register. However, if a large organisation
such as a charity—I can think of some that spend £300
million a year; that is their turnover—has parliamentary
consultants working for them or for third-party organisations that are
lobbying Parliament in the material interests of that charity, that
should be registered. The register will take only a few moments to fill
in—it is not a particularly arduous task—and it is right
that anyone who lobbies Parliament should be on it.</hs_Para>

I have met, as I have told the Committee, all the representative
organisations of the lobbying industry. I have met many chairmen,
chairwomen and managing directors of the larger lobbying companies and,
almost without exception, they think that the legislation is too weak
and does not go far enough, so they oppose it. I have also met all the
lobbying transparency campaigners. One would not think that the people
who campaign for lobbying and the people who campaign to constrain
lobbying would inevitably share the same point of view but, in this

the Leader of the House conceded to the Political and Constitutional
Reform Committee that the definition of consultant lobbyist was narrow.
He said—bear in mind that a Minister said this, not
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T17:14:58"></hs_TimeCode>—“It
is not that we believe consultant lobbyists are the only ones lobbying.
Clearly they are a minority.” The Leader of the House makes the
point more effectively and with fewer words than I am. The point is
that a very small minority of lobbyists and lobbying activity will be
covered the

is a Government amendment before the Committee this afternoon that
excludes companies from having to register, yet the hon. Gentleman
points out that in law companies are individuals—they are legal
persons. On corruption, I have not made the case that the lobbying
industry is wholly corrupt. Not at all, but there is a huge gap between
the population and the political and commercial elite in our
country.</hs_Para>

Leader of the House accepted that consultant lobbyists are a tiny
minority. The Government have constructed a straw man argument in order
to give the appearance that they are taking action on lobbying
transparency, whereas in reality they are doing no such thing. Why is a
register of consultant lobbyists proposed in the Bill? In my view it is
because the Government merely want to be seen to be doing something
while in fact doing very little.</hs_Para>

lobbying transparency for the good and the health of our democracy. We
want to suggest something different to the Government. We want lobbying
transparency because in a 21st century democracy it is only right that
people can see how their Government are being influenced and by
whom—which commercial forces lie behind particular decisions.
That requires a register of all professional lobbyists. All lobbyists
would then have to meet the same high standards, not only to create a
level playing field within the industry, but to make sure that big
money can no longer buy more influence than the rest of the population
by using underhand techniques.</hs_Para>

all that were not bad enough, Government amendment 76, in
the name of the Leader of the House, rather remarkably succeeds in
achieving what many think is impossible: making a bad Bill even worse.
Despite comprehensive and uniquely united criticism and a consensus
against the Bill, the Government have decided in their wisdom further
to amend it, not in order to strengthen it, as lobbyists and experts
have recommended, but rather further to weaken it. Rather than
including companies and organisations that employ lobbyists on the
register, as happens currently with the voluntary register, the
Government have chosen to seek to limit the scope of the Bill further
with this amendment by removing the need for a lobbyist’s
employer to register. This is an important point, so I hope that the
Committee is following the argument. For a register to bring meaningful

<?notus-xml column=721?>transparency to the lobbying industry and to allow public scrutiny of
lobbying, it must surely include, at the very least, all of those who
are doing lobbying. That surely must include the individual
lobbyist’s employer. Yet that is precisely what the amendment
seeks to avoid. Without the information as to who is employing a
particular lobbyist, it will be impossible to know which organisations
or companies are lobbying at all, let alone what they are lobbying
about or how often they are lobbying. The amendment is a retrograde
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T17:22:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090914000465" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0002.htm#13090914000465">I
have highlighted before how the Bill is weaker than the existing
voluntary code, and the amendment is a case in point. The public or an
organisation seeking the services of a lobbyist can currently search
the voluntary registers in a way that discloses an organisation or
employer’s client list, but the Government’s new
proposals will remove that ability. The amendment removes the necessity
for the lobbyists’ employers to be registered. We would know who
the lobbyists were if they were consultant lobbyists, not if they were
professional lobbyists, but we would not know who they were working
for. We would not know who their colleagues were. Nor would we know
which clients were being served by their colleagues. Nor would we know
which other clients were employing the same company. We would not know
the identity of the directors of the company. I would argue that
knowing the names and identities of the directors of the company is
quite important. Arguably, a company director may not themselves be a
lobbyist, but it would be of interest to know who the directors of the
company were which employed the lobbyists who were then on the
register, and the amendment would exclude such a
possibility<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T17:24:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090914000466" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0002.htm#13090914000466">Finally,
we would not know who the shareholders of the company were, which
leaves a massive opportunity for opacity. We would not know who the
directors are or who owns the company, the name of the company or its
registered address; we will be able to know simply that a lobbyist, Mr
M. Smith, or whatever his name may be, is working out of Wimbledon. We
will have no idea who his colleagues are, what company he works for,
what its registered address is or who its shareholders and directors
are. It really is a very bad and dangerous amendment. Rather than
opening up the lobbying industry, the Government’s proposal
would allow companies and organisations to hide behind the
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T17:25:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090914000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0002.htm#13090914000467"><B><Member ContinuationText="Grahame M.

The truth is that we will have no idea whom they are working for. We
will know who their clients are, because that is required on the
register, but we will have no idea who employs them. That seems to me
to be a rather critical question to ask. For those people now on the
voluntary register and operating to an ethical code, we know who their
clients are and whom they work for, and the companies they work for
also register. If the amendment is made, we will have no idea whom they
are working for or who their other clients are. It seems 
<?notus-xml column=722?>to me that those on the Government Front Bench—I look to the
Minister—should reflect on the amendment carefully before
deciding whether to press it. It is very

Pressure can be brought to bear with a view to setting off a favourable
reaction or having a desired effect. We have often heard the aphorism,
“Does the flap of a butterfly’s wings set off a tornado
elsewhere?” A lobbyist would certainly hope that it does. We
have heard about the subtle art of making sure that people are in the
right place at the right time to catch somebody’s eye to have
that casual conversation. As the Bill stands, none of this is captured,
and I am very concerned about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T17:38:28"></hs_TimeCode>. The public

charities and organisations that are captured by the Bill and, indeed,

the informal, behind-the-scenes lobbying over the cup of coffee, the

Bill that was not their doing. Rather than that, we should end this
cruel sport and do what the all-party Select Committee on Political and
Constitutional Reform proposed, once it was allowed to report and get
engaged in this process. It proposed that the Bill be put into a
special Committee so it that could be discussed and got
right—not delayed, but brought back to the House as a new Bill

for Hemsworth, made an assertion in this Committee that the intention
of Government amendment 76 was to exclude companies and employers. That
is simply not right: that is a misconception. If the Opposition pour a
torrent of misconceptions on the drafting of the Bill, their criticisms
will not be listened to. I am anxious, as is

word “person” in clause 1, as proposed, would mean that
anybody carrying on the business of consultant lobbying, whether they
represented a partnership or a company, would have to register if they
came within the definition of consultant lobbying. The problem the 
<?notus-xml column=735?>hon. Gentleman refers to is not a problem in clause
1; it is a problem in clause 2, to which I expect we are about to come.
The problem in clause 2 is the definition of consultant lobbying, but
clause 1 would cover employers and people who carry on a business of
consultant lobbying through their employees. A company cannot carry on
business in any way unless it be through human beings—their
employees. Therefore, if a human being goes to lobby and is lobbying on
behalf of a consultant lobbyist, as defined, then that consultant
lobbyist, his employer, will have to register. There is no doubt about
that—that is a

caught by this definition. My suggestion and submission to those on the

major City law firms—it is now not uncommon for there to be
specialist departments that deal with lobbying activities. It strikes
me, with the greatest of respect to those on the Government Front

issues that we need to reach in order to deal with the layers of

scandal have basically come up with the narrowest of nets to deal with
professional lobbying, restricting it not to professional lobbying as
we all know and understand it—lobbying as we see it practised in
and around the parliamentary estate and elsewhere in public life, at
various levels of government—but to a narrow definition of
“consultant lobbying”.</hs_Para>

suspicion. Why would we go along with a glaringly inadequate Bill? Why
would we fail to respond to the representations that have come from so

know that we looked at the Bill more widely on Second Reading, Mr
Caton, but I hope it is in order to make the argument in the debate
about this group of amendments and part 1 that it is hard for people
not to be suspicious when they see the lobbying to be registered so
narrowly defined in part 1, and the issues to be covered in part 2 so
widely scoped. As many hon. Members who have spoken have pointed out,
none of the lobbying scandals that have happened in recent
years—not even those during the life of this
Parliament—would have been ameliorated or mitigated in any way
by the scope of this Bill. Instead of pretending that it will solve the
next big scandal, let us be clear: it would not have addressed any of
the big, small or medium scandals that we have seen in the last few

of transparency and registration is about being able to say that, if
all such engagement is absolutely above board and matter of

picture is created, or when it can be canvassed by some, that there is
something untoward about such contacts and representations—that
they are an attempt to get undue influence in pursuit of a particular
vested interest—the whole public policy system and Parliament
suffer. That is what happens when those suspicions abound. We are

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T18:49:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
is right. It is clear from clause 2—the amendments that we are
considering relate partly to clause 2 and to paragraph 3 of schedule 1
—that any organisation whose main purpose is not lobbying, such
as a legal firm, an accountancy firm of a broadcaster, will not be
required to register at all. The hon. and learned Member for Torridge
and West Devon made a very good point when he said that the industry
had changed in the last 10 years. Many Government relations companies
that used to stand alone have been brought into wider companies that
deal with public relations and communications of a much more general
sort. Those organisations will not be required to register. Moreover,

paucity of the drafting of the Bill—cobbled together, I think,

who the Government think do consultant lobbying do not do it in the

The Government may think that 350 organisations will be

hon. Friend the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch) and I
have outlined. They would widen the scope, and would mean that only
incidental lobbying activities would escape. That could not be said of

Finally, if the Government know that the legislation is so flawed that
they have had to table many amendments—we are
considering 15 Government amendments in this first
group—it would make far more sense to say, “Let’s
draw stumps. We all want a piece of legislation. Some parts of the Bill
may be serviceable. Let’s give it to the Select Committee and
suggest that it draft proper legislation that will work and meet the

atmosphere being poisoned in such a way that air pollution far exceeds
European limits; 2 million people will experience increased noise
across London. There was lobbying from the aviation industry,
particularly BAA, formerly the British Airports Authority. A lobbying
firm was employed, but its activities were largely a smokescreen for
the real lobbying by BAA employees. As I said on Second Reading, many
of them had passes to enter the Department for Transport and meet
officials. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T19:19:03"></hs_TimeCode>The

48, however, is rather inadequate, as its definition of lobbying
relates to the lobbying of Ministers and permanent secretaries, and
does not relate in any way to the real world of lobbying. In the BAA
lobby on the third runway there was, as I said, wining and dining of
Ministers and senior civil servants, but that was a smokescreen for the
intensive lobbying of fairly junior civil servants who undertook the
assessments of traffic growth, air pollution impacts, noise impacts and
the logistical arrangements around the airport. By the time that the
reports that they prepared landed on the desks of the permanent
secretary and of Ministers the decision was virtually
made.</hs_Para>

McDonnell:</Member></B> That is an extremely valid point. In the real
world of lobbying, I have experience of that constituency issue, with
BAA employees employed virtually full-time—yes, with a range of
experts—intensively lobbying relatively junior staff in the
Department for Transport and the Treasury, building up a head of steam
around a particular demand from BAA that eventually shapes the decision
made by Ministers. My understanding of the debate so far is that such
lobbying would not be covered by the Bill and BAA in its new form, as
Heathrow airport, would not be caught by
it<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090941000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090941000007">Things
have moved on. Governments are increasingly outsourcing the preparation
of the material that will eventually enable Ministers to take
decisions. That outsourcing relies upon the commissioning of external
experts—not within Government, but often academics and
others—and in addition to that, the setting up of various
commissions. The Howard Davies commission is consulting various
organisations on behalf of Government about the expansion of aviation
in London and the south-east, especially the issues surrounding the
expansion of Heathrow. My understanding of the Bill is that the
lobbying of the external advisers and members of such commissions is
also not caught by the

may have experienced that process, but let me explain. An intensive
lobbying exercise is being undertaken by the aviation industry across
the country. Businesses that own individual airports are intensively
lobbying Howard Davies’s commission, and they are lobbying
external experts commissioned to undertake pieces of work, because
obviously they are looking to expand their particular airport. I do not
believe, and I am happy if the Minister wants to advise me differently,
that any of that lobbying will be caught by the Bill.</hs_Para>

influence that goes on behind closed doors, whereas small businesses
that are lobbying for change, those SMEs that work as public affairs
consultants, have to bear the burden of regulation. As has already been
touched upon, the burden is horrific. The impact assessment is
fundamentally flawed. As I said earlier, it has simply been transposed
from the systems in Australia and Canada. It has been assumed that that
is how our system works. Given that the Minister and our civil servants

Docherty:</Member></B> I am most grateful to my hon. Friend, who spoke
eloquently from the Front Bench during proceedings on my private
Member’s Bill last year, setting out why the Opposition want to
see workable legislation. I am more than happy to set out what is wrong
with the impact assessment. It uses the Government’s figures and
is confused. It says that the register, which covers only consultant
lobbyists, will cost £500,000 to set up and a further
£200,000 to run each year. That is according to the
Government’s own figures, so it must be right. Almost all the
firms who are members of the 
<?notus-xml column=756?>APPC are SMEs. I would be amazed if there were one that employed more
than 250 people in total. Most are firms with between 20 and 50
employees, so these are not large firms. They are the entrepreneurial
firms that we hear so much about from Government Members. But the
Government and their civil servants have made up some rash figures.
They have said that there are about 1,100 lobbying consultants in this
country. I am still not clear where that figure has come from. I think
they have taken the APPC list and accepted that that is probably pretty
much every one who is “a lobbyist”. They have then said
that, if the cost is £500,000, that can be shared by
1,000, which I assume is the 1,000 lobbyists. However, the Bill
contradicts that. It says that payment is per firm—the Deputy
Leader of the House graciously nods in agreement—and probably
only 10 to 20 firms will be caught by the current definition. I am not
a great mathematician, but if one takes £500,000 and divides it
by 20, that is not £500. It is significantly more. That
is just the start-up cost in the first year. That is a
disproportionate and huge impact on small
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T19:36:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_09_PT_1/8475B792CFE4F6768A610829AC19E31378CBB4BA" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="9 September 2013">Monday

Docherty:</Member></B> I will just touch on the issue of some of the
very large firms. One of the huge flaws is the issue of non-lobbying
business—that a firm that is not a lobbying company
would not be captured. One example is DLA Piper, a well-regarded law
firm and lobbying communication consultancy; it is exactly the type of
company that could probably afford to pay something. We are talking
about £25,000 per company as the cost of the register, which is
not the £500 that the Government’s impact assessment
claims. DLA Piper is exempt. The irony about the Front-Bench team that
we have today is that the reason why the Deputy Prime Minister’s
fingerprints are not on the Bill is that his wife previously worked for
DLA Piper. The Deputy Prime Minister, correctly in my view, recused
himself from the whole process. Under the Bill as it has been drawn up,
however, DLA Piper is not covered. I hope that the Minister for the
Cabinet Office is reflecting on that

Docherty:</Member></B> With your indulgence, Sir Roger, let me try to
answer what I think is a genuine intervention from the Deputy Leader of
the House. I was involved in the APPC back in 2008-09, when the
previous Government effectively told the industry that it was drinking
in the last chance saloon. In the previous Parliament, we had the
Public Administration Committee report that, as I recall, recommended a
statutory register if the industry did not improve public confidence
and Parliament’s confidence in it. I made the point that those
firms that are working in the correct manner and striving to improve
their reputation would join a voluntary body, which they duly did, and
the UK Public Affairs Council was set up to try to bring those things
together. Regrettably, it was clear that the small number of dubious
lobbying firms—dubious individuals, to be more
accurate—would choose not to. Many of those who sign up to the
voluntary register do so because they want to demonstrate that they are
playing to the highest ethical standards and that there is bureaucracy
and paperwork involved. It is not a case of chaps sitting around and
signing off each other’s
practices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090941000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090941000035">Firms
also made the point that, when asked by potential clients whether they
are a member of a register, they would simply say, “Well, we
don’t do that activity.” In my three years as a
consultant lobbyist—I understand that the Government do not
accept my definition of a lobbyist—I do not recall once having a
meeting with a permanent secretary or Minister, so my firm
would have had no need to register. That is why I think that there is a
real danger that those firms would say, “We don’t
undertake that activity, so the Government and Parliament do not think
we need to register,” and therefore the provisions will fall
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T19:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090941000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090941000036"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andy Sawford" PimsId="6000" UID="13090941000692" xid="1241" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090941000692">Andy

Bill as well as its effect. My understanding of the companies that
currently participate in the voluntary register is that effectively
they are the good guys, although I am sure that we could find examples
of where they have not always met the highest standards. What we should
really be trying to do, with regard to bringing transparency, is
identifying people currently operating outside any ability for us to
see what their line of work is or their willingness to be transparent

is capture only third-party lobbyists. As the Deputy Leader of the

correctly—the two Ministers are present, so they can correct me
if I get this wrong—all they are interested in doing is ensuring
that if a consultant lobbyist sits in a room with a Minister, that

that the register be extended to apply to in-house lobbyists in
addition to consultant lobbyists. As I have repeatedly reminded the
Opposition and the Committee, the steps we have taken to enhance
transparency at these previously opaque levels have already revealed
the interaction between Ministers and external organisations. We
proactively publish details of all Ministers’ and permanent
secretaries’ meetings. It is therefore difficult to appreciate
what value a register of in-house lobbyists would provide. It could
merely duplicate the information that we already publish. Of course, we
do publish that information. Will Opposition Front Benchers confirm in
this debate what they have failed to confirm before—whether they
would publish their own meetings and diaries? They
have consistently failed to meet that challenge, and that is

52 would amend schedule 1 to remove the de minimis exemption that we

Constitutional Reform Committee on this. I assure hon. Members that the
Government are keen to listen to the concerns expressed by his
Committee and others that the exemption in paragraph 3 would perhaps
exclude large multi-disciplinary firms. That was never our intention,

exemption would exclude only those who happen to communicate with the
Government in a manner incidental to their normal professional
activities. Multi-disciplinary firms that run consultant lobbying
operations and lobby in a manner that is not incidental to their other
activities will be required to register. I can therefore reassure hon.

me turn to a pair of Opposition amendments that are in this group but,
intriguingly, were not spoken about—amendments 25 and 26. They
would entirely remove the exemption that we have included in
paragraph 7 to ensure that the normal activity of altruistic
organisations such as charities is excluded from the scope of the Bill.
We all know, of course, that the Charities Commission already imposes
strict rules governing how charities lobby, and there is also a
specific and onerous regime governing charitable status. Despite that,
the Opposition want to remove the exemption for bodies such as
charities and require them to register. Interestingly, though, they are
not seeking to remove the exemption for the normal activity of trade.
The Opposition are thus proposing that charities register as
professional lobbyists in relation to their normal activity, but that
trade unions do not. I urge hon. Members to withdraw the

3—the lead amendment in the group—is a probing amendment

Bill, need to record by whom they are employed. 
<?notus-xml column=774?>Given the widespread concerns about what and who Crosby Textor lobbies
for, it seems reasonable that the individual consultant lobbyists who
work for Crosby Textor should reveal who employs them. The Opposition

conduct. Such a code of conduct would be introduced after full

will have the bizarre situation whereby the registrar can punish
lateness in providing or submitting information, but cannot punish

what I think would enjoy cross-party support. In the case of
organisations such as the Royal Pharmaceutical Society and many other

membership role. The regulatory role has emphasised a code of conduct
and enforcement of standards, whereas the representative membership
role has been about advocating for the profession. The two roles are
quite different. The voluntary side is about working together, mutual
support, peer support and advocating for the role that a profession

Sawford:</Member></B> Let me clarify my
interpretation of the debate on the amendments to which my hon. Friend
is speaking. The general tone of the discussion from the Opposition
Benches has been about the need to enhance transparency. There is no
suggestion in the initiative that the organisations that might be
encompassed by a proper regulatory code are engaged in something that
is in any way wrong. I think that Opposition Members are therefore
quite right to seek to broaden the provisions. I wonder whether
Government Members do not protest too much and whether, in a sense,
they have something to hide. There may be nothing wrong in the actions
of Linton Crosby, but as far as the public are concerned—and I
hope this is parliamentary, Sir Roger—it stinks. Nobody should
have anything to fear from transparency if they are doing nothing
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T20:56:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090952000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090952000002"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Thomas" PimsId="4261" UID="13090952000615" xid="589" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090952000615">Mr
Thomas:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes the perfectly reasonable
point that new clause 2 is an attempt to prevent the sort of concerns
that have arisen, going wider than our Benches and our parties, about
the role of Mr Crosby. New clause 2 seems to me to be a perfectly
sensible provision to prevent any similar situation from happening in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T20:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090952000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0003.htm#13090952000003">New
clause 7 is designed to make provision for professional lobbyists
taking up employment in government. It deals with similar territory,
albeit on a slightly different issue, to new clause 2. It would
similarly deal with the potential conflicts of interest that can arise
when a lobbyist seeks to take up a senior position in government. It is
quite possible that someone with considerable skill and expertise who
is working as a lobbyist at the moment might secure an offer to work as
a senior civil servant. Such a person who has worked in a senior
position in government before and has been seeking to widen their
career profile might now successfully seek to return to a senior
position in government. Having a system in place, which is what new
clause 7 allows for, to check that there are no conflicts of interest
around such employment is surely sensible and would help to build trust
in the new appointment. Together with new clause 2, that new
clause would allow the relevant Committee to probe whether there were
any reasons to be concerned about any ongoing commercial lobbying
interests that such a person might
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T20:57:57"></hs_TimeCode>. I say

Allen:</Member></B> It is very generous of my hon. Friend to offer the
creation of a more effective Bill to the tender mercies of my Select
Committee, but we are not looking for that job. There is a process
whereby a special Committee can be created in order to review a Bill
effectively and pre-legislatively. It is also important from my hon.
Friend’s point of view, however, that the Opposition make it
clear that pre-legislative scrutiny, which has barely taken place in
this case, must become part of the Standing Orders of this House so
that every Bill as a matter of course—apart from in
emergencies—goes through proper pre-legislative scrutiny. This
must not be a convention gifted to us by courtesy of the Government of
the day, of whichever political colour, but must be something that this
House does as of right to every appropriate

31 seeks to probe the Government over the appointment of the registrar.
It is crucial for whoever performs that role to enjoy the confidence of

not be good enough for the Government simply to pick one of their
friends or cronies. We believe that allowing my hon. Friend’s

particular cause at any one time. In the United States, an approximate
good-faith estimate of the amounts that are spent must be published
every quarter. It is surely right, in the interests of transparency,

know from today’s media reports—thanks to a leak of
confidential documents from Philip Morris International—that
huge sums are, on occasion, spent on lobbying in pursuit of particular

products directive from coming to fruition. Apparently, more than 230
Members of the European Parliament were met at least once. Freedom of

get to the truth. Like so much of the Bill in its current form, clause

the Government are wrong and all the expert witnesses are right about
that, the registrar could be faced with a substantial cost gap, and
that would have to be picked up by the public purse. The Government
seem to be very relaxed about wasting money, as they have happily
written off the disastrous IT projects for universal credit and
borrowed billions of pounds to fund the welfare costs of those who
cannot find jobs, but it would be useful to hear from the Minister how
the apparent fairy tale of a budget for the registrar that the impact
assessment suggests has been cobbled together. What is the thinking

Leader of the House to suggest on Second Reading that we were all
alarmed because of trade union scaremongering. That is not the case. I
have not received a single letter or e-mail from a trade union, but I
have received them from charities, which want reassurance that the
registrar will be independent of Government. The registrar will have
the power to keep and publish the register. They must keep the register
up to date, they have the power to monitor compliance with obligations,
and they can issue information notices if they believe that consultant
lobbyists have not registered.</hs_Para>

It is essential for public confidence in the new register that, as the
Leader of the House promised on Second Reading, the new system is
independent of Government and the registrar enjoys independence. The
amendments that I have tabled would require the Minister to allow the

any other person.</hs_Para>

Leader of the House to suggest that the lobbying industry would pay for
the register

organisations throughout the UK, which are listed at the back of the

</B><B>Chloe </B><B>Smith:</B></Member> I want to respond to a couple
of the amendments before we wind up. Amendments 3 and 4 would
alter clause 1 and provide that lobbying was prohibited
unless a lobbyist had both registered and signed up to the
register’s code of conduct. Amendment 42 would
establish a civil sanction in relation to breaches of the code of
conduct. New clause 1 provides that the registrar must produce a code.
However, there is little detail about what provision such a code would
make other than that it would forbid inappropriate financial relations
between registered persons and parliamentarians. The amendments reveal
that, as we perhaps knew already, the Opposition intend not only a
register of lobbyists but a full-blown regulator of the
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T21:29:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090952000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#13090952000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Thomas" PimsId="4261" UID="13090952000633" xid="589" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#13090952000633">Mr

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T21:34:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Lady
says that the amendment makes no provision for a description of what
might be in the code of conduct. I gently say that that seems a bit
presumptuous. The point is that there needs to be wide discussion with
the industry and those who watch its activities about what should be in
a code of conduct. Why will she not allow provision for a code of

it?</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13090952000611" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#13090952000611">9.30

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T21:31:32"></hs_TimeCode>codes contain
laudable principles and good practice guidance, their translation into
statute is not feasible or practical. The experience of regulators in
other jurisdictions clearly shows that statutory codes of conduct for
lobbying can be unworkable and unenforceable. That is what I seek to
guard against in opposing the amendment. The question then hangs in the
air of what provisions the Opposition would expect to see in a code of
conduct. They have provided very little indication other than that it
will, rather intriguingly, forbid any 
<?notus-xml column=787?>inappropriate financial relations between registered persons and
parliamentarians. Can the Opposition give us an example of what an
inappropriate relationship might entail? Can the hon. Gentleman explain
whether it would not already be prohibited by Parliament’s own
code of conduct or laws on bribery and corruption? He is silent, which
is rather worrying. This is another example of the rather lazy and
imprecise draftsmanship that we have seen from the Opposition today,
and that is not good enough. He does not provide any notion about how
the code’s provisions might be enforced and what resources the
registrar would be required use to monitor it. The Opposition are
setting the registrar an impossible task in expecting them to do that
kind of thing. I urge him to withdraw the

register is fully funded by the industry in order to protect the
taxpayer. As I said earlier, the Canadian register costs £3

the identification of the interests that are being represented by

entirely undermine the enforcement regime relating to the register. The

consultant lobbyist bumped into a Minister on the tube and spoke about

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T21:43:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) about the way in which the debate has
been organised and the high number of amendments that will not be
scrutinised at all. Ironically, the Prime Minister brought forward the
Bill saying that he wanted to avoid the next scandal. I am sure I am
not alone in thinking that the way in which we are being forced to
handle this debate is in itself a
scandal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-09T21:44:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090952000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#13090952000086">I
will speak briefly to amendment 152, the purpose of which is to bring
depth to the Bill by focusing on financial disclosure. I believe that
there should be a requirement to disclose a good-faith estimate of how
much money has been spent on lobbying activity. The Minister said that
the purpose of the Bill was to shine the light of transparency on
lobbying. To my mind, we would be doing only half the job if we did not
ensure that we had an idea of what was being spent on lobbying. I will
try again to persuade her that requiring information on how much money
is spent on lobbying on a quarterly basis would be proportionate and
not
burdensome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090952000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#13090952000087">The
money being spent is the clearest indication of how committed an
industry or organisation is to influencing a particular issue. It is
also a clear indicator that Government decision making on an issue must
be carefully scrutinised. Money also reveals the scale, disparities and
trends in lobbying, and financial disclosure of the amount spent on
lobbying would help us assess the spending gap between business and
civil society groups, for example, or multinationals and non-profit
organisations lobbying for Government contracts. Such a requirement
need not be a bureaucratic burden. Work by Unlock Democracy on a mock
filing showed that it would take about 20 minutes to
prepare. That already happens in the US, and I have heard no good
argument for it not to happen here. As a result, in the US it is much
easier to see what is going on.</hs_Para>

by looking at lobbying expenditures from the Senate Office of Public
Records, we see that last year the US tobacco industry spent more than
$26.5 million on lobbying. Those figures also reveal a long-term trend.
Although exact levels have fluctuated, the industry has consistently
spent more than $20 million a year for the past 10 years. By contrast,
in the UK we know only that the Government have retreated from their
support for plain packaging, amid rumours that multimillion pound
lobbying contracts have been signed, from press reports or
behind-the-scenes tip-offs. We have all heard the allegations that last
November, after his appointment as the Prime Minister’s
electoral strategy adviser, Lynton Crosby signed a contract between
Philip Morris International and Crosby Textor for lobbying in the UK
that could be worth many millions, but we have nothing the public can
use properly to hold the Government to account. We should not have to
pick our way through 
<?notus-xml column=791?>rumours, tip-offs, allegations and counterclaims to find the truth; it
should be officially gathered and openly published for all to

we know that the taxpayer-funded Royal Bank of Scotland
spent more than £2.5 million on lobbying Washington about
financial regulation laws, but we know it from documents released by
the US Government that list lobbying activity in the US and state the
lobbyist, client, amount spent and the subject of the lobbying.
Therefore, even though we have a stake in that bank we have no right to
know how much it has spent in the UK; we have that information only
because of financial disclosure requirements in the US lobbying
register, and we have no idea how much RBS or any UK bank spends on
lobbying the UK Government.</hs_Para>

reveal lobbying trends or stories. For example, the oil and gas
industry spent more than $140 million on lobbying in the US
in 2012—well over double, and getting close to treble, the $52
million it spent in 2004. Therefore, an important story is revealed. We
see climate change rising up the political agenda as science shows the
risks to be even greater, and we see the economic benefits of cleaner
renewable energy and the challenge that poses to incumbent utilities
business models. We also see the oil and gas industry redouble its
lobbying efforts and throw tens of millions of pounds into the process.
Information about the industry’s spending tells us far more than
just knowing that it has had certain meetings; it is a vital part of
the equation.</hs_Para>

secured this debate on spousal visas, an issue on which the Minister
has responded on a number of occasions. On one of the last such
occasions, on 19 June in Westminster Hall, he explained that the
spousal visa changes had three aims: dealing with fraud, namely, sham
marriages; promoting better integration, including English language
testing and tests on life in the UK; and preventing visa applicants
from becoming a burden to the taxpayer. I do not necessarily have an
objection to any of those aims. Indeed, I would like to see a tougher

nothing and has no impact on the income threshold. Despite the fact

arbitrary £18,600, and he would be able to bring his wife in,
despite the fact that he would have greater outgoings and a much lower
disposable income than he has by virtue of the fact that he lives in
Goole. I am grateful for a figure provided by the Royal College of
Nursing to the all-party parliamentary group on migration, which has

than they do in mine. I know she will be working hard on behalf of her

figures from the Home Office show that the largest decline in family
visas has been among applicants from the United States. In the year to
March 2013 such visas were down by just under 1,000. In evidence to the
all-party parliamentary group, the Migration Observatory points out
that 47% of the UK working population last year would not meet the
income criterion. In my constituency that figure would be an awful lot

some of those people access to join their family is having a
detrimental effect on the UK economy. When they come here their
passports are stamped with the words “No recourse to public
funds”, but they are often people who, if they were here
working, as in the case of my constituent, whose wife has a job offer,
would be paying tax and contributing to the UK economy. I make no bones
about wanting, as

the Member for Battersea (Jane Ellison) said, a tougher immigration
system. The English language testing is problematic for some, but I

Government’s general position on the immigration system and the
desire to restore some sanity to it after the uncontrolled immigration

my hon. Friend correctly said in his opening remarks, the family rules
have three aims. The first, which I know he strongly supports, is to
deal with abuse, which is why we have extended from two years to five
years the probationary period before partners can apply for settlement,
to test the genuineness of the relationship concerned, which should
help to deter applications based on sham marriages. Secondly, we are
promoting the integration of family migrants by requiring those
applying for settlement from 28 October this year to pass the new
“Life in the UK” test and demonstrate that they can speak
and understand English to the intermediate B1 level. That means that
those intending to live permanently in the UK can communicate in the
wider community and have a basic understanding of British history,
culture and democracy. My hon. Friend said that he supported that as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309102000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#1309102000603">The
third issue, about which my hon. Friend has concerns, is the aspect of
the rules seeking to prevent burdens on the taxpayer by introducing the
minimum income threshold of £18,600 a year to be met by those
wishing to sponsor the settlement of a partner. He said that that was
an arbitrary number. It was the Migration Advisory Committee, the
independent body that advises the Government, that proposed a range of
numbers based on its analysis of the problem; we adopted a figure from
the lower
end.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309102000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#1309102000604">In
talking about regional pay, my hon. Friend touched on the interaction
between the welfare and immigration systems. As I said in the
Westminster Hall debate, it is interesting that Members who, in the
context of this debate, say that £18,600 is a high number, often
suggest—I am not suggesting my hon. Friend does—suggest
in the context of a welfare debate that it is not high. We selected
that number because it is broadly the amount more than which a couple
must earn if they are not to be eligible for income-related
benefits.</hs_Para>

is right that in the period when the migrant spouse is in the UK before
they get indefinite leave to remain, they are not entitled to benefits,
but they will be once they are settled and their spouse may be entitled
to income-related benefits because of their being here—housing
benefit, for example. As he said, we do not have a regional benefit
system and that is one of the complexities of the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309102000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#1309102000606">In
practice, the previous requirement for adequate maintenance meant that
any sponsor earning, after tax and housing costs, more than the
equivalent of income support for a couple—about
£5,700—was deemed to have sufficient funds to sponsor a
partner. That was not an adequate basis for sustainable family
migration and did not provide adequate

requirement provided little assurance of a sustainable basis over the

based principally on the 
<?notus-xml column=808?>expert advice from the Migration Advisory Committee. It is the level of
income at which a couple, once settled in the UK and taking into
account children, generally cannot access income-related benefits. My
hon. Friend said that his constituent had no intention of claiming
benefits, but of course there is no way for us legally to enforce their
not claiming benefits once they are in the United

Committee looked at whether there was a case for varying the income
threshold across the United Kingdom, which is the substance of my hon.
Friend’s point—I know that he did not want to make that
point, but I will take it as a suggestion floating around that I can
comment on. The Migration Advisory Committee looked at that approach
but concluded that there was not a clear case for taking it. It would
mean that sponsors, for example, could make an application when living
in one area and then move around the United Kingdom. It would also
penalise a sponsor living in a relatively wealthy part of a poor
region; they would have a lower income threshold than a sponsor living
in a deprived area of a relatively wealthy region. A single national
threshold may not be more acceptable, but it makes things clearer for
people than a much more complicated system of regional
targets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309102000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/debtext/130909-0004.htm#1309102000611">As
my hon. Friend mentioned, I said in the previous debate that we would
continue to monitor the impact of the new rules and make adjustments

Members here who came to see me—will have noticed that in the
immigration rule changes that I laid before the House on Friday last
week, we set out changes in the flexibility of evidence, allowing
details of electronic bank statements to be submitted. There will also
be flexibility around the cash savings that people can have, to include
net proceeds from the sale of a property owned by the applicant and a
partner. That has been an issue in some specific cases.</hs_Para>

that a lot of Members who want us to reduce the income level would

immigration. About 30% of immigrants come from EU countries and over
half come still from outside the EU. It is important to put that into
context. It is also the case that if people coming here from the EU

always be conscious of the fact that there are more than 11 million
pensioners in Britain, or nearly 20,000 per parliamentary constituency.
Pensioners are among those who follow politics most closely and are
some of our most well-informed electors. They are most likely to vote
in elections, so we would all be wise to take proper and full account
of their
views.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000012">The

have a few things to say on the timing of today’s debate. It was
originally tabled to take place before the freeze on the age-related
personal tax allowances had come into force, but the proroguing of
Parliament, and the Queen’s Speech, denied us that opportunity.
By the time the Backbench Business Committee had been re-elected and
was able to allocate time, we had reached the summer recess. Although a
debate may now seem something of an afterthought, it at least gives MPs
the chance to discuss the matter in detail, which was never the case
when the Chancellor made his initial announcement. It also provides us
with the opportunity to see how the policy relates to the much wider
issue of older people and the effect of austerity on their living
standards and general
well-being.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000014">For
decades there has been an acknowledgement of the need to provide
additional support through the taxation system to older people in
retirement. In 1925, old-age relief was introduced to help those aged
over 64 with incomes of £500 a year or less. The
Chancellor at the time, Winston Churchill, said that the modest savings
of pensioners should be exempt from tax. The basis of today’s
age-related allowance was introduced in 1975, and in 1987 further
assistance was given by the introduction of an increased allowance for
taxpayers aged over 80—reduced to those aged over 75 in
1989.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000015">The
decision by the Chancellor in the March 2012 Budget to
freeze the age-related tax allowances, therefore, not only went against
a widely held consensus that had been in place for more than 50 years,
but caused serious concern about the future income levels of older
people throughout the UK. The Chancellor announced in the House that he
would freeze the age-related allowances from 6 April 2013 at the level
of £10,500 for someone aged 65 to 74 and at £10,660 for
someone aged 75 or over until those allowances aligned with the
ordinary personal allowance. People retiring after that date—in
effect, those born after 5 April 1948—are therefore to receive a
lower personal tax allowance of £9,205, which is £1,295
less than they would have been expecting. It is estimated that the
measure will save the Exchequer £3.3 billion by
2016-17 and, according to Treasury figures, will result in 4.4 million
existing tax-paying pensioners losing between £63 and £83
a year, while future pensioners will suffer a loss of between
£285 and £322 a year after
tax.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000016">Understandably,
the announcement caught the headlines the following day, but it came as
a surprise to many, and it was unexpected for a number of reasons. Only
the year before, the Chancellor had told the House that the
allowances would continue to rise for the lifetime of the Parliament in
line with the retail prices index. There was no indication that he was
preparing a change of policy. Twelve months later, he clearly decided
to break that
promise.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000017">Astonishingly,
while announcing a freeze on the tax allowances of pensioners at the
same time, the Chancellor said that he would give those earning more
than £150,000  
<?notus-xml column=199?>a year a 5% cut in their tax rate, from 50% to 45%, which was an
enormous windfall to those on the highest incomes. Someone on an income
of £1 million taxable at the highest rate stood to benefit to
the tune of £50,000 a year. It is hardly surprising, therefore,
that older people felt as if those on modest incomes, seeing the
purchasing power of their tax relief decreasing, were effectively
subsidising a tax cut for the super-rich and for better-off pensioners.
One blatant unfairness arising from the Chancellor’s decision
was that while pensioners with annual incomes of less than
£25,000 saw their tax bills rise, those with incomes in excess
of £29,000 saw their tax relief increase by
£268.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000018">At
the time of the announcement, there had been much erroneous nonsense in
the media suggesting that older people had somehow escaped the effects
of the Government’s austerity measures and that they needed to
feel the pain just like everyone else. Think-tanks such as the
Intergenerational Foundation and the Nuffield Foundation were quick to
point out that older people were a burden on society’s finances,
and individual politicians from the Deputy Prime Minister to the shadow
Chancellor mentioned how universal benefits would have to be taken away
from Britain’s apparently greedy older
generation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000019">Since
2010, an argument has been put in some quarters suggesting that we can
no longer afford older people. No doubt that background noise had some
influence on the Chancellor’s decision in the 2012 Budget. The
revenue collected by the state from older people, however, whether
directly through a range of taxes or through costs that older people
bear that would otherwise be paid by the state, adds up to a staggering
£175.8 billion every year, compared with total expenditure on
older people through pensions, welfare payments and health care of
£136.2 billion. The overall net contribution by
pensioners to the economy is, therefore, almost £40 billion and
is estimated to rise to almost £75 billion by 2030. Most
importantly, that is more than enough to pay for the current range of
age-related benefits, as well as the personal tax allowances that we
are debating
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000020">We
have only to look at the voluntary and charitable sector to see how
older people are keeping many of its organisations going, and how
without them many of the networks of support that hold our communities
together would start to crumble. Not only that, but millions of working
families rely on the help of grandparents to provide unpaid child care,
enabling parents to go out to work. Through volunteering, caring and of
course paying taxes, Britain’s pensioners continue to give back
to the country, rather than simply taking from it, as some would have
us believe. As history often shows, however, an economic crisis can
provide the conditions in which sections of society are scapegoated and
blamed for the problems that we face. This time it appears to be
pensioners and the elderly who are being targeted as the source of our
economic woes, rather than the activities of a largely unregulated and
irresponsible finance industry and the feeble Government policies to
deal with
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000021">One
of the biggest problems with the debate over the freeze on age-related
tax allowances has been the myths that it has promoted. Following the
Chancellor’s Budget  
<?notus-xml column=200?>statement, the newspapers dubbed the freeze the “granny
tax”, although the truth is that around 60% of those affected
are men. It has been widely acknowledged that our poorest pensioners
tend to be women, many of whom do not even have enough income to pay
any tax at all. A lifetime of caring responsibilities, or of part-time
or low-paid work, means that many of them now struggle on less than
£10,500 a year. Even the inadequate minimum wage would give
people an income of over £12,800. Therefore, many older women
are among the 6 million pensioners in this country who do not pay tax
because they simply do not have enough money. To argue that they have
escaped austerity when they have been living in austerity for years is
outrageous nonsense. To suggest that someone on £15,000 is well
off and can afford to face an increase in their tax bill when older
people are facing many other financial pressures is either naive or
callous, or
both.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000022">The
inflationary impact on older people is higher than that which the
country as a whole is experiencing, largely because pensioners spend a
greater proportion of their limited income on things whose cost is
rising fastest, such as food, fuel and health. It is estimated that
average living costs for those over 75 have risen by 6.2%, which is
considerably higher than the official consumer prices index would
suggest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000023">The

sufficient dignity. The UK state pension remains among the least
adequate in Europe, with the risk of poverty among older people ranked
fourth of the 28 EU countries. Some 5.6 million older people have
savings of £10,000 or less. Nearly 2.5 million pensioner
households live in fuel poverty and spend more than 10% of their income
on fuel. That figure is rising. Almost a quarter of all
pensioners—24%—do not go out at least once a month; 41%
do not take a holiday away from home; 10% are unable to have their hair
cut regularly; 5 million older people consider the television to be

costs in their lives. They often spend more time at home and need more
heating in their homes, for example. Someone as far back as Winston
Churchill recognised that, which was why he initiated the idea of a
greater tax-free allowance for pensioners to help them with their
additional living costs. That is the case that I made in my

McKinnell:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend. The point that he and I
make is that the concern about the Government’s change is the
lack of notice that many pensioners have had of it. It has not been
introduced gradually to give pensioners a chance to readjust their
savings plans or earnings plans; they have not been given time to
adjust to the change. I will go on to say just what a shock it was to
many pensioners, and to the Office of Tax Simplification itself, when
the change came about, but it is worth reflecting first on the number
of pensioners affected.</hs_Para>

about 4.41 million people who are worse off in real terms, with an
average loss of £83. Those are the
Government’s own impact figures, but in addition <I>The Daily
Telegraph</I> has estimated that many people could be £479 worse
off as a consequence, or £511 if they are aged over 75. It could
cost a couple nearly £1,000. Those are not insignificant numbers
for pensioners who are watching their household bills rise month on
month. They are now watching their income diminish as a result of these
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000064">It
is also helpful to consider region by region the number of constituents
affected by the changes. Many MPs have been contacted by constituents
who are most aggrieved by the changes and, in particular, by the lack
of notice that they were given of them. We know from written answers
that the Minister was unable to identify exactly how many people would
be affected by the change in the age-related allowance—the
granny tax, as it has been dubbed, or indeed the
granddad tax, as my hon. Friend the Member for Luton North rightly
pointed out. However, Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs has been
able to produce figures for the number of people over 65
paying income tax by region. The House of Commons Library
sensibly suggested that that could be used as a proxy to estimate the
number of people in each region affected by the freeze, so we know that
170,000 of those affected live in the north-east, 480,000 in the
north-west, 340,000 in Yorkshire and Humber, 320,000 in the east
midlands, 370,000 in the west midlands, 450,000 in the east of England,
410,000 in London, 710,000 in the south-east, 460,000 in the
south-west, 240,000 in Wales, 370,000 in Scotland and 90,000 in
Northern Ireland. Those figures are something for everyone to consider
when we think about the number of constituents in our own areas who are
affected and the sheer volume of engaged voters up and down
the country who, as my hon. Friend pointed out, will not forget these
changes
quickly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000065">However,
the critical group of people whom we should be seriously concerned
about are those reaching their 65th birthday this year. I would be
grateful if the Minister could update us on whether the
Treasury has undertaken any research to try to understand the true
impact of the changes on that group, because it is a group of
approximately 360,000 people who will be roughly £322
a year worse off as a result of being excluded from the
age-related allowance. For that group, the incredibly short notice of
the change has been completely unacceptable. We are talking about

change their

McKinnell:</Member></B> We run the risk of digressing into a broader
debate on tax avoidance and taxation rates, and it would be an
injustice to the pensioners who are affected by the change in the
age-related allowances to allow that. However, I take on board both
points that were made in those interventions. My hon. Friend’s
was about the crucial measures the Government need to take to clamp
down on tax avoidance and evasion, close the tax gap and ensure that
all revenue due to the Exchequer is brought in. The Minister and I
regularly debate those issues. I also take on board what the hon.
Member for Suffolk Coastal said. I appreciate her point, 
<?notus-xml column=208?>but I dispute her analysis. She should look at the figures for the shift
in income that took place to forestall and then avoid the 50p tax rate,
and then at the bumper tax take as soon as the rate dropped to 45p;
those who are savvy, and in a position to do so, are able to take
advantage of the
reduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090913000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090913000079">Like
so many of the Government’s decisions, the change is completely
arbitrary. It is likely that this year somebody celebrated their 65th
birthday on 5 April, retaining their age-related allowance, while
somebody down the street born the very next day lost their allowance
and as a result will find themselves substantially worse off for the
remainder of their retirement. That was why the Opposition voted
against the measure in last year’s Finance Bill and tabled an
amendment calling on the Government to conduct a proper review of the
impact of the change on that group of people in particular and on
pensioners in general. Some people did not have the common sense or
ability to ensure that they were born before 5 April 1948, and as a
consequence of that total lack of foresight, they will be much worse
off for the remainder of their retirement. That is a deeply
unsatisfactory situation for the people who prompted the debate today,
on whose behalf we
speak.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-09?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_09_PT_1/23797FF38D2D468D9718BE0103968F39E8BA1B6E" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="9 September 2013">Monday

passion. I thank my hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr

her constituency, including my uncle Norman. Hon. Members have had the
opportunity to discuss these matters a number of times, as the hon.
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell) said. In
fact, we last debated the topic during proceedings on the Finance Act

position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000002">As
hon. Members are aware, a phased withdrawal of age-related allowances
was legislated for through the Finance Act 2012, meaning that there
would be no new recipients of such allowances from April 2013. The
existing age-related allowances have since been kept at their 2012-13
levels, meaning that we have frozen the age-related allowances at
£10,660 for individuals born before 6 April 1938 and
£10,500 for individuals born over the following 10 years. Once
the personal allowance aligns with those levels, there will be one
personal allowance for everyone. I appreciate that there is opposition
to the measure, but we believe that in the light of the other changes
we have made, particularly those that relate to the basic state
pension, those steps will help us achieve a fairer, simpler tax
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000003">The
Government’s first priority for income tax has always been to
increase the personal allowance, and the allowance has seen
above-inflation increases in every year since we came to office. Given
his earlier remarks, I am sure the hon. Member for Luton North supports
that. In this financial year, the allowance rose by
£1,305—the largest cash increase ever—and next
year it will continue to rise by a further £560. Those steps
mean that we will meet our target of increasing the personal allowance
to 
<?notus-xml column=209?>£10,000 a year early, taking the number of taxpayers who have
seen the benefit of our increases to 25 million. We remain committed to
ensuring that personal allowances are set high enough that pensioners
who are solely reliant on the basic state pension do not pay any tax.
As such, half the people over 65 will not have to pay any income tax at
all in this financial year.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Suffolk Coastal touched on simplification.
We want to make the tax system simpler and easier for people to
understand, and the changes to age-related allowances are an important
part of that. It is worth pointing out that we are not the only people
to conclude that such allowances add unnecessary complications to the
tax system. A 2009 report by the Public Accounts Committee
commented:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13090915000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000031">“The

complexities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000008">The
taper feature is one of the main sources of complication in age-related
allowances. It is worth setting out how it works, to demonstrate the
degree of complexity in age-related allowances. The taper removes an
individual’s age-related allowance where their income exceeds
the aged income limit,—£26,100 in 2013-14—at a
rate of £1 for every £2 over the limit. The
age-related allowance is reduced up to the point at which the income
tax allowance is exactly the same as the normal personal allowance.
That taper creates a 30% effective rate of tax for individuals on
modest incomes and, most importantly, brings hundreds of thousands of
people into the self-assessment system when, in many cases, they would
otherwise have no need to complete a tax
return.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000009">Our
changes to age-related allowances will remove such complexity and
confusion for older taxpayers. The simplification is not only of
benefit to taxpayers; a simpler tax system is also easier for the

gap, which I know the hon. Member for Luton North cares about
passionately.</hs_Para>

Gauke:</Member></B> If the right hon. Gentleman looks at the measures
in the 2012 Budget, he will see that the amount raised from the
wealthiest, in increased stamp duty on the most valuable properties and
the cap on reliefs used by the wealthiest to reduce their income tax
bills, raised far more money than the cost of reducing the 50p rate of
income tax—a rate that the evidence suggested was not raising
anything like the sums for which the previous Government hoped. There
is a good reason why the Government in which he served for many years
had a top rate of income tax of less than 50p: a top rate of 50p is not
a terribly effective way of raising revenue. We must place this in the
context of all the other measures that the Government are taking for
pensioners. The overall tax system remains favourable to them, and
there are measures that protect pensioner benefits, not least the
triple lock for the increases in the basic state
pension.</hs_Para>

the difficulties faced by many of those who rely on their savings to

that we have low interest rates. We acknowledge that that creates
difficulties, but the alternative—higher interest
rates—would have significantly damaged the economy over recent
years. Importantly, we have been able to bring in the triple lock,
which has enabled us to increase the state pension at a faster rate
than before and has included the largest-ever cash increase. That

is also worth re-emphasising that as a result of the decision to remove
age-related allowances no one will pay more tax than before. Other
factors, such as wage inflation and increases to the basic state
pension, may, of course, affect tax liabilities, but no one will pay
more tax from one year to the next because of the policy change alone.

someone aged 30 earning the same amount. A 69-year-old further up the
income scale, earning £26,000 a year, still pays only 56% of the
amount of tax and national insurance their working-age children pay.
Someone born before 6 April 1948 earning £26,000 would have
previously been eligible for age-related allowances but, following the
withdrawal of the allowance, they will still see their total tax and
national insurance bill reduced by 40% when they reach state pension

is only right that we do not consider the changes to age-related
allowances in isolation—I appreciate that I have made that point
a number of times already this afternoon. Only about 40% of pensioners
currently receive the age-related allowances but, by contrast, almost
every pensioner in the UK—more than 11 million
people—receives the basic state pension. Those 11 million
pensioners have already benefited significantly from our decision to
introduce the triple lock for the basic state pension, and they will

so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000022">Last
April, the basic state pension increased by the consumer prices index
inflation rate of 5.2%, which represented the largest-ever cash
increase in the basic state pension. This April, the triple lock
guaranteed an increase of a further 2.5%, which was larger than the
corresponding increases in inflation and average earnings. In contrast,
under the previous Government’s plans, the basic state pension
would have increased by only 2.8% last April and only 1.6%
in the current fiscal year. In addition, we must not overlook the other
benefits available to this age group, including winter fuel payments,
free bus passes and prescriptions, and free TV licences for those over
the age of 75. As I have said, the conclusion of the IFS is that
pensioners are the group least affected by the tax and benefit changes

Hopkins:</Member></B> I am pleased to have the opportunity to respond
to some of the points made in the debate. There is no getting away from
the fact that the changes are having a negative effect on the income of
quite large numbers of pensioners—about 4.4 million—at a
time when they are suffering from the effects of austerity in other
ways, with rising fuel prices being a particular
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000025">The
National Pensioners Convention’s point, which I mentioned in my
speech, is that all those problems could be overcome if there were a
substantial increase in the basic state pension. It is still among the
lowest in Europe. Some 12 or 14 years ago, it was the lowest in the
European Union—we were on about £90 a week for a single
person, while the Germans, the next lowest, were on £150 a week.
Other benefits that pensioners get add up to more than the basic state
pension, but a substantial increase in the basic state pension would
overcome many of the problems. That is not necessarily the policy of my
hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne North (Catherine
McKinnell) and our Front Benchers, but it is certainly my view and that
of the National Pensioners Convention, and I have put that case on
several
occasions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000026">Rolling
all the additions to the basic state pension that pensioners currently
get into a much bigger basic state pension would be the way forward.
The problem will get worse as time moves on, with the progressive
crumbling and demise of occupational schemes, particularly in the
private sector, which is now happening apace. A time will come when,
for survival in old age, pensioners will look more to the state than to
occupational schemes because, particularly in the private sector, such

view is that we must look not just to a much bigger basic state
pension, but on top of that to a state earnings-related scheme with
guaranteed returns at the end. With a large private pensions industry
it will not be an easy job, but that is the way forward. Once we start
to move in that direction, the problems we have discussed today will
begin to disappear. Many pensioners still live on incomes that are far
too low, and the Government’s measure has made many of those
incomes still lower. As politicians or as Governments in general, we
have a major job to do better by our pensioners for the longer
term.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090915000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/halltext/130909h0001.htm#13090915000028"><I>Question

claims referred to arbitration where the decision of the Motor
Insurers' Bureau (MIB) was overturned either because it rejected the
claimant's application in its entirety or where the applicant and MIB
cannot agree on the amount of an award. Claims often take some time to
settle, therefore the figures provided are from 2010, as most of these
will now be settled. In that year the MIB received 18,915 untraced
claims. Of those, 270 or 1.4% have been referred to an arbitrator and

decisions to move claimants to managed payments of rent are not
systematically reviewed. Under universal credit we will return
claimants to direct payment of rent once we are satisfied that they are
in a position to manage their affairs. We expect that managed payments
will remain in place at least until the outstanding arrears have been
recovered. How long managed payments remain in place beyond that will
depend upon individual circumstance but we expect most claimants would
not be switched back to direct payments for a further six

positive effect on youth unemployment for two reasons. First, taking a
contribution from those aged 21 to 24 who are on benefit but on whom
there is an expectation of work, increases the incentive to find a job;
not least because the householder now has a direct interest in the

Tyneside. Between 2009-10 and 2012-13 there were 165 sales of local
authority owned dwellings through the Right to Buy scheme in South
Tyneside. The annual figures show an increase in sales from 30 in
2011-12 to 85 in 2012-13 since the change in Right to Buy discounts in
April 2012, but there is more to do to inform tenants of their new
rights and help them up the ladder of home ownership. These figures do
not include other schemes such as Social Homebuy. Over the same time on

On its launch in 2005, one of the key objectives of the centre was to
focus on community engagement and working with community groups. Its
community engagement activity peaked in 2008-09 when the centre held
over 200 community events involving 20,000 people. Research undertaken
in 2011 found, however, that local awareness of the community work led
by the centre was low. More recently, local community engagement
activity has diminished as the workload of the centre has changed and
widened beyond the centre's catchment area. A number of community
groups were specifically invited to respond to a recent consultation on
the future of the centre and have not done so.</hs_Para>

Truss:</Member></B> The Department’s child care and early years
survey of parents provides national estimates of the amount families
pay for holiday child care. The latest survey shows no significant
change in this amount between 2010 and 2011. In 2011, the average daily
cost of holiday clubs was £18.75. Over the longer-term, child
care costs as a whole have increased significantly. “More
Affordable Childcare” sets out Government plans to increase the
amount of affordable child care.</hs_Para>

above figures do not account for the direct benefits to energy
consumers from these policies and the impact they have in helping to
offset costs. For example, the Government’s latest estimate of
the total impacts of energy and climate change policies (i.e. not just
those levied on energy suppliers) on energy prices and
bills<Sup>6</Sup> finds that in 2013 households are estimated on
average to save around 5% (or £65) on their energy bills
compared to what they would have paid in the absence of policies. This
is because the total monetary savings from policies which help
households save energy more than offset the necessary cost of investing
in new capacity and efficiency. By 2020 it is estimated that households
will save on average 11% (£166) on their energy bills compared
to what they would have paid in the absence of
policies.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13090944000015" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000015">Fracking</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13090944000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000127"><B><Member PimsId="3266" UID="13090944000278" xid="205" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000278">Paul

of the radioactive decay of the elements uranium and thorium. These
have existed since the earth was formed and are present in all rocks.
Virtually all rock types have been measured for their
naturally-occurring radioactivity and the results are published widely.
UK and world-wide experience suggest that the levels of
naturally-occurring radioactivity in drill cuttings would be so low
that they would not considered to be radioactive waste and assessment
of radium releases would be unnecessary.</hs_Para>

stated in Parliament in December 2012, that he was in principle
prepared to consent to new fracking proposals for shale gas, where all
other necessary permissions and consents were in place. He made that
statement having carefully reviewed the evidence with the aid of
independent experts, and with the aid of an authoritative review of the
scientific and engineering evidence on shale gas extraction conducted
by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Royal Society. Appropriate
controls are available to mitigate the risks of undesirable seismic

of agricultural land is assessed in a similar way to other assets.
DEFRA's policy statement on the appraisal of flood and erosion risk
management underlines the need to value agricultural land and the
damages that can occur as a result of flooding and erosion. Specific
guidance was provided by DEFRA in 2008 based on HM Treasury Green Book
appraisal principles. It takes account of the decoupled Single Payment
Scheme introduced in the UK from
2005.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090944000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000198">Grant
in aid is assessed according to the whole life economic, social and
environmental benefits of a scheme. Where these benefits include the
protection of agricultural land, grant in aid is calculated on the
basis of the economic damages avoided to the agricultural property over
the lifetime of the investment, valued in line with HM Treasury
guidance. The relevant rate at which these benefits attract grant in
aid is 5.56p per £1 of qualifying benefit, i.e. 1/18 of the
damages
avoided.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13090944000021" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000021">Fracking</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13090944000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000199"><B><Member PimsId="1818" UID="13090944000300" xid="394" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000300">Miss

including representatives of the betting industry, on a number of
occasions to discuss a range of matters. However the Health and Safety
Executive are responsible for policy relating to safety in the
workplace. Regardless, under the Gambling Act, local authorities have
powers to consider whether a betting shop's premises licence is
suitable in public protection terms, including for example, whether a
particular premises has an association with crime or disorder. If there
is evidence of crime associated with a betting shop, the licensing
authority can review the licence and, potentially, consider a number of
sanctions, such as restricting opening times, requiring security
measures, such as the installation of CCTV or the recruitment of
security staff, or even suspending the
licence.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="13090944000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000218"><B><Member PimsId="6002" UID="13090944000314" xid="1240" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130909/text/130909w0002.htm#13090944000314">Lucy

for the UK, worth more than £36 billion a year. We are working
hard with colleagues across Government and the sector to ensure this
remains the case, identifying barriers to growth for businesses in the
sector, and working to overcome these, in priority areas such as
accessing finance, ensuring people in the industry have the right
skills to compete successfully, and helping businesses in the sector
make the most of export opportunities and encouraging overseas firms to
invest in the UK. It is recognised by Government that PMSE services
play an increasingly important role across a number of creative
industries including television and radio production, theatre and other
