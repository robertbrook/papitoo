major sporting event taking place in England. It will showcase one of
the most beautiful parts of our countryside, but one issue of
controversy will not go away: the fact that there is no women’s
race as part of the Tour de France. The success of British women
cyclists makes that hard to understand, particularly at a time when we
are trying to encourage more women to get involved in sport. Will the
Minister join me in backing women cyclists and say to the
sport’s governing bodies, the owners of the Tour de France,
their sponsors and the media that this is an argument that has long
been lost and that they should come together to ensure that there is a
women’s part of the Tour de France in

Robertson:</Member></B> I find myself in complete agreement with my
opposite number. Of course, the slight complication with the Tour de
France is that it is run by a private organisation, not by the
international federation, and it therefore relies on sponsorship and
other things. There are a number of factors to sort out, but the
central point that the hon. Gentleman makes is absolutely
correct—this should be competed for by men and women
alike—and I will do everything I can to help.</hs_Para>

the area. She is right to raise the matter, because we are also doing a
great deal to tackle harmful material that is on the internet,
including on access by people who are under 18. The providers are

Cycling, one hears that huge numbers of people who are cycling are not

sports premium means that £150 million will go to every primary

That is far ahead of Labour’s plan, which was only to get to
superfast broadband by the end of 2017. It is also important to stress
that the NAO acknowledged that the in-life controls in local authority
contracts with BT were robust. We follow exactly the same procedure as
that used in Cornwall, where BT has gone from 80% to 95% coverage for

that employers and employees stay in touch during the period of
maternity leave can ease the return to work and make the process work
better for everybody involved. The “keeping in touch
days” that were introduced fairly recently—within the
last few years—as part of maternity leave have helped in that.
We are of course considering how that successful initiative can be
extended further through the shared parental leave that we are
introducing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090531000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0001.htm#13090531000157"><Member ContinuationText="Yvette Cooper" PimsId="2709" UID="13090531000427" xid="132" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0001.htm#13090531000427"><B>Yvette

the importance of supporting maternity leave for working women. We wish
her well. However, she will also be appalled by the figures that one in
seven women on maternity leave lose their job and half return to jobs
that are worse than those they left. Discrimination against someone
just because they are on maternity leave is obviously illegal, but the
Government have now decided that new mothers who want to take their
case to an employment tribunal will have to pay £1,200 to do so.
That is the equivalent of nine weeks’ maternity pay. Does she

points, and I thank her very much for her kind words. I agree that
maternity discrimination is unacceptable—of course, it is also
illegal. Any employer worth their salt would not dream of doing it, but
some will. It is important that we proceed on the basis of evidence. I
would be happy to look at the analysis I have requested from Slater and
Gordon, which I understand did some of that research, because it does
not necessarily tally with the figures that also exist which say that
84% of women return from maternity leave to the same job they had

understand the right hon. Lady’s concern on employment tribunal
fees, but it is important to see the whole picture. It is not the case
that most women who want to take up a case of maternity discrimination
will be forced to pay such a fee. The vast majority of cases can be
dealt with well outside the tribunal system. The Government’s
employment law reforms have encouraged more cases to be conciliated at

of part-time and full-time employment. One problem identified by, among

The Government are taking steps to help to improve the situation by
extending the right to request flexible working to everyone, which
should help to ensure that it becomes more of a cultural norm rather
than an anomaly purely for parents. I take his point and we will

I changed the leadership team in October 2012 and brought in the
brilliant Philip Langsdale, who had successfully delivered Heathrow
terminal 2. He was one of the great IT brains in the UK. He made it
very clear that the programme was deliverable, and that it 
<?notus-xml column=468?>needed to be reset so that it could be delivered on time and on budget.
When he sadly died, I went to my right hon. Friend the Minister for the
Cabinet Office and Paymaster General and asked for David
Pitchford—in the short term, while we looked for a
replacement—who headed the Major Projects Authority in January.
My right hon. Friend agreed to that, and the Cabinet Office helped us

Langsdale.</hs_Para>

the programme was deliverable on time and on budget. The important

like to remind the House that universal credit is not just succeeding
but progressing. It is progressing because we have already started to
roll out the pathfinders. I was in front of the Select Committee in
July, when I explained that those pathfinders were already teaching us
some important lessons. We are expanding those into six new jobcentres
and dealing with them. Also, from October, around 100 jobcentres a
month will begin using the claimant commitment with new jobseekers.
That commitment will act as a contract between the jobseeker and the
state. We are already seeing that this is driving people into work.
Universal credit is not just about IT. It is massively about cultural
change to get people back to work and to ensure that those who do go to
work, particularly the poorest, benefit the most.</hs_Para>

because of the shambles and the mess they were in. They lost huge sums

When Lord Freud, the Minister with responsibility for welfare reform,

workers is paid less than the living wage, a rise of nearly 1.5 million
in three years. We now know that the Government’s economic
policies have meant that people are £28 a week worse off than
they were in 2010, and for all but one month since the election prices
have risen faster than wages. It is not a recovery if it leaves
everyone but those at the top behind, and the public are not buying it
either. Polling shows that 70% of people believe that recent
improvements in the economy have not benefited middle and lower income
families, and 81% believe that politicians who say that household
incomes have grown faster than price rises are “out of
touch”. I could not have put it better myself. This is an
out-of-touch Government, complacent on living standards, building an
economy that works only for their rich millionaire friends. So

that is not surprising when with this Government money seems to buy

then got a massive tax cut, and then there was the tax cut for
millionaires. In spite of all this, I was still surprised to see Boris

The Leader of the House got a very rough ride, including from three
Select Committees and his own Back Benchers, for this rushed,
incompetently drafted and sinister mess of a Bill. He has already
tabled 23 amendments and there will be a lot more, I am sure, before we

transparency campaigners, who agree that it will make lobbying less

I made clear on Second Reading, we will look at some of the concerns
that have been raised, but I re-emphasise this point: many of the
representations that are being made are based on a complete
misunderstanding and a misrepresentation, which is that some change is
taking place in the definition of what constitutes expenditure for
electoral purposes, as distinct from campaigning on policies and
issues. Charities will continue to be able to campaign as vigorously as
they wish in putting forward their policies, and if any organisations
were to step over the line and try to secure the election of a party or
a candidate, that should be treated as election expenditure. That was
the case in the past and will be the case in future. If there is any
way we can make that even clearer, we will set out to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0001.htm#13090532000009">I

said they should have. Only yesterday we saw Paul Kenny of the GMB
clearly trying to push him off his proposals. If he wants to entrench
them, he should come forward next week—he still has time to do
so—and table amendments to the Bill so that that can be
legislated for and he can show his determination. If he does not do so,

hon. Lady asked about the urgent question earlier today, trying to
rerun points that I think my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State
dealt with very well. Let me say one thing, and I say it from personal
experience: he is doing absolutely the right thing to ensure that we
deliver the programme on universal credit. It is vital that we do so in
order to make work pay and to get the incentives in the welfare system
right, which the Labour party failed to do. Stepping into a programme
to make changes in order to deliver it on time and on budget is the
right thing to do, unlike what Labour did with the NHS IT programme,
which was to go into denial about all the problems. When my colleagues
and I came into office after the general election we found a broken
programme that we had to scrap, but in the process we saved over
£2 billion, which enabled my right hon. Friend the Secretary of
State for Health last week to 
<?notus-xml column=482?>announce a major programme for supporting hospitals and the NHS to
improve their technology themselves. That is what we should be doing;
we should have workable programmes, not top-down, broken ones.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Talking about the National Audit
Office, it has said that delivering the NHS reorganisation programme on

thereafter.</hs_Para>

know that the nature of the economic crisis we inherited, with the
economy having declined to a gross domestic product of 7.2%, meant that
the recovery was inevitably going to be long and difficult; we cannot
expect it to be easy. However, it is happening, and on a more
sustainable basis. My hon. Friend rightly points out that it is more
sustainable if growth is better dispersed around the country rather
than merely being based on financial services in the City of London,

we cannot expect Government spending simply to replace private
spending. Consumers, as a result of high levels of debt, have also been
retrenching. Our ability to invest and secure growth in the economy
therefore depends principally upon winning in the global race and

the House knows, this Government have embarked upon a process of
repairing the public finances, after years of reckless borrowing and
financial crisis under Labour. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor
explained at the spending review in June, we are making good progress,
but we must continue to take the tough decisions necessary. No area of
our spending has been immune from scrutiny. Our legal aid system is a
major part of my Department’s budget, and it is therefore
necessary that we look to make savings there, too. The Ministry of
Justice will see its budget reduced by nearly a third between 2010 and
2016. Our reforms would see the legal aid fund reduced by the same
order of magnitude. It is worth saying that we have one of the most
expensive legal aid systems in the world and that, by comparison with
similar jurisdictions elsewhere, we spend between two and three times
as much per head of population on legal aid. That is simply not
sustainable for the
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000073">The
House will remember that I set out our initial proposals to meet those
challenges in April. In doing so, I emphasised two important
objectives. The first was to ensure that we could live within our means
and still deliver a quality legal service to those who need legal aid.
The second was to guarantee access to justice by creating a firm
contractual framework for criminal legal aid. That would enable us to
ensure that we retain legal aid-funded legal support in all parts of
the country, provided by organisations that will be financially
sustainable in a tougher funding climate.</hs_Para>

publishing our initial proposals in April, we have undertaken intensive
negotiations with the Law Society, which represents legal aid
solicitors, who are the most affected by our proposals on criminal
legal aid contracting. I am pleased to tell the House that we have
reached agreement with the Law Society on a package of revised
proposals on criminal legal aid contracting, which we are publishing
for consultation today, and a copy has been deposited in the Library. I
would like to express my thanks to the Law Society team for the
constructive way in which they have approached a set of negotiations
that I believe have led to a good deal for this country.</hs_Para>

will mean that all those accused of a crime receive high quality legal
representation, that defendants are free to choose their lawyer,
whether they want a big firm, their local high street solicitor or a
particular specialist, and that all those who currently provide
criminal legal aid services can continue to do so, provided they meet
minimum quality standards. However, I have to ensure that every person
arrested and put in a police cell has access to a lawyer. In future,
therefore, duty slots will be allocated through a tight contracting
mechanism, based on quality and capacity to ensure that only firms or
groups of firms that demonstrate clearly that they have the financial
strength to operate in this new, tighter financial environment will
provide that guaranteed support in police
stations.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_05_PT_1/8C4E329B2ABB613AB01B600E4EAD5C1DA6FB1995" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 September 2013">Thursday

situation that this Government face means that fee reductions are
inevitable. However, I have agreed to phase these between early 2014
and the spring of 2015, in line with a new timetable for contracting,
so that firms have time to prepare and adjust. It is important to note
that these proposals will enable my Department to operate within our
spending review settlement, and therefore represent a long-term and
sustainable way forward for the Government and for the profession. This
is a good deal for the country and for the taxpayer. In addition, in
order to reduce financial pressures on legal aid lawyers, I plan to
make staged payments more readily available, to improve their cash
flows.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000077">In
order to meet our financial objectives for Crown court costs, I am
putting forward for consideration two options on advocacy fees. One
builds on the proposals we put forward in April, but sets a floor below
which fees cannot go, and recognises that there should be a different
fee for guilty pleas and trials. The other is based on a scheme put
forward in discussions between us and the Bar Council, and I am
grateful to the Bar Council for that proposal. It draws on the scheme
used by the Crown Prosecution Service. Both schemes represent a
sensible way to reduce fees, particularly for the highest earners, as
well as speeding up and simplifying the administration of the legal aid
system. We will be guided by the views of the profession and other
stakeholders in reaching a final decision on which scheme to
implement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000078">It
is also clear to me, particularly following the consultation that we
have carried out, that it is not simply legal aid funding arrangements
that determine the success and viability of the legal professions. I am
therefore taking a series of steps that will demonstrate that the
Government are serious about maintaining the legal profession in this
country as a world leader. We have to go further to ensure that the
criminal justice system is more efficient, so that cases do not demand
more time and resources than necessary, in terms of public money and of
the individual commitment by the lawyers involved. Alongside the
criminal justice action plan announced by the Minister for Policing and
Criminal Justice earlier this year, we are therefore putting together a
panel of criminal lawyers to look at the whole legal process, to
identify scope for improvements and to draw up proposals for reform. We
need to speed things up and to reduce work loads.</hs_Para>

clear that advocacy is facing an uncertain future, given the rise of
different routes into the profession, increasing supply but decreasing
demand, regulatory changes and financial challenges. I have therefore
asked Sir Bill Jeffrey to conduct an independent review of the future
of criminal advocacy in England and Wales. This review will be carried
out in partnership with the Law Society and the Bar Council.</hs_Para>

proposals in April also set out a number of other changes to legal aid,
in order to ensure public confidence in the system. I now plan to go
ahead with most of those, subject to a number of limited modifications
and exceptions. In particular, we will introduce a new residency test
that will prevent most people who have only just arrived in the UK from
accessing civil legal aid until a year after they arrive. We will limit
criminal legal aid for prisoners so that it is not available
unnecessarily. There will be no more legal aid available because
someone does not like their prison. We will also set out new rules 
<?notus-xml column=494?>that will mean that, in most cases, the wealthiest Crown court
defendants—those in households with more than £3,000 of
disposable income left each month after tax, housing costs and other
essential outgoings—will have to fund their own legal
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000081">When
I set out our initial plans in April, I was clear that they were for
consultation. I have kept that promise. I believe that what we have
agreed with the Law Society on criminal legal aid contracting is a
sensible revised proposal that is tough but realistic. I shall be
interested to hear whether the Opposition support the agreement. I do
not deny that some of the proposals will be challenging for many, but
in the context of unavoidable spending restraint, I have worked with
representatives from the solicitors’ profession and the Bar to
achieve the best outcome for everyone. I believe that it offers value
for the taxpayer, stability for the professions, and access to justice
for all. I commend this statement to the

current Lord Chancellor for giving me advance sight of his oral
statement just over an hour ago. However, I am still somewhat puzzled
as to why today’s edition of <I>The Times</I> was considered a
more important outlet for the public announcement of this climbdown
than the proper place for such an announcement, which is here in
Parliament. Can the media-shy Lord Chancellor explain that rather odd
decision to the

me reiterate Labour’s position. We support efforts to find
savings across our criminal justice system. We support making those who
can afford to pay their legal fees to do so and restricting legal aid
to those truly most in need. We also support using the frozen assets of
criminals to fund their legal costs, and we want a more efficient
system. We offered months ago to work with the Justice Secretary, but
he arrogantly refused, although I note that he has taken on board many
of our concerns, which we welcome, and adopted our idea of having a
review and asking experts to look at the legal processes to see whether
further positive reforms can be made. Will he please give the House
more details of this

statement provides confirmation that the Justice Secretary’s
plans—and they were his plans—really were half-baked,
legally illiterate nonsense. He has been forced to climb down, and the
sloppy way in which he goes about making policy has been exposed by

Secretary was warned—by us and others—that his plans
would see the destruction of a swathe of legal small and medium-sized
enterprises across the country, yet he denied that it would happen. He
was warned that the removal of client choice would undermine confidence

put pressure on the innocent to plead guilty; he refused to accept
that, either. Does he now agree with all those criticisms of his
original proposals?</hs_Para>

first time that the Justice Secretary has participated on a debate in
this Chamber on legal aid, so I have a number of further questions for
him. Will he 
<?notus-xml column=495?>confirm that the 16,000 representations that the Ministry of Justice
received about his plans is a record? I note, of course, that the
Justice Secretary has made a deal with the trade union for solicitors,
the Law Society, which we welcome. Does the Law Society fully accept
the plans he has published today? Does he still stand by his previous
public criticism of the barristers’ trade union, the Bar
Council? What discussions has he had with it about these plans? Will he
confirm that his latest plans still lead to a single fee for
magistrates courts’ work, regardless of whether the case is a
guilty plea or a trial? The right hon. Gentleman will be aware that
this could lead to a perverse incentive to persuade a defendant to
plead guilty when he or she is not guilty. Given that the Government
have changed their mind on this issue for Crown courts, why not for
magistrates courts,
too?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000087">The
Justice Secretary will be aware that small and medium-sized firms
undertaking legal aid work are already struggling to survive. There is
a real concern about their future viability after a 17.5% cut in their
fees. In that light, will the right hon. Gentleman tell us about the
impact assessments he has done on his latest plans? What will be their
impact on high street firms, on junior barristers, on black, Asian and

the right hon. Gentleman tell us what changes he has made to his plans
for civil legal aid and judicial review, bearing in mind the many
concerns raised across the House about them? He should now be aware
that his plans for civil legal aid would have prevented the Gurkhas and
the family of Jean Charles de Menezes from getting legal aid, while his
plans for judicial review would create a perverse incentive for lawyers
not to settle cases because they will need to get permission at a court
hearing to recover costs. How is he going to address those
concerns?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000089">I
am pleased that the Justice Secretary used his summer to swot up on the
law and the justice system. I am glad that the primer worked. I am
pleased that he appears finally to have seen sense and to have listened
to those who know better. We will study the new plans closely, and
consider the 270-page document published by him today. The public want
confidence that the rule of law is being preserved, that access to
justice is being maintained and that those truly guilty are being
prosecuted and punished after due process. The justice system needs to
be both credible and efficient. These are the tests we will continue to

rather difficult, because they agree that we have done the right thing.
It is clear to me that the days of beer and sandwiches are long gone,
because the Labour party has forgotten how a negotiation works. It
works like this: you put forward proposals, you listen to a
representation from the other side, you engage in a negotiation, and
you reach a settlement. That is what we have done, and this is a good
settlement for Britain. It enables us to meet our spending review
targets, which is what the country would expect. What the Opposition do
not like is the fact that we have done the right thing

right hon. Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) asked me about this
yesterday. I should point out that I took the unusual step of briefing
the Opposition on our plans 24 hours rather than one hour in advance,
because I recognised the importance of talking to the legal profession,
whose members are personally affected by this change. I have tried to
balance the interests of the House with those who are most personally

right hon. Gentleman referred to the concept of debates in the House. I
seem to remember his telling the House that he would use a Labour

know, our proposals were always about Crown courts. He asked about our
discussions with the Bar Council. I have had many meetings with the Bar
Council and the circuit leaders over the last few months. One of the
two options that we have presented today was suggested to me by the
circuit leaders and echoed by the Bar Council, namely the option of
replicating more closely the way in which the Crown Prosecution Service
works. I have received valuable support in relation to all this from
the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General, and I hope that those

The Law Society and I are clear about the fact that we expect these
changes to lead to amalgamations in the SME sector. Legal aid services
are currently delivered by 1,600 firms, many of which are very small.
We will continue to allow those firms to carry out their own client
work, but what is most important is that I provide access to
justice—to which the right hon. Gentleman referred—in
every part of the country. That requires me to be sure that I have
firms that are financially sustainable in every part of the country,

I have listened to the representations made to me by members of the

specialist situations—where people have been trafficked, where
there is a child aged under 12 months, and other similar
cases—and we have sought to identify cases where there are
individual special needs that need to be met. That is reflected in the

guarantee coverage around the country, but without some form of
contractual mechanism to ensure we secure the supply of duty legal aid
services at the very least, we will always risk the availability of a
law firm that does legal aid in a particular area being at the whim of
the market. I think that this set of compromise proposals will deliver
the certainty we need, and that it will do so in a way that is much

thank the Backbench Business Committee for granting us time for this
afternoon’s debate, which takes me back to my maiden speech in
this House, just over three years ago, in which I raised this very
issue. My reason was simple: I grew up in the south Wales valleys,
where doorstep lenders were as much a feature of the towns and villages
as the coal slagheaps from the mining industry. Although the valleys
have changed and are now green and beautiful again, one thing has not
changed—the loan shark, whether legal or illegal, is still a
regular visitor to the terraced streets of my
youth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000156">Despite
heavy campaigning by Members on both sides of the House, I still have
constituents trapped in the appalling cycle of debt. Indeed, in March
2012 I tabled a ten-minute rule Bill calling for the introduction of
legislation to tackle the problem of financial exclusion. Based on the
US Community Reinvestment Act, it called on banks to work with
community lenders in areas where the banks have only a limited
presence. It was my hope that such a development in fair finance would
that ensure financial exclusion did not continue to push families into
high-cost
credit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000157">My
Bill was formulated against a backdrop of the increasing market for
short-term loans. Just recently, Wonga announced that profits after tax
had risen by 36% to £62.5 million in 2012. Whether we like it or
not, people will always need money for an emergency—such as a
car repair or a new washing machine—and with many of the
mainstream lenders not even in the market it is the short-term loan
companies to which people will turn. To put it simply, we are not going
to abolish the sector. If we do that, we will do nothing but push money
lending underground. Families in communities such as mine might be
tempted to borrow from people who might offer unattainable terms and
conditions and many of those lenders might even resort to criminal
behaviour if money is not repaid to their satisfaction. That is not
what anyone would want to see.</hs_Para>

mean there is no room for improvement in the present market. At
present, payday loan companies are expanding into new markets and
target customers who previously would have borrowed money from friends
and relatives. Last month, a study by the housing charity Shelter Cymru
and the citizens advice bureaux in Wales warned that nearly half of
adults in my native Wales—some 48%—struggle to afford
rent or mortgage payments.</hs_Para>

mortgage or rent payers in Wales does not have any financial safety net
such as insurance or savings and 12% “struggle
constantly” to make ends meet. Citizens Advice in Wales says
that it has seen a 555% increase in the number of people asking for
advice about payday loans. Sadly, whether we like it or not, unlike the
future of households across Wales, which have experienced the second
biggest drop in earnings in the UK since 2010, the future of loan
sharks and payday lenders is more secure than ever.</hs_Para>

Archbishop of Canterbury’s announcement of plans to use the
weight of the Church to boost credit unions so that they provide a real

£36.3 million. My hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central

2011, the average amount owed on payday loans has increased by
£400 to £1,657. People now owe more than a whole

extremely innovative in using advertising and the internet to reach
people and we, as supporters of the credit union movement and community

consider other ways to reach the vulnerable people who see short-term
lenders as the only solution to their

I was granted the debate, a constituent wrote to me about the problems
he has faced with short-term lenders. When we met, he told me how
payday loan companies added a range of administrative charges, interest
and fees on top of initial loans. He borrowed in 
<?notus-xml column=508?>an attempt to pay back some of the money, but he fell further into debt
as he took out loan after loan. He borrowed £400 from Wonga, but
now must pay back £739. If he cannot afford the initial
£400, how is he to afford £739? Where is the logic in
that? It baffles me that payday loan companies seem to think that if
someone is unable to pay back a loan, the answer is to take out another
one. With Wonga breathing down his neck, he was forced to borrow
£100 from QuickQuid, but now he owes that company
£201.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000167">My
constituent told me that at no stage when taking out the initial loan
was he asked about his income or expenditure, which bears out the
findings of the Office of Fair Trading’s compliance review that
only six of the largest 50 firms in the market made any attempt
whatsoever to carry out proper income checks. That is simply not good
enough. Had I not carried out such checks when I worked at Lloyds TSB,
I would have faced disciplinary action—and rightly so—but
such companies continue to follow those discredited
practices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000168">The
Office of Fair Trading also found that 75% of payday lenders renewed
loans without checking whether they would be affordable, despite the
fact that rolling over loans is a strong indicator that the borrower
cannot pay back the money. It is especially worrying that each time
someone fails to pay back a loan and takes out another one, they are
committed to paying not only the interest on the initial loan, but
admin fees and hidden charges on the new
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000169">My
constituent was the victim of the culture of multiple loans, but he is
not the only one. Some 30% of the people who contact StepChange Debt
Charity for urgent help hold four or more loans. Parts of the industry
are getting people into a vicious cycle of borrowing from one creditor
to pay another. UK borrowers can end up paying back 74% of their
initial loan in charges and administration fees on top of the money
they borrowed. That figure is capped at 7% in Canada, meaning that the
maximum payable in default interest and charges for a £300 loan
is just £25. That practice needs further study in the UK. The
consumer group Which? has called on the Financial Conduct Authority to
replicate existing rules for mortgages and other credit products to
help borrowers struggling with repayments. There is already a cap on
default charges and fees in the credit card and mortgage markets, and
we must consider extending such a cap to credit
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000170">I
have further examples of how payday loans mean just piling on the debt.
A payday loan company issued a man with a claim for £1,830 in
penalty charges that were incurred for defaults on a loan of just
£120. Each time the company went to his bank and was
unsuccessful in recovering the money, it cost him £5, and the
company made 330 attempts to get back the money. On top of that, the
lenders added £178 of interest. It would be farcical if it was
not true, but for many people in communities such as Islwyn, that is a
sad fact of life each and every day. A Which? survey found that one in
five users of payday loans were hit by unexpected charges and that, in
the past 12 months, more than half of payday loan users had incurred
charges because of missed or bounced
payments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000171">We
need to accept that borrowing from a payday lender is not like
borrowing from a bank. When I worked in a bank, I would meet someone to
discuss their needs. We would look at their income and expenditure, 
<?notus-xml column=509?>and talk about the affordability of loan and why they needed it, but
even if the customer credit scored for a loan, I would still have no
hesitation in saying no. However, with payday loans, because of the
internet and fast access through iPhone technology, there is no one at
the end of the line to say no, and what worries is that a person taking
out such a loan may have the money in their bank account within 10
minutes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090532000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090532000172">For
many, payday loans are a last resort. Many of the people I talk to have
basic bank accounts that do not credit score for financial products.
They have never got into mainstream banking, principally because they
have seldom come across a bank in their lives. They see walking into a
bank as a scary experience, so when they find themselves in dire
straits and see the friendly advertising of Maud and Errol and the
granny puppets from Wonga, or Amigo Loans, they think that there is a
friendly place to go and they pick up the phone—they find it so
easy. I therefore welcome the Government’s actions to
investigate the effects of advertising and the year-long study of the
market. I also look forward to the Financial Conduct Authority
formulating a strategy in the autumn. However, I and others who have
campaigned on the matter find the speed of implementing such measures

huge budgets to advertising, which I talked about in response to the

Doyle-Price</B> (Thurrock) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans), who has given an
excellent introduction to the debate. I pay tribute to colleagues on
both sides of the House who have done so much to shine a light on some
of the more irresponsible practices that have sadly become all too
commonplace in this industry.</hs_Para>

today will focus on what I think we would all agree has been a
regulatory failure in this section of the market, and I want to refer
to a Public Accounts Committee report which some hon. Members present
today were involved in producing. We looked at the regulation of
consumer credit earlier this year, and we reached the firm conclusion
that the Office of Fair Trading had been found wanting in getting to
grips with tackling some of the more unpleasant practices of high-cost
lenders. The message that I would like Parliament to send out today is
that we are now at a crossroads with the regulation of this sector. The
Financial Conduct Authority is preparing to take responsibility for it
from the OFT, and bearing in mind that the OFT has been so slow in
getting to grips with this, I want us to send a clear signal that we
all expect the FCA fully to use the regulatory tools at its disposal
really to give the sector challenge, and to be fleet of foot in
intervening where we see poor
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000003">The
OFT has had a number of tools that it has failed to use, and there are
clear breaches of rules. There are powers under the unfair contract
terms regulations that could easily have been used to tackle some of
the more unacceptable levels of fees and penalties for default, which
are probably the most acute cause of additional cost to anyone who
takes out these loans. Equally, every credit provider is required to
follow responsible lending rules. As the hon. Member for Islwyn
outlined in some of his examples, the advancing of credit to people in
such situations was far from responsible lending. The OFT has the power
to withdraw credit licences, but it has failed to use it, resulting in
irresponsible lenders and unscrupulous companies exploiting the
vulnerable and  
<?notus-xml column=512?>laughing all the way to huge profits. That is not acceptable, so
Parliament needs to give a clear signal about what we expect the FCA to
do in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000004">Much
of the debate in the past has focused on how we control some of the
costs. As I have said, I believe that the unfair contract terms
regulations give regulators the power to intervene to control some of
them. However, we have a real problem with the consumer credit
directive, which has prescriptive rules about how firms advertise costs
of credit with reference to APRs. The reality is that APRs are
meaningless in this sector, because we are talking about loans that are
advanced for a short period. The real issues are how much the credit
will cost and the transparency of additional charges. I have seen one
example of a payday lender who charged £25 for each reminder
letter sent when a customer defaulted. That would not be caught by any
regulation regarding APRs. It is an unfair contract term and a clear
exploitation. The powers exist to control such activities. The PAC
stated explicitly that we wanted the misleading APR rules to be ditched
and replaced with clear guidance on and responsibility for publishing
the cost of credit in amounts repayable in
cash.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000005">I
also associate myself with the hon. Gentleman’s comments on
credit unions. As we all readily understand, the only reason customers
access credit in this way is because they cannot get it from anywhere
else. Unfortunately, mainstream lenders are not interested in providing
small loans for short periods. However, we have to be careful about
prescribing additional regulation for the sector, because if people
cannot get credit from it they will go elsewhere and that will send
them into the hands of some very unscrupulous
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000006"><Member ContinuationText="Stella Creasy" PimsId="5611" UID="13090533000182" xid="1175" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000182"><B>Stella

Doyle-Price:</Member></B> The reality is that people will follow
regulation if it is economical to do so, otherwise they will go
elsewhere. My evidence is that people are accessing these loans in the
first place. We have a failure in the market to extend affordable
credit, and that is  the issue that we are trying to tackle
today. I remind the hon. Lady of what was said earlier. The rules and
the tools are already in place, but the regulator has failed to use
them. This is not about more burdensome regulation; it is about
regulators being prepared to use their teeth and the tools that they
have to do the
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000008"><Member ContinuationText="Meg Hillier" PimsId="4739" UID="13090533000184" xid="845" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000184"><B>Meg

Further to that intervention, the hon. Lady may remember that the PAC
heard evidence from Fair Finance, which explained that if the interest
rate was capped, as a social enterprise it would have to lend a higher
amount to individuals, so risking greater indebtedness. So we have to
get the balance right to make sure that people without a credit record
get the loan that they need but are not
over-indebted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jackie Doyle-Price" PimsId="5689" UID="13090533000185" xid="1152" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000185">Jackie
Doyle-Price:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is quite right. The cost of
extending small amounts of credit is higher, pound for pound. We have
to be sufficiently grown-up to realise that when we are considering
regulation. I 
<?notus-xml column=513?>have not yet come across one consumer organisation that is in favour of
caps. They all recognise that there is a market failure and a need to
clean up the industry, but caps are not their preferred tool. However,
there are some measures that they would like to see. The first is a ban
on excessive default fees and charges. Again, this is not the preserve
of the payday lenders. Unauthorised overdraft users also experience
punitive charges, which again illustrates that these are issues that
extend throughout the credit market, which the regulators need to grips
with. In fact, Which? has found that unauthorised overdraft users
suffer more from excessive charges than payday loan users: more than
20% of overdraft users are surprised by the level of charges they face.
Again, we need to look at using the regulatory tools available. The
FCA’s requirement will be that any institution has to treat its
customers fairly, and that would extend to not having excessive
charges. The regulatory power is there; it just needs to have the guts
to use
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000010">Secondly,
the FCA must give a clear signal that it really will implement the
rules on irresponsible lending. We have seen that 48% of payday loan
users and 44% of unauthorised overdraft users have taken out credit
that it turned out they could not afford. It is clearly irresponsible
lending for any firm to continue extending credit with roll-over loans
or to let an overdraft get ever worse. It must be clear to lenders that
they will face penalties from the regulator if they continue to exploit
vulnerable consumers.</hs_Para>

all need to think about what more we can do to support effective debt
management and encourage people to take appropriate advice, because
when people are that desperate the only place they can go is to those
lenders. We need to make it much easier for them to access advice that
will help them, so that they do not get into a worse
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000012">There
also needs to be a clear sign to lenders that they must give clearer
information on what the consequences will be if people default. We know
that many consumers are over-optimistic about their ability to pay off
credit on time and in full, so clear warnings are needed about what the
consequences will be if they do not. Those warnings need to be given in
a simple and clear way, such as by stating the amount of cash it will
cost per £100 if the loan is not paid on time, so that people
really understand the deal they are getting into. Again, that 
is consistent with the Public Accounts Committee’s
recommendation. Even mortgage statements, and indeed any credit, should
come with clear health warnings explaining the consequences of missed
payments. All costs must be
transparent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000013">I
believe that those measures would greatly strengthen the protections
for consumers. That is what we really need to focus on today. I agree
that we must look at what more we can do to support credit unions. I
think that employers have a big role to play, because we know that many
payday loan customers are in jobs. If employers can be encouraged to
have relationships with their local credit union, that would be a good
way of signposting people to more reputable lenders. We need to use the
tools we already have for the job: tough rules on responsible lending,
tough action on default charges and much more regulatory
activism.</hs_Para>

the hon. Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price), because I genuinely
believe that there is now a clear divide between the political parties
on how best to approach something that we all agree is a problem. I am

payday lending causes and recognise that there is a problem with the

are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000015">It
will come as no surprise to the hon. Lady that my perspective on how to
deal with the incentives in the market is very different from hers. In

about those challenges, we must remember that in the past three years
we have seen a tenfold increase in the number of people going to a
citizens advice bureau for whom debt involving payday lending is a
problem. When I started campaigning on this issue, along with many
colleagues, we were looking at 1 million people borrowing in that way,
but the figure is now 5 million, and 20 million people in
this country are desperately worried about their debt picture, with the
cost of living continuing to rise. We know that people need access to
credit and that these loans are causing problems with gaining that
access. I absolutely accept that not everybody who borrows from a
payday lender gets into financial difficulty, but enough of them do, as
a result of the terms of the loans and how the market works, that it is
right for Parliament to intervene and to try to learn from the
experience of other countries about what works in tackling that kind of
credit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000017">In
this industry people do not make money by lending at a high rate of
return; volume is what matters. If lenders can lend to people in a way
that makes them more likely to keep coming back to borrow more, because
the following month they are a little short again, and the month after
that, that is when they make their profit. Indeed, market analysts have
pointed out that 50% of the revenues of those companies come from just
a small number of their customer base, their repeat borrowers. Indeed,
one company operating in the UK makes 23% of its profits from just
34,000 people. Who are those 34,000 people? They are the people who are
constantly indebted because every month they have to borrow, because
borrowing from those companies means that they are more likely to
borrow the following month.</hs_Para>

spiralling principle that we have to tackle. When we look at that
principle, we must ask what incentive it creates for the market and how
the companies make their money. The OFT research shows something that
many of us have been warning about: debt is positive in this industry.
If a company can get people in a situation in which they have to keep
rolling over their loans and borrowing from them, that is how they make
their profit. That is why we are seeing Wonga making  £1
million a month more in this country. It is not just Wonga; there are
now four companies in the UK making over £100 million a year by
working in that way, pushing people into debt, constantly extending
their loans and pushing them with their marketing and
advertising.  
<?notus-xml column=515?>They know that because those people have borrowed from them once, they
will probably need to borrow from them again, because that is the way
in which the loans are
constructed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000019">Some
people borrow £300 but end up owing £811 in interest
alone by the end of the year because they get caught in that spiral and
because of the price of the credit. That means that the average payday
lending customer, who earns £18,000 a year, would pay 6% of
their entire annual income to pay off a £300 loan. It is little
wonder that the OFT research shows that few of those companies are
doing affordability checks, because affordability does not matter once
they have people hooked. It means that they can always get some money
from
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000020">Who

father who came to see me. He has tried to tell Kwik Quid multiple
times that his son has mental health issues and asked it to please to
stop lending to him because he cannot afford to keep paying the

charge them to set the limits. It makes no sense. That is why we have

changed behaviour. Yet those countries still have payday lending

Conduct Authority takes over in April next year. It is hampered by the
fact that it needs to see the evidence about the UK credit market. It
needs the credit reference data and other evidence from the companies,
all of which claim that they are responsible lenders, yet about all of
which we have heard stories of bad conduct. Indeed, Citizens Advice has
shown that some are not even following 10 of the 12 good practice
codes. If we are really serious about resolving the problems in this
market, let us ask the FCA to do its job but also give it the data so
that it can do so from the get-go in April. We should tell the
companies to give it the data about their credit market, their profit
ratios and how they are operating so that we can see how and where a
cap would influence the UK credit market from April next year. Let us

is a non-starter in that context. Those debts are racking up because of
these kinds of practices. We could help them to manage the cost of
living, to manage their borrowing and to make ends meet if we do our
job today and get the regulator the information that it needs so that
it can make the choice about what kind of cap would work in the UK. I
think that the Japanese model is the way forward, because it has been
done in practice along with the industry and consumer groups. Let us
not have another three years of talking about how terrible these

the impassioned speech by the hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella
Creasy). I congratulate the Backbench Business Committee and the hon.
Member for Islwyn (Chris Evans) on securing this very important debate.
He took a sensible and non-partisan approach, and I appreciate that.
There is cross-party consensus on the mood for taking action on payday
lenders. Many Members from all parties came to this Chamber to support
the private Member’s Bill on the subject introduced by the hon.
Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield)—I would call him
my hon. Friend—which I still hope can make some progress in
forming Government
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000031">Other
Members have mentioned constituency cases. I have recently been
particularly moved by a couple of cases in my own constituency. In one,
someone had six separate loans from payday lenders, which clearly
cannot be justified on the basis of seeing them through until payday,
and they were being absolutely crippled by the interest. In another, a
pensioner living on the basic pension got thousands of pounds in debt
to payday lenders—a clear sign that some of these businesses are
not looking at the affordability criteria. It is right that we should
express our concern about such cases.</hs_Para>

am sorry that the Bill did not get voted on on Second Reading; a number
of us were here to support it. In responding, the Minister expressed
some understandable concerns on the part of the Government, which were
shared by the previous Government, as regards not wanting to tie the
hands of regulators. However, this House has been clear in its desire
that regulators consider caps. It is very important that we give
guidance to regulators about what we expect them to do. The Government
are right to have launched investigations into the impact of
advertising in the sector, but many of us are a little frustrated by
the pace of action on that front and would like more to be done. The
hon. Member for Islwyn made some good points about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000033">We
have to acknowledge that high-cost lending goes much wider than the
payday loan industry. It also covers doorstep lenders and credit cards
where they are not used appropriately; people can build up enormous
amounts of high-cost debt through that sector. As the hon. Gentleman
pointed out, there is also a large informal sector that we should be
wary of encouraging or supporting. Many Members have noted that when
banks generate overdraft charges they can raise the cost of borrowing
to exceptionally high levels. His comment about moving people into
mainstream banking was absolutely right, but we need to find tools to
do that which protect them from such charges. In a recent discussion
with Six Towns credit union, I was interested in a ring-fenced bank
account that it was considering launching which would allow people, in
effect, to set aside rent and energy bill payments and then only access
money to  
<?notus-xml column=518?>spend on other things. Innovative financial products like that can help
to move people towards mainstream
finance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000034">We
need to look at the overall level of debt. Any debt is high-cost if it
is unaffordable. We still need to do more work on deleveraging the
economy as a whole. Some progress has already been made on that front.
It would be wrong for anyone to pretend that overall debt problems are
greater now than they were in 2008, at the height of the boom. Credit
Action produces monthly reports that show a significant decline. In
July 2013, overall unsecured debt was £158 billion. That sounds
an awful lot, but in 2008 it was £231 billion. In the 1980s,
during the boom years under Lawson, household debt as a percentage of
income rose from 70% to 80%. During the period when the right hon.
Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) was Chancellor and
Prime Minister, it rose from 80% to 170%. It is now falling back to
145%, but that is still too high. There is significant progress to be
made on the level of debt as well as its
quality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000035">On
quality, we need tools to help people to access the better lenders and
to ensure that customers are well informed on the real costs. As many
Members have said, percentage rates do not tell the whole story: hidden
costs and charges are important. We should pay tribute to the many
financial advice services that work in the voluntary sector and the
state sector to try to provide that information, including Citizens
Advice, which we all know well in our constituencies. I am delighted
that the Archbishop of Canterbury has entered this debate and offered
support to the credit union movement and the voluntary sector in taking
on the loan sharks. The Church can play a very important role in this,
as Christians Against Poverty and many other religious groups already
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000036"><Member ContinuationText="Ian Swales" PimsId="5649" UID="13090533000190" xid="1133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000190"><B>Ian
Swales</B> (Redcar) (LD):</Member> The hon. Gentleman is making a very

understand
percentages?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000037"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robin Walker" PimsId="5656" UID="13090533000191" xid="1178" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000191">Mr
Walker:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The work that
my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) has done
on financial education will be crucial in getting people to understand
the reality of what taking out a loan means and all the potential
hidden costs, including the real cost of interest over whatever period
it is charged, which is often far more directly important than levels
of APR.</hs_Para>

absolutely clear that financial education will be key. It is a huge
victory for my hon. Friend and his cross-party campaign to have secured
financial education in the national curriculum, but that is only the
start. We should not kid ourselves that writing something into the
national curriculum will solve the problem. We will have to make sure
that it is taught well and that a generation of teachers who came

Government are doing a lot to support credit unions, as did the
previous Government, but there is still much further to go to catch up
with the levels of credit union engagement in other countries.
Achieving that should be a constant challenge. Tragically, in
Worcestershire we lost our local credit union, not necessarily because
it did not have support but, unfortunately, due to bad lending.
Capacity in credit unions is another vital aspect. I am very glad that

need an incentive to support the growth of credit unions and
responsible lenders. As I argued when we debated the Bill, I think it
would be wrong for the Government directly to subsidise the credit
union industry, because that would undermine its business model when we
want such businesses to be able to stand on their own two feet. I
suggest that we should go further than even the CAB argues in its
briefing paper, which welcomes the extension of the Money Advice
Service levy to payday lenders, and consider putting a higher levy on
high-cost lenders. We should create an incentive for people to go to
credit unions, and the higher levy would create a fund to support
financial advice services, financial education and all the other good
things that can help people. Yes, we should support the credit unions,
but we should do so indirectly by giving them that competitive
advantage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000042">There
is a straightforward way to do that. The Government have set a cap on
lending for credit unions. If we start the levy at the top of that cap
and apply it to all lending over that amount, it could create a
valuable revenue stream to support the free financial advice industry
and the financial education industry. I urge the Government to look
again at the provisions in the Bill and to examine what they can take
from it, because it made some well-thought-through
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000043">I

Fovargue</B> (Makerfield) (Lab):</Member> It is indisputable that
everybody needs access to credit, but it has always seemed perverse to
me that the people who can least afford it pay the most and therefore

loans are not always the illogical choice, despite the rate of
interest. If someone’s washing machine breaks with two weeks to
go until their payday and they know they will have an overtime payment
in their next pay packet, it makes sense for them to shop around and
buy another washer for £200 with a short-term loan—at 
<?notus-xml column=520?>a total cost of £267—than to go to BrightHouse, pay
£600 for the same product, have a mandatory five-year guarantee
for £400 and pay it back over five years at about 30% interest,
which would result in a total cost of about £1,500.
But—and it is a big but—although such loans provide a
service, they cause detriment to tens of thousands of people each year
and their providers have been, and still are, guilty of bad practices
that cause much
concern.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000046">The
Office of Fair Trading report highlighted bad practice by the vast
majority of the industry and warned a number of them that either they
clean up their act voluntarily or action would be taken, and they have
been referred to the Competition Commission. I am pleased that some
have had their licences revoked, but I hope that stricter enforcement
will continue until the Financial Conduct Authority takes over in 2014.
That transfer of responsibility gives us a golden opportunity to clean
up the market and protect vulnerable consumers, but what are the payday
lenders suggesting? A voluntary code of conduct devised by the
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000047">There
are two things wrong with that. First, it is voluntary. It is not even
a requirement to be a member of a trade body. If consumers do not even
research the cost of paying back a loan, they certainly do not research
whether their lender is a member of a trade body—that is if they
are aware of who the lender is, a point I will return to later.
Secondly, the code has been devised by the industry and I am not
totally convinced that it will put protection before profit. Statutory
regulation and a constant review of the market are absolutely
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000048">I
will outline the main issues that I think are causing problems. The
market is ever changing and new practices emerge almost daily, so we
need a flexible regulator. The first and most important issue—it
is probably more important than headline-grabbing high interest
rates—is the continuous payment authority. People who do not
know what this is are not alone, because the banks, let alone the
consumers, do not know, either. What it means is that the loan company
can access someone’s bank account at any time, for any amount of
money, as many times as it wishes. It is not just a blank cheque; it is
a continuing, unending number of blank cheques. A constituent of mine
had her account debited four times just before Christmas. Her account
was cleared completely, leaving her with no money for Christmas, and
she only became aware of this when she tried to pay for her Christmas
food shopping and could not. It is clear in all the guidance that the
customer should be able to cancel the CPA with either the lender or the
bank, but Citizens Advice has numerous examples of the banks telling
people that it cannot be cancelled by the customer because it is
different from a standing order, and of the lender preventing people
from
cancelling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000049">Another
practice I have recently become aware of—I am looking into this
at the moment, because I heard about it only two days ago—is
that of companies asking for a borrower’s online bank account
details, including their PIN number and password, which makes the
matter even more problematic. The lender can see when the individual is
paid and when the rent and bills go out and take advantage of the gap,
plunging the borrower into even more serious
debt.</hs_Para>  
<?notus-xml column=521?><hs_Para UID="13090533000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000050">The other
major problem with the continuous payment authority is that it reduces
the incentive to perform a thorough and proper affordability check.
After all, if a lender has unlimited access to someone’s bank
account, why bother too much about checking whether they can afford it?
The lender can dip into their bank account at any time, for any amount.
Continuous payment authority has been described to me as the one thing
that the payday lenders really want to keep. On that basis—as I
used to say when disciplining my daughter—it is probably the one
thing they should not
have.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000051">There
is an issue with the industry writing its own code. Wonga has given 10

of the principal under commitments 6 and 7 of the code, the total
repayment amount for a loan of £200 would be
£588. That is a cause for

the friend might have to repay all the loan and end up with a damaged

happens. New products are emerging all the time—often they are

I welcome the debate secured by the hon. Member for Islwyn (Chris
Evans), who made an excellent speech. We have also heard pragmatic
speeches from my hon. Friends the Members for Thurrock (Jackie

lending is controversial. There are many who think that the Government
should regulate it out of existence. Ultimately, we need to understand
how the payday lending industry has evolved and how that has been led
by consumers. It exists because people wanted access to small amounts
of money for a short period of time, not long-term loans for short-term
problems, as was offered by the traditional banking system. A Consumer
Finance Association report showed that younger people like the
convenience of online interaction and the quick decisions that payday
lenders offer in contrast to the relatively formal bureaucracy of
putting on a suit, going to a bank and justifying oneself. Banks have
been unwilling to lend to people whom they consider to be
high-risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000065">All
the speeches today will understandably press for action to protect the
consumer—I will list a ream of things that should be
done—but such action must be taken with consideration. Anything
less and we will simply push vulnerable consumers into the hands of the

<?notus-xml column=523?>black market and illegal loan sharks. We have to look at why the market
is not working in the interests of consumers and seek to change
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000066">There
is a growing consensus that many of our consumer markets do not always
work in the interests of consumers. Be it Government interventions to
regulate pricing in the energy industry or scandals such as payment
protection insurance, there are signs everywhere that the consumer is
often at the mercy of markets, rather than at the heart of them. As a
recent working paper by my hon. Friend the Member for South Thanet
(Laura Sandys)
commented:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13090533000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000160">“Good

choice”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13090533000067" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000067">That
point is key, especially given the vulnerable nature of the consumers.
In this industry more than most, consumers need to be in the driving
seat, because for many people, the consequences of bad market
characteristics in payday lending are
severe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000068">There
is a fundamental asymmetry in the information within the payday lending
market. That is at the root of why the market does not work in the
consumer’s interest. The market distorts decision making so that
rather than making an informed decision based on price, the consumer is
led into favouring other factors above all others in making their
decision. Of those factors, convenience is the most prominent. Although
convenience is important and of benefit to consumers, it is problematic
when it becomes the primary basis of competition in the market as it
itself conveys no price information. Without clear price information,
consumers are unable to appreciate relative value in order to make
informed and savvy financial
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000069">As
we have heard, an investigation of the 50 main payday lenders by the
OFT found that 60% of them emphasise speed and quick access to money in
their advertising. The cost of the loan is at best a second thought and
is often presented in a muddled way through the use of misleading and
confusing APR figures. In short, without price information, competition
is undermined. That leads to reduced choice. Consumers are led into
making a decision based primarily on convenience. For the market to
work in their best interest, it needs to enable consumers to make a
decision in which price is the key consideration. Convenience should be
only a secondary
factor.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000070">I
have a number of recommendations. We are coming up with quite a
shopping list for the Minister. The Government should intervene to
improve the information that is available in the market—most
notably the pricing information—to encourage price competition.
With better information and clearer competition, the supply-side
control will weaken, allowing consumers to call the shots. That
intervention should take three main directions, forming a tripartite
approach to the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000071">First,
we must reform the information structures. We all agree that the cost
of loans should be displayed in cash terms. APR is confusing, even with
financial education in the national curriculum. I thank all Members who
supported the cross-party campaign that I led on that issue. Let us be
frank: even Treasury Ministers would struggle to work out the cost of
an APR rate. It is an incredibly complex calculation. The Government
should consult on and implement a standard unit for lenders to 
<?notus-xml column=524?>allow for price comparison, such as the cost per pound that is borrowed
per day. Greater minds than mine can work that
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000072">We
should also have real-time credit checking. We all agree that people
should be able to borrow only what they can afford. The horror stories
of people taking out multiple payday loans are totally unacceptable.
Part of the solution is real-time credit checking. The system is not
quite there yet. Perhaps we should place a levy on the industry to get
it in place. It is then crucial that the FCA enforces
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000073">Secondly,
we need to improve access to information. I have mentioned financial
education, which will put the next generation of consumers in a better
position to make informed and savvy financial decisions. We also need
access to independent debt advice and advice on whether products are
right for people. Just as we have health warnings about smoking, when
people attempt to take out one of these products, there should be a
telephone number or a website that is advertised. Before Citizens
Advice is snowed under with millions of calls, I say again that there
should be a levy on the industry to pay for free, independent advice
for consumers who are not equipped to make informed
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000074">Thirdly,
we must complete the information circle. We should look to restore
credit ratings. Consumers often choose high-cost credit because the
traditional banking system does not wish to lend to them. People might
choose payday lending, which is an expensive form of borrowing, because
it is the only option. However, when they manage to repay the loan,
they should have their credit rating repaired and should be allowed
back into the
mainstream.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000075">We
need to give the regulator teeth and ensure that it uses them. My hon.
Friend the Member for Thurrock made some important points in that
regard. It is clear that the regulator has often stood by when it could
have become involved. We need the regulator to take a proactive
approach. I have been very critical of doorstep
lenders—something that was mentioned by the hon. Member for
Islwyn. Such lenders may have good customer satisfaction ratings, but
when people sell on a commission basis, there is always the potential
for problems. We have seen that even in the traditional banking system
with insurance products. Often, the consumers of such products are the
least well equipped to make complicated complaints and to bring matters
to a regulator to take action if they have been poorly treated. We
therefore need mystery shoppers who will step in and find out whether
nudge, nudge sales techniques are encouraging people to take on debt
that they do not want or
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000076">I
would like to see an affordability test, a limit on the number of
roll-overs that can occur on an individual loan and for debts to be
frozen when consumers are struggling so that they do not escalate. We
also need to look at the cost of the licence. It costs only
£1,500 to set up a payday lending company. With a few hundred
pounds, people can get themselves up on the Google ratings and end up
lending to all sorts of people. In the two years that it takes for
action be taken, they can reinvent themselves. Let us charge more and
use that money to pay for independent debt advice and the other things
that I have called
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000077">We

Government should do more to promote a savings culture to prevent
consumers from finding themselves in positions of stress in which they
do not have the time to make an informed decision. Also, as many

we must consider the mainstream institutions. They were caught
sleeping, and the market has changed. It has gone online. People do not
necessarily want to turn up at a bank in a suit to justify themselves.

online services. We all instinctively trust the traditional
institutions to do a better job, but they need to be in a position to
do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000082"><Member ContinuationText="Damian Hinds" PimsId="5583" UID="13090533000198" xid="1059" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000198"><B>Damian

Friend for giving way during his persuasive speech. Does he agree that
the traditional, mainstream financial institutions could and should
also innovate in the area of budgeting accounts, or jam jar accounts?
Those accounts help to prevent people from tripping into debt in the
first place and can also help to foster the savings culture that he
mentioned. By siphoning off small amounts of money on pay day, people
can build up a small savings
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Justin Tomlinson" PimsId="5650" UID="13090533000199" xid="1192" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0002.htm#13090533000199">Justin

of plans for jam jar banking. It is a fantastic idea, because we all
know people who, even with the best will in the world and the best

is true of many of us. At times of distress, such as death,
family breakdown, partnership break-ups or unemployment, they can
quickly be overwhelmed. Products that can help people manage as well as
possible on limited money give the consumer power. As I said, we need

I first spoke in Parliament about high-cost credit, I drew on my
experience. When I came to London as a 21-year-old graduate, I worked
as a researcher in Parliament, earning £7,000 a year. I got
myself into a stupid amount of debt—£15,000—very
quickly, not because I was trying to pay rent, meet bills and buy food,
but because I wanted to keep up with the Joneses. I wanted to go out
wearing nice clothes and to have good evenings out with my friends, all
of whom worked in the City and earned a lot more money than I was
earning. I borrowed a lot of money on credit cards, I was always at my
overdraft limit, and borrowed money on store cards. I bought things on
store cards that people normally pay for with small cash. I could not
afford to live the life I wanted to lead in my not-very-well-paid job
as a
researcher.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stella Creasy" PimsId="5611" UID="13090533000202" xid="1175" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000202">Stella
Creasy:</Member></B> I make no comment about the friendships the hon.
Lady had, but does she agree that one worrying aspect of the debate on
the payday loan industry—the evidence is clear—is that
80% of payday loans are for basics? They are for paying rent, and
travel and food costs. People cut back as far as they can, so those
costs

back my debt. I learned that lesson thanks to the bank. I got to the
stage of hiding from the bills and not going out. I was in a miserable
place, and—the hon. Member for Islwyn will be pleased to hear
this—Lloyds TSB took me aside and said, “Your credit
rating is dreadful. You keep going over your overdraft limit. You will
be in serious trouble if you don’t deal with this now.”
The bank cut up my credit and store cards, which was incredibly
upsetting, and put me on a repayment programme. The problem today is
that banks do not necessarily provide the personal banking they did
back in 1996-97 when I was getting myself into debt, and people are
finding alternative ways in which to deal with their debt
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robin Walker" PimsId="5656" UID="13090533000204" xid="1178" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000204">Mr

have heard a lot about charges for people who go into unauthorised bank
overdrafts. I was recently charged for going into my authorised
overdraft, which I found incredibly shocking. I did not know the bank
could do that, but it did. The charge was the equivalent of taking out
a £100 loan from Wonga for five days. I can see why people turn

into an authorised
overdraft.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000113">We
need to be aware of people’s problems when it comes to debt. We
should not judge people for getting into debt or for trying to get
themselves out of it. We also need to be aware of the scale of the
problem. I have two wards of deprivation in my constituency, and there
is an increase in the number of people turning to payday lenders. The
local citizens advice bureau tells me that the average debt in Medway
is £43,000. It also tells me that people from more affluent
areas are turning to payday lenders for the reasons the hon. Member for

lenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000114">When
used correctly, those loans can be a help. When someone needs that
short-term boost—when something is broken and they need to
borrow £100—it is easier for them to go to a payday
lender than it is to go to their bank. We need to be clear that such
loans serve a purpose. However, problems arise when they are not used
correctly. That is why we need to address problems such as rollovers,

need to be concerned about the proliferation of shops on our high
streets. It is incredibly easy for the people to get the credit they
need. Thank goodness payday lending companies were not around when I
was  
<?notus-xml column=530?>in debt. Nothing would have stopped me going in to borrow £200 to
get what I wanted. I have learned my lesson, but it took a long time to

the positive measures we could take, it is important that we consider
sharing data. Real-time data are incredibly important. Currently,
someone who has taken a Wonga loan in the morning can go to the Money
Shop or Cash Converters or the next place on the high street in the
afternoon and get money out. Nobody knows how much they are getting out
on any given day. We also need to look at restricting access to online
credit services overnight. Many years ago, I lay awake at night
worrying about debt. When people come to see me, they tell me that they
cannot sleep and are hiding from their bills. They know they can go
online at 2 am, when they are not thinking straight, and access instant
relief to their fears. We should look carefully at
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000117">We
need to look at supporting our credit unions. I am a saver at both
Medway credit union and Kent Savers credit union. Hon. Members should
do all we can to try to help to promote them so that they are

means using flexible business rates so that credit unions are
encouraged to go into the bigger shops on the high street so they have

debt advice is incredibly important. The Government are doing a great
deal to promote free debt advice. I have worked to keep the Insolvency

become clear during the debate is that there are two strands to this
issue. First, there is the need for enhanced regulation, which my hon.
Friend the Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price) and others have
talked about, and the Financial Conduct Authority and the Office of
Fair Trading have a responsibility to step up to and deal with that.
Secondly, each day Wonga makes 10,400 loans. When the Archbishop of
Canterbury said that we had to compete Wonga out of business, a cheer
went up. In the three years I have been fortunate to be the Second
Church Estates Commissioner, I have not known an issue attract as much
press interest—one morning I did about 20 radio interviews. All
around the country, local radio and newspapers see this is as a serious
issue. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Swindon (Justin
Tomlinson) said, the fact is that each day there are large numbers of
people who want to take out short-term loans that they hope to repay
over a short period. Of course regulation has an important part to
play, but we have to think about what we can do to enhance the
competition.</hs_Para>

Members have said, this is a David and Goliath situation. The hon.
Member for Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith) said that we need credit unions
to be fit for the 21st century. They need adequate IT platforms. After
the Archbishop of Canterbury spoke, the Manchester credit union said
that while having extra premises would be useful, credit unions needed
an IT platform that is fit for the 21st century. We have to recognise
that many credit unions are still at the starting gates.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker) said that the
credit union in his area collapsed altogether, and Worcestershire is a
pretty prosperous county. Oxfordshire is an equally prosperous county,
but it has pockets of high deprivation, such as Blackbird Leys in the
constituency of the right hon. Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith), and
at least three wards in my constituency are in the highest social
indices for the south-east. We have a credit union that has only just
over 1,000 members, which is less than 1% of the population of the city
of Oxford. It has just £300,000 of members’ savings and
£200,000 out on loan. The Oxford credit union is seeking to do
all the right things: it has established a partnership with the south
Oxfordshire housing association to help tenants; it rolled out prepaid
debit cards to allow members to buy goods without using cash; and it
worked with a fuel-buying organisation to allow new members to spread
the cost of buying high-cost fuel. However, this House has to give much
more thought to what we can do collectively to enhance the status of
credit unions. Elsewhere in Europe, credit unions are a much greater
feature. I was recently in Ireland for a family wedding and in
practically every town I went to there was a prominent credit union
building—they are part of the waft and weft of the social
structure.</hs_Para>

disconnect here. Large numbers of savers in Oxfordshire complain that
they get very little return from the banks for their savings. Are there
not ways to encourage savers to invest in credit unions? The difficulty
is that many people living in Oxfordshire would not think of joining or
investing in a credit union. Are there ways in which one could give
minimal tax incentives to people who invest in credit unions? If I let
a room in my house, I can get up to £6,000 a year tax free. What
if the interest on what is invested in a credit union, up to a certain
amount, is tax free?</hs_Para>

alternative financial mechanism to the banks and payday lenders will
require an enormous amount of energy. The Archbishop of Canterbury says
that he thinks it will take a decade to turn things around. It is
welcome that the Government are investing £38 million in credit
unions, but that is almost exactly the same amount that the main payday
lenders spend in advertising in just one year. By and large, the
£1 million that they make each week in profit is money that is
leaving poorer areas of the country. It is not being spent in shops in
areas such as Blackbird Leys.</hs_Para>

Minister replies to this debate, she will obviously reply to the
comments that hon. Members in all parts of the House have made about
regulation, but we also have to focus on how collectively we compete
Wonga out of business and how collectively we work out an alternative
financial mechanism. That might also require banks changing their
practices. As the House might know, the Church Commissioners are one of
those competing for the new Williams and Glyn’s bank. If we win
that competition, we hope to return to 
<?notus-xml column=533?>the sort of old-fashioned responsible banking that people remember from
the 1960s. However, unless people feel able to access short-term loans
for short-term needs, they will be pushed into the hands of the payday
lenders or, even worse, the loan sharks. We therefore have a collective
duty to try to work out how we get credit unions in this country funded
and fit for the 21st
century.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_05_PT_1/2CD9C382A453EDC576C52A23891251350369A0E4" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 September 2013">Thursday

constraints, I will not comment on most of those speeches, but I think
we are all clear that there is a world of difference between those of
us in this place, as well-off MPs, able to access interest-free credit
cards or get loans at 5% or under these days, and many of our
constituents, who have no savings and no credit record or a poor credit
record, for whom the options are limited. It is important that there is
a sector that can lend to people who have a crisis when the washing
machine breaks down or, typically—I hear this a lot in my
constituency—when they have to pay for a funeral, which is a
huge expense, and have nowhere to go. We need to ensure that the system
works.</hs_Para>

touch on some of the concerns, as I see them, and what needs to be
done; to highlight some of the organisations in my constituency and how
they work to achieve things; and also to pick up on the point that the
hon. Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) made about the
disgraceful withdrawal by the major financial institutions of products
for poorer, riskier borrowers.</hs_Para>

harder even for people with good ratings to get products from the
banks, as many of my local businesses will testify, while those who do
not have a good credit record cannot get products from anywhere. We
need to be careful, because the vilification of payday lenders means
that there is a huge reputational risk for mainstream lenders entering
the quick, short-term loan market. We have to think responsibly and in
the round about how we act and how we ensure that there is something
out there for those who will be a higher risk and will therefore face a
higher cost. There is a place, as we have all agreed, for short-term
lending of fixed sums at high rates.</hs_Para>

the Public Accounts Committee about how Provident works. For many
people, it is a psychological thing. A nice woman—they are
nearly all women—comes to the person’s door and asks for
the money. It might be £185 to borrow £100, but it never
goes up: even if someone misses a payment, there is no penalty. Many of
my constituents—they are often the same sort of people, and rely
on meter keys—do not want the surprise or worry of a bill they
are not expecting. I agree with the hon. Member for North Swindon that
there is a worry about secondary selling, but that certainty and direct
contact is important.</hs_Para>

really right to make the comparison, because if the credit union went
round to people’s doors in person, there would be an increase in
the cost and the interest rate would be much higher than the 26.8%
quoted. We need to be careful when comparing products to be aware that
there are different products out there. I agree with all colleagues
that the focus on APR and percentage rates is confusing for people. We
need to change that—I will touch on my suggested changes at the
end.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue) mentioned
BrightHouse, which has a really invidious system, providing high
interest on credit via purchases and then tacking on insurance. Indeed,
the insurance costs for one item of furniture or a television can be as
much as the insurance for a whole household, yet it is sold in a
shop-front environment in places such as Dalston Cross shopping centre.
Worse still, BrightHouse is often recommended by social landlords. When
someone moves in and says, “But I’ve got no
furniture,” they are often told—by people who are not
qualified to give financial advice—“Oh, why don’t
you just go down to BrightHouse?” They think they are giving
shopping advice—often, probably in good faith—but have no
idea that they are indebting their tenants for a long time to
come.</hs_Para>

street in Dalston, we have every type of high street lender that could
be imagined, from the legitimate banks to the loan sharks, who do not
exactly have shop frontages, and the swish, nice-looking frontages of
the Money Shop, Oakam and so on. I want to touch on Oakam, which has an
interesting business model that is different from many of the other
high street lenders. It is based on an American model, which is fairly
newly arrived in the UK, and works with people who are themselves
fairly newly arrived in the UK who are trying to build a credit record
or set up a business, but do not have access to credit from mainstream
institutions. Typically, someone from Poland—we have a lot of
Poles in Hackney—or people from parts of west Africa, having
arrived in the UK, will spend six months building up their credit
record at a higher interest rate than many others, but then move to the
high street bank over the road to get a loan. Oakam provides a service
that people need—it is at a higher interest rate, but people
know what they are doing. Oakam says that a lot of its customers are
clearly building their
records.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000141">Fair
Finance is a social enterprise that gave evidence to the Public
Accounts Committee. It has a base in Hackney and provides face-to-face
loan advice, but has taken nearly nine years to reach break-even point.
One of Fair Finance’s worries is that if interest rates were
capped, it would have to provide loans to people at higher levels and
further indebt them, so if someone came wanting to borrow
£5,000, it might have to call it £10,000 to cover their
costs, because it costs a lot. Fair Finance has a model that trains
advisers to sit face-to-face with someone, talk them through all their
financial issues and ensure they can manage the loan and the
repayments. Fair Finance feels that talking face-to-face is one of the
reasons why it gets the money back.</hs_Para>

talked a lot about credit unions, too. As a Co-op MP, it saddens me
that too often we see credit unions failing. Having to save before a
loan is one issue. In Hackney, our credit union collapsed. We are now
working with the Tower Hamlets credit union, which 
<?notus-xml column=535?>has taken over the space. One of the challenges was that a lot of people
were basically using the credit union as a bank account for their
benefits. They never really saved and were therefore never able to take
out a loan, although they had no great interest in taking out a loan
either. The service quality was poor, and too often the credit union
was badly managed and there was a lack of advertising, as is the case
for other credit unions. We need to work with the credit union sector
to get it to step up to the mark. If credit unions are to compete with
flash shops such as the Money Shop, which people who can walk into and
get good quality service—whatever the issues with the
products—they need to remember that people will shop
around.</hs_Para>

touch on what needs to be done and to refer colleagues to the Public
Accounts Committee report, which the hon. Member for Thurrock (Jackie
Doyle-Price) highlighted. I will not repeat them, but its
recommendations clearly show that there is an issue with a lack of
regulation from the regulator. The work of the regulator—we now
have a new regulator, so there is some hope in this—needs to
focus more on consumer protection, ensuring that those with a licence
to lend have the right protections and checks in place, so they do not
over-lend and over-extend people. There should be a limit on
roll-overs. There is sometimes talk as though everyone is always
rolling over all the time. There are legitimate payday lenders that
limit roll-overs. We need to recognise that there is a range of
providers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090533000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090533000144">There
also need to be proper affordability checks. People should not be able
to walk down the high street and get three payday loans on the same
day. The whole point about the speed of many payday lenders is that
they can make online checks quickly, so the system needs to be updated.
It is interesting that one’s own credit record is sometimes not
updated very quickly, so there is a basic IT issue. Continuous payment
authority is an invidious system and needs to go. We also need a change
from APR to clearer costs. These are all things that need to be
done.</hs_Para>

I welcome the changes in the way in which they are to be run; the
Government should take credit for that. All Members of Parliament
should become greatly involved in their credit union; I certainly
support the Hexham credit union, which was set up with the help of the
Churches in Northumberland. However, I question whether the credit
unions alone will be able to address the problems of high-cost credit.
In regard to interest rates, credit unions have clearly adopted a
fantastically successful approach—their lending rates are so
much better—but their deficiencies might mean that it is
difficult for them to go forward. None the less, debates such as these
on Wonga or on the private Member’s Bill introduced by the hon.

incredibly difficult to set up a bank. It took in excess of £50
million and the process was highly regulated, even though the smaller

The Financial Services Act 2012 changed the approach taken by the then

organisations are improving, and many groups now wish to get involved.
They include not only local communities but local authorities and
individual businessmen with a philanthropic approach to their local

unregulated market, with all the problems that that entails. We have
now formed more than 14 separate oil-buying clubs to try to address the
cost of the oil. However, the requirement to buy 500 litres involves a
very large financial outlay, often when oil is at its most expensive,

be reminded by my hon. Friends the Members for Blaenau Gwent (Nick
Smith) and for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg Hillier) about the
context in which our constituents face difficulties with high-cost
credit. There was a danger that we might forget that these problems do
not occur in a vacuum. The reasons for people being forced into using
high-cost credit include the decline in wages, which has accelerated
over the past three years. We have seen a £1,500 real-terms
reduction in the mean level of wages over that period and, as we
discovered yesterday, the median wage in Britain is now £3,300
less than it was in 2006-07.</hs_Para>

of the Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills,
the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) on the Treasury
Bench prompts me to talk about the context in which the debate is
taking place. She and I are parliamentary neighbours, and there is a
road—Colston road—that divides her constituency from
mine. On one side of that road, in my constituency, is the ward with
the highest level of child poverty in Scotland, at 51%. On the other
side of the road, in the hon. Lady’s constituency, the level of
child poverty is only 9%. That is a yawning gap. I have constituents
visiting my office who are in dire need of food because they do not
have enough money to get through the day. That explains the surge in
the use of high-cost payday lenders in my constituency and those of
many other hon. Members across the country.</hs_Para>

that the average APR for payday lender loans is about 1,737%, but some
of our constituents are facing an APR of nearly 5,000% on even
relatively small loans. In many parts of Glasgow, this demand for
high-cost credit is, in my experience, clearly linked to financial
hardship and the lack of available alternatives for finance. We saw
previously that crisis loans proved to be a stop-gap, but even in the
run-up to the period during which the arrangements were devolved by the
DWP to local councils—and, in Scotland, to the Scottish
Parliament—we saw the significant pressures caused by cuts in
crisis-loan funding. Between 2011 and 2012, crisis-loan funding fell by
almost £90 million, which led to an explosion in demand for
payday lending, particularly in Scotland.</hs_Para>

months, the Resolution Foundation has evidenced a number of key facts
that show the extent of financial exclusion across our country. About
4% of UK households have no bank account at all; one in 10 does not
have a current account; and it has been estimated that people on very
low incomes pay a poverty premium of around £1,000 a year just
to access basic financial services. Some 7.8 million in our country are
unable to access mainstream credit, while 60% of adults among the
poorest fifth of the population would like to save just £10 a
month, but are unable to do so. Growing numbers of people are only a
broken washing machine or a broken fridge away from stepping over a
very steep financial cliff indeed, while 3 million households in social
housing do not have any contents insurance despite the fact that they
are twice as likely to be burgled as people who live in privately owned
properties.</hs_Para>

has been useful in focusing the eyes of the Government—and, I
hope, those of the Competition Commission, too, in its
inquiry—on the need to take concrete action on misleading
advertising, the irresponsible roll-over of loans, about which my hon.
Friend the Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) spoke so lucidly, the
targeting of vulnerable customers and the unfair treatment of customers
who are in arrears and default. It is the charges for these defaults on
which I believe urgent action is particularly needed by the Competition
Commission and, perhaps, by the Financial 
<?notus-xml column=539?>Conduct Authority next April when it takes over regulation of this
sector. The Bristol study, which reported to the Minister’s
Department, said that having tighter lending practices and a
restriction on default charges could result in short-term lenders
exercising less forbearance than they currently do on lenders who are
very much in need.</hs_Para>

that we have heard such a focus on credit unions in this debate. I
recently held a summit of small credit unions in my constituency, and
they came up with practical suggestions about how the Government could
help. They told me that, in their view, the Government’s fund
through the DWP does not do enough to support small, community-based
credit unions. They consider that the lion’s share of the
funding had gone to the larger credit unions and said that the smaller
credit unions were often run exclusively by volunteers, and they lack
IT expertise and permanent staff. Credit unions from Haghill, Ruchill,
and Greater Milton and Possilpark in my constituency have told me about
the huge impact they could have and the huge extension in services they
would be able to provide to constituents if only they had the

business model and lending. They welcomed the fact that finance for a
financial education worker was available, which they said had been
pulled in the past sometimes after just six months, and argued that the
Government needed to be much more consistent in their support. They
raised an important final point—that credit unions are often
seen as low priority in comparison with banks when customers become
bankrupt. They asked the Government to think about reviewing the law in
this area to bring them equality of treatment, which would very much
help the credit unions’ provision of
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000013">The

interesting point, especially when he talked about some payday loan

to go back to the basics. For three or four years, we have had a 0.5%
base rate, and the Governor of the Bank of England is hopeful that that

would have thought that this wonderful Government of ours must be
looking at such a levy—and if they are not, I am sure that they

Yes, some might argue that we are saving people from themselves, but in

is not just a question of whether the loan is repaid. People may reach
a stage at which they are unable to repay it, and charges will then be
levied for non-payment. The loan will be rearranged, another fee will
be added, and they will end up paying five or six times the amount that
they originally borrowed, or perhaps even more. That cannot be right.
In any sort of capitalist system—or whatever system we
have—there is a need for profit, but there is no need to extract
money in a way that almost constitutes extortion. Someone who arrived
in this world for the first time and observed that it was possible to
charge such amounts of interest, or indeed—let me be

those who did that should be locked up. We must do something about

people who cannot repay their loans, there are people—although
not so many—who are addicted to borrowing money, not just from
payday loan companies but from, for instance, store cards that they can
use in shops. They must be given more access to advice, and
restrictions must be placed on the amount that they can borrow. If
people are such a credit risk that they must be charged enormous
amounts of interest because companies believe that that is the only way

their constituents who have suffered at the hands of legal loan sharks.
My hon. Friends the Members for Makerfield (Yvonne Fovargue), for
Blaenau Gwent (Nick Smith), for Hackney South and Shoreditch (Meg
Hillier) and for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) all deserve special
mention, as does the dogged determination of my hon. Friend the Member

hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) for his
private Member’s Bill, and for his superb contribution to
today’s debate. The Bill attempts to provide a regulatory
framework for high-cost payday lenders, and I shall say more about it
later. I agree with the hon. Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey

a fantastic debate. There is clearly a consensus, not only in the House
but among key organisations representing consumers and the debt support
industry, that action is needed, and needed now. The hon. Member for
Worcester (Mr Walker) was right to point out that there was cross-party
support for such action. The issue has also been prominent in another
Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, where Kezia Dugdale MSP has run
the very successful Debtbusters campaign in an attempt to pressurise
the Scottish Government to use their powers to assist. Unsurprisingly,
they have so far refused to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000034">The
pace at which the high-cost credit industry has grown is extraordinary.
That is no doubt largely due to the cost-of-living crisis—my
hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow North East referred to the
desperation that drives people to food banks, and my hon. Friend the
Member for Blaenau Gwent mentioned the problems of insecure employment
in his constituency—but it must also be attributable to the
attraction of the industry to countries with weak regulatory
environments. Indeed, some commentators have described the regulatory
environment in the United Kingdom as a “payday loans
haven”. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield drew attention
to the failure of the voluntary code in the sector.</hs_Para>

struggling economy, with ever-rising prices and stagnating wages, that
is driving people towards high-credit borrowing just to meet the
demands of everyday costs. Last year, Which? found that 60% of people
who were using the high-credit market were doing so for everyday
purposes. That shows how acute the cost-of-living crisis has become.
There is a market for access to such short-term credit, as we have
heard in the debate, whether that be for a broken washing machine or
for the commuter whose car breaks down. Those problems cause unexpected
shocks to families’ budgets and they can be helped by the
short-term credit market, but as my hon. Friend the Member for
Walthamstow said, many companies make most of their money through a
small percentage of people who are forced to become repeat customers.
It is becoming clearer that vulnerable people are being targeted and
exploited by this industry; they find themselves drawn into a spiral of
debt and are using such lending for everyday purposes. Many Members
have told of their constituents’ experiences in that
regard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000036">The
harsh reality of the pressures of rising living costs is highlighted by
the rising number of people using the StepChange Debt Charity. It has
reported that more than 30,000 people contacted it in the first six
months of 2013, which is the same number as for the whole of
2012.</hs_Para>

high-cost credit crisis has deepened, month by month this Government
have failed to take any meaningful action, and it is clear that
consumers need protection now. The Minister with responsibility for the
industry has played her part in that failure, despite the cross-party
consensus which has been mentioned. Her payday loans
“summit” in July, which she called the industry to
attend, was slammed as a sham by many and what it actually achieved is
unclear.</hs_Para>

Minister to answer the following questions when she responds to the
debate. Did she lambast industry executives for their continued
flouting of their own good practice customer charter, as Citizens
Advice has shown? Did she challenge industry executives, whose
advertising spend rose by 26% in this year alone? Did she even ask them
about capping the total cost of credit? If the industry is doing all
the positive things it tells us it is doing, why will it not give the
Government and the FCA its lending data so that we can determine
whether or not we can trust what it says? We urgently need to put in
place sensible and measured policies which will protect people. If we
do not do that, ever more people will be affected.</hs_Para>

about some of the issues raised by Members today and by my hon. Friend
the Member for Sheffield Central (Paul Blomfield) in his private
Member’s Bill. First and foremost, we must have a cap on the
total cost of credit, including charges and defaults. In her wonderful
speech, my hon. Friend the Member for Walthamstow highlighted how that
could be done. Last year, we proposed an amendment to the Financial
Services Bill to give the new FCA the clear powers to do that, and it
is a shame that the Government rejected it—only for the Lords,
including the Archbishop of Canterbury and other Cross Benchers, to
persuade them that it was the right thing to
do.</hs_Para>

Government are reluctant to over-regulate in the credit marketplace,
they must lay down to the regulator some clear foundations about what
they are looking to do. First, there must be a crackdown on
irresponsible lending, for which an affordability framework needs to be
put in place. The FCA also needs to introduce measures to stop small
debts becoming large debts. That should include addressing roll-overs
and a limit on default charges. They should also consider a cooling-off
period, as my hon. Friend the Member  for Wansbeck said. The
FCA needs to collect some transactional information, too, so that we
can be clear about how the market is operating. The Government and the
FCA should introduce a live database as well, so that payday lenders
can do proper credit and affordability checks in order to protect
borrowers. That is the only way we can overcome the hurdle of the
industry being accused of not doing proper affordability checks. There
should be strong warnings on all advertising so that customers are
aware of the risks and costs. My hon. Friend the Member for Makerfield
said that her children had been told to boo when the adverts appear on
the television; perhaps we should add those boos to the adverts
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000041">Borrowers
experiencing difficulty should be automatically signposted to a free
debt advice service. The continuous payment authorities should be
reviewed, too. The Minister must tell the FCA to look at that, in
particular with regard to the high-cost credit
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000042">This

the House today that she is doing everything in her power to make sure
that the market is regulated properly? I would challenge her on that,
because I do not think that she is doing that. The House has spoken
clearly—not just in this debate, but in many debates on
high-cost credit over the past 18 months to two years—and it is

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and
Skills (Jo Swinson):</Member></B> We have had an excellent and
constructive debate, and I thank the hon. Member for Islwyn (Chris
Evans) for introducing it and the Backbench Business Committee for
allocating time. I appreciated his welcome for the action the
Government have already taken, such as on the research into advertising
and the FCA strategy that we are due to see soon with the publication
of its rulebook. I understand and appreciate his concern about the
speed of change, and the frustration he feels. His party colleague the
hon. Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) said the pace of growth of
the payday lending industry has been extraordinary. The Government and
regulators have, of course, been working to keep up, and I think we
have seen in recent months that that has been happening.</hs_Para>

alternatives have been mentioned. One of them was the possibility of
introducing low-limit credit cards, and I have explored that with the
UK Cards Association and others in the industry, as I think it could be
one of the alternatives that might work. Of 
<?notus-xml column=545?>course, it would not work for everybody; as we have heard, some people
who take out payday loans are keen to make sure that they get something
quickly and with that level of convenience. Indeed, some may not pass
the credit scoring that would be required for some of those credit
cards. That underlines the importance of the affordability assessments,
because people are currently passing the checks by payday lenders and
perhaps some of them should not be.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Thurrock (Jackie Doyle-Price) talked about the
PAC report and the importance of this House sending a clear signal to
the FCA that it expects it to use its powers to intervene where there
is poor practice, and I absolutely agree with her. We do expect that,
and I have made that abundantly clear to the FCA. Today’s debate
has also been very helpful in making it clear exactly how strongly the
House feels about this issue. I am sure that the FCA will be following
this debate, but just in case it is not, I will happily write to it to
draw that to its attention. Indeed, next week I will be meeting Martin
Wheatley to have further discussions on this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000047">My
hon. Friend mentioned that she was disappointed that the Office of Fair

three licences—so those powers are being used.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Walthamstow (Stella Creasy) for all her campaigning on
this issue; we had a positive meeting to discuss it earlier this week.
Obviously, the profitability of payday lenders has been high up in the
news this week, and we agree on the level of profits being derived from
default fees, roll-overs and so on. That is why it is so important that
the Competition Commission is investigating this market. It has already
begun its investigation, issued its issues statement and invited
comments from interested parties by later this month.</hs_Para>

in detail the other day the points that the hon. Lady made about total
cost capping. I appreciate that we perhaps have a difference of opinion
on where exactly the evidence points, the possible negative impacts of
fees being charged elsewhere—a displacement effect—and
whether or not there would be less sympathy for lenders than
difficulty. That said, it is vital that the FCA has that power and has
the evidence. Her point about ensuring that the FCA can get off to a
flying start when it takes on the responsibility in April 2014 is
important. I have been keen to ensure that it is able to do that, and
it has said it is prioritising the issue.</hs_Para>

Lady’s point about data sharing in the industry, I encourage
lenders to liaise and share their data with the FCA in advance of its
taking over that responsibility. The OFT has a data-sharing agreement
with the FCA, so data that it has can be shared, with all the
appropriate confidentiality protections in place, as one would expect.
It would be helpful if the industry would share further data with the
FCA, and when we had the summit the industry indicated its willingness
to be as helpful as possible. I hope that it will be able to take that
up.</hs_Para>

highlighted concerns about CPAs and the way in which banks have treated
them, because where individual customers decide to cancel a CPA, that
should be honoured. She will be pleased that the FCA took up that issue
seriously once it came into being earlier this year. It now has
agreement with the high-street banks that they will ensure that when a
customer asks for a recurring payment to end, that will be sufficient
to cancel the arrangement. Furthermore, if any payment subsequently
goes through by mistake, the customer will be refunded immediately.
That will not solve all the problems on CPAs but it is a good start, in

important for two reasons. First, it is about the most important single
issue facing the north-east of England. The region, including Teesside,
has the highest rate of unemployment of any part of the United Kingdom
at more than 10%. That equates to more than 83,000 people, of whom
24,415 are young people. Long-term unemployment has increased by 8.6%,
or more than 2,300, in the past year. In my constituency, approximately
3,000 people are looking for work, nearly a third of whom are aged
between 18 and 24. Those people want to work, but the jobs are simply
not
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000071">The
debate is also important for every English region that has a local
enterprise partnership. Although the report that we are considering is
not the only one of its kind—I think that Manchester has
produced something similar—it is clearly relevant to other UK
regions that face similar
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000072">There

Auckland (Helen Goodman), the hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) and
the right hon. Member for Berwick-upon-Tweed (Sir Alan Beith). When I

report identifies the key problems that the region faces, but it is
weaker on what to do about them. The issue at the heart of all this is
what we should be doing to bring down high rates of unemployment and to
ensure that the citizens we represent have a chance of a job, a decent
wage and a secure future in the north-east of England—including
in Teesside, for the avoidance of
doubt.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000074">While
the report focuses largely on structures, I would have preferred it to
focus on outcomes. It could have offered practical ways forward, but it
focuses on process and reorganising functions. I think that a better
approach was the one adopted by the previous Labour Government, with
the regional Minister, local authorities working with that Minister
through the Association of North East Councils, and essential economic
development input coming from One North East, the independent,
business-led development agency. Given the need to reduce public
expenditure, it would have been better to refocus the development
agency on its core business, rather than abolishing it.</hs_Para>

to be single-minded focus on broadening and deepening the
region’s private sector employment base. Promising individual
projects were in the pipeline 
<?notus-xml column=549?>when I was regional Minister—I believe that they are still in
place—so they should be assessed and pushed forward with a sense
of urgency. There should be political leadership from an individual
Minister appointed to focus on this issue. The crucial point is that
such a Minister will have access to the great Departments of State and
can act as an advocate for incoming private sector investment. Other
parts of the United Kingdom with similar problems have their own
economic development bodies, local political decision-making bodies and
ministerial champions at Cabinet level. That is true for Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, and the north-east, including Teesside,
needs a ministerial champion of its
own.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000076">In
my time as regional Minister, I was able to intervene effectively at
the heart of government. I was able to intervene on the region’s

I worked behind the scenes—we were not allowed to say anything
in public—in the campaign to find a future for what was then the
Corus steelworks at Redcar. I worked closely with the North East of
England Process Industry Cluster, and secured central Government
support for public transport initiatives on Teesside and for the
Newcastle metro. I also championed the north bank of the Tyne’s
industrial strategy, as well as a partnership between the regional
development agency, Newcastle city council and North Tyneside council
that brought new industrial jobs to the Tyne. A substantial amount of
work was undertaken with small and medium-sized employers and an

principal recommendations of the LEP report involve creating a
leadership board that is made up of the leaders of the seven local
authorities and that will lead on the three functions of transport,
economic development and skills training. I understand that the
Government support those recommendations because they are similar to
their existing policy, but I note that our ministerial presence has
been upgraded so, if I have got that wrong, I am sure that the Minister
for Universities and Science will tell us when he says a few
words.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000078">The
recommendations in the report involve organisational change, with no
very clear-sighted view of where there would be an improved outcome
following the change. They also strike me as being labour intensive.

Brown:</Member></B> It would certainly be impossible for local
authorities to do what the report suggests. My hon. Friend’s
point is correct. If extra resources were to be supplied to enable them
to do so, frankly it would not be the first priority for expenditure in
local authorities, all of which are very hard-pressed at the moment
even 
<?notus-xml column=550?>without taking on extra functions without the resources to carry them
out. Let us remember that the recommendations, which effectively are
for extra civil service support, be it central or local
government—as I read the report, it is both—come just
after the Government have closed the Government office for the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000081">Of
course there is a case for the seven local government leaders to meet.
In effect, this replicates, but for a smaller area, the arrangement
that pertained under the last Labour Government through the Association
of North East Councils. Local authority leaders already take a close
interest in economic development questions in their council areas, and
they work with others when there is a common interest. But is not the
lead on economic development supposed to lie with the LEP, not the
local authority leaders alone? The local authority leaders are already
all represented on the board of the LEP. What is the relationship
between the two supposed to
be?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000082">A
better approach to the Tyne and Wear passenger transport authority
would be to amend the existing arrangements rather than create a whole
new authority. The existing authority has the advantage of involving
councillors who are not the leaders of their authority and can give the
time to specialise in transport matters. Nexus and the integrated
transport authority are already working hard to push ahead with many of
the recommendations in the report, including smart ticketing and a
consultation on a quality contracts
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000083">Similarly,
I do not understand, and the report does not explain, what the specific
input of the local authority leaders into skills training is expected
to bring. The justification in the report is that the local government
leaders know their own areas the best and therefore are best placed to
identify skills needs and shortages. I am not sure that this is true.
In any event, local authority leaders have a great deal to do already,
and to demand that they specialise in skills and training issues as
well as economic development and transport policy seems to me
unreasonable.</hs_Para>

authority does not give the region any more access to Government, and
it is Government who have the power and hold the purse-strings, and
that is more so now than under the previous Government. We have had the
LEP up and running now and that has not enhanced the region’s
direct access to Government, where the big decisions are made. The LEP
has had the lead on the enterprise zone policy for almost two years

Nissan is one of the great hopes for the region. It has the potential
single-handedly to make a substantial impact on the employment issues
in east Durham and in the city of Sunderland. When I was the regional 
<?notus-xml column=551?>Minister, I was a great enthusiast for the potential that was there and
a great champion of it, and I was able to take its case to the heart of
Government. I hope that that helped to bring about the arrangements
that are now in place and the success the company now enjoys, but we
should never lose sight of the fact that the principal reason for
Nissan’s success is the management and the work force. I think
that everyone in public life in the north-east wants it to succeed,
will fight its corner and stands ready to help. I hope the issue will
never divide us when we look for the way forward for our
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000087">My
principal criticism of the report is that it is all about process,
rather than outcomes. It is repetitive and has a scattergun approach to
initiatives. For example, there is a flurry of ideas around one of the
most pressing issues: the need for venture capital and the continuing
difficulty in getting banks to lend. That problem is not unique to the
north-east, but it has a particular impact on us because we are trying
to develop the private sector in our economy.</hs_Para>

a regional business bank, a north-east access-to-finance scheme, an
investor readiness programme and a north-east finance and investment

relationship management”, “re-location” schemes

of initiatives, but what does it all mean? Do they overlap? I cannot

increase in apprenticeships, greater foreign direct investment and more
young people from the region going to university. All those outcomes

stating that they are desirable, the report gives no indication on how
best to achieve them. At the very best, the report’s
recommendations would deliver administrative change for our region in a
few years’ time. The need for action is now. Yet now the
Government are actively sucking demand out of the regional economy by
changing the national funding formulae for local government, the
national health service, policing, transport and infrastructure

done a tremendous amount to help ourselves as a region, but the scale
of the problem is such that more needs to be done. As well as
determinedly driving forward the projects that we know are there, there
is a case for a short-term emergency response to the emerging problem
of long-term youth unemployment. Only central Government can do that.
The Chancellor and the Business Secretary could explore incentivising
the region’s small and medium-sized employers 

<?notus-xml column=552?>to take on an extra young person, or more than one, if only to prevent
the corrosive and demoralising effects of worklessness and defeated

my view, things were moving in the right direction under the structures
and leadership of the previous Labour Government. The report confirms
that by setting out the region’s progress in the last growth
cycle with 67,000 extra jobs, gross value added increasing by 57%, and
tens of thousands of jobs created through greater foreign investment.
The north-east was moving in the right direction, with the fastest
growth rate of any English region, although admittedly from a more
modest start. That was delivered under the former economic development
structures, which would have worked well to get us through the economic
downturn. The report is quick to offer new structures but gives no
assessment of how well the old ones worked. In short, it correctly
identifies the issues facing the region but is insufficiently bold in

forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000093"><B><Member PimsId="-1" UID="13090540000238" xid="-1" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000238">Several

Opperman</B> (Hexham) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to follow the
right hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown). I suggest
that we should be very proud of the report, and very proud in the
north-east. As we all agree, it is the most beautiful of regions, and
certainly not desolate. It is blessed with a positive balance of
payments, as the North East chamber of commerce and the businesses
constantly make clear to us.</hs_Para>

the region the cradle of the industrial revolution, but this year we
are leading the way. First, in the spring we had the January
declaration in the north-east, which made a significant contribution to
how we visualise the type of country we wish to be. Secondly, in April
we had Lord Adonis’s report, which is fundamentally
business-led, with the most pragmatic of Labour politicians at its
head; he is someone we can genuinely work with. I am happy to say that
I worked with him and supported what he was doing in creating the
report. Thirdly, in June, we had the banking conference in Gateshead
which a group of us organised to try to facilitate bank lending in a
multitude of ways, ranging from a business bank to a local enterprise
partnership infrastructure bank to community and local
banks—different types of lending and expanding on credit unions
that will address the fundamental problem of the lack of bank lending
and finance to create the private sector jobs that we all so wish
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000097">The
north-east is leading the way. The right hon. Member for Newcastle upon
Tyne East is right that Manchester has produced a derisorily small and
not very good report. We have produced a proper report that deals with
what all 39 local enterprise partnerships have to do—address
specific plans for a strategic economic plan within a particular time
scale. Every Member of Parliament and every person in this country will
have to address the problems that we are leading the way on. That is
very significant. The north-east is not sitting back and accepting the
state of things as they are; the north-east is making the case for
change.</hs_Para>

economic plan must be submitted by the end of March 2014, and it
requires a Government response at a certain stage over the winter. It
affects businesses, universities, local authorities and anyone
interested in transport, housing, schools or skills—pretty much
everybody. I cannot speak to every part of the report in seven minutes,
but I can say that I support its broad thrust. The most important part
concerns the development that has taken place over the past year-plus
with the local authorities all coming together and forming the combined
authority. It is absolutely vital that we go on this journey. I take
the point about the Association of North East Authorities being a type
of combined authority, but it is nothing like what we are going to have
in future.</hs_Para>

Kevan Jones:</Member></B> That is a structural change, although I am
not opposed to it. To be fair to the north-east councils, they have a
very good track record, across the political divide, of working
together. However, the hon. Gentleman cannot get away from the fact
that his Government have already taken some £240 million from
the local authorities covered by the LEP area in the past two years,
and that is before the next round of cuts. How does expect those
councils to come up to the mark as the Government are asking them to
do?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000100"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="13090540000242" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000242">Guy
Opperman:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman need not take my word for it;
he can listen to the author of the report and the business men and
business women who believe in the north-east being able to cope with
those difficulties and strongly make the case that there is optimism to
be found there.</hs_Para>

Gentleman, actually. On that basis, does he support the idea eloquently

mayor is someone working from the bottom up and driving the region
forward. A Minister in the Government—I say this with no
disrespect to the work of the Minister on the Front Bench or any
replacement—is here for at least four days a week and unable to
drive things from the bottom up. However much the Member of Parliament
who was the Minister would like to be in touch with everything that is
going on, it must surely be 
<?notus-xml column=554?>accepted that someone local needs to be driving it forward. That is
certainly the case with the Mayor of London and the mayors of Paris,
San Francisco and other regions, and they have been successful. It is,
however, a matter for debate, which is what this process is about. A
legitimate debate is taking place about how to make progress. Tomorrow
I and 400 other delegates will discuss the report’s individual
parts at the International Centre for Life in Newcastle. I am not
suggesting that anything is set in stone, but one thing is clear: the
north-east is leading the debate about where the structures should
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000107">In

future growth must be engineered through education and skills. We
cannot plan for the future without more of the brightest and the best
getting involved in initiatives such as Teach First and acting as role
models for local children. As it stands, the north-east has only a
third as many of those dynamic individuals as London. We need to
motivate children from all economic backgrounds to apply to Russell
Group universities. One of the report’s targets is for 35% of
the area’s secondary schools and 40% of its primary schools to
reach the top quartile, and it sets out some very good ways, such as
Teach First and the north-east schools challenge, to achieve that. It
is good that we are encouraging university technical colleges to build
links between academia and industry and take advantage of the
north-east’s unique
characteristics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000109">On
apprenticeships, I am pleased to say that I have made my limited,
modest contribution by employing an apprentice—not as an
apprentice MP, I hasten to add, but as an office manager. There should
be greater incentives to encourage everyone to take on an apprentice,
and the report eloquently notes specific measures that could enhance
the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000110">On
local community banking, at our June conference at the Sage in
Gateshead 170 people came together to discuss how they could turn
around their local economies and get local communities lending. On
larger infrastructure, the local enterprise partnership could run the
infrastructure bank. There is no reason why community banks could not
be backed by local authorities, universities or the Army, which is
looking at them. If we can get regional and local lending to address
not just the high-cost credit issues that were discussed in the
previous debate, but the issues of bank and mortgage finance, that
would be a great deal better than the present, patently insufficient
system whereby the big seven banks are remote, London-based and
computer-run, and totally unresponsive to and not located in the
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000111">I
cannot finish without raising two particular points. First, I welcome
the comments of Northumberland county council on the need for a rural
deal so that the report does not just deal with the urban centres. It
needs to be for the rural countryside as much as for the urban centres.
Secondly, a survey by <I>Business Quarterly</I>, which is available
online, found that there is great confidence that this north-east
independent review will stimulate and address some of the
region’s economic needs.</hs_Para>

Elliott</B> (Sunderland Central) (Lab):</Member> I endorse what my
right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown)
said about wanting a regional Minister again. Having worked very
closely with the regional Minister before coming to this place, I know
that it was a huge asset to have somebody in the House who was
responsible for our region. As somebody who was very involved in the
campaign for a north-east assembly and regional government, I found it
interesting to hear a Conservative politician calling for a
mayor—an elected politician to speak up on behalf of the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000114">The
report identifies many of the problems in the region, but a lot more
work needs to be done on the solutions. It demonstrates that the
north-east economy has a solid foundation on which long-term growth can
be built. The north-east has a good record of creating jobs. Some
67,000 jobs were created between 1998 and 2008, which was more than in
any other region. The north-east is also a trading powerhouse for the
UK economy. In 2011-12, it was the only area in England to record a
goods trade surplus. That is a real achievement. Our excellent export
record is a result of the high levels of foreign direct investment in
the region over the past 10
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000115">Of
course, the north-east economy has several key structural weaknesses
that will continue to hinder economic growth and job creation if they
are ignored. The two central problems are that there are too few
private sector jobs and too few high-skilled, highly paid service
sector jobs. That leads to lower productivity and income levels across
the region that are simply too low. The north-east has just 38
businesses per 1,000 working-age residents, whereas the national figure
is 60. That lack of businesses is a major factor in the high levels of
unemployment in the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000116">Despite
the abjectly chaotic regional growth fund and the dissolution of our
successful regional development agency, One North East, the north-east
continues to be a driving force in the re-emergence of the British
automotive industry. As the hon. Member for Burton (Andrew Griffiths)
said, Nissan is a huge success story. It is based in Sunderland, but it
benefits not only Sunderland, but the entire
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000117">The
Nissan plant employs 7,000 and a further 30,000 people are employed in
the supply chain. In the main, those are very highly skilled jobs. In
2011, the Nissan plant in Sunderland produced more than 480,000
vehicles. It has invested more than £3.6 billion in Sunderland
since 1984 and it continues to invest in innovation, most recently with
the Nissan Leaf, bringing further investment and jobs to our region.
Having lived in the region all my life, I have to say that Nissan was
brought there not by one person, but by all the parties and all the
people who are involved in industry in the north-east. The Nissan plant
demonstrates the importance of the UK’s membership of the
European Union to the creation of jobs in the north-east. The
uncertainty around a referendum is not helping investment and is
creating problems.</hs_Para>

have a huge role in bridging the gap between education and graduate
employment. I have no issue with the Russell Group, but we have
excellent universities in the north-east and not all of them are
Russell Group universities. As is noted in the report, the Institute
for Automotive and Manufacturing Advanced Practice and the university
of Sunderland have developed a centre of excellence in low-carbon
vehicle technology, which trains graduates with the skills that large
employers such as Nissan require. AMAP has introduced the first master
of science qualification in low-carbon technology, allowing engineers
in the LCV industry to study part time and gain vital advanced
qualifications in that fast-growing
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000119">On
the banks of the Wear, on the site of the old shipyards, the university
of Sunderland hosts the Institute for International Research in Glass
and the Ceramic Arts Research Centre. The National Glass Centre is part
of the university and it offers a glass and ceramics degree in which
students can work with professionals in state-of-the-art facilities.
That is a fine example of education working with industry to develop
the right skills, abilities and network of contacts to build a
career.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000120">As
has been said, participation in higher education is lower in the
north-east than in the UK as a whole. Something needs to be done about
that. The increasing adoption of science, technology, engineering and
maths qualifications is vital if we are to provide the highly skilled
work force that our advanced manufacturing sector needs. Employers
often report problems in recruiting people with the right skills. It is
vital that we enable more employers to take on long-term apprentices to
produce people with the level 3 and above qualifications that are
needed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000121">Rebalancing
the economy is not a meaningless platitude, nor does it mean hampering
London’s competitive advantage in banking and finance. It simply
means recognising that growth, jobs and rising productivity in regions
such as the north-east are vital if we are to see sustainable,
long-term economic growth nationally. I urge the Government to take
note of the report, empower councils and give LEPs the powers and
access to finance that they need to form partnerships with SMEs and
universities, so that they can help make the north-east the economic
powerhouse it clearly has the potential to
become.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-05?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_05_PT_1/232C28AD3537995E05E888F60D88F5EEA564FC66" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="5 September 2013">Thursday

welcome the high-quality report. I was slightly surprised at some of
the critical remarks about it in the opening speech, because I
understood it to be a bottom-up initiative by a lot of people in the
region, and therefore a good summary of what was happening and what
should be done. Lord Adonis said in his report that he had been
immensely stimulated by being in the region and meeting various people,
and had left “full of optimism”. That is certainly the
spirit in which we should see the future.</hs_Para>

five key aims set out in the report, especially the one about the
skills agenda. We saw in the news today that Dyson had said it would
employ 2,000 more people if only it could find the technical and
engineering staff that it needed. It is frustrating for me, in an area
of high unemployment, constantly to meet employers who say that they
cannot find the people they need. We also need more entrepreneurs in
the north-east. That is not well covered in the report, but we have one
of the lowest levels in the country of entrepreneurship and small and
medium-sized enterprises. There is plenty of room for growth
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000125">As
a Tees valley MP, I look at the report through the lens of that area,
and I would make one observation that is meant to be helpful. The
report is quite heavy on structures and low on dynamism and the private
sector. I know that there are real issues in the North East local
enterprise partnership area, but Tees Valley Unlimited is different in
that the local authorities come together in the LEP rather than as a
separate group. That leads to cohesion and also gives the LEP a strong
mandate for action. It remains to be seen how the north-east’s
structures will work in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090540000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0003.htm#13090540000126">Of
course, our region has been hit hard by the decline of traditional
industries, but it is recovering. As has been said, it is the only
region with a net trade surplus, and we are benefiting from the
Government refocusing on manufacturing. Recent figures show growth in
manufacturing, and Redcar steelworks had record production just a few

that instead of spraying money around all the regions of the country,
the Government have picked the regions that actually need it. The
limited amounts of money are coming to areas such as the north-east.
The recent announcements of 
<?notus-xml column=558?>EU funding are of course welcome, and I congratulate the Government on
taking only a small slice of it, as opposed to the 50% slice that I
believe the previous Government took. The EU’s recognition of

remember the late Baroness Thatcher telling the country that
engineering and manufacturing were the past. It was that relentless
pursuit of a service-led economy that saw the level of employment in
the north fall by 1.3 million between 1979 and 1987. The associated
devastating impact on our communities is still felt today. It is not
good for the north-east, or the UK as a whole, to have a deep and
growing divide. A one nation economy needs an innovative and dynamic
north-east. The region already has world class institutions,
businesses, universities and of course people, not to

Fundamentally, this Government do not believe in regional policy, so
they have come up with two LEPs. They have no cash, but a nice report

it has to be matched by another £500 million, either from

quarter, Durham county council is going to lose £209 million.
What are the Government doing with that money? They are giving it to
their friends in the south of England. Let us look at the local

just over two hours. That is what we have to do—invest in that,

we had the RDA, which could step in and rightly did so when the

consensus that has existed in the region for some time, particularly
about the importance of skills and the need for higher skills if we are
to secure more and better jobs. The proposal to increase

Scandinavia, the Baltic States and Russia. It also rightly points out
that a number of important infrastructure projects could fruitfully be
invested in, especially transport projects. We are talking not just
about the inadequate road links with Yorkshire, over the Pennines and
to Scotland, but about the bus services that have been decimated

The final section, entitled “Re-balancing the economy”,
lists the milestones that have been set for the end of the

institutional capacity. No one objects to the notion that local

deal with the skills shortages. In the time I have left, I want to
place on the record my thanks and congratulations to Northumberland
college, in my constituency. It is delivering a range of different
things. It is now offering up to 28 different apprenticeship frameworks
and has more than 700 apprentices. It is also leading the way locally,
having established an employment skills forum, with the aim of driving
up skills and employment in Northumberland. We are looking to increase
employer and individual engagement and investment in skills; support
individuals to gain sustainable employment by improving employability;
and strengthen joint working between employers, employer groups, skills
networks, universities, colleges, other skills providers and the local
authority. The college has done a marvellous job. It is only a matter
of a year ago that we could have lost a college that is much needed in
the area of south-east Northumberland; it could have been subsumed into
a huge university in the area, so I was delighted at what
happened.</hs_Para>

huge need for the skills gap to be narrowed in my constituency. We have
the people, but they are, sadly, unemployed, because the jobs just are
not there. Where there are jobs we face a problem with skills. We have
the colleges and schools now working together to try to encourage
people to join. We have the employers now sitting around the table with
the colleges and schools. We are now looking at the whole situation,
hoping that we will eventually get together to make Wansbeck a place
where employment succeeds.</hs_Para>

right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown) on
securing this debate, as well as all other right hon. and hon. Members
who supported our bid for it, and the Backbench Business Committee for
giving us an opportunity to discuss this important report. In the time

east Durham, as you might expect me to do, Mr Speaker.</hs_Para>

over-critical, and while acknowledging the contributions of everyone
who has been involved in preparing the report, not least Lord Adonis,
we might be able to offer some reflections that might be helpful in
determining a strategy that can produce the best results possible in
terms of generating the maximum numbers jobs and growth in the region
that we care so much about. As other right hon. and hon. Members have
said, we need to address issues that concentrate on process. The one
thing that stood out in my mind when I was looking at the report was
that it is spatially blind. In other words, it does not concentrate on
people or place. In an area such as mine, Easington in east Durham,
which is away from the urban core, that will present a particular
problem.</hs_Para>

to dwell too much on what has happened in the past, but it is important
to inform our opinion and reflect on what has worked in the past and
what perhaps has not. Some policies, incentives and strategies have
been successful, whereas others have been less so. The collective view,
if I may venture an opinion, is that our regional development agency,
One North East, which was abolished by the coalition Government, was
pivotal in acting as a pole of attraction, not only to bring in
overseas investment, but to encourage growth from small and
medium-sized enterprises already located in our region. I could list a
number of companies in my constituency that were helped by One North
East.</hs_Para>

emphasise my support for the concept of a Minister for the north-east
and pay tribute to my right hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle upon
Tyne East for his sterling work in support of projects in the area.
Some, such as the centre for creative excellence, did not come to
fruition but it could have created more than 1,000 jobs and many
hundreds of training places, giving a vista of opportunity to young
people in east Durham. Sadly, however, that project is on the back
burner, shall we say, because of a lack of funds. I will not go into
the precise problems, but it looked at one point as though that it
would have come to fruition. That would have been a real boost not just
for east Durham but for the region and for our further education
colleges and universities.</hs_Para>

important to audit our physical and non-physical assets. East
Durham’s physical assets include advanced modern office and
factory units, and road and rail transport infrastructure, including
Seaham, County Durham’s only port. We have a modern multi-modal
distribution terminal—ship, rail and road—and industrial
and commercial land, including the large industrial site to which I
referred earlier. We have an automotive supply chain and opportunities
to develop port-related activities, including distribution. Those are
assets on which we could build.</hs_Para>

people assets. The hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) said that not
enough students from our region went to the Russell Group universities.
We have some world-class universities in the region and many do not get
the praise they deserve. Teesside has links and synergies with the
chemicals industry and Sunderland is one of the best universities for
pharmacology. I am sure that there are examples from all our
universities and they are a real asset that we should build on. Our
work force are skilled, interchangeable and adaptable. All those things
provide opportunities to develop new skills or more advanced skills for
potential employees moving in to the area.</hs_Para>

have a stock of physical and non-physical assets in east Durham, it is
important that we market them effectively to potential investors. How
we can best achieve that is the $64,000 question. The LEP must
recognise that all economic growth and investment cannot be channelled
into the urban hubs in the core cities. Although I welcome the
establishment of the combined local authorities, they might need to
consider particular needs and the targeting of sector-specific support
in particular places, especially those on the periphery of the urban
core. I am thinking, perhaps selfishly, about Seaham in my constituency
and the former new towns, such as Peterlee, which are less strongly
connected to growth centres. I know that there are other similar 
<?notus-xml column=569?>examples in other Members’ constituencies, such as Redcar. I feel
that the LEP should have a stated commitment in its strategy to tackle
what I describe as economic  cold spots in the
region—those that suffer particular disadvantage, such as east
Durham and south-east Northumberland. I know that there are
others.</hs_Para>

pay attention to what is happening in the EU. There will be a number of
reports, including the fifth cohesion report, that will inform the next
round of European regional development fund funding. We must take
account of that and ensure that we have an effective place-based policy
to get the maximum benefit from investment in goods and services to
stimulate growth in our area.</hs_Para>

completely support the recommendation to encourage foreign students to
attend our universities to diversify the region, but it flies in the
face of much of the Government’s policy on immigration and
learning academies. The Government seem to disregard completely the
fact that international students not only attend lectures, write essays
and sit exams, but import money into local economies, create new
enterprises, support 
<?notus-xml column=570?>work with local industry, and make vast academic, cultural and financial
contributions to regions such as the north-east of
England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000011">Another
significant—if not the most significant—aspect of the
report is transport. It is essential that the north-east’s links
to national and international economies are improved, so I welcome
proposals to pool funding from the various authorities to deliver a
regional transport strategy, which would hopefully result in improved
roads and rail, bus and metro
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000012">I
use the word “hopefully” because funding is essential to
achieve those aspirations, but I am not convinced that the Government
are willing to put their hands in the coffers for the north-east to the
extent that they are for other parts of the country. In response to
that assumption, Ministers might say that I am over-sceptical, given
the announced improvements to the A1 in my constituency at the Lobley
hill pinch point. Although I am delighted by such overdue improvements,
the region should not be settling for scraps off the table. We should
be demanding the best and most effective transport systems that are on
offer for other regions in the country, yet let us consider spending
per head on transport infrastructure projects by region. A report
published by the Institute for Public Policy Research in June called
“Still on the wrong track” highlights the distinct
disparities: the north-east receives only £5.01 per head of
population whereas Londoners receive £770 a head. When thinking
about national funding and taking into account the needs and special
requirements of the capital, we might rationally determine that it
should get twice, three times or five times the funding of other
regions, but should it get 154 times the funding of a region such as
the north-east? Such a thing is repeated year on year. If the roles
were reversed, the screaming of London Members in the Chamber would be
heard in Southend. I wonder how many Ministers have driven up the A1
north of Catterick and realised that it is no longer a motorway because
it peters out into a dual carriageway with the occasional crawler lane
as part of the motorway system.</hs_Para>

heard about Government proposals to introduce fines for people hogging
the middle lane on the motorway—chance would be a fine thing in
the north-east of England. There is no middle lane because there are no
three-lane roads; it is that bad. North of Newcastle, north of Morpeth,
the road peters out into a single lane in each direction between
Newcastle and Edinburgh. It is not good enough. The people of the

is fair to say that at times the north-east has an underserved
reputation in the media and, sadly, among some politicians. I get fed
up with those who do not know how fantastic my part of the world and
its inhabitants are, referring to the region as a cold, grim
and—dare I say it?— desolate place. I know better,
because it is my home. I am so proud of my region, and I am acutely
aware of its incredible strengths, which are ready to be harnessed by
Government and business. The real failure has been that of national
Government, who have overlooked those strengths and neglected our
needs, particularly when it comes to
infrastructure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000031">In
my constituency, more than one in 10 people are unemployed, including
over 1,000 18 to 24-year-olds. Economic stagnation under this
Government means that the number of people who have been out of work
for over 24 months is four times higher than it was a year ago.
Although students in my constituency received excellent GCSE and
A-level results at the end of last month, less than a quarter of them
will go on to higher education and fewer than one in 10 will start an
apprenticeship. The simple fact is that this Government refuse to admit
that there are not enough jobs and that, of those that exist, not
enough are highly skilled. Job creation and training are essential for
the north-east and its
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000032">The

is correct. Skills and training are an essential part of transforming
our economy. The review recommends establishing a “North East
Schools Challenge”, a dramatic expansion of the Teach First
programme in the region and the introduction of university technical
colleges, which will enable students to study technical skills
alongside their
GCSEs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000034">Apprenticeships
will have an important role to play. In South Shields there are more
apprentices over 25 than under, and the majority of them are
at the intermediate level 2, rather than the advanced level 3. It is
the  level 3 qualifications that employers, and particularly
manufacturers, favour. Local businesses in my area are going some way
toward remedying that. Ford Aerospace, 
<?notus-xml column=573?>a local manufacturer, is working in partnership with South Tyneside
college to take on 14 school leavers. They will have the potential to
earn national vocational qualification level 3 apprenticeships. The
port of Tyne, meanwhile, has taken on seven apprentices, including five
teenagers, with more to join later this
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000035">Ford
Aerospace and the port of Tyne also represent two of the areas that the
review highlights as the north-east’s strengths: manufacturing
and exports. The north-east’s well-known success as a
manufacturer has been maintained in recent years, as it continues to
outperform other areas of the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000036">It
is true that manufacturing provides high-skilled and high-paid jobs and
contributes to our local supply chains. The port of Tyne is one of our
great success stories, contributing an estimated £467 million
pounds to the region and helping to sustain an estimated 9,500 jobs.
But those businesses are not helped by infrastructure that is failing
through a lack of investment. The Government announced in the spending
review that the transport funding allocated to the north-east will be a
third lower than anticipated, and the Institute for Public Policy
Research North has revealed that transport project spending per head is
over 500 times higher in London than in the
north-east.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000037">The
second Tyne tunnel, which is in the constituency of my hon. Friend the
Member for Jarrow (Mr Hepburn) and feeds directly into mine, has been a
success story. By linking the north and south sides of the Tyne, it
dramatically reduces travelling times and increases economic activity

investment for the junctions on the north side and the south side is
not forthcoming.</hs_Para>

that the report says little about how smaller towns such as South
Shields with a heavy retail and tourist focus can make the most of the

strategy that takes advantage of the north-east’s characteristic

has been particularly striking and welcome about the debate is that no
speaker has been negative or despairing about our region. It is not a
failed region suffering inevitable or irreversible decline. As we heard
from my hon. Friends the Members for Sunderland Central (Julie
Elliott), for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) and for South
Shields (Mrs Lewell-Buck), it has real potential. That is reflected
today in the great news that Nissan will be spending £250
million on expanding its factory in Sunderland and increasing its work
force by 1,000 in order to become the first Nissan plant in Europe to
produce the luxury Infiniti model. The onesies in Wansbeck are also

single problem facing the north-east is skills and unemployment.
Unemployment in our region is 10.3%, and getting worse. The gap between
the region and the rest of the country is widening. This needs to be an
urgent priority for Government. What is the Minister going to do about
it? Will he explain how the abolition of the future jobs fund has
helped young people in the north-east to get a foot on the career path?
How has the cancellation of the education maintenance allowance helped
young people in the north-east to stay on in education or training to
get a skill or a trade that will get them a better job? How have savage
cuts in the public sector helped demand, economic activity and public
sector employment in the

and access to finance are essential if businesses in the north are to
succeed and grow. Yet the north-east is suffering just as much as other
regions, if not more. Notwithstanding the great news from Nissan and
Hitachi, the gap in foreign direct investment between London and the
regions is widening. The Ernst and Young attractiveness survey for 2013
found that investments in England outside London were 24% below their
level in 2010. The north-east secured 26 projects, which represented 4%
of the UK market share of FDI—better than the likes of Yorkshire
and the east of England but trailing behind comparable regions such as
the west midlands, the north-west and, crucially, the devolved nations,
and well behind London, which alone captured 45% market share of total
FDI. Ernst and Young

often, the absence of business investment is because firms have no

Minister for Universities and Science (Mr David Willetts):</Member></B>
I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman), the
hon. Member for Bishop Auckland (Helen Goodman) and the right hon.
Member for Newcastle upon Tyne East (Mr Brown) on securing this lively
debate. I have occasionally felt like I have found myself in a meeting
of the north-east parliamentary caucus, which is clearly a very lively
group. It just needs a little more political balance, but we are
working on that. This has been a very interesting discussion of what I
think is a very important
report.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000064">I
will start with the important opening speech by the right hon. Member
for Newcastle upon Tyne East. I recognise that he has great expertise
in this area. He criticised the Adonis report for focusing on
structures, but many of his own comments were, in turn, about
structures and organisations. He raised issues such as 
<?notus-xml column=577?>whether there should be regional Ministers. Let me make it clear that in
the last few months, we have established the Local Growth Cabinet
Committee, which is chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and is
directly involved in decisions on the powerful tools for regional
development that we have put in place. Notable among those is the
regional growth fund, from which the north-east has benefited
substantially, and the city deals, which offer enormous opportunities
for the cities that negotiate
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000065">I
was rather disappointed by the approach that the right hon. Gentleman
and several other Opposition Members took to the report. I hold no
particular brief for this report. Contrary to what the hon. Member for
Hartlepool (Mr Wright) said, it was not commissioned by the Government.
It was commissioned by the north-east for the north-east and produced
by a former Labour Cabinet Minister. I think that it is a valuable
report. We should congratulate the LEP on leading the way by producing
such an important and substantial report that really tackles the
economic challenges facing the
north-east.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000066">I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Hexham on taking the right
approach. He told the House that there will be a meeting in the
north-east tomorrow, where 400 delegates will assess the ideas in the
report. That will not be the final word, but I hope he will take to
that meeting the message that the Government take the report very
seriously indeed and consider it to be a high-quality piece of work. We
will not get bogged down in endless arguments about process. We look
forward to working with the LEP, local councils and local
representatives in rising to the challenge, which has just been set by
the hon. Member for Hartlepool, of raising further the growth and
economic performance of the north-east. That is what this is all
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000067">There
was a range of further contributions. I agreed with the hon. Member for
Sunderland Central (Julie Elliott) that we should focus not just on the
Russell Group, but look at the strength of all the universities in the
north-east. As Minister for Universities I have, of course, visited all
of them. They all have distinctive strengths, but they share a

hon. Member for Redcar (Ian Swales) made some important points about
the range of initiatives that are available to support economic growth.
I have referred briefly to the regional growth fund. He mentioned the
opportunities that are presented by enterprise zones and by securing
funding from the European Union. He spoke about the commitment on
access to superfast broadband, both urban and, very importantly, rural.
He also mentioned the good news that comes from major investment
decisions, such as that of Hitachi. A lot is going on, but there is
always more that needs to be
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000069">We
heard from the hon. Member for Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi
Onwurah) and then from the hon. Member for North Durham (Mr Jones), who
seemed to think that the review was a plot to ignore the views of
Labour MPs—a plot so subtle that it involved putting a former
Labour Cabinet Minister in charge of the exercise. He clearly has an
obsession with Lord Adonis, which is rivalled only by his obsession
with Wokingham. I do not think either obsession need detain us any
longer, as time is so tight, but I think I represent the only party in 
<?notus-xml column=578?>the House with which Lord Adonis has not had a political connection at
any point, so I can say that we should thank him for the important work
that he has led. Of course, I can also repeat our commitment to another

programme of transport investment, including the £314 million
scheme to upgrade 11 miles of the A1, which will begin in 2014, and the
£60 million scheme to improve a further stretch of the A1
between Newcastle and the Gateshead western bypass, which is due to
start by 2015. And yes, we will also be moving soon on the development
of funding for schemes on the A19. There are also smaller-scale pinch
point schemes—I have a note about them and will read it out, as
Opposition Members will know more about them than I do—that are

debate is core because of the consequences of the disastrous open-door
immigration policies pursued under the previous Labour Government, and
the efforts of this coalition Government to deal with them. This debate

numbers, or the effectiveness of current Government policies to deal
with that open-door policy. It is right that we have a debate about the
number of people allowed into this country, the growth of our
population and whether public services can manage. That is exactly
right; we should be doing that. Equally, it is right that we talk about
the efficiency and effectiveness of our border controls, so that we can

with some statistics. Every year, about 27,000 people are detained for
immigration purposes, of whom 4,000 are women. Of those, approximately
100 are pregnant women. One hundred women—that is what this
debate is all about. In the grand picture of immigration control, that
number barely registers, but in an assessment of what type of people we
are, and how we manage and care for those 100 women and the children
they are carrying, it matters a great
deal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000095">The
reason for detaining pregnant women is to achieve their removal. Home
Office policy states
that:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13090545000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000142">“Pregnant
women should not normally be detained. The exceptions to this general
rule are where removal is imminent and medical advice does not suggest
confinement before the due removal
date.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13090545000096" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000096">However,
the stated policy is not, in my view, and according to the evidence
that I have been given, being implemented in practice. In practice,
pregnant women are not being detained in exceptional circumstances
only. This concern has been raised by Medical Justice and Her
Majesty’s inspectorate of prisons, and the pregnant women are
not detained for periods of time that would match any description of
what an imminent removal would be.</hs_Para>

me that the UK Border Agency was not collecting information on the
detention of pregnant women, so questions could not be answered about
whether policy was being followed. With no information, how are we to
understand whether this important policy relating to vulnerable people
is being pursued correctly? I asked Medical Justice to review the 20
cases in its report. It found that the average detention period was 11
weeks, and that in four of the 20 cases the women were detained for 20
weeks or more. By no stretch can that be described as pursuing the
stated policy of the UK Border Agency.</hs_Para>

ago, I asked the Minister to ask the UK Border Agency to check its
facts. I appreciate his response, but I would like to ask him again
today, because collecting information is so important. Does he know how
many pregnant women are currently in detention? Can he advise the House
what the detention period has been for each of those women and for all
other pregnant women detained in the past 12 months? Is he satisfied
that the procedures for identifying pregnant women and applying the UK
Border Agency’s policies are being implemented fairly? Only 5%
of pregnant women who are detained are deported, with 95% released back
into the community. I would be interested to hear whether the Minister
could confirm those numbers. If he can, what is his assessment of their
implications for the efficacy of the UK Border Agency’s policy?
Spending more than £700 a week to keep a pregnant woman in
detention when we are going to release her, compared with spending
£150 a week to keep that lady in the community with people who
can support her, is the complete opposite of an efficient and effective
policy.</hs_Para>

another issue: our ethics. In my view, a pregnant woman who is in
detention is vulnerable almost by definition. The circumstances that
led her to that position will already be associated with heightened
vulnerability. She might have been seeking asylum or she might have
been trafficked. She might have been left on the streets and made
vulnerable in terms of accessing housing, which might then have made
her vulnerable to the actions and motivations of people who wanted to
provide her with housing. Then, while she is pregnant, she is put in
prison—we can use the language of “detention
centres” all we like, but it is a prison. That tells us
something about how we are treating people.</hs_Para>

utterly wrong to ignore the moral and ethical arguments. I am concerned
about the response of the UK Border Agency when ethical issues are
presented. Let me present two ethical differences and concerns of mine.
The first concerns the use of force to remove a pregnant woman, which
has now been resolved. In 2012, Her Majesty’s inspectorate of
prisons
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13090545000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000143">“Force
should never be used to effect the removal of pregnant women
or…children.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13090545000101" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000101">However,
only in February 2013, and only after a High Court case, did the
Government yield on that point. I do not understand the ethics of that.
That leads to another question. If we have accepted that force cannot
be used in the removal—as we have heard, only five out of 100
women are removed—why detain pregnant women at all?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090545000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000102">The second
ethical question relates to the medical guidelines for pregnant women
who are deported to countries with a high risk of malaria. That issue
was given particular focus in Medical Justice’s report. The NHS
guidelines for British citizens are quite clear: “If
you’re pregnant, do not travel to a country with a high risk of
malaria.” However, the UK Border Agency guidelines say:
“It’s okay to go, but take your
tablets”—have pill, will travel. Why the double standard?
It is important that the Minister is clear. Do we want to treat the
health of those who have come here in that way—I understand that
they are here illegally—differently when we deport them to other
countries, or do we think that the United Kingdom Government should
take the same approach in their treatment of all pregnant women? If he
accepts  
<?notus-xml column=583?>that point, which I hope he does, he must accept it
as another strike against the ethics and morality of detaining pregnant
women for immigration purposes.</hs_Para>

this Government are rightly focusing on reducing them and ensuring that

Minister for Immigration (Mr Mark Harper):</Member></B> I am grateful
to my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) for securing
this debate. As he acknowledged, he and I have had detailed discussions
on this issue. Yarl’s Wood, the principal immigration removal
centre holding female detainees, is located in his constituency, so I
completely understand his interest in this particular issue, both from
a policy and a constituency
perspective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000107">First,
I would like to emphasise that the decision to detain someone is never
taken lightly and only as a last resort. My hon. Friend acknowledged
that in his speech. Generally, when we decide that detention is
appropriate, we ensure that we take care of detainees’ welfare.
That obviously includes pregnant women, who have particular needs. He
set out the Government’s policy quite fairly. It is that we do
not, in general, detain pregnant women except in two sets of
circumstances. The first is when a woman’s removal from the UK
is imminent and medical advice suggests that her baby is not due before
the expected removal date. The second is, under the asylum system, when
the decision not to grant asylum would allow for the woman to be
removed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090545000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000108">I thought
that the statistics that my hon. Friend cited suggested that we were
doing as the policy required. He described the significant number of
people who were detained, then said that only 100 of those were
pregnant women. I think I have got that figure right; I was listening
carefully to his speech. That shows that we detain very few pregnant
women and that we do so only in the circumstances that I have
described.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=584?><hs_Para UID="13090545000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000109">We factor into
our decisions the timing issue that my hon. Friend raised. Obviously I
do not have the details of the specific case that he mentioned, but I
will explain in a minute why I do not think that that case would have
contravened our existing policy. We factor into the decision on timing
the International Air Transport Association’s guidelines to
airlines on carrying pregnant women, which provide for travel up to 28
weeks or, if medically certified, up to either 32 or 36 weeks depending
on the circumstances of the pregnancy. Women who are less than 24 weeks
pregnant may also be detained under the fast-track asylum process
operating at Yarl’s Wood, which would allow for a case to be
processed and, if appropriate—that is, if asylum is not
granted—for removal to take place within those time
frames.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000110">In
regard to the case that my hon. Friend described, I can give him only a
general answer as I do not have the details. If he would like to write
to me after the debate with those details, however, I will of course
look into the specifics of the case and correspond with him about them.
We might have detained the woman for removal, and the removal might
then not have gone ahead for a reason that was not anticipated at the
time. There might have been a further legal challenge, for example, or
perhaps a travel document was unavailable. Alternatively, she could
have been detained under the fast-track process prior to the 24-week
point. All those circumstances would fall within published policy, but
it would be better if my hon. Friend could furnish me with the details
of the specific case so that I can look into
it.</hs_Para>

Fuller:</Member></B> The Minister has just indicated in his answer the
very reason that the current policy does not work. It is based on
imminence, and imminence cannot be predicted, for the very reason that
he has just set out. He has therefore just stated why ending the
detention of pregnant women would be a clearer, fairer, better and more
moral policy. We are talking about 100 women. That is it. Would it not
say more about the ethics of his policy if he were to accept that
reality and stop the policy now, rather than pretending that the policy
is actually happening in
practice?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000112"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13090545000178" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000178">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> I do not agree with my hon. Friend for this
reason. The use of statistics was mentioned, but we do not collect
statistics on this matter because women are not, of course, obliged to
tell the Home Office whether they are pregnant. They may tell us, and
if they do, the information will be held on their individual case file
and they will be provided with appropriate health care, broadly
comparable to what is available from an NHS general practitioner. The
women are under no obligation to tell us, and I do not think forcing
them to disclose the information would be right. That is an issue about
the
statistics.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000113">Making
decisions about the imminence of removal is clearly based on our best
intelligence, but as we know, the people who have no right to be in the
United Kingdom and who should leave the country voluntarily often throw
all sorts of legal obstacles in the way. We may detain a woman when
removal is imminent and she may attempt to secure a last-minute legal
challenge to throw a roadblock in the way of her removal, and we have
no way of anticipating that before she does so. That provides my hon.
Friend with an example.</hs_Para>

do what my hon. Friend suggested and have a blanket policy of not
detaining women, first, having read many cases, I fear we would find
quite a lot of people saying they were pregnant as another method of
delaying their departure from the UK. I have seen people throw many
obstacles in the way when they have no right to be here, and I do not
want this to be one of them. We are committed to treating pregnant
women properly, providing proper health care and treating them well. I
do not want this to be an excuse that women who are not pregnant dream
up in order to throw a legal obstacle in the way. I fear that that
would be the result of adopting the blanket policy suggested by my hon.
Friend.</hs_Para>

follow-on policy from what my hon. Friend suggests would mean not
removing the women from the UK when they were pregnant and allowing
them to give birth to their child, but then seeking to remove both the
woman and the very young child from the UK to their home country or
country of origin—and I am not sure that that would be an
improvement. If I anticipate correctly, if we did that, we would then
be criticised for trying to remove the mother with her very young child
back to their country of origin. As I say, I am not sure that that
would be an improvement on the present situation, because the fact
remains that these women have no right to be in the UK: they should not
be here and they should leave voluntarily. <I>[Interruption.] </I>I

pregnant in order not to be detained. Secondly, it is quite easy to
find out whether someone is pregnant, so that bit of the
Minister’s excuse gave the lie to his hon. Friend’s very

carefully—that women would get pregnant; I said women would say
they were pregnant in order to throw a legal challenge. I know it is
perfectly easy to test whether women are pregnant, but we do not have
the right to do that. The Home Office does not have the right to insist
that a women disclose that she is pregnant. We do not have the right
forcibly to test people to see whether they are pregnant. If I were to
propose that, I doubt whether the hon. Lady would support it. To be
clear, I did not say that people would get pregnant;  I said
that they would say they were to throw a legal obstacle in the way of

The fact is that 
<?notus-xml column=586?>these women have no right to be in the UK and should leave. I am not

validate its assertions. The difficulty with giving my hon. Friend
overall statistics is that although when women provide the information
that they are pregnant, that information is held on their health
records, we do not log it statistically, and obviously we can do so
only when they disclose the information to us. Of course, in the early

hon. Friend’s point about advice to British nationals who are
travelling, he should bear in mind that these women are nationals of
their home countries, the countries where they should live. The NHS is
a national health service whose purpose is to provide health care for
citizens and residents of the United Kingdom. It is not an
international health service. I do not think that the comparison
between the health care that a woman would receive in the United
Kingdom if she lived here and the health care that is available in her
home country is relevant. Her home country is the country in which she
should live. It is not the job of the national health service to become
a health service for 
<?notus-xml column=587?>everyone in the world. If it were to do so, it would rapidly collapse,
and I do not think we want that to
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Richard Fuller" PimsId="5734" UID="13090545000185" xid="1004" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000185">Richard
Fuller:</Member></B> The Minister is right to say that the NHS is a
national and not an international health service, but that is not quite
the point that I was making. One of the consequences of losing control
of immigration is that people have been in this country for a long
period, and when people have spent a long period in another country,
their immunity to malaria is lowered. We are sending back pregnant
women with low immunity. Their health condition is not the same as the
health condition of a lady who becomes pregnant in her country of
origin. That is the comparison that I was trying to make. I certainly
do not want us to have an international health service, but I think the
Minister must accept that delaying the repatriation of people who are
here illegally has consequences in terms of their health status,
particularly when it comes to malaria. That is a key point for pregnant
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000127"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Harper" PimsId="4788" UID="13090545000186" xid="841" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000186">Mr
Harper:</Member></B> And that is exactly why we ensure that pregnant
women are given a course of anti-malaria medication. We also provide
them with mosquito nets, free of charge, to use in their countries of
origin. I am not sure that I follow the logic of my hon.
Friend’s argument. If we allowed those pregnant women to remain
in the United Kingdom and give birth here, we would still later be
removing both mother and child  to that same country of origin
where malaria may be prevalent.</hs_Para>

that we will not allow women to stay here when they do not have a right
to do so. Not only will their cases have been judged by the Home
Office, but a number of appeal routes will have been open to them, and
only when all those routes have been exhausted will we be in a position
to remove them from the country. We try to persuade people to return
home voluntarily, and that includes providing assistance when they are
in their home countries. Those whom we do detain—those to whom
my hon. Friend is referring—will be people who have no right to
be here. We will have tried to persuade them to leave voluntarily, and
to give them support that would help them to do so. Only when they have
refused all those offers of assistance and help from the United Kingdom
will we seek to enforce their removal. Therefore, by definition they
are people who are not co-operating in their removal from the United
Kingdom. That is why I anticipate that if we change the policy to the
one my hon. Friend suggests, people will use that to throw legal
obstacles in the way—not to do what the hon. Member for Slough
said, but at least to suggest to us that that is the case, which would
at least delay, if not stop, their
removal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090545000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/debtext/130905-0004.htm#13090545000129">I
am therefore unable to give my hon. Friend the outcome he desired. I am
very happy to continue this dialogue with him and to look into the case
he has raised with me, and if he thinks there are other cases where the
Government are not following the policy we have set out, I will look
into them. On his central request, however, I am afraid the Government
have no plans to change the current

Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> It gives me
great pleasure to introduce the report by the Select Committee on
Communities and Local Government, “Councillors on the
Frontline”. The title was changed between the initiation of our
inquiry and the eventual production of the report; I will explain in a
moment how the term “Councillors on the Frontline” came
about. It was changed from “Councillors in the
Community”, the first name that we chose.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000008">Councillors
do a vital job. I might even get agreement from the Minister on that.
Perhaps he will not agree with everything that I say from now on, but
that is certainly not a bad place to start. Councillors are on the
front line of service delivery and democracy, and they are the
lifeblood of our democratic system. I feel strongly about the
importance of the role that they play.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000009">Our inquiry
first considered who we wanted to take evidence from and how we should
take it. Obviously, we called Dame Joan Roberts, because of the Roberts
commission. It was a useful starting point for looking at what had been
done, but apart from that, we considered the matter afresh. We took
evidence from people; we did not go back to see what had or had not
been agreed in the past. We considered the role that councillors
perform and the current barriers and obstacles to their
performance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000010">We
took formal evidence from a variety of organisations, and, in the end,
from the Minister, but we also tried to go out and search for evidence
in a slightly different way. We began with a seminar of councillors
from a variety of authorities and of different statuses within
authorities. Some were cabinet members, some were leaders and some were
councillors whom we at first termed back-bench councillors. We took
evidence from them at those seminars, organised by the Local Government
Association.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000011">We had an
interesting visit to Sunderland to see what councillors were doing on
the ground. I see
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:32:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) nodding his head; I think that we all
found it interesting. They were genuinely trying to devolve power to
local councillors and local communities. That is where the title
“Councillors on the Frontline” came from. I asked a
colleague who remembered me from the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities many years ago, “What about your role now as a
back-bench councillor?” He said, “Clive,
I’m not  
<?notus-xml column=152?>a back-bench councillor; I’m a front-line councillor.”
I thought that that change in mindset was important, and we
took our report heading from it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000012">We took
evidence formally. We had a speed-dating session. I was not quite sure
what that was, but essentially, we got in a number of people, and
Committee members went around individually and chatted to them for 10
or 15 minutes each, taking information, ideas and views from them. That
was interesting, because we did not really invite councillors; we
invited people who had been councillors and given it up for whatever
reason, and people who were community activists but decided not to be
councillors. They were doing a vital role, but they had decided that
being a councillor was not for them, or they would have liked to be
councillors, but found certain obstacles in the way. That helped better
inform our understanding of the situation. It was an important
start.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000013">We
also considered the surveys that had been done on the composition of
councils. It is worrying—I know that the LGA is
worried—that the average age of a councillor in this country is
60. I want to make it clear that there are many excellent white male
councillors of retirement age doing a very good job, but equally
clearly, there are many women, young people and people from black and
minority ethnic communities who could be doing a good job as
councillors but are not. We considered that challenge right at the
beginning. It certainly influenced our discussions thereafter. The fact
is that 69% of councillors are men, 96% are white and 45% are over
retirement age. They are not reflective of their communities in that
sense. That issue was clearly flagged up at the beginning in the
information that the Committee received.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000014">We know that
the role of councillors is changing significantly, and we reflected
that. The development of the cabinet system over the years has changed
councillors’ role, as has the fact that they are involved in
scrutiny. Scrutiny committees did not exist when I was a councillor
back in the 1980s. Even where the cabinet system has been introduced,
councils have responded to it and dealt with it in different ways, but
there is clearly now a role for front-line councillors who represent
their community—they have been called facilitators, civic
entrepreneurs and a variety of other names—to go out and engage
with their communities in a practical and meaningful way.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000015">Different
councils do that differently. We saw evidence in Sunderland of a
proactive approach to training and encouraging councillors, setting up
area committees with area budgets and an area manager and encouraging
councillors to meet and work with other public bodies, schools and
voluntary groups. Those councillors had some power and influence to get
things done in those communities. When we visited one of the local area
committees, we said to the leader of the opposition, who happened to be
a councillor in that ward, “What do you make of all
this?” He said, “As a ward councillor, I think
it’s great. It actually works. I have influence, and I can get
things done in my local community. My local community can come to me
knowing that. That has been a change. But as leader of the opposition,
I think it’s a long step backwards, because now I have many
fewer things that I can complain about to the local newspapers. Things
are done better and more responsively to the needs of local
constituents.” I thought that that was a powerful and honest
message.</hs_Para>

our report on localism earlier in this Parliament, we encouraged
councils to look at the second level of localism and devolution. It was
right that Government should push powers down to councils—we can
have views about how well or badly that has been done—but
councils should be encouraged to do so as well, in a variety of ways.
It would be down to local councils to do that in their own way in their
own area. Circumstances will be different in different parts of the
country, but we certainly encouraged that in our report.</hs_Para>

report on the co-operative council, we went to Lambeth, where my hon.
Friend the Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed), who was then the leader
of Lambeth council, showed us examples of what happens on the ground.
My neighbouring authority, Barnsley, has just produced a report about
developing area and ward budgets on a stronger basis. Again, lots of
councils of all political persuasions are doing that, and it should be
welcomed. It gives a much more meaningful role for all the councillors
in a local authority. We recognised and recommended such action, and we
thought that the LGA could play a role by identifying examples of good
practice, not so that everyone would do things in the same way, but so
that individual councils could be aware of what happens in other areas
as well. We were pleased with what we saw in
Sunderland.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000018">We
know that councils are going through a time of great change. The
localism agenda has certainly produced changes, as have the housing
revenue account reforms, which the Committee welcomed, and the city
deals, which is one of the best things that this Government have done.
In my authority, thanks to the city deal, the council is taking on
powers over apprenticeships and economic development. That is positive.
The working relationship with local enterprise partnerships is another
change, as are public health changes, on which we also did a report
recently, the commissioning of adult care and the development of
combined authorities.</hs_Para>

challenges for councils. At one time, one could be a councillor for 10
years and nothing much would change in terms of how councils ran. An
awful lot has changed. It changed in previous Parliaments, and it has
changed a lot in this Parliament. It is a bit challenging for councils
to keep abreast while carrying on doing their important and difficult
job.</hs_Para>

said—perhaps this is one area where the Minister will not
necessarily agree with me—that we were not always sure that
ministerial comments were helpful to councils in doing their job. Over
the summer, we have heard how councils can better manage their parking
arrangements, how parking can be organised on double-yellow lines, and
how they can put their bins in better places. They have been accused of
being democracy duckers for not holding referendums, because they did
not put the council tax up by more than 2%. Most of those matters are
for local councils to decide. If the Secretary of State is always
second-guessing things right down to the minute detail, it gives the
impression that somehow councillors cannot be trusted to get on and do

saying to the Committee. We made that point in our recommendations

hon. Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill) is here, and in
his previous life as a Minister, he spoke about what I thought was an
important concept: he said that it was not a matter of postcode
lottery, but of postcode choice. We should not be against postcode
choice; if councils make that choice rationally and properly, we should
encourage them to do so as an important part of localism. I certainly
think that, and I believe that the Committee would concur.</hs_Para>

the composition of councils, we were concerned about the age of
councillors, the balance of men and women, and the balance of those
from white and BME communities. They are not representative, they do
not properly reflect their communities, and that is not healthy for
democracy. To some extent, we recognise that it is the political
parties’ job to sort that out. Representatives from the parties
gave evidence to us, and we were encouraged and pleased that they all
seemed to recognise the problem. They have different ways of addressing
it—women-only shortlists is something we do in the Labour party,
but I know that the Conservative party is not convinced by
that—but at least everyone who gave evidence appreciated the
problem and wanted to do something about it.</hs_Para>

we were not always convinced, in the case of any party, that the
promises made at national level were necessarily being communicated,
dealt with and implemented at a local level. All the parties still have
to look at and deal with that challenge, but if we get this right, we
can encourage a lot more people to come into local government. That
will help stimulate local government and create a greater vibrancy. New

Betts:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that—I
think—but I will not be led down the road of discussing a debate
that happened in Parliament this morning. However, I think there is a
case for such training. I pointed out the major financial changes in
local government that councils are having to deal with, but of course,
we have to deal with those as Members of Parliament, too.</hs_Para>

Committee, for example, we have tried to get more briefings from the
Scrutiny Unit in Parliament, which is an excellent resource, and from
the National Audit Office, which is trying to work more closely with
us, so that we can understand some of the complicated technical
issues—which I am sure that the Minister can explain to us, if
he wishes, at any point in time. We are all trying to grapple with
these issues, and I agree that training is important for us as well. It
is also important that we try and reach out to potential councillors
and potential candidates, and that parties and local councils work on
that as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000032">We
looked at the barriers, why we have an unrepresentative group, and why
certain people feel it is just not for them. Perhaps they would like to
be a councillor, but they do not become one. Time is a factor. Flippant
comments are often made, such as “Well, it’s only a
part-time job, a few hours a week”. I do not think it is; the
ward work alone can be demanding. Cabinet members clearly have larger
time commitments, but if someone is on a scrutiny committee and they
are going to do what we saw in Sunderland, where ward councillors are
taking decisions through area committees and are spending money, that
is also a time commitment. It is easier for retired people than it is
for people who work, which is why more retired people tend to go on
councils. That is a fact, but it is also a challenge and a
barrier.</hs_Para>

remember a time in Sheffield when all the major steelworks would almost
vie with each other. One would say, “We’ve got two
councillors on the council”, while another would say,
“We’ve got three.” They all saw giving time off as
a badge of honour. I accept that it is easier for large organisations
employing thousands of people to do that than it is for small
businesses, but it is a challenge to try and ensure that being a
councillor is an opportunity open for many people in all walks
of life.</hs_Para>

part of our process, we talked to young people, some of whom had been
councillors and had given up. One reason was that young people start
off, perhaps prepared to make a sacrifice about having a job, but
eventually, they have to get a job, and the employer starts saying,
“I’m sorry, time off really isn’t—well,
maybe we can find you half a day every fortnight.” They cannot
really do the job in that regard.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>We heard from a
councillor—I think she was a Conservative councillor—who
said she was trying to get a job, and the jobcentre told her to take
the fact that she was a councillor off her CV, because if anyone saw
it, they would not employ her. That is really worrying. We ought to
give proper attention to that, and the Government have to address it as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:47:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

help councillors by providing better admin and clerical assistance.
Again, there is a worry that such things get squeezed and scrapped when
councillors are, understandably, trying to protect front-line
services from cuts. We looked at what is happening in the
Ministry of Defence. We made the following recommendation:</hs_Para>

Ministry of Defence is giving serious consideration to the ways in
which employers can be encouraged to support military reservists. The
Department for Communities and Local Government should conduct a
similar review. We recommend that the Government consult on how

as

are not saying that it has to be exactly the same as the MOD, but at
least if the Government were out there saying to employers, “We
think this is important. We think serving as a councillor in your
community is something we should encourage people to do”, having
that ministerial steer would be helpful. Do a review. Work with the
LGA. At least recognise it as a problem, Minister, because it is a
problem, as was clearly shown in our own evidence.</hs_Para>

am getting towards the end of my comments. We also raised the issue of
allowances. Given the press comments and ministerial responses made
initially about our report, one would have thought the only thing we
said was that all councillors should be paid more. Actually, we did not
say that anywhere in the report. We raised the issue of allowances
because it was raised with us in evidence as a problem—it was an
evidence-based report; that is what Select Committee reports are. We
did not recommend, as I say, that allowances should be increased. We
got the evidence clearly that councillors, in some cases, were not well
paid.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000038">We did not
agree with the idea of having a national rate for councillors, because
we recognise the big differences in the job that councillors do in
different authorities, and in the jobs that various councillors do.
However, we were generally persuaded that councillors had the right to
expect an appropriate level of compensation for the time and loss of
earnings. Both are important; it is about the time that councillors put
in, often at weekends and evenings, but it is also about the time that
those in work give up, and the loss of earnings as a result, which is
often a risk.</hs_Para>

Pawsey</B> (Rugby) (Con):</Member> To reflect on the speed-dating
exercise that we did, the allowances came across as being a substantial
sum of money. For someone who is very young, and perhaps not yet in
their first job, it is a substantial payment, but for people in
full-time work, the allowances were relatively modest. That is one
reason why the analogy with reservists is particularly
interesting.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:49:16"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Betts:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman virtually anticipates my next
point, which is that we met young people who were happy in that
situation. Perhaps they had just been to university and were used to
living on student loans and earnings. They had moved on to being a
councillor and, as a first step in life—perhaps they had got
some part-time work as well—that was okay. However, once they
started to get permanent employment and to move up the income scale,
being on the council suddenly caused them significant loss and, if they
had got into relationships and had children, the loss was very
off-putting and became a barrier. We talked to people who had joined a
council at a relatively young age and, when they got to 30, they did
not stand again or perhaps they did two terms and then did not stand
again. That was a very serious
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:50:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000041">We
heard from councillors that they did not put up allowances because they
were concerned about the public and press reaction, which is something
that councillors have to live with, but we also heard that very often
they did not put up allowances because there were enough people on the
council who felt that they were okay. People with a private income or
who were retired had no great incentive to put up the allowances. The
people who were in work and relying on that money to replace lost
earnings were in a minority, so they could not get an increase in
allowances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:50:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000042">We
therefore made two recommendations to the Government, but Ministers
dismissed them and I am very disappointed about that. We said,
“Look, Parliament has had this problem.” We had gone
through all the traumas about how we fix our pay, so we said that the
issue should be dealt with by an independent body. We said, “Set
it up and then we have nothing more to do with the issue—hands
off.” I think that the public understand that. Sometimes I think
that Members of Parliament have a little difficulty understanding or
appreciating it. The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority is
not always everyone’s flavour of the month, but it is an
important step for us to say, “We don’t decide our
pay.” Why should councillors not be allowed to take that step if
they want to do so? They can set up independent panels now to advise
them, but we heard from one witness after another who said,
“Yes, we had independent advice and a recommendation, but we
felt we couldn’t accept it. It was all too difficult.”
Why not at least give councillors the option to be able to delegate
absolutely, just as MPs have
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:51:45"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000043">We
suggested one other power, which I do not think councillors have now,
not merely to give an allowance, but to give a loss-of-earnings
payment. It could be capped; it could be limited; it could be instead
of part of the allowance, but I think that the public will get it. If
someone loses money and can show that they have lost money by being
away from work to do their council work, why should they not be
recompensed for that in a specific way that I think the public could
understand? Ministers dismissed that and said, “The allowance is
there. It gives people compensation.” It does not. We heard
evidence from people on that.</hs_Para>

for most councillors is that once they start getting better-paid jobs,
the allowance does not cover their loss of earnings, let alone anything
for all the work that they do at the weekend and in the evening, which
comes out of their family time. I do not know why Ministers cannot be a
bit more relaxed about saying, 
<?notus-xml column=158?>“This is reasonable.” It used to happen previously, before
the allowance system was brought in. It was possible to award loss of
earnings then. I certainly received such payments when I first went on
a council and I think that such a system would be useful if councils
wanted to adopt
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:52:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000045">I
say this to the Minister just in passing. We did not have before us the
incredibly mean proposals about councillors’ pensions, which
came after the Select Committee report. It is one thing to say to
people, “Lose your family income or have less family
income”—because it is family income, not just an
individual’s income—“now as a councillor.”
It is another to say, “Because you are off work and not able to
pay into your pension scheme as much as you otherwise would have done,
for ever and a day once you retire, your pension will be reduced as a
result of the effort that you put in as a councillor—for being a
councillor.” I just do not think that is fair. It is
unreasonable. I can understand why the LGA and others have got very
upset about that proposal. The Government could avoid that; they could
row back from the proposal. It is another barrier for people who are in
work and thinking about becoming a
councillor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T13:53:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000046">As

Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), on the “Today”

said, “Really, councillors shouldn’t be paid much,

councillors had been upset with the Government about other things, they
were even more upset after that. I am thinking of the number of

Vickers</B> (Cleethorpes) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship, Mrs Brooke. By way of background, perhaps I
should say that I served 26 years as a local councillor,
which I know is more than people get for murder. It was a great
privilege to take on that role. I saw it change over many years. I had
the opportunity of serving on a district council, in a two-tier system,
and when, thankfully, the county of Humberside was abolished, I was
able to serve on one of the unitary authorities that replaced it, so I
have seen the role from both perspectives.</hs_Para>

2 of the report is entitled “Localism and the role of
councillors”. I support the Government’s determination to
free up councils from the continuous moves towards more and more
central direction—something that I experienced in the whole of
the period 
<?notus-xml column=160?>for which I was a councillor. I sincerely hope that the Government will

principle, I support greater community involvement, but we must ensure
that we retain decision making by democratically accountable
authorities. It is tempting to create community groups and so on, and I
can think of many good examples of those in my constituency, but the
truth is that they are not entirely representative of the community
from which they hail. I attended a meeting of the Haverstoe community
forum in my constituency last month—30 to 40 dedicated people
who wanted improvements to their local area. Those of us who have
attended public meetings and the like over the years know that it is
only when there is a really big decision, usually concerning planning
or perhaps the closure of a school or hospital, that the community
turns out in force. Otherwise, only a limited number of people are
involved and they are certainly not
representative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:00:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000060">If
we are to attract people into becoming councillors, the job must be
seen to be worth while. By that, I mean that there must be real
opportunities to take decisions that affect local communities. Too
often in the past 25 to 30 years, successive Governments of all
persuasions have felt the urge to create more quangos of various
descriptions, usually taking decision-making away from democratically
elected councillors. That is to be deplored and I hope to see gradual
moves to change the situation. People want to get involved and shape
their police service or local health services, for example. There are
opportunities to do that, but there are limited opportunities to do it
within the context of a decision-making authority.</hs_Para>

row in my area at the moment, following a £25,000 increase in
the salary of the chief executive of the local hospital trust.
I would like to think that such things would be constrained,
at least to some extent, if there was democratic
accountability—looking at the rates of pay for council chief
executives, perhaps that is a vain hope. Nevertheless, we must not
undermine our local authorities by creating more bodies that have no
electoral mandate.</hs_Para>

Fascinatingly, there are two types of councillors: those who are

councillors. A marriage between the two provides the best service to
the local community.</hs_Para>

too, share the concerns about outsourcing highlighted in the report.
Too often, there is an assumption, one way or the other, sometimes
governed by politics, that either in-house or outsourced is better. In
fact, there is no magic formula. I have seen good and bad examples of
both, but where we do outsource, it is essential that elected members
have control, can still raise issues on behalf of their constituents
and have access to the performance evidence that shows either failure
or success, or, as is more likely, something in
between<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:04:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:04:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Under the current constraints, many local authorities have to
outsource. The all-party-supported Public Services (Social Value) Act

turn to the structure of local government. Paragraph 30 is headed
“Unitary authorities”. I have served in two-tier and
single-tier systems, and I say unequivocally that unitary is by far the
superior structure. My view, not widely shared, is that we should move
to unitary authorities headed by an elected mayor, leaving, I hasten to
add, parish councils as they are, because they play a vital role. A
streamlined structure and an elected mayor—someone with their
own mandate—who is recognisably in charge would provide a better
service. Mayors could act as ambassadors for their local areas and,
like Back-Bench Members, be another thorn in the side of Government,
which will do no harm at all.</hs_Para>

serve under your chairmanship, Madam Chairman. I congratulate my hon.
Friend the Member for Sheffield 
<?notus-xml column=164?>South East (Mr Betts) and his Committee on their report. I am delighted
to take part in this debate. It is very important to me, as I believe
that I am the most recently arrived former council leader in the House.
I also had the huge honour of serving as deputy chairman of the Local
Government Association until I came here nine months
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000088">From
my experience, I can confirm what the report says: that the role of the
councillor is changing fast. It is becoming much more demanding, not
least because the expectations of citizens and Government are
increasing at a time when resources are dramatically reducing in ways
that no one involved in local government can remember in their
professional lives. Councillors give up a huge amount of their time to
help make their communities better places in which to live or work, and
that causes, as my hon. Friend the Member for Sheffield South East
mentioned, problems for them in their work and home lives. I had the
experience that he had also heard of: a councillor came to me when I
was leader of the council in Lambeth and said that she had been told to
remove her experience as a councillor from her CV to help her get a
job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000089">If
that is how the world views the role of the councillor, it behoves all
of us involved in public life to help change that reputation and
promote the truth of the matter, which is that the role helps develop
skills and abilities that are of immense value elsewhere in
individuals’ working lives. It would be good if more employers
understood that and if the Government reinforced it, by treating
councillors more like military reservists and perhaps promoting the
idea that they should be given time off to carry out their important
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000090">I
agree that we need a much more diverse and representative group of
councillors representing our communities. We need more women, more
young people and more people from black, Asian and minority ethnic
communities. During my time as leader of the opposition in Lambeth, up
until 2006, we ran a three-year programme that identified people from
precisely those groups, offering them shadowing, mentoring and
training, and supporting them to stand as councillors. We were
delighted in 2006 when that bore fruit, with the biggest increase in
BME representation anywhere in the country that year. That model has
been used by all parties in other places but, sadly, it is not yet used
everywhere. I commend the LGA for its work, through the Be a Councillor
campaign, to extend such
models<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000091">To
return to my point about the need to promote the positive role of

opposite of what is needed by denigrating councillors’ work.
Certainly the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:20:26"></hs_TimeCode>

Secretary of State’s proposal to abolish councillors’
pensions is nothing short of spiteful, especially given that he, as a
Member of Parliament, is fully aware that he is very nicely sorted out
in that respect. Councillors’ remuneration is certainly not
excessive. The average payment to a councillor is £7,000 per
annum. I do not think that that over-compensates them for
their work and the time and potential income, if they are self-employed
or employed, that they give up to carry out their important

disappointing to hear the chairman of the Conservative party, the right
hon. Member for Welwyn Hatfield (Grant Shapps), compare the role of a

multi-million pound organisations, employ thousands of people and are

the current comprehensive spending review was announced, it was
disappointing to see the Secretary of State in effect fiddling the
figures, in my view, by adding to the base sums of money that were
never within local government responsibility in the first place before

make the overall cut in funding for local authorities look smaller than
it really

is worth commenting that, in reality, local government is getting a
bigger percentage cut than any national Department. The National Audit
Office confirms that local government is the most efficient tier of
government. We should look to local government to learn lessons, not
demonise it to allow the national Government and national Departments
to get away with smaller efficiencies than they could

as I regularly hear Ministers do, that councils can lose what amounts
to up to 50% of their discretionary funding without that affecting
front-line services, through some kind of imagined and miraculous
efficiency savings, is a ludicrous position to adopt and demeans those
who mouth it. That would be a feat that no public service organisation
has managed to deliver, and it is a fiction by Ministers that is worthy
of nomination for the Man Booker prize. It should certainly not be
thrown into a debate about the future funding and resourcing of vital
public services on which our communities

need for localism is growing like never before. The Government like to
talk local, but they often centralise decision making under a veil of
language—the opposite of what they are saying. It is true that
not only this Government but every Government I can remember have
behaved liked that. I hope that if there is a Labour Government after
the next election, they will genuinely seek to devolve power to local
government, and localise it, in a way that we have not seen
before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:24:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000099">Local
government is finding out and identifying new ways to run public
services that take account of the drastic reductions in public service
funding over recent years. In my view, the business model for local
government is bust: it cannot continue in the future in the same way as
in the past, because the reduction in resources is so drastic. Funding
has changed dramatically, and so too have the expectations of citizens,
who want more choice over public services and want those services to be
more 
<?notus-xml column=166?>responsive to their needs.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:25:47"></hs_TimeCode> must face up
to the fact that top-down public services have had negative
consequences, including in sapping the self-reliance of some
individuals who have become heavily dependent on them, so capping their
aspirations to lead better lives.
Many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:26:12"></hs_TimeCode> councils of
all parties, recognising those points, are considering how to transform
public services by empowering citizens and co-producing services with

communities can define for
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000100">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:26:30"></hs_TimeCode>
16 Labour councils that form the co-operative councils innovation
network—one of the groups looked at by the Select Committee

Edinburgh city council, which is run by a coalition between Labour and
the Scottish National party, is considering a model of city-wide child
care co-operatives that aims to reduce costs, but increase
accessibility for parents across the city. Rochdale has mutualised its
entire housing stock to give council housing tenants more control over
how its housing is managed and how decisions about their lives are
taken. The council that I used to lead, Lambeth, has just set up a
youth services trust that aims to give more control to communities
affected by the scourge of violent gun crime over the services and
interventions that will make a difference in getting young people out
of crime, steering their lives back on track and helping them become
more productive
citizens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000101"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>In
all those cases, it is vital to engage citizens and harness their
insights and views about the services that they believe will tackle the
problems they face. That must be central to the reform of public
services in years to come. I am afraid that councillors across the
country, not parliamentarians, are leading that transformation, and
Parliament will have to learn from local government how to make it
happen. Given that situation now, I plead with Ministers to stop
demeaning the role of members of local authorities or local
councillors, because the job they are doing is potentially
transformative for public services across the whole
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000102">In

There is a world of difference between serving as a back-bench
councillor on a small district council and serving as an executive
mayor or the leader or a cabinet member of a unitary authority. We must
accept that there is a range of differences, and that a national
template cannot be imposed on them. An error that the earlier
Councillors Commission made—I am glad to say that the report has
not made it—was to try to impose national minimums for
remuneration and so on. The Government are right to say that allowing
councils to outsource their remuneration policies to an independent
body—although it is useful to have such a body to
advise—runs the risk that it does not then calibrate effectively
to that change in local circumstances. We must always be honest and up

Ministers; the ministerial pension scheme is being revised—and
it is happening to civil service pensions and to local government
officers’ pensions. We cannot escape the fact that doing
otherwise would send a message that is rather at variance with the

officer-led, and if the elected members are not around enough to ensure

reasons. First, I am firmly of the view that 
<?notus-xml column=171?>the best councils are member-led and that good officers respond more
effectively to strong member leadership, so having such strong
leadership is in everybody’s interests. Secondly, however, that
does not mean that we must have a massive professionalisation. I have
already made the point that often there are differences in roles, for
example, in London boroughs such as the ones with which he and I are
best acquainted. There is the world of difference between the
commitment of the leader and the cabinet, and that of a
back-bench—let us say “frontline”—ward
member. We have to recognise those distinctions and that is why a
sensible, locally set form of allowances is a better means of going
down that route, rather than moving towards some kind of quasi-salary,
because those allowances can reflect particular
circumstances.</hs_Para>

there has been a degree of what we might term “grade
inflation” in the number of special responsibility allowances
that are awarded. I notice that, according to the report, something
like 53% of councillors have some kind of special responsibility
allowances. I wonder what that would translate into
here—300-plus Front Benchers of one kind or another in this
House. I do not know, though; occasionally I suppose I could see
attractions to that. Again, however, I think we understand that it is a

will just say one other thing that shows that I do not entirely follow
Opposition Members. This Government should be judged not necessarily on
words but on deeds, and the real thing that makes people decide to be a
councillor and to stay a councillor is a belief that the job makes a
difference. The issues that we talk about and how we recruit people are
terribly important. My party is putting in work. I particularly want to
mention the work done by the Be a Councillor campaign, which is a
cross-party Local Government Association initiative; the work that we
have done in the Conservative party through Women2Win and other groups;
and the work of my friend, Councillor Clare Whelan, who is a former
colleague of the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:46:18"></hs_TimeCode>

of the British Empire for her work on improving diversity in local
government. All those things are important, but the key point is that

decision can make a difference to their community and the place where
they live.</hs_Para>

there was not one before, a legal power of general competence: to
remove what I think we would all agree now were overly prescriptive
targets; to remove the comprehensive area assessment; to phase out
ring-fencing; to change the approach to planning, neighbourhood
planning and so on; to remove predetermination, which I think we all

decisions, but if a local authority of any political persuasion makes a
flawed decision, it must run the risk of criticism by Ministers or

to coming to the Chamber, I was in the Tea Room discussing this debate
with a colleague who said, “The problem is that I used to be a
councillor and used to run weekly surgeries, and no one would turn up.
Since I have become an MP, my weekly surgeries have been packed and
almost all the people are coming to see me about local authority
matters.” That brought out the dilemma that we all

want to pose some challenges beyond the report, to an extent, and
answer some important issues. First, what is the barrier to becoming a
councillor? Why do people do this? I spent 24 years as a Brent
councillor, including four years on the London assembly, and served on
the fire authority, so I have reasonably wide experience. I served in a
position in the London borough of Brent in which I lived through every
possible form of administration, bar none.</hs_Para>

into the wacky world of London borough of Brent politics, but suffice
it to say that in the 1980s, when I was first elected, committee
meetings were jam packed to the rafters, with standing room only in the

to turn up, let alone any members of the public.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:54:28"></hs_TimeCode> have
disconnected the public from local authorities in many ways. That is a
bad thing, which has happened over many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:54:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000143">People<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:54:38"></hs_TimeCode>
become councillors for one of three reasons. First, it is often because
they have a passion for one or more local issues, which are really
about their local area, not even about the borough, and they want to
see change and make things happen for their local people, which is
laudable. Sadly, those people often become rapidly disillusioned. We
found during discussions that 
<?notus-xml column=174?>a number of councillors serve a single term, and we lose their expertise
that they have built up, because they have got frustrated and no longer
wish to serve their local
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:55:13"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have to deal with that in a big
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:55:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000144">Secondly,
there are the political zealots—the people who have an axe to
grind about the politics—who join. They are probably lobby
fodder for whoever is running the council or is in opposition. They
have a political axe to grind and will do anything in that respect.
Sadly, many of those continue in councils year after year and often, in
my experience, poison the atmosphere on all three sides in the main
political
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:55:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000145">Thirdly,
there are the people who want to get on and do something else, either
to become leaders in the council and take on executive roles or go on
somewhere in politics, sometimes using local authorities that are known
to be safe for Labour, the Conservatives or the Liberal Democrats as a
means to get into Parliament or some other representative body. Often,
those people are very talented and progress rapidly through the ranks,
but they are always—I have to say it: here is the
pointer—out for what they can achieve and the kudos they can
gain during the short period when they are serving, which is, I think,
a great
frustration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:56:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000146">There
are clear barriers. One problem is the change from the old committee
system, where every vote and argument was made in public and every
councillor serving on that committee had to justify their vote to
members of the public observing what they said, to the cabinet system
or strong leader, or mayoral, model, where all the decisions—let
us be clear about this—are taken in private and then rolled out
in public to be rubber-stamped. That prevents political groups from
reining back on political decisions that have been
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:57:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000147">One
of the opportunities of the committee system was that officers
presented reports and political groups could take a view on those, and
then a debate would follow, after which a decision could be made. Often
now, with a cabinet system, such reports are endorsed by the political
group and the individual member on the cabinet; it is then difficult
for people to change their mind about a decision that has been taken,
when they find out that the public do not like the decision. As a
result of that, many people are now put off from becoming councillors,
because they do not want to serve on a local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000148">There
is a difference between executive councillors, who are either full-time
councillors or significantly part-time members, and back-bench
councillors—call them front-line councillors, or what you
will—who are often struggling for a role. I concur with the
Committee chairman: in Sunderland we saw that, clearly, a lot of work
had gone on to ensure that all councillors saw that there was a benefit
in their
role<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:58:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000149">The
only drawback in allowing councillors power over spending money is pork
barrel politics, with people saying, “I’ll spend some
money in your area, provided that you get votes for me, come the
election.” Local politics has been fraught with such difficulty
over many years, with suspicion that particular organisations have
received funding in return for votes. There is a big risk in such an
approach. Although the sums are relatively small, they can have a
significant effect. That is not a reason not to do it, but there have
to be controls in place to ensure that this is truly beneficial for the
local community, 
<?notus-xml column=175?>and truly acceptable measures have to be in place. The process has to be
seen to be transparent, auditable and
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T14:59:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000150">On
training councillors, one problem is that many members do not have much
experience of public life, really, when first elected. They come on to
the council for a reason—we have talked about that—and
local authorities, in the main, give them a quick briefing and say,
“Good luck, you’re on your own.”
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>That is the
risk.</hs_Para>

proper training programmes throughout a councillor’s career that
are appropriate to their individual needs, and we neglect that far too
often. As several hon. Members have said, having member-led,
member-controlled councils with members who are experts in their field,
who can take decisions and who can get officers to do what the
community wants, is beneficial to the officers, the community and the
wider public. Far too often, such training is
neglected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000152">One
of the problems that we always had when managing budgets was that it
was very easy to cut a training budget—whether training for
officers or for members, it did not really matter. People would always
say, “Let’s cut the training budget, because we do not
need it.” Actually, training and education should always be
invested in, because that is the way to get better officers, better
councillors, better decisions and better value for
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:00:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I would
caution against the cutting of training
budgets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000153">On
the structure of councils, I will share the current experience in
Harrow to show the problems of the current cabinet structure. Harrow
has 63 councillors. There are five individual councillors—a
rag-bag of various types—25 Conservative councillors, 25 Labour
councillors and eight independent Labour councillors. That makes it
difficult to have a strong leader model.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000154">People might
be surprised to learn that, of the eight independent Labour members,
the leader of the council is independent Labour, six independent Labour
councillors are members of the cabinet and the mayor is an independent
Labour councillor. So all of them have executive positions, yet they
form a small minority of the council. That is the problem of the
current structure of local government, in which minorities can take
huge control because they are the balance between the major parties.
That is an extreme example, but it can happen and I think it is one of
the drawbacks of the current system. That is one of the reasons why we
need to redress the structure back to a more committee-based system,
rather than the cabinet system. That is my personal
preference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:02:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000155">Another
issue is remuneration and whether councillors should be full time, part
time or volunteers. My view is that there is a difference between
people who lead a council, or who hold an executive position, and those
who are critiquing or being a front-line councillor. The fact is that
leading a council is a full-time job.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000156">When I was
the leader of a council back in the early 1990s, I had a full-time job.
I would go into the council first thing in the morning to ensure that
everything was hunky dory, and then I would go off to work. I came back
at 6 o’clock and never left the council before 11
o’clock, which without question affected my career. People said,
“Oh, you are not really committed to the job you are
doing.” During that time the most I ever got in a single year
for that service was the princely sum of some £1,300. I knew
what the position was when I took  
<?notus-xml column=176?>it on, but we should recognise that people are doing that sort of job,
which is a strain, and they should be properly remunerated for doing
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:03:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000157">Given
the electoral cycle, and given that someone can be in the role at one
moment and voted out the next, we must have a position on whether they
are protected with a pension and, potentially, redundancy payments. We
have gone from a position in which people volunteered for the council
and, to a certain extent, were recompensed for a small amount for their
time—their expenses, telephone bills and, if they had them, care
costs were probably paid for—to a position in which they have an
allowance as a councillor and special responsibility allowances on top
of that.</hs_Para>

there has never been a job description, a contract of employment or a
position on redundancy and what happens at the end of a term. Pensions
were never mentioned. It was always ad hoc. We have gone from people
being complete volunteers to being full-time employees, but they are
not really full-time employees. That is something that successive
Governments and regimes have failed to address. We have to bite the
bullet and do something about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000159">The
make-up of councils is a real problem. The numbers of both women and
ethnic minority people are not representative of the community. As the
Chairman of the Select Committee said, the average councillor is white,
male and aged 60, which cannot be right because it is not fully
representative of our community. It is incumbent on political parties
to make that change. I am pleased to say that, come the local elections
next year, of the 27 proposed candidates in my constituency 11 are
women and 18 come from minority ethnic communities, and that number
could be stretched further if people from certain other minority
communities are included. That shows that we are trying to make a
change at local level
ourselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000160">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:09:29"></hs_TimeCode>
concern is that after the 2006 local elections—I cannot speak
for the 2010 local elections—the London boroughs of Brent and
Harrow represented 40% of ethnic minority councillors in the whole of
London. In London, which is probably the most ethnically diverse city
in the world, it has to be bad news that councillors across our
boroughs are not representative of the communities they
face<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:06:17"></hs_TimeCode>. I commend
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:06:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

steps taken there in 2010. That is good news, but we are woefully short

people, if challenged to do so on the doorstep, are unable to name
their councillors. That is a problem faced by councillors across the
board. Talking to communities in community languages is all-important,
and representing those communities is difficult for people who do not
understand such community languages. Often, the people who need help
have difficulty speaking English—they always have English as an
additional language—and therefore having councillors who can
speak those community languages is terribly helpful for representing
them in the council, for understanding their problems and for dealing
with the ward work that follows. That issue needs to be addressed with
appropriate action from the political parties, rather than from the
Government.</hs_Para>

the issue of councillors as the leaders of their communities. One of
the thrusts under the previous Government was to get to a point at
which councillors spent more time in their community talking to
residents’ groups, charities, community groups and so on. In my
experience, the problem has been that there is then a disconnect
between councillors understanding what the council
does—inputting into and critiquing the work of the
council—and connecting with community groups. My personal
opinion is that that has not worked wonderfully well, and a lot more
work needs to be done by individual councillors, assisted by the
councils, to understand that things have to change and that councils
have to be representative of the
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000163">I
am concerned that in London we have all-out elections every four years.
In the London borough of Harrow, regardless of the results of the

opportunity to train people in the right sort of way that encourages
them to be councillors in the right sort of vein.</hs_Para>

have one last challenge, which is not in our report. Given the changes
that have been made to the roles of executive councillors, who make
decisions, and councillors on the front line, who represent their
wards, we should perhaps reduce the number of councillors overall,
rather than having large numbers of councillors and large councils
right across unitary and all sorts of other authorities. We should pay
councillors better, reward them appropriately and give them the support
they need, but we should reduce their numbers, because if we make them
more professional, more involved and more effective, we will need fewer
of them. That might be controversial, and some people may not agree,
but local authorities all over the country are starting to reduce
marginally the number of their councillors. However, a marginal,
creeping approach is perhaps not sufficient, and we may need radical
action to introduce such a change.</hs_Para>

Pawsey</B> (Rugby) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to speak in

for only five years.</hs_Para>

became a councillor in 2002, and it was easy for me to do so, because I
did not have a boss to ask permission from. I was running my own
businesses, and like other Members, I found it easy to allocate time to
being a councillor. I sat on a district council, and the majority of
meetings were in the evening, so it was easy for me to attend. At no
stage did I contemplate putting my name forward for a county council,
given the number of daytime meetings and the time commitment they would
have involved.</hs_Para>

am pleased to make my contribution as a member of the Select Committee,

way all members were able to support. Listening to the debate, I was
reminded of the evidence sessions we held—almost 12 months ago
now. We had a number of formal evidence sessions, but I got most out of
the more informal sessions, and particularly the speed dating, which
was much to the interest of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:12:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst (Robert Neill). It was extremely
valuable to be able to meet people who would not normally give evidence
in the very formal Select Committee setting. It was particularly
valuable to speak to people who had contemplated becoming a councillor,
but who had chosen not to do so, because there is no body representing
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:12:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000174">As
an aside, let me say there is some merit in making more use of informal
evidence sessions in the Select Committee system. We get to speak to
people on more of a one-to-one basis and to hear their views without
their needing to be concerned about going into the House of Commons,
sitting behind a desk with microphones and being interrogated by
Members of Parliament. We got an awful lot out of the less formal
sessions, and the Chairman is looking at doing more informal sessions,
because we generally get more out of them.</hs_Para>

report is important because the councillor’s role is important,

about the role of the political parties in that.</hs_Para>

come from an area with a two-tier authority. The first tier across much
of my constituency is parish councils. Parish councils are, of course,
not political, and people with an interest in the community will put
their names forward for parish councils. However, at district and
county level, the councils are run on party-political lines. I do not
know the statistics, but a significant proportion of councillors on
county and district councils are from the established political
parties, although I suspect there are more independent members on
district councils than on county councils.</hs_Para>

need to make it easier for people to become councillors. In the main,
the way to do that is through our established political parties.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:14:50"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bromley and Chislehurst is doing work on that in the
Conservative party, and I am sure the same kind of work is being
undertaken in the Labour and Liberal Democrat parties. The role of the
parties in encouraging people to come forward must be brought out.
Perhaps the parties should come together and put together a uniform
campaign to explain why people should become
councillors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000178">Another
issue raised in the report is the need to encourage people with broader
experience of life—particularly people with experience of senior
roles in the community—to put their names forward. If we look
back two or three generations—we often see this when we visit
council offices, because there are photographs of past mayors and past
councils on the walls—we see that business leaders, head
teachers, accountants, lawyers and other professional people with
experience of senior roles were actively engaged in local politics. One
concern is that we are not encouraging that cohort to come forward, and
those people often see the council’s role through a negative
lens, rather than a positive one. As has been said, it is distressing
to hear of councillors being encouraged to take the fact that they are
a councillor off their CVs; that is a matter of great
concern.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13090555000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000179"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>The
Chairman of the Select Committee drew attention to the fact that the
average age of a councillor is now 60, that only 31% of councillors are
women and that 96% of councillors are white. On the age range, we have
discussed the fact that the role can be attractive to somebody who is
straight out of university; for them, the allowance is relatively
large, and somebody who is young and perhaps living at home can use it
as their primary source of income. However, as people move into jobs
that are more demanding of their time, and particularly when they have
children, it becomes difficult for them to get involved—my
children were reasonably old before I felt able to put time into
becoming a councillor. Parents may, therefore, be particularly
under-represented among councillors.</hs_Para>

written evidence to the Committee, Professor Colin Copus made an
interesting European comparison. It turns out that Spain’s
councillors are the youngest, with a mean age of as low as 45. We then
go up the table through Switzerland, Italy, Greece, Austria, France,
Germany and Sweden, before we get to the UK at the very top, with an
average age of 59. We really need to focus on those in the middle years
of their careers and to make it interesting for them to come
forward.</hs_Para>

might we do that? Clearly, we need to ensure that people are not put
off by the prospect of becoming a councillor. There is a real lack of
understanding of the time that being a councillor takes up. We have
spoken about training, and I recognise the need for it, but one thing I
was aware of, particularly in the early years of being a councillor,
was the massive number of briefings, which take up an awful amount of
time. Even when we become more experienced as councillors, we are still
dragged along to many meetings that are perhaps not necessary. I
recognise, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:19:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Croydon North (Mr Reed) said, that councillors need to be actively
involved in the council, but far too often, councillors go into
meetings that are not particularly significant or valuable, and they
come away thinking, “Did I really get anything out of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:19:20"></hs_TimeCode>?”</hs_Para>

is a real turn-off for people thinking about becoming a
councillor—we, as parliamentarians, are responsible for
this—is the bickering and the Punch and Judy nature of politics.
Parliament often does not represent itself well. Many people’s
only awareness of national politics is what they see in Prime
Minister’s Question Time on television. They see the bickering,
and it does not encourage people to come forward.</hs_Para>

Jones</B> (Warrington North) (Lab):</Member> I hear that point made
frequently. Anyone who has seen women council leaders in the north-west
would probably not think that. The real drawbacks are meeting times and
the lack of child care. I had my child when I was a councillor and I
had to go back a week later, because it was a hung council. Those are
the things that need attention. The idea of a different political
mindset among men and women is

Pawsey:</Member></B> My evidence may be anecdotal, but it comes from
two councils that I know of. One was quite antagonistic, and women were
under-represented. The other was in Rugby and it was rather more
gentle, partly, I felt, because power had gone through different groups
and coalitions so we worked more consensually. I thought it was a more
attractive council chamber to be involved in, and we had a far larger
proportion of women. I simply make that
observation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:21:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000186">We
need to give councillors real power. The Localism Act 2011 has been
mentioned. For far too long, all councillors did was rubber-stamp
policy that came from Government. I remember having Hobson’s
choice about what action to take. Not doing what the Government wanted
would mean not getting the grant that would enable something to happen.
Under the current cabinet model, cabinet members have executive power
and are actively involved in the council; but council back benchers
have little role. They sit on scrutiny committees and can make
recommendations, but it is hard to get things done. That is why the
Government should be applauded for the 2011 Act, which gives power back
to councillors and councils. I hope and expect that the additional
powers that councils have will lead many people with more senior roles
in the community to put their names
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000187" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000187">I
want to consider the accessibility of councillors. Often, particularly
in a two-tier authority, people do not know which councillor is
responsible for what, and often they will therefore not go to their
councillor to solve a problem. It has been mentioned that MPs get
letters about potholes, roads, road lighting, parking and
planning—things that are not within our control—and we
should tell those correspondents “Go to your local councillor,
who is someone who can deal with that.”
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:23:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers) made a valuable point about
multi-member wards, where the disconnect is even greater. With
single-member wards, an effort to convey to people the responsibilities
of their councils, and councils that made themselves more accessible,

quite easily spend the whole time going to briefings with the same

Select Committee and those who have spoken today have all made
important points about the change in the role of councillors, the
greater demands on them and the wider political and social context in
which they now operate. Times have changed. We no longer have a system
in which MPs go back to their constituency once a quarter, hold a
surgery and go away again. Similarly, for local councillors it is no
longer simply a matter of getting elected and waiting until they have
to stand again. Local government could have a vital role to play in
bridging the gap that has developed between people in the community and
politicians. Councillors could be central to that, if we get it
right—but it is important to get it
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:30:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000199">We
have to recognise, as was said earlier, that the scale of the cuts to
local government funding instituted by the Government has made it
extraordinarily hard for local councillors to deliver the services that
they know 
<?notus-xml column=183?>are needed. Even the Local Government Association, which is Conservative
controlled, has estimated that the gap will be £16.5 billion by
2019. Furthermore, in those areas most in need, the cuts are relatively
bigger: the 10 most deprived local authorities in the country are
taking cuts six times greater than the 10 least deprived. In such
circumstances, it is right to pay tribute to local councillors
throughout the country, who are struggling to square the circle and
having to take unpalatable decisions every day. Before I go any
further, I want to put on the record my appreciation of their

thrust of the Select Committee report is, rightly, about looking to the

that we encourage more young people, more people from minority ethnic

has been said frequently, the average age of councillors is now 60. I
am sure that lots of them are doing a good job, but councils need to
look more like the communities that they serve. We need to ensure that

younger people putting themselves forward to stand as councillors and
to go on our party’s panel. “Younger”, however, is
a relative term. I often describe people as young, only to realise that
they are married, settled and with a couple of kids; they are not that
young in the overall sense. We need to encourage such
people—more parents and parents of young

need to?” The officer looked at me as if the words
“pram” or “baby” were in a foreign
language—“Why would you want to do that? We have never
had it before.” The answer is, “Well, you have got it
now.” Councils have got to adapt their procedures to accommodate

am sad that the Government chose to ignore some of the recommendations
in their response,

earlier—of the benefits of having a councillor staff member,
because of the skills that people pick up and the knowledge of the
community that they gain, which can be of huge benefit to the employer,
not a burden. It needs to be seen as such. There are problems in small
businesses and so on, and we must strive to overcome that. It is not
easy, but unless we tackle the problem, we simply will not have a
representative local democracy, which is vital to us

report also highlighted the need for proper training and support for
councillors, who after all are doing a difficult job, making decisions
that affect people’s lives and spending millions of pounds of
public money. Political parties, councils and representative bodies
such as the LGA all have a duty to make that happen, through training
for people before they become councillors and ongoing training
afterwards, so that they have the necessary knowledge and skills to
carry out their duties. I agree with what has been said in the debate:
if we do not train councillors properly, we get officer-led
authorities, instead of member-led authorities, which is bad for
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000207">The
Government have said, rather foolishly, about councillors, “They
are all volunteers; we do not want to professionalise them.” The
argument about training, however, is not about whether someone is a
full or part-time councillor; it is about whether someone has the
knowledge and skills to do the job properly. Training is not about
professionalising the role—we can have all those arguments about
who needs to be full time and who does not, and I agree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:37:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Harrow East that leaders of local authorities, certainly the big
ones, are in effect full time—but about ensuring that duties are
carried out effectively. Roger Bannister was not a professional runner,
as the Minister might remember, but he still needed to be trained
properly to run a sub-four-minute mile. It is the same for everyone
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:37:48"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000208">Allowances
are much more contentious. All councils must bear in mind that at the
moment most people’s incomes are being restricted, while their
standard of living is falling. In the longer term, yes, of course it is
right—we need a system that does not deter people in employment
from standing for the local authority. I, too, along with
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T15:38:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

of earnings, but councils now must bear in mind the economic situation.

of all, we need to accept the role of local councillors in making
decisions that are right for their local communities. I agree with what
has been said, but the Secretary of State is sometimes what might be
described as conflicted. On the one hand, he says that he is in favour
of localism, but, on the other, he cannot stop interfering, whether
about bin collections, parking on double yellow lines or what he

about localism is not enough, however; the Secretary of State has taken
a lot more power to himself. The Local Government Finance Act 2012 gave
him huge powers, while the Local Audit and Accountability 
<?notus-xml column=185?>Bill will even give him power to decide what councils
publish—“Pickles the censor”, up there with his
blue pencil, deciding what fits with his code. That is despite the fact
that there have been few complaints about council publications. We all

right hon. Friend the Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn) made it
clear that we want radical devolution of power to local communities,
including power over transport, infrastructure, skills and economic
development. However, that devolution of power will make it even more
incumbent on local authorities to ensure that they have councillors
with the right skills who are representative of their community. It is
a chicken and egg issue: as more power is devolved, more people will be
interested in standing for local authorities, but we must ensure that
those authorities are truly representative of their communities and
that councillors are properly trained to carry out their role.
Otherwise, we will let down the very communities that people hope to
serve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0001.htm#13090555000212">The

great cities and urban areas. A whole range of people out there are

the core principles of being a councillor, for us, are community
service and volunteering. We are clear that councillors are and
fundamentally should be volunteers. Let me be clear about what I mean.
I am not suggesting that councillors should be amateurish or lack the
important skills that they need to fulfil their role as representatives
of their electorate, but I am clear that being a councillor is not a
staff council job.</hs_Para>

professional councillor role, which would blur the line between the
council and the executive. Councillors are there in a different

lead and set strategic direction without being part of the

it is important to delineate the difference between a
councillor’s role and that of staff of the council. It comes
through on many levels, and training is part of that. I congratulate
the LGA on the great work that it is doing to develop training. Some
training opportunities have been mentioned in this debate, but councils
have a duty to ensure that they educate people, particularly new
councillors, about the opportunities available. The political parties

cabinet members and leaders in front-line roles, for want of a better

appropriate recognition by the community of the contribution that the

<?notus-xml column=190?>councillors have a purpose and opportunities to get things done that
matter to them and their communities. That goes straight to the values
of being a councillor, which I have discussed. Our commitment as a

great, innovative work to make sure that they are being efficient, but
there are still lots of councils out there that have not looked at
everything they can do, in terms of front-line services, innovation and
shared management, and cracking down on the £2 billion of
uncollected council tax and the £2 billion worth of fraud and
error. Councils have increased their reserves by another £3
billion in the last year alone to a record high of £19 billion.

able to freeze council tax back in 2005 to keep council tax low, as the
Government have done consistently since coming into office in 2010. I
fully understand that. I say to councils that if they want to spend and
if they have reserves they are building up—councils have built
up £3 billion of extra reserves in the past year alone, taking
the amount to a record high of £19 billion—it is not
credible for the public to expect them to be able to build up such
reserves while pleading poverty. If they want to look at using that and
they need to look at the capital side of their reserves, they should
look at putting that into capital expenditure that will help them save
revenue further down the line. That can be done, and good councils are
doing that across the country and are even able to provide cuts in
council tax, as we saw from some great Conservative councils in this
year alone.</hs_Para>

political parties to engage positively in their areas, to provide
strong role models, to go out into their communities and to be part of

hon. Friend the Member for Cleethorpes touched on elections every two
years, and he has made his views well known around unitary councils.
Where we do have examples of two-yearly elections, the turnout is not
particularly higher, and it is certainly no higher than when we have
all-out four-yearly elections. Again, that 
<?notus-xml column=193?>is something that councils have the freedom to look at, take a view on,
and decide what is right for them in their communities.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T16:07:16"></hs_TimeCode>What it is about
is harnessing the enthusiasm on the ground to get involved and make a
community better. For example, we already have more than 650
communities applying to have a neighbourhood area designated. That is
the first step in a formal process for neighbourhood planning. More are
joining each week and, in that way, exercising a real local say in how
they want their areas to develop.</hs_Para>

is about working with communities and encouraging them to see the new
opportunities open to them, even if the community does not necessarily

organise a training session, and some councillors will turn up, wanting
to be involved and to learn, but often the ones who most need the
support and help, whether they realise that or not, are the ones who do
not turn up to those meetings. We must have the courage to admit that
that happens, do something about it and encourage those people to be

Betts:</Member></B> I thank you, Mr Benton, and Mrs Brooke for the
excellent way in which you have chaired the debate and kept things in
order. We have had a very good debate—a very positive debate.
Some differing views were expressed, but generally there was quite a
lot of consensus about the fact that councillors play a vital 
<?notus-xml column=195?>role in delivering public services and are vital for the health of our
democracy. It is also very important that councils are member driven
and member led. There was a lot of consensus about that as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T16:13:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0002.htm#13090555000273">There
was consensus about the challenges facing councils and councillors
today. It is a greatly changing world: changing in terms of the
internal arrangements of councils, the financial framework within which
they operate and the powers that are devolved to them—or, in
some cases, taken away. There are also changes in the way councillors
themselves operate. Many of them are, as we saw in Sunderland,
devolving more responsibilities and more budgetary control to local
level within their councils. The Select Committee saw that as a very
positive
move<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T16:13:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0002.htm#13090555000274">In
this rapidly changing world, with the challenges that it presents, it
is very important that councillors—not just the cabinet members,
but all councillors—have the support necessary to enable them to
do their jobs inside the council. I am talking about the admin support,
the clerical support and the training that is necessary. That point has
come across very strongly in the debate. It is one that the Select
Committee highlighted and it has also received support from the
Minister this
afternoon<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T16:14:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0002.htm#13090555000275">General
concerns were expressed about the lack of diversity and the need to
address that. There was recognition that that is a responsibility for
political parties, for councillors themselves, for the LGA—it is
the responsibility of everyone involved in politics to raise the issue.
Again, the Minister was supportive of that. It might be interesting to
come back in four years’ time and see whether progress has been
made after another cycle of council elections. That will be the test in
the end of whether we have made progress—the next round of
councillors who are
elected<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-05T16:14:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0002.htm#13090555000276">There
was quite a lot of discussion about the barriers to becoming a
councillor. Again, I was pleased by the Minister’s encouragement
to employers to see that having councillors as employees is beneficial.
That is important. Perhaps the Government could do a little more. We
may have further discussions about what more they can do to raise the
issue with employer organisations and get the message across that they
could be doing more to encourage that as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0002.htm#13090555000277">There
was a lot of discussion about remuneration. I am still not
sure that I like the term “volunteer”. Of course all
councillors volunteer; nobody presses them to do the job as part of a
work programme. We are 
<?notus-xml column=196?>volunteers. We are all here because we want to be, but nobody calls us
volunteers. Councillors are not volunteers in the sense that they
should be doing it for free, as people might do as a scout leader.
There is a difference, and I think that the Minister recognised that to
a
degree.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090555000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/halltext/130905h0002.htm#13090555000278">Of
course, most councillors are not full time. Some do only a few hours a
week and, on a smaller district council, do the job perfectly well, but
an executive mayor or a leader of a major authority will be full time.
The hon. Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman) made that clear from his
experience. In that sense, it is the job that that person has, because
they cannot have another job if they are full time.</hs_Para>

how we deal with people who are not full time, but are taking time off
work. We cannot recompense people for the promotion that they might
have had if they had not been on a council, but perhaps we can do a bit
more to recompense people who have to take some time off work and do
not get covered by the allowances. Clearly, that is a disincentive.
That is reflected in the percentage of councillors who are retired and
the fact that many people in work feel put off from doing council work
or leave when they start to get more involved in their full-time
job.</hs_Para>

shall pick up one final point. I am committed, and the Select Committee
has been whenever it has discussed it, to more devolution, more
decentralisation and more localism—sending more powers down to
local level. The hon. Member for Cleethorpes (Martin Vickers)—he
is not a member of the Select Committee, so I will probably refer to
him in a cross-party way—made the point that if we are to move
more powers down and have more responsibilities at local level, those
powers in the end will be best exercised by those who are accountable
to their communities because they are elected. That is a very important
point: more powers at local level, but exercised by people who are
elected and therefore ultimately accountable to their local
communities. That is what councillors are, and that is why they are so

extend the usual deadline for providing this information from 14 to 28

independence payment (PIP) assessments, the two providers—Atos
and Capita—must provide sufficient suitable accommodation for
face-to-face consultations. Atos' delivery model utilises the premises
of local supply chain partners already established in the health care
sector and as such have access to large flexible network of
sites—locations such as private medical centres, physiotherapy
practices and hospitals. Atos have published details of 171
consultation centres on their website. The number of sites utilised by
Atos for PIP consultations will fluctuate in line with the demand for
assessments. Using the Department's forecast volumes of PIP
assessments, Atos have demonstrated through their supply chain
contractual arrangements that they have full geographic coverage with
an additional capacity of at least 15% in each of their supply chain
partners, as well as back up options across their network, should
volumes prove higher than expected.</hs_Para>

England is not held centrally by either NHS England or the Department.
NHS 111 is a locally commissioned service and the cost of running it
during 2013-14 will depend on a number of factors such as call volume
and roll-out dates in different parts of the country. Costs are
reimbursed to providers on a price per call basis, so the final costs
will depend on the number of calls received over the course of
2013-14.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090557000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/text/130905w0001.htm#13090557000299">With
regard to the decision to reprocure NHS 111 services in
those areas currently contracted to NHS Direct, NHS Direct have
forecast a deficit in the region of £26.2 million for the total
running costs of NHS 111 contracts for the year 2013-14, and this
figure has been agreed by the NHS Trust Development Authority and NHS
England. This is a forecast predicated on a number of conditions and so
the final figure may vary but should not exceed £26.2 million.
The final figure is dependent on call volumes and how quickly NHS

providers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090557000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/text/130905w0001.htm#13090557000300">The

Poulter:</Member></B> The Department of Health has not made a specific
assessment of the effect of access to the Nursery Milk Scheme on
children's health outcomes. However, the proposed changes to the
Nursery Milk Scheme have been designed to ensure that the benefits of
the Nursery Milk Scheme continue to apply equally to al! eligible under
children—on a universal basis. In parallel with the public
consultation, we also asked all child care providers currently
registered with the scheme to complete a simple survey about how the
scheme works for them now, and how potential changes might affect them
and the children they care for. The questions asked included those on
packaging
preferences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13090557000377" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130905/text/130905w0001.htm#13090557000377">We

Lidington:</Member></B> Royal Gibraltar Police powers are a matter of
Gibraltar law. The British Government's response to incursions is kept
under review, including the use of Ministry of Defence assets. The
Government's overarching commitment to ensure the security, prosperity
and development of all the British Overseas Territories was set out in
the Queen's Speech in Parliament on 8 May. We take this commitment
seriously and we do not rule out any measures that are necessary to
defend Gibraltar from a genuine threat to its security or defence.
However, while the incursions of the Guardia Civil are an attempt to
assert Spain's legal position in respect of the waters, they do not
weaken or undermine the legal basis for British sovereignty over
Gibraltar and British Gibraltar Territorial Waters. Nor are they acts
of war. The Government's assessment is that the structures and
procedures of the Royal Navy Gibraltar Squadron are adequate to deliver
their current tasking.</hs_Para>

both regulars and reservists, is of high importance. We continue to
commission an ongoing programme of research into the health of military
personnel from the King's Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR),
which looks at a range of issues that may affect the mental health of
all personnel, both regulars and reservists, including deployment and
tour lengths. This research helps us to achieve a more scientific
understanding of the impact of operations on the armed forces, and
informs practice and policy in managing the health of our personnel. A
considerable number of research papers have already been published,

KCMHR study published in <I>The Lancet</I> in 2010 indicated that the
numbers of repeated deployments did not translate to an increase in any
of the common mental health issues measured. However, a separate KCMHR
study published in 2007 showed that if a regular service person is
deployed for 13 or more months in any 36 month period, then there is an
increased risk of mental health disturbance. The study reported that
this risk is higher following an unexpected (rather than pre-planned)
extension to a tour.</hs_Para>

Dunne:</Member></B> It is the Ministry of Defence (MOD) policy that all
losses of materiel are investigated and reported in accordance with the
Defence Logistic Support Chain Manual. If stocktaking discrepancies are
identified an independent reconciler initiates an investigation, the
level of which is dependent on the value and stocktaking category of
the item. It is during the investigation that the cause of the
discrepancy will be identified and, in cases where criminal activity is
suspected, the situation is to be reported to the MOD, service or
civilian police as appropriate. Before approving any write-off the
authorising officer must be clear about the nature of the case; the
amount involved; and the circumstances in which the loss arose; and its
causes, including any relevant information from police reports; and if
there is any suspicion of theft, fraud, arson or sabotage. Before
writing off expenditure, there must be clear evidence that all
reasonable action has been taken to recover the loss and that no
feasible alternative exists. All items lost as a result of theft are
subsequently written-off.</hs_Para>

deployments are directed through a Whitehall process by Defence to
maintain the readiness of the RFTG and deliver Maritime Security and

adjustments to minimise disadvantage people may face in the workplace
because of a disability. This includes discretion for disabled
employees in the management of their attendance. It is for individual

may include allowing special leave or other paid time off for employees

various generation technologies on the DECC website since 2010. The
levelised cost of a particular generation technology is the ratio of
the total costs of a generic plant to the total amount of electricity
expected to be generated over the plant's lifetime (per megawatt hour).
Levelised costs include installation costs, but also pre-development
costs, infrastructure costs, operating costs, connection costs and
carbon and fuel costs. They do not include revenues or support

cost estimates for different types of electricity generation are highly
sensitive to the assumptions used for capital costs, fuel and EU ETS
allowance prices, operating costs, load factor, discount rate and other
drivers and this means that there is significant uncertainty around
these estimates. It is perhaps more appropriate to consider a range of
cost estimates as pipeline projects show a large range around these
central values. These are shown in Table 2 for a range around capital

Metropolitan Police Service announced that it had started a criminal
investigation. Under the 2000 Act the examining officer may retain any

sentenced prisoners are categorised and allocated to HMP Ford following
an established risk assessment process. Prisoners may be assessed as
suitable for open conditions if they present a low risk of harm to the
public, are considered to be trustworthy not to abscond from low
security conditions and, for those serving a lengthy prison sentence,
are in general within two years of their earliest release date.
Prisoners who do not meet these criteria are not moved to open
conditions. Those who are later considered to have increased risk
