by a jury of one’s peers is a crucial and long established
feature of our justice system and jury service is one of the most
important civic duties that anyone can be asked to perform. Currently
the Juries Act 1974 specifies that the upper age limit for jury service
in England and Wales is 70. The upper limit was last amended by the
Criminal Justice Act 1988, which raised it from 65 to 70.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1309022000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309022000007">The previous Government
consulted on changing the age limit. We have spent time considering the
responses to that consultation, and the views of those who have written
to us (and asked Parliamentary Questions) about this. We have now come
to the conclusion that the age limit should be increased.</hs_para>

of those over 70 has improved significantly since the age limit was
last set 25 years ago and it is right that this should be reflected in
a higher upper age limit for jury service. Data from the Office for
National Statistics shows that, on average, people in England and Wales
can expect to be “disability free” until they are 75. We
believe that it is fair to expect people below this age to sit as
jurors.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1309022000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309022000009">Over
the age of 75, an increasing number of people would find it difficult
or impossible to sit as jurors and would therefore seek to be excused
jury service. Rather than put them through the process of applying for
excusal, and spend tax-payers’ money dealing with this
additional administrative burden, we are increasing the upper age limit
to 75.</hs_para>

provision allows anyone summoned for jury service,
including, in future, those over 70,  to
seek to be excused, where there is a good reason  for
this.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1309022000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309022000011">Whilst
the main motivation for increasing the upper age limit is to make
juries more representative of all the people who are playing a full
part in their communities, we do expect some savings to result from a
reduction in the number of jurors in full-time employment. This will
reduce the number of employers who have to pay staff who are on jury
service, and the costs to Her Majesty’s Courts and Tribunal
Service of paying for loss of earnings. The only costs involved in
implementing this policy will be minor changes to our systems, and to
the relevant forms and guidance.</hs_para>

limit for jury service to 75 will involve amending the

British companies to raise awareness of their responsibility to adopt
best practice guidelines, and to promote the business case for good

will continue to be a crucial part of our energy mix to the 2030s and
beyond. It is therefore essential that we have secure supplies at
competitive prices. GB has a well-functioning gas market with high
levels of liquidity, and comparatively low wholesale gas prices.
Previous independent assessments<Sup>1</Sup> show that we enjoy high
levels of gas supply security provided by a diverse range of supply
sources, including our own production, pipeline imports from Norway and
the EU, imports from global markets via LNG and storage. These sources
have provided reliable gas supply over recent challenging winters,
including our highest ever daily gas demand in January 2010 and the
protracted cold spell earlier this year.</hs_para>

challenges are emerging, including our increased dependence on gas
imports, and greater demand volatility. We therefore already have a
range of measures in hand to promote our gas security. We also asked
Ofgem to report to us on the outlook for gas security of supply and
whether there is a case for further interventions in the gas market.
Ofgem’s report, published last November, confirmed the
resilience of our gas market. Since then, my Department has been
working to assess whether the potential benefits of a further
intervention in terms of more secure supply and effects on gas prices
might outweigh the associated costs and risks.</hs_para>

interventions in the gas market to establish whether they might improve
our gas security cost-effectively. Our analysis shows that, although
such interventions could enhance our gas security, under most scenarios
they would not do so cost-effectively. If considering only the direct
benefits in terms of avoided costs of disruption against the cost of
building the storage, the costs outweigh the benefits in all cases. In
addition, all options risk unintended consequences through distorting a
well-functioning GB gas market or crowding out investment in
alternative gas supply sources. These effects could undermine any
additional security of supply intervention might bring. Therefore, we

review is an important part of the Government’s programme to
tackle public burdens, promote growth and stimulate economic recovery.
I am clear that judicial review is, and will remain, an important means
to hold government to account where it is acting unlawfully, but I
remain concerned that too often it is being used either as a campaign
tool or to delay or frustrate decisions that have been properly made. I
am also concerned that legal aid resources should be targeted at those
judicial review cases where they are needed most if the legal aid
system is to command public confidence and credibility.</hs_para>

have already been made to the procedural aspects of judicial review,
including removing the right to an oral renewal in a case certified by
the judge as ‘totally without merit’ and aligning the
time limits for bringing a planning or procurement judicial review with
the relevant statutory challenges. A new fee will soon be introduced
for an oral renewal. Whilst these reforms are a worthwhile first step,
it is right that we test the potential for further substantive
reform.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13090911000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#13090911000191">To
that end, the paper makes proposals in a number of areas: the
courts’ approach to cases which rely on minor procedural
defects; rebalancing financial incentives; speeding up appeals to the
Supreme Court in a small number of nationally significant cases, which
would extend beyond judicial review; and planning challenges. I also
think it makes sense to explore the potential for reforming the test as
to who can bring a judicial review, as well as whether there are
mechanisms other than judicial review for resolving disputes
related  to the public sector equality duty, following a
recommendation by the Public Sector Equalities Steering
Group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13090911000192" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#13090911000192">Having

guaranteed payment for their work on a judicial review where permission
is granted by the Court, this consultation proposes that the Legal Aid

analysis: Macroeconomic and fiscal performance” looks at

free access to the larger UK market, a common regulatory framework,
integrated supply chains and a highly flexible labour market. As a
result, Scottish companies trade more goods and services with the rest
of the UK than with the rest of the world, exporting £36 billion
of goods and services to the rest of the UK. Flexible labour movement
between Scotland and the rest of the UK allows businesses to recruit
the best people from across the whole UK, and the benefits of being

investment.</hs_para>

the absence of a border is key for economic integration. Even where
free trade agreements exist and physical borders are weak, neighbouring
countries with similar economies are affected by the presence of a
border. The analysis finds, for example, that that trade between the US
and Canada is thought to be 44 per cent lower than it could be as a
result of the border between them. Canadian provinces trade around 20
times more with one another than with US states of a similar size and
proximity, despite a free trade agreement between Canada and the US.
Labour migration between Scotland and the rest of the UK is also
estimated to be as much as 75 per cent higher within an integrated UK,
allowing the sharing of skills and knowledge.</hs_para>

and gas.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13090911000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#13090911000245">The
paper shows that, since 1999, Scotland’s onshore economy has
generated 8.3 per cent of the UK’s tax receipts, while at the
same time Scotland has received an average of 9.4 per cent of UK public
spending. Relative to the UK generating and spending £100, this
means that Scotland’s onshore economy has generated £98

spending.</hs_para>

heart of the UK’s current economic and fiscal union.
Independence would fundamentally transform and fragment this
relationship, ending the pooling of resources and risk-sharing between
Scotland and the rest of the UK, and erecting a border where one does
not currently exist. Research in the paper concludes that remaining
part of the borderless United Kingdom could boost real incomes in
Scotland by as much as 4 per cent after 30 years, equivalent to
£5 billion in 2012 prices or £2,000 per household,

licences is intended to ensure that alcohol is sold responsibly. At
present, all alcohol sales must be authorised by a personal licence
holder. Personal licence holders must have completed training on the
risks alcohol can present if handled irresponsibly. They must also
notify licensing authorities if they commit any offence which suggests
they may be unsuitable as a manager at licensed
premises.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309163000004">Extensive
discussions with partners in the police, local government and the
licensed trade during the recent Alcohol Strategy consultation
suggested that this system may not always be the most targeted and
proportionate way to ensure alcohol is sold responsibly. For example,
all premises—from the riskiest to the quietest—must
comply with the system regardless of whether it is locally appropriate
or not. As a result, the consultation published today proposes enabling
targeted, local alternatives to personal licences through locally
applied conditions to premises licences. We have estimated that this
proposal could save businesses, including small and medium enterprises,
some £10 million a year if taken forward, while keeping a focus
on measures to tackle crime and disorder at licensed
premises.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309163000005">This

Government is dedicated to the care and welfare of the men and women of
our Armed Forces, particularly those deployed on operations, which is
reflected in the comprehensive Deployed Welfare Package. A key part of
that package is ensuring the timely delivery of free personal mail from
family and friends. In the past the general public has shown their
support by sending unsolicited goodwill parcels. This has resulted in
huge volumes of mail, which have overwhelmed the system and have
prevented mail from families from getting through. British Forces Post
Office (BFPO) estimates that, in the eight-week period between
mid-October and mid-December, the volume of mail in the logistic system
increases by 65%. The amount of unsolicited mail entering the BFPO
system can impact on personal 
<?notus-xml column=198?>mail, causing severe delays, and can increase pressure on essential
in-theatre resources.</hs_para>

that the MOD will be repeating its campaign to discourage unsolicited
mail. Its success in recent years has reduced the volume of unsolicited
mail significantly. Key to the success of this campaign is encouraging
the British public to show their support, in other ways, through one of
the recognised MOD Service charities. Service personnel on operations
over Christmas will receive a seasonal gift box from the charity, uk4u
Thanks!. This charity works closely with the MOD, using free space in
the existing supply chain to deliver the boxes well before Christmas,
without impacting on the normal mail

of Lord Justice Leveson’s Report in November 2012, the
Government accepted his recommendation—endorsing that of Lord
Justice Jackson—that costs protection should
be extended to defamation and privacy claims. Costs protection protects
parties from the costs that they might have to pay to the other side in
civil litigation. Costs protection was introduced
in April 2013 for personal injury cases when the Government reformed
the way in which no win no fee agreements operate. Those reforms,
contained in Part 2 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of
Offenders (LASPO) Act 2012, were delayed for defamation and privacy
cases as a result of Lord Justice Leveson’s recommendation until
a costs protection regime has been
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309163000020">The
proposals in the consultation are designed to help people and
organisations of modest means to be able to bring and defend defamation
and privacy claims without the fear of having to pay unaffordable legal
costs to the other side if they lose. The consultation also proposes
that those of substantial means (whether individuals or organisations,
such as national newspapers) would be excluded from the costs
protection regime, while those of less modest means might have to pay
something towards the legal costs of the other side if they
lose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309163000021">The
consultation runs until 8 November. The Government hopes to introduce
the new costs protection regime in April 2014, at the same time as
implementing the relevant provisions in Part 2 of LASPO Act for
defamation and privacy cases. Taken together, these changes will result
in access to justice at more proportionate cost: meritorious claims
will be able to proceed, while those without merit will be
deterred.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309163000022">Copies

more direct control of how public funding for vocational skills is
spent and are testing this through the Employer Ownership Pilot. Round
1 of the programme is funding 36 projects with £102m of

the Advanced Manufacturing Supply Chain Initiative—the
initiative was first established in December 2011 to help existing UK
supply chains grow and achieve world class standards, while encouraging
major new suppliers to come and manufacture here in Britain. The Autumn
Statement 2012 provided an additional £120 million for two
additional funding rounds of AMSCI—Rounds 3 and 4—taking
the total government contribution to this scheme to up to £245
million. Subject to due diligence five supply chain projects from the
aerospace, chemicals, electronics and life sciences sectors will be
receiving over £115 million of joint public and private sector
investment and we expect their projects to create and safeguard over
1,500 jobs.</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>•
£150 million investment in Green Construction
projects—£60 million is being invested through the
Technology Strategy Board to support the UK construction industry in
designing and developing more energy efficient buildings. Government
expects the projects to attract an additional £60 million of
industry investment and £30 million extra funding

most in 2013-14, working with Monitor and the NHS Trust Development
Authority. This follows the Prime Minister’s announcement in
August that A&amp;E departments will benefit from an additional
£500 million over the next two years to address seasonal
pressures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0001.htm#1309163000086">It

of flu do increase, the pressure on A&amp;Es will also increase. The

healthcare workers, by the very nature of their jobs, deal with people
who are unwell every day and on average, around 27,000 people spend
time in hospital with flu every year. NHS staff can play an important
role in not picking up the flu virus and passing it on to other
patients who are often people who are already poorly and vulnerable to
infection by simply having the flu vaccine. Less than half of frontline
NHS staff get vaccinated against flu and in some hospitals, this figure
drops to fewer than 1 in 5. This is why we want to significantly boost
the number of healthcare workers getting the flu vaccine to 75 per
cent. Trusts will not be eligible to receive a portion of the money in
future years if they do not vaccinate 75% of their staff this year,

Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme (SAWS) allows fruit and vegetable
growers to employ migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania as seasonal
workers for up to six months at a time. It will close, as planned, at
the end of 2013. The Government does not intend to open any new SAWS
for workers from outside the EEA as our view is that, at a time of
unemployment in the UK and the European Union there should be
sufficient workers from within those labour markets to meet the needs
of the horticultural industry. The Agricultural Technologies Strategy
will support innovation by agricultural businesses, which will also
help to offset future
impacts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000281" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0002.htm#1309163000281">Currently,
there is an annual quota of 21,250 SAWS participants. From 1 January
2014, when the transitional labour market controls on Bulgarian and
Romanian (EU2) nationals are lifted, growers will have unrestricted
access to EU2 workers. Since the controls on the EU8 (the Member States
that acceded to the European Union in 2004) workers were lifted, those
workers have continued to form the core of the seasonal
agricultural workforce. At present, UK growers recruit about one third
of their seasonal workers from the EU2, and about one half from the
EU8. Seasonal agricultural work can pay good wages and the sector
should be able to attract and retain UK and EEA
workers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000282" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0002.htm#1309163000282">Our
migration policy is to allow only highly skilled workers from outside
the EEA, with an annual limit of 20,700 workers. Unskilled and low
skilled labour needs should be satisfied from within the expanded EEA
labour market. The SAWS was previously open to non-EEA nationals but
was restricted in 2007 to EU2 nationals, consistent with an intention
to phase it out as the EEA labour market expanded. That remains the
Government’s position. We do not think that the characteristics
of the horticultural sector, such as its seasonality and dependence on
readily available workers to be deployed at short notice, are so
different from those in other employment sectors as to merit special
treatment from a migration policy
perspective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000283" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0002.htm#1309163000283">The
independent Migration Advisory Committee reviewed the impact of the
closure of the SAWS on the horticulture sector earlier this year. They
concluded that there was unlikely to be an impact on labour supply in
the short term, although this might change in the longer term. They
noted, however, that there is a wide range of uncertainty around the
effects on migration 
<?notus-xml column=214?>flows to the UK of ending restrictions on labour market access for EU2
nationals. The MAC was also clear that a replacement SAWS would amount
to preferential treatment for
horticulture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1309163000284" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130923-wms0002.htm#1309163000284">The
Government recognises that the SAWS has for many years provided an
efficient supply of labour for the horticultural sector. The Department
for Work and Pensions has been working with JobCentre Plus, LANTRA (the
sector skills council), the National Farmers’ Union and others,
including growers and horticultural recruitment
firms, to help unemployed UK residents into horticultural work through
training and guaranteed interviews. A pilot scheme to encourage
unemployed UK residents to apply for, train and secure jobs on arable
farms has shown encouraging results with a high
proportion of participants going on to secure employment in the sector.
We want to build on this and other innovative approaches.
The Government, including the Department for the Environment
Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Work and Pensions and the
Department for Communities and Local Government, looks forward to
working with the sector to monitor and address the issues, and will

Commission signed the Protocol on behalf of the Community in 2001 with
the intention of concluding it once the Articles they negotiated had

through amendments to the existing Weapons Directive 91/477 on the
acquisition and possession of weapons and the adoption of Regulation

Syria’s Christians are  said to number around 2.5
million (11 per cent) of

by pre-uprising emigration and recent displacement. The largest
Christian communities in the country were in Aleppo and Homs, cities
which have seen some of the most intense clashes between the regime and
opposition. We regularly meet with representatives of minority groups,
including a number of Christian religious leaders, and they have been
similarly affected by the wider implications of the conflict; internal
displacement, lack of security, seeking refuge in neighbouring
countries. Using UK Conflict Pool funding, we are working with civil
society organisations in Syria and the wider region to support
inter-faith dialogue and

how the scheme is working by the end of the calendar year, and whether
