Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):</Member></B> The hon.
Gentleman asks about trends in real wages. The main deterioration in
wages and salaries was from 2007 to 2009 when growth fell from 5.7% to
minus 0.6%. This is a vivid reminder of the damage that the great
recession did. The Government have taken continued action to help with
the cost of living so that last year real household disposable income
grew by 1.4%, the fastest growth for three years. Of course, however,
these remain difficult times for families, and the only way to deliver
improved living standards for the long term is a sustained, balanced
economic recovery with low mortgage rates, more jobs and more income
tax-free. Our economic plan is delivering that. The Opposition’s
plan for more spending and more borrowing would make things
worse<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0001.htm#13091038000034"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Cryer" PimsId="2791" UID="13091038002029" xid="144" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0001.htm#13091038002029">John

restraint in the private sector and the public sector has helped
preserve jobs during the economic shock that we experienced under the
previous Government. That is partly a credit to the labour market
flexibility of the policies that previous Governments introduced in the
1980s and early 1990s and the last Government did not reverse. The wage
restraint has helped us preserve more jobs than would otherwise have
been the case in the public sector, which is why at least until

Chancellor of the Exchequer (Mr George Osborne):</Member></B> This year
the Government are taking further steps to help small businesses. We
have increased the investment allowance tenfold, and from next April we
will introduce a new employment allowance worth £2,000 for every
small employer, taking around one third of small employers out of
employer national insurance contributions altogether. From next Monday
we will help small businesses get the best deal from their banks by
guaranteeing that they can switch their accounts within seven days.
That service will also be available to families, which is real choice
and competition in banking being introduced by the
Government.</hs_Para>

million over the next two years to deal with seasonal

is an avoidable pressure on the NHS. Every year, around 750,000
patients see their GP with flu symptoms and nearly 5,000 people die.
While flu levels have been comparatively low in the last two years, it

happen, it will increase pressure on A and Es, which have already seen

best way to protect oneself and other people from flu is to get the flu

27,000 people spend time in hospital with flu every year, so it is very
important that NHS staff should do all they can to avoid getting, and
passing on, flu. Less than half of front-line NHS staff get vaccinated
against flu. In some hospitals, that drops to fewer than one in five.
The Government want to boost significantly the number of health care
workers getting the flu vaccine. Trusts will not be eligible to receive

Burnham:</Member></B> This Secretary of State has been in office for
one year—the worst year in A and E in a decade: close to 1
million people waiting more than four hours, and on his watch, the
first summer A and E crisis in living memory. But with this Government
it is always someone else’s fault: GPs, nurses, patients, the
weather, immigration, bank holidays—nothing to do with him, Mr
Speaker, he is just a member of the public, as he is fond of saying.
Well, I have got news for him: he is the Secretary of State, and it is
time he started acting like it. All year we have warned him about the
growing A and E crisis. First, he ignored those warnings, leaving A and
E ill-prepared on the brink of a dangerous winter, as the NHS
Confederation has warned. Now, in panic, he briefs out half-baked
plans, without coming to this House. This is too little, too late. It
is not good enough that we have had to drag him here on an issue of
huge importance to our constituents. With his spin about the GP
contract, he neglects the real causes.</hs_Para>

on staffing, we learn today of the shocking shortage of doctors
covering A and Es overnight, and we heard at the weekend reports of A
and Es up and down the land without enough staff. More than 5,000
nursing jobs have been lost on the Government’s watch—and
counting. Enough is enough. When will the Secretary of State stop the
job cuts and ensure that all A and Es have enough staff to provide safe
care?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0001.htm#13091038000213">Secondly,
on GP opening hours, the Secretary of State tries to blame the 2004
contract but conveniently ignores the fact that A and E performance
improved between 2004 and 2010. The truth is that it is the Government
who have let GP practices stop evening and weekend surgeries, and it is
the Government who ended the guarantee of appointments within 48 hours.

on social care, in the first two years of this Government there was an
appalling 66% increase in the number of people aged over 90 coming into
A and E via a blue-light ambulance—that is more than 100,000
very frail and frightened people in the backs of ambulances speeding
through our cities and towns. That is a scandal, and it is more to do
with social care cuts than anything else. I do not know how many more

the while the Secretary of State blames a contract signed 10 years ago
for today’s pressure he neglects the real causes of his A and E

to turn the NHS into a political football, he, disappointingly, paints
a picture that is a long way from reality. He talks about A and E
performance. Yes, since I have been Health Secretary we have missed our
target in one quarter, but when he was Health Secretary he missed it in
two of the three quarters, including 14 weeks over the crucial winter
period. What he does not tell the House is that this Government
actually hit their A and E target for the year as a whole, whereas in
Labour-controlled Wales the NHS budget has been cut and the A and
E target has not been hit since 2009—he repeatedly
refuses to confront
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T12:42:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0001.htm#13091038000217">The
right hon. Gentleman talks about the number of nurses being down. He
might want to check the figures and correct the record for the House
when he uses the 5,000 figure, because the fact is that the number of
hospital nurses—hospitals are where A and E departments
are—has gone up under this Government, as has the number of
doctors, health visitors and midwives. None of that would be possible
if we had cut the NHS budget by £600 million from its current
levels, which is his

right hon. Gentleman then talks about the social care budget. Under his
Government the number of over-80s went up by more than a quarter, yet
the Labour Government cut social care funding per head. We have

I am afraid that Labour Members are burying their heads in the sand

one of the most senior doctors in the NHS and responsible for all A and
E services in NHS England, has said that between 15% and 30% of the
people using A and E could be using primary care instead. That is why
we are announcing really important changes to the way in which the GP
contract operates, in order to address this problem. When the
Government come before the House with a sensible package of short-term
and long-term measures, any responsible Opposition would welcome

are put in place. He is absolutely right that joined-up integrated
services are critical for A and E departments, because one of the
biggest problems that they mention is the difficulty in discharging
people from hospital, which makes it hard for them to admit patients
who need to be admitted, often in very distressed circumstances. We
also need to address the longer-term IT problems which mean that A and

address why people go to A and E instead of the alternatives, such as
walk-in centres. Communication about the alternatives to A and E is not
as good as it needs to be. We are addressing those issues, but I must
say to the right hon. Gentleman that the previous Government failed to
address this problem when he was Health Minister and the difficult

critical. We have already said that we want another 2,000 GPs and are
considering whether that is enough. We recognise the fact that general
practice is very stretched, that we need GPs to offer more services and
that we need more people to do that. Professor Keogh’s review is
considering A and E departments, and one thing we are asking is why we
are one of the only countries in Europe to have an emergency medicine
specialty. Other countries do not do that and ask all doctors to spend
time in A and E. We are also considering what we need to do to make A
and E a more attractive profession for people to go into, given the

this winter and next winter. Improving 111 is an important part of the
long-term solution for A and E. If there is one thing that
could persuade people not to go to their local A and E, it is to pick
up the phone and get a good service. We have 92% satisfaction rates
with 111 now, after the teething problems earlier in the year, but I
think it can be even better. One of the things that would make the
biggest difference is if we did something that has never happened
before, which is to make it possible for doctors at the end of the
111 lines to access people’s medical records, with
their consent. Then people would be talking to someone who knew about
them, their allergies and their medical history. That is a big change.
It never happened under the previous Government. Their
attempts—<I>[Interruption.]</I> NHS Direct had no access to

more doctors who want to work in A and E departments. That is a
longer-term challenge, but one of the ways in which we will make A and

is right. The reason why the 100 or so hospitals that have not
benefited today did not get money is that our assessment is that they
have outstanding leadership and will be able to cope. That is not,
however, to minimise the pressure they will be under or the fact that
it will be extremely hard work. I pay tribute to them because, as good
hospitals, they often have to deal with more people wanting to go

Mr Speaker. On 2 September at Defence questions, I asked the Defence
Secretary about a UK firm granted a licence to sell chemicals to Syria
in 2012. The licence was revoked because of tougher EU sanctions. In
reply, the Defence Secretary admitted that the export licences had been
granted for some industrial chemicals that could have been used in
processes that might be involved in the production of poisonous gases
in Syria, but stated that no such chemicals were exported because the
licences were revoked.</hs_Para>

Member for Tonbridge and Malling (Sir John Stanley), who chairs the

saying that the Defence Secretary’s statement in answer to my

April this year said that although the order had been revoked because
of tougher EU sanctions, that could not prevent shipments of chemicals
already sent to Syria.</hs_Para>

ill health is a fact of life, but the figures surprise me. One in three

someone who is mentally ill. In people under 65, mental illness
accounts for nearly half of all ill health. The economic cost amounts
to over £100 billion a year, but the human cost—the
suffering—is intangible. Many mental health problems, if
untreated, can shatter lives.</hs_Para>

the obvious scale of the problem, only in the past few years have
mental health issues started to emerge from the shadows of our society.
Mental health is often a problem that people feel they need to hide,
cover up, or excuse—and for far too long, Governments and
society have felt as though they needed to do the same. I therefore
welcome recent significant and major advances in the provision of
mental health services. One of those is the pioneering
IAPT—improving access to psychological
therapies—programme, designed significantly to increase the
availability of National Institute for Health and Care
Excellence-recommended psychological treatments for depression and
anxiety disorders. This has been particularly successful and is now in
its fifth year, having treated over 1 million people.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T13:34:56"></hs_TimeCode> addition, the

health in their mental health strategy and in the NHS mandate marks a

a major disparity continues to exist regarding access to mental and
physical health services in the NHS, and that is what the Bill seeks to
address. Astonishingly, it remains the case that people with mental
health problems do not have the same rights to timely access to
treatment as those with other types of ill health. Despite the fact
that the NHS constitution embeds the right to access certain services
commissioned by NHS bodies within maximum waiting times, this excludes
anyone who is waiting for psychological therapy. That means that at
present there is no statutory maximum waiting time for mental health
treatment of this type. In contrast, according to the NHS constitution,
patients with a physical complaint have the right to be seen within 18
weeks.</hs_Para>

of treatment and long waiting times have a huge impact on
people’s lives. People are being forced to live with
debilitating mental health problems day in, day out. Relationships can
break down and many people are forced to take time off from work or
give up a job completely. Children with mental health problems, unable
to seek appropriate treatment, miss out on months of vital schooling,
disrupting not only their education and their social development but
their whole future. Perhaps most importantly, early treatment prevents
later mental health crises. Rates of detention under the Mental Health
Act 1983 are increasing year on year. They currently stand at 42% of
all admissions to hospital, suggesting that people are not able to
access the early support and treatment that are so vital to prevent
major crises later on. One sufferer testified to

better and more timely access to treatment is not only the right thing
to do but makes sound economic sense. The Centre for Mental Health
estimates that, as I said, the economic and social costs of mental
health problems amount to over £100 billion a year. In
comparison, the wider annual UK cost of obesity is
£15 billion. Let us take one example, among many, of
where savings could be made: depression. Extending NICE-recommended
treatments to all those with depression could deliver £1 billion
in economic benefits each year, with treatment costs vastly outweighed
by higher Government revenues and reduced welfare payments, as well as
wider social benefits.</hs_Para>

Friend the Minister of State has done, and continues to do, to ensure
we work towards parity in this area. He has long argued that we must
have access standards in mental health, and I am aware that his
Department is starting to look at those issues, specifically through
the NHS mandate “Refresh” document, currently out for
consultation. I also welcome increased investment for IAPT in the
recent comprehensive spending review, which I am sure he fought hard to
secure. The Bill would ensure that that momentum is not lost. Over the
past 10 years, much has been achieved and we have made enormous
strides. However, achieving parity for mental health is a monumental
task, and although we have made tremendous progress, the job is far
from finished.</hs_Para>

anxieties, and many others that will be expressed in the debates on the
various clauses that come before us today, are debated by the

filibuster so that those points were not reached, it would be an act of

stands in my name and that of my right hon. and hon. Friends, and is
linked to amendment 46. I will also speak to new clause 4
although I do not intend to speak to any other amendments. Briefly, let
me explain the context behind why I tabled these amendments. Part 2 of
the Bill sets out limits and rules relating to non-party political
campaigning. As I understand it, the Government’s intention is
to draw a clear distinction between the activities of those such as
charities and interest groups that seek particular policy outcomes that
they promote to all candidates and parties in an election, against
those third parties that seek to influence the outcome of an election
by support or opposition to particular parties or candidates.</hs_Para>

system is based on a principle enshrined for many years that all
political activity at elections, whether by established party or
non-party groups, is regulated as to the amount of expenditure they may
use. That is a long-held view. Our electoral system has held that
unlimited funding on the US model is not how we wish to do our politics
or elections, and that we should have expenditure limits. I wholly
concur with that principle.</hs_Para>

therefore right that non-party political campaigns should be subject to
that principle just as much as parties—a point that was clearly
accepted in the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.
Indeed, if one were to reverse the argument, it would be very odd if
non-partisan groups, or even charities, were to argue that they alone
should be free to have an unfettered right to spend money with regard
to who wins or loses an election, either in the country or an
individual seat. Notwithstanding that principle, there are justifiable
concerns about some aspects of the drafting of this Bill, and the
amendments seek to address one such concern.</hs_Para>

drafted, amends section 85 of the 2000 Act. Amendment 47 paves way for
the meat of the issue, which is amendment 46. It simply puts forward
the proposition that we should leave the status quo in place. By
deleting subsections (3) and (4), the amendment seeks to state that the
Government wish to proceed on the basis that nothing has changed in
that definition, so that is what we should have. My proposition is
straightforward: let us stick with the status
quo.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000368" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000368"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T13:50:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Tom Brake" PimsId="2268" UID="13091038002291" xid="64" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038002291">The

legislation. Let me remind the Committee that the Bill has had no
pre-legislative scrutiny and that there was no attempt by the
Government to consult the many organisations that will be affected.
There was no prior consultation with the devolved institutions or even
the Electoral Commission, which will have the unenviable task of
ensuring that the Bill is implemented properly. Like the Electoral
Commission, we believe there is a need to review and update the
UK’s party and election finance laws. The Electoral Commission
has made 50 proposals for change, but have the Government had any
dialogue with the commission? The answer is no. They have simply pulled

before the NCVO meeting, the Leader of the House responded to concerns
by saying, “Don’t worry, you’ve all got it wrong.
We are absolutely certain that we are right and you are all wrong. This
won’t affect charities and voluntary organisations at
all.” That was the Government’s line. On Friday, as has
been said, he changed his tune and indicated to the NCVO that there
would be a concession. I would like to know what precisely the
concession will be.

the individual spending limit of each organisation. I have heard the

Fair enough. That code of practice will be issued under paragraph 3(2)

important, in this context, to reinforce what he has said. New powers
are being bestowed on the Electoral Commission that it does not want
because they will allow the commission to become judge and jury on a
whole range of difficult and complex areas without a clear piece of

168, 169 and 171, and my new clause 9, focus on the problems and
uncertainty that the Bill creates in the devolved regions and nations.
It has been said that the interface between this Bill and the currently
existing rules is not straightforward. In essence, I would suggest that
three things appear to be clear; the Minister can correct me if my
interpretation is wrong. First, it is clear that clause 26 and schedule
3 will apply to all devolved elections, as well as to general
elections. Secondly, it is clear that clause 31, which focuses on the
registration procedures of the Electoral Commission, will also apply 
<?notus-xml column=865?>to devolved elections. Thirdly, it is clear that
clause 27, with new registration thresholds, will also apply to
devolved
elections.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000430" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000430">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T14:21:01"></hs_TimeCode>,
other aspects of the Bill, which I have not mentioned, will not apply
to devolved elections. The application of the Bill to devolved
elections is important because the conflict between the different
aspects of the legislation will create enormous difficulties in Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland. Those issues are particularly important
in those countries because the third sector plays a far greater role in
the devolved institutions than it does in England. That is particularly
so in Northern Ireland, where the impact will be greatest of all. It
gives me a great deal of pleasure to be the president of the Council
for Wales of Voluntary Youth Services—I hasten to add that I am
in receipt of no remuneration for that honorary position. I know that
the relationship of the voluntary youth sector in Wales with the Welsh
Assembly is healthy and positive. This Bill makes that relationship
more difficult, yet there has been no consultation with any of the
devolved Administrations.</hs_Para>

little—we are principally talking about clause 26, but it also
relates to later clauses, which will be dealt with later 
<?notus-xml column=867?>in the day. It is in this context that the comments from the Electoral
Commission—the primary executing agency of this Bill—come
into play. It uses the words “significant regulatory
uncertainty”, saying that parts of the Bill are
“impossible to enforce” and pointing out
“significant issues of workability”. What are we doing?
We are transforming a bureaucratic organisation, with the powers to
make rules on policy campaigning, as well as to relax those rules,
tighten the rules, amend them retrospectively and then apply them
retrospectively to freedom of speech—something that is, by
definition, oppressive. By definition, that will chill freedom of
speech. This Parliament has created a bureaucracy without the ability
to alter, change or amend the rules before—it was known as the
Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority. What we are creating in
this Bill is—if we want a precursor of how this will play
out—an IPSA for elections.</hs_Para>

of the points that I made on Second Reading was that those third

They are already significantly constrained in the activities they can
undertake during an election period. In my extensive experience of the

those responsibilities seriously and tend to err on the side of caution

other forms of regulation that seem to be working well. Charity
regulation is certainly working well in Scotland, and since the

far-reaching consequences for the quality of life of thousands of

Gentleman would be the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009. Had this
Bill been in force, it would have coincided with the 2010 general
election, so the cross-party political consensus created around that
Act—world-leading legislation—simply would not have
happened. It was the key role of civil society actors that enabled and
facilitated the emergence of that consensus. That is one of the reasons
I am concerned that the Bill in its current form will inhibit
democratic debate and not move us any further

for his helpful intervention. Speaking as someone who has been a
trustee of charities, very small and larger, more robust organisations
working in a highly professionalised environment, I know just how true
what the hon. Gentleman said is. Trustees of charities are inherently
quite risk averse: they cannot fall back on huge reserves, and they are
very careful in what they do. As I say, it is already a very regulated
sector and, for the most part, a well-governed sector. The bigger the
charity—this applies particularly to the big campaigning
charities—the more attention gets paid to governance and to
ensuring that it is operating within the
law.</hs_Para>

understanding of the law is that if a charity is engaged in an activity
that might affect the outcome of an election, it needs to identify,
first, whether that activity can be engaged in legally under charity
law and, secondly, whether the activity would have an effect on the
election. If it did have such an effect, the activity would, under

Goodman</B> (Bishop Auckland) (Lab):</Member> A new low has been
reached in the handling of the Bill. I do not think that we have seen
such a shambles since the last occasion on which the Leader of the
House was involved with a piece of legislation. At least on that
occasion there was a pause when the Government decided to go back to
the drawing board. This time, we seem to be being expected to debate a
Bill which the Minister himself, from the Dispatch Box, has said is not
adequate and must be changed. I am pleased to see that the Chair of the
Procedure Committee, the hon. Member for Broxbourne (Mr Walker), is in
the Chamber, because I feel that the Committee should consider the
process issues connected with the Bill.</hs_Para>

peculiarly ironic that the Minister, the right hon. Member for
Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), is a Liberal Democrat. One would
think that, of all the things that the Liberal Democrats could defend,
one would be liberal democracy. This is about the nature of our
democracy, and I really think that the Liberal Democrat members of the
coalition should learn to stand up to the Tory members. The Bill is
clearly a highly political piece of legislation, aimed at defending
Tory donors and attacking the civil society groups that might support
any other political activity and any other political
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000506" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000506">It
is particularly worrying that the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet

experiences working in the voluntary sector, as they help to explain
why I am so horrified by the contents of clause 26. Before I was
elected to this House I worked in three voluntary sector organisations:
the Runnymede Trust, the Church of England Children’s Society
and the National Association of Toy and Leisure Libraries, which I ran.
The Church of England Children’s Society, in particular, did a
lot of campaigning work alongside all the many practical projects it
ran. It is perverse to put a limit on the amount that voluntary sector
organisations can spend on campaigning in the run-up to a general
election because that is when they can most effectively influence the
political process, as that is when the political parties are writing
their manifestos and when candidates are standing for election and

never be certain of when there will be a general election. A voluntary

for Nottingham North (Mr Allen) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>for St Ives
(Andrew George), would require the Government to carry out a proper
assessment of the effect of third-party campaigning on UK elections,
because I want to know what problem the Government think they are
trying to fix. Alongside the rest of part 2, the changes made by clause
26 would silence legitimate campaigning voices in the run-up to
elections. Equally alarmingly, Ministers are trying to push through
this clampdown without a shred of evidence that there is a problem with
third sector organisations exerting an undue influence over elections
in the first place. As many hon. Members have said, the best way to 
<?notus-xml column=879?>proceed would be to ditch the whole of part 2 and only introduce changes
for which there is a robust evidence base—one that would attract
cross-party support—and which could take place after
consultation with all organisations affected. That is what new clause
10 proposes.</hs_Para>

strongly believe that there is a case for revisiting the current
legislation, introduced by Labour in 2000 with the primary aim of
preventing the emergence of US-style front groups working for
particular candidates or parties, because the existing legislation has
already been criticised for being heavy-handed in how it goes about
achieving what is, of course, a laudable aim. As a result,
some fiercely non-party political organisations are already
saying that even the current rules have had some dampening
effect on the freedom of charities and civil society organisations to
campaign on policy issues—not for any political party or
candidate—around the time of
elections<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:12:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000533">The
crucial point must be to proceed on the basis not of hearsay but of a
sound evidence base. It is right to examine the effect that third-party
campaigning has had at elections in the UK and whether it has exerted
undue influence over elections. It is also right to look at whether the
activities of charities and civil society groups have harmed the public
perception of the political system, as the Cabinet Office contends. But
such a review must surely also look at whether the opposite is closer
to the truth. It must ask whether existing rules are already too
restrictive: do they make it unnecessarily difficult for the public to
hear the opinions of those who might have different views from
particular parties or candidates; are they imposing disproportionate
limits on the ability of charities and others to engage in political
and policy debate as one way of pursuing their charitable purposes; and
are they preventing people from getting together to seek to influence
the policies and positions of those who want to become their elected

fundamental principle at issue today is the right of citizens to
express their views and argue for or against a particular policy, and
to do so by joining with others who share their concerns. It is that
combination of the people who come together that we need to protect. We
must not rush into changes that could make a bad situation worse when
it comes to public engagement with the democratic process and
elections. We need an even-handed and thorough review of the current
rules. Like others, I am looking forward to seeing the details of the
Government’s concession, but there is a real fear that even if
their changes do what they claim they will, this Bill will still impose
a dangerously anti-democratic chilling effect on legitimate voices
seeking to raise awareness and stimulate debate on issues of crucial
public interest, be it NHS reform, fuel poverty, housing policy or
wildlife
conservation.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13091038002015" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038002015">3.15

other hon. Members have said, charities already have to be
non-political under charity law, and they do not need this extra layer
of regulation. Other groups that do not operate as charities also play
a crucial role in public debate, as do the trade unions. Such
organisations include the World Development Movement, which campaigns
on tackling the root causes of global poverty. Although that is surely
an issue of cross-party concern, the WDM, like others, is fiercely
independent from any political
party.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000540">If
we change the meaning of “controlled expenditure” in a
way that, alongside other measures, shuts down healthy public debate on

who disagree. The opposite should be true, particularly in the run-up

fundamentally misunderstands the difference between engaging in
political debate and electioneering. It actively ignores the huge
contribution that pressure groups and charities play in enriching
democratic debate by raising public awareness, contributing to
political thinking, and holding elected representatives to account. If
it passes into law it will not only be harder for the public to hear
the opinions of those that might have different views than the
particular parties or candidates. It’s also very likely that

should be seeking to encourage, not eradicate, debate, difficult as
that may be at times. Such debate and challenge makes a positive
contribution to accountability, policy making and public engagement in
the political process itself. Too many people already feel turned off
and disempowered when it comes to politics. Too many people feel that
they do not really have an 
<?notus-xml column=881?>influence over the future of their neighbourhoods,
their national Government or, indeed, international affairs. That is
why I believe that the small concessions we are being offered this
afternoon—or at least the promise of them some time in the
future—are totally inadequate at this stage. We should
absolutely reject clause 26. This Government once spoke about the big
society, but we are seeing today a Government intent on smothering the
big society and instead bringing forward a much smaller society, one
that will be much less well-informed than it is
today.</hs_Para>

big corporate donors who had meetings with people we knew not

tradition of charities being allowed to campaign on political issues
germane to their charitable activities is at the heart of British life
and our democracy. It has been established in case law since 1917, a
year before universal male suffrage. Well before women had the vote,
Lord Normand, in the case of Bowman <I>v.</I> Secular Society, held
that a society whose predominant aim was not to change the law could be
charitable when its campaign to change the law was merely a subsidiary
activity. That tradition has a long pedigree in this country and I do
not believe that it should be for tinkering politicians, perhaps
fearful of the impact of Cameron and Clegg non-mania in 2015, to play
with it.

real issue, of course, is that there has not been any consultation.
There has been no time for anyone to look at this in advance. I had the
privilege yesterday of meeting a number of third-sector organisations
in Cardiff—some Wales-only organisations, and some that also
operate UK-wide but quite properly have offices in Cardiff or other
parts of Wales, which facilitates their engagement with the National
Assembly for Wales. It is extremely important to consult—even to
speak today, I found it essential to consult, listen to and read a lot
of the material that those groups have kindly produced in a very short
time
indeed.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13091038002016" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038002016">3.30

was utter disbelief and anger that the Government had made no attempt
to consult the organisations. Those are organisations that feed in
regularly, whether to legislation or to Select Committee inquiries.
They often do enormous amounts of research, and they help us by
providing useful facts and figures and giving evidence that we can
often use. I think of organisations—perhaps the RSPB—that
are well respected, have a wide remit and often operate across the
political spectrum, perhaps uniting groups of people who might not
otherwise meet, to campaign together on a specific
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000573" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000573">The
Welsh Assembly elections are an additional challenge for groups
operating in Wales, because taking into consideration the period in
which the legislation would apply—12 months before a general
election, plus the 
<?notus-xml column=885?>few months before a Welsh Assembly election, plus
the European elections—a rather large chunk of any five-year
period is a no-go area, when those organisations cannot operate. The
real shame is that many of those organisations are involved in policy
formation. Some of the work that they do—their ideas and
discussions—results in substantial contributions to policy. If
any one party were then to adopt that policy, the whole of the
legislation could then apply retrospectively to many of the activities
that they had carried out, including the staff time to put that policy
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000574" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000574">Not
only would those organisations be less inclined to get involved in the
work that is so vital to us, but the net would be flung far wider and

them, it would be much more practical to provide clarification of

course, it makes it especially difficult when organisations are trying
to influence policy both in the devolved Administrations and in the UK
Government. So many areas overlap now. It can be big things such as
climate change, which was mentioned earlier; it can be things like fuel
poverty or it can be much smaller things, which are partly devolved,
partly not. A lot of work is done by such groups in influencing both
the devolved Administrations and more

intervention, to which the Deputy Leader of the House should pay
attention. I am not saying that he has not paid entire attention to
every remark made this afternoon; I am sure he has. I refer to the fear
that charities have about criminal offences being committed. They will
not know about being in breach of the legislation until after the
event. It is imperative that the Government 
<?notus-xml column=887?>write into the Bill that any new criminal offences created by it,
particularly in parts 1 and 2, will not have retrospective effect. That
is essential, otherwise the Secretary of State could not sign the

move forward and get things right. I hope that, whatever the Government

that that could materially influence an election outcome, perhaps

mentioned Hope not Hate is that it is a classic example of an
organisation that conducts not only national but local campaigns in
specific constituencies, boroughs and districts. According to Hope not
Hate, with which I and many Members from all parties have done a lot of
work in the past, its spending in the run-up 
<?notus-xml column=889?>to the next election will be cut by 70%. It also calculates, accurately,
that its limit per constituency over the same period will be about
£9,000. That will have a material effect on anti-racist
campaigning in the run-up to the next election. As I have said, Hope
not Hate campaigns with all democratic parties, not just one or
two<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:47:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:47:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:47:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000600" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000600">I
cannot help thinking that part 2 is not entirely divorced from the fact
that one or two Liberal Democrat MPs will be facing potentially
strenuous campaigns by the National Union of Students in the run-up to
the next election. One Member who springs to mind is the Deputy Prime
Minister. For those who do not know Sheffield that well, I point out
that his constituency is surrounded by a sea of student accommodation
for a large university. I suspect that the Deputy Prime Minister is a
little bit worried that the student voices that were sympathetic to the
Liberal Democrats at the last election will now be saying,
“Well, hang on a minute: the leader of the Liberal Democratic
party stood on a specific pledge of not raising tuition fees, but he
went back on it and voted for, and actually helped introduce,
legislation that tripled tuition fees.” I do not think that that
was a million miles away from his mind when he was considering part 2
of this Bill, and I think that is why it is receiving enthusiastic
support from not all but certain Liberal Democrat
Members<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:48:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:48:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000601" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0002.htm#13091038000601">I

questioned whether the Bill is compliant. The Government’s
assessment is that we consider all the spending limits in the Bill to
be compatible with article 10  
<?notus-xml column=895?>and have taken into account the amount that the third parties are
permitted to spend under the reduced limits and the amount that they
spend now. Clearly this has been given active consideration by the
Government, as the hon. Gentleman would
expect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000652" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0003.htm#13091038000652">The
main purpose of clause 26 is to align the activities that count as
controlled expenditure for political parties and third parties. At
present, the activities that count as controlled expenditure depend on
whether we are referring to a political party or a third party. This
means that spending by recognised third parties to assist a political
party with the cost of an event would be captured as political party
spending. However, if the recognised third party were independently to
organise such an event itself—perhaps supporting that same
party—such spending would not be caught. That highlights why we
are trying to ensure that these two definitions—for third
parties and for political parties—are brought into
line.</hs_Para>

the Electoral Commission that the current variation in what constitutes
controlled expenditure for a political party and for a recognised third
party is a potential gap in the regulation of spending in the UK
elections, hence the intention behind clause 26. I believe that
aligning the definition of controlled expenditure is a reasonable and
sensible measure. However, to achieve this, the current definition of
election materials needs to be revised.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I hope Members will let me finish
what I am saying before trying to intervene. At present, recognised
third parties incur controlled expenditure in connection with the
production or publication of election material that is made available
to the public. As a result, the Bill proposes to replace
“election materials” with “for election
purposes”; as we are aligning the activities with those of
parties, we are also aligning the language of the
test.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000654" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0003.htm#13091038000654">As
we have said, the Government do not believe that we are significantly
changing or widening the present test. Controlled expenditure would be
incurred only where an organisation is promoting or procuring the
electoral success of a party or candidate. However, I am conscious, as

the proposals in clause 26 and that the new language leaves room for

for Nottingham North seek, as previous amendments have done, to strike
a balance between the reasonable intent of expanding the range of
activities that incur controlled expenditure, and addressing concerns
over the activities of charities and voluntary organisations being
caught. Amendment 131 seeks to revise the definition of “for
election purposes” as activity that can reasonably be regarded
as promoting or procuring the success of a party or candidate. As the
Government have indicated, we support the principle of that aim, and we

further amendment tabled by the hon. Gentleman proposes that donations
by a third party to a third party coalition group should count towards
the donor third party’s spending limits. That seems to suggest
that such a grouping would register as a separate, new third party and
be subject to the wider controls of the Political Parties, Elections
and Referendums Act 2000. The intention appears to be to repeal section
94(6) of PPERA. That provision stipulates that when two or more third
parties work together as a group or coalition in pursuance of a common
plan, the whole of the expenditure they incur as part of that coalition
must count against each third party’s spending limit separately.
However, the drafting of the amendment would not explicitly repeal
section 94(6).
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:23:24"></hs_TimeCode> amendment
also fails to consider that removing the existing provisions on acting
in concert would remove a key anti-avoidance measure from PPERA. If
total spending by a group of third parties acting as part of a common
plan was not counted in full against each individual third
party’s limits, it would allow third parties to form many
coalitions on single issues in order to evade their spending limits.
That would remove a vital safeguard from the integrity of the
rules<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:24:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091038000681" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0003.htm#13091038000681"><B><Member ContinuationText="Angela Smith" PimsId="4808" UID="13091038002480" xid="886" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0003.htm#13091038002480">Angela

hoped to hear from him that it was, in fact, a case of the
Government’s listening to the concerns expressed by charities

Short money and Cranborne money to help the parliamentary activities of
Opposition parties, but we have consistently decided that the state
would not fund political parties and that they would instead be funded
by private donations, trade union donations and business donations. It

for it to do so. It would be an outrage if one of the most
admired and apolitical bodies in this country suddenly

Charities are not there to intervene in general elections. They have
specific tax benefits and their ability to fundraise is dependent on
them being charitable, not political, and there is a clear difference.
There is no question of the Royal British Legion becoming a third party
in a general election. That is the classic scare story that
we hear again and again from the Opposition, who wish to obfuscate and
confuse matters because they are worried that their trade union masters
will, under this clause, have the amount they can spend reduced. They
hide it; they camouflage it under this complaint on behalf of the

in the context of this much more fundamental and necessary reform of
election funding. Let us be clear: that is the right way to tackle the
issue because, to put it quite simply, the big money is not in third
party spending. Political parties nationally—as my hon. Friend
the Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne) has said—spent
£31 million in the 2010 election, compared with just £3
million by third party campaigners. The biggest third party spender
spent just 4% of the £17 million spent by the

would be looking at a reduction in the overall expenditure cap for
political parties during election years. If the Conservative party, in
particular, is serious about taking the big money out of
politics, it will withdraw this mess of a Bill and commit to meaningful
reform. This is a bad, and badly drafted, Bill and it is very unlikely
that, however much it is amended, it will stand up to

coalition is to place reform of third party spending in elections
clearly in the context of a cross-party consensus on political party
funding and political party spending. We need to see a cap on donations
to political parties—our leader has suggested a cap of
£5,000 —and we need to see meaningful reductions in
spending limits by political parties in general elections. We need to
stop this spending race, which sees spiralling sums of money spent on
successive elections. No more dodgy dinners in Downing street; no more
bankrolling of the Conservative party by a tiny number of wealthy City
donors. The Electoral Commission itself has made it clear that reform
of third party spending is needed, but not like this.

want any Member in any part of the Chamber to talk about U-turns, or to

magnanimity, however, can be extended to clause 27. Clause 27 is the
clause that is the most obnoxious to the charities that many of us

unprecedented amounts of reporting, and the second is to impose limits
on their spending that are far more fierce and far more rigorous than
those that currently apply.</hs_Para>

expect it to be perfect, and I think that we shall need to revisit it
in a

put our shoulder to the wheel, as our charities and voluntary
organisations are asking us to do. We do not have much choice: we
should do the right thing by them. I hope that as the Bill proceeds
through its various stages, there will be a number of opportunities for

there is a message for Opposition Members to take away and consider,
just as there is for Government Members. State-funded activists are
engaged in direct lobbying of politicians and indirect lobbying of the
public using taxpayers’ money, and I think that blurs the
distinction between private and public action.</hs_Para>

27(1) seeks to reduce by 50% the level at which a non-recognised third
party such as a charity, voluntary organisation or social enterprise

stand, the clause will bring thousands, potentially tens of thousands,

happens, charities that are already facing huge cuts under this
Government will be forced to shoulder an immense burden of new
administration and a whole tier of extra costs. As a former CEO of

Amendment 101 is already gaining traction, and we are told that there
will be an even harder version of it on Report. I therefore think that
it needs to be fully and  
<?notus-xml column=936?>fairly reported. Not only would the amendment restrict the use of public
funds for campaigning, it basically states that nobody can do anything
that would come under controlled expenditure if they receive public
funds, even if they are not using those funds for anything that might
be defined as controlled expenditure. Therefore, if a charity,
community or voluntary group receives funding, whether from the local
council, a European programme, a Department or another public body,
perhaps under a service level agreement, it can in no way use the
advocacy side of its role in anything that might involve controlled
expenditure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061000080">In
the context of Northern Ireland it is important for organisations that
work and engage with young people who are otherwise

ways socially disconnected—to get public funds. It also good
that in election periods they ensure there is discussion, political
conversation and an opportunity for political parties, and others, to
engage. Nothing is done that is unfair or gives advantage to any party.
Indeed, the kind of hustings that are called put all parties on their

good that women’s groups get funding, although it is often not
enough. Groups such as Foyle Woman’s Aid in my constituency, or

It is important that they too are part of the democratic conversation

Ireland from the traditional binary divide that our media keep getting
us caught into. All parties complain that we are constantly brought in

based on our experience in the field, working alongside people living

the substance of the hon. Gentleman’s proposals, amendment 101
would amend clause 27 so that third parties in receipt of public
funding would, 12 months before the commencement of a regulated period
up to an election, be prohibited from incurring controlled expenditure
in that regulated period. It would be an offence for them to
do so. Many individuals and organisations receive public funding to
undertake work—for example, providing services or carrying out
research—that also further the Government’s aims.
Preventing such individuals or organisations from campaigning during
the regulated period for parliamentary elections, as the amendment

been clear that we are not seeking to stop organisations campaigning on
policy issues, and we are not seeking to stop them campaigning
politically, although we are seeking to reduce the cap in the way

greater transparency to third party campaigning. It will not prohibit
campaigning altogether, as the amendment seeks to do. I therefore urge

66 would amend clause 27 so that it no longer lowers the expenditure
threshold that third parties may exceed only after they register with
the Electoral Commission. Clause 27 proposes that those registration
thresholds be set at £5,000 in England and £2,000 in
Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The Government are seeking to do

No. 66, upon registration with the Electoral Commission, third parties
become entitled to incur controlled expenditure up to a higher limit
and will have to comply with other regulatory requirements. The Bill
lowers the thresholds in order to identify greater numbers of third
parties that campaign in the political process. It is right to
distinguish which organisations incur expenditure campaigning at
elections and to ensure that their funds are fully accounted for.
Reducing the registration thresholds, as proposed by the Bill, does not
preclude third parties from campaigning. This is a point that, I am
afraid, a number of Members have made: that a requirement simply to
register will stop organisations campaigning. That is not so. The
requirement to register will mean that the expenditure that they can
incur is controlled. In the light of that, I hope that the hon. Member
for Caerphilly will withdraw the
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061000111">Amendment
No. 165 proposes that until the Electoral Commission has undertaken an
assessment of the impact of clause 27 on political parties and on third
parties and that report is laid before Parliament, the provisions of
clause 27 may not come into effect. I have been asked why we have
settled on the cap. Clause 27 amends the third party limits for
controlled expenditure. These limits would be the equivalent of 2% of
the maximum campaign expenditure limit for political parties. For third
party campaigning across the UK, this would be £390,000. As hon.
Members will be aware, currently the level at which it is set does not
cover or catch any of the third party
organisations.</hs_Para>

at £390,000 would, as I stated earlier, capture two
organisations that currently spend slightly above that cap. We think
that that would, first, provide equality of arms in relation to the
examples to which the Chair of the Select committee referred—the
League Against Cruel Sports and the Countryside Alliance. It would
ensure that one organisation campaigning in favour of something could
not be heavily outgunned financially by another campaigning on the
opposite side of the
argument.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061000113">If
at the next general election, the threshold were set where it is
currently and the 30 organisations that registered all spent at their
current limit—the £1 million, or just under, that they
are allowed to spend nationally—they would have been able to
outspend, very heavily, each of the political parties. Our view is that
election campaigns are about political parties fighting and setting out
their stalls, with, of course, third party organisations campaigning as
well, but it should in principle be a battle between political
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061000114">Clause
27 also lowers the expenditure thresholds at which the third parties
must register with the Electoral Commission: the thresholds are set at
£5,000 in England and £2,000 in Scotland, Wales and
Northern Ireland. As I stated, the Government’s assessment is
that that would 
<?notus-xml column=941?>affect a total of 30 additional non-party organisations, not charities,
as I stated earlier. Thirty additional non-party organisations might be
caught by the lower threshold. The Government have already published an
impact assessment on the provisions of the Bill, which
considers the impact of the lowered registration threshold.
It assessed that only a small number of third parties would
be required to register and become subject to the regulatory framework.
This will not create new administrative burdens for already registered
third parties but, as I stated, may affect 30 additional non-party
organisations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061000115">The
impact assessment also considered the impact of the lower spending
limits. At the last general election, the largest 10% of third parties

proposes. That demonstrates that the current spending limit is so high

Anne McGuire</B> (Stirling) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for the
opportunity to raise my concerns about the application of the landfill
tax across the UK to cases in which, due to time elapsed and the lack
of any responsible polluter, the burden of liability for contaminated
land remediation costs, plus landfill tax and value added tax, falls on
the occupier of that land. The incidence of contaminated land across
the UK is apparently wide scale with limited public funds available to
assist businesses and residential occupiers who find themselves bearing
the considerable burden of such costs where they are at no fault in the
creation of the
contamination<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T19:29:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061001260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061001260">My
understanding is that the landfill tax was introduced in the 1996
Budget as one of a series of measures aimed at reducing waste placed in
landfill sites. Part of the aim of the tax—a laudable
aim—was to tackle polluters of land that required remediation to
make it safe, with a tax on top that could be used to penalise and
discourage polluters. For recent instances of such contamination it may
be, and often is, possible to identify and penalise the polluters, but
as many sites are a legacy from this country's industrial past, the
polluter has often disappeared into the mists of
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061001261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061001261">I
initiated this debate to raise the plight of 13 residents and their
families who are the unfortunate victims of the landfill tax
legislation. Blanefield is a village in the Stirling constituency to
the north-west of Glasgow. In the 19th century it was home to a large
calico printing works, which I understand at its peak may have employed
500 men, women and, given the historical time, children. With the
demise of the calico printing trade at the end of that century there
was overcapacity and factories like the Blanefield printworks closed
down. By 1910 the last of the buildings had been demolished and the
site lay dormant until the late 1950s, when a residential housing
development was built on
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061001262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061001262">Rolling
forward, in 2012 a random soil analysis was carried out by the local
authority and it found traces of lead and arsenic left as a legacy of
the printing process. Under the Environment Act 1990 there is a
responsibility on the local authority to ascertain whether land is
deemed “contaminated land”. The local authority in
Stirling believes, based on the scientific outcomes of its
investigation of the ground and the risk assessment, that there is
evidence that the land is in such a condition that it presents a
“significant possibility of…harm” to human
health.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061001263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061001263">In
this case we are talking about a printworks demolished more than 100
years ago, and unfortunately, as you can imagine, Madam Deputy Speaker,
the council has been unable to identify any party who “caused or
knowingly permitted” the presence of the substances in question,
because the owners of the printing works went out of business over a
century ago and there is no indication of a successor company. Also,
the council has no evidence that any of the developers who built the
current dwelling houses on the site knew about the contamination. Part
IIA of the Act provides that in the absence of a causer or knowing

Library has clarified for me that although the 1990 Act regulates
contaminated land remediation, environmental issues, as the Minister

advised, though, that contaminated land soil was originally exempt from
the landfill tax. However, that exemption was phased out in 1998 due to
concerns that soil was not being cleaned, but simply landfilled. I
understand that until 2008 land remediation specialist companies did
not have to pay landfill tax when they disposed of contaminated soils.
But the Government argued that this exemption encouraged remediators to
take the easy “dig and dump” route, rather than follow a
more sustainable option, cleaning and reusing soil. They then announced
that they would end the exemption for the contaminated sites, although
the Government promised that any money they received would be
reinvested through an expansion of existing rebates for remediation.
These arrangements appear to apply only to companies and not to
individuals who find themselves liable to pay the landfill tax for
remediation of contaminated
soil.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061001267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061001267">Given
that the implementation of land remediation is now a devolved
issue—I am sure the Minister will expect me to recognise that,

funding to mitigate the remediation costs of individuals and residents

Scottish budgets. In 2008 the previous Scottish Executive set up a
contaminated land grant fund of £17 million available
to Scottish local authorities. The new Scottish Government did not
continue this fund but instead, under their single outcome agreements
with local authorities, included a sum to allow them to take
responsibility for funding in such situations. In the Blanefield case
Stirling council has made available a sum of £125,000 towards
the remedial works

currently on the Treasury Bench. I hope 
<?notus-xml column=954?>the Minister will agree that it could not have been the intention of

the right hon. Lady has explained, the liability for that remediation

is right that the polluter will be held liable to cover the cost of
remediation. However, as we have heard, in this instance the original
polluter—namely the Victorian printworks—is no longer in
existence. In the absence of the original polluter, the responsibility
for carrying out the remediation works, under the Environmental

is worth making it clear that in about 90% of cases involving
contaminated land, the land will be remediated when the site is
redeveloped for future use, as stipulated under planning policy. In
most instances, the liability will fall on a company or business, which
will be better placed to cover the costs of remediation. In the small
percentage of remaining cases, however, the costs of remediating the
land will fall on

course, in most circumstances the value of the land will
rise once it has been decontaminated. In this respect, the logic of the
law is to ensure that the landowner, who will be set to gain from the
increase in the value of the land, should also be the person liable for
the costs of the clean-up. Unfortunately, in the instance under

the right hon. Lady will be aware, the landfill tax aims to
reduce the environmental damage caused by sending waste to landfill. In
increasing the cost of landfill, the tax also aims to encourage more
sustainable waste technologies, such as recycling. At a national level
the tax has been successful in achieving those goals. Waste material is
increasingly being diverted away from landfill towards reuse or
recycling. The tax has also been successful in ensuring that the
environmental damage associated with the disposal of such waste is

the right hon. Lady acknowledges, the tax is designed to ensure that
the polluter pays, and she is right to point out that in this
particular instance the original polluter will not be paying. I am
sympathetic to the argument. However, it will not be possible for the
contaminated waste in this instance to be exempt from landfill tax, as
the right hon. Lady proposes. It may be useful, in explaining why such

the current system, the tax liability falls on the landfill operator,
not the person delivering the waste. Those landfill operators must
check the content of the waste to determine what rate of tax to apply.
There is, however, no requirement on the site operator to satisfy
themselves as to the origin of the waste or the type of business, local
authority or private individual that has delivered it to them.
Therefore, introducing an exemption, as requested, would require a
fundamental change to the structure of the tax. It would also place an
excessive future burden on all landfill operators, who would be forced
to check and verify the origin of each item of waste that had been sent
for disposal at their
site.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091061001289" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/debtext/130910-0004.htm#13091061001289">It
is also worth remembering that a change such as that suggested by the

amendments to primary 
<?notus-xml column=957?>legislation. That would mean, first, that it could not be made with the
haste required for the right hon. Lady’s constituents to
benefit; and secondly, that it could create a more complex law on
landfill. As hon. Members will unfortunately be only too well aware,
complexity in any tax can increase the opportunity for evasion. While
she has suggested changes to the current legislation, for wholly the
right reasons, certain unscrupulous individuals or businesses may well
seek to use such an exemption for wholly the wrong reasons to reduce
their own tax liabilities. So while I acknowledge and sympathise with
the real difficulties that these households, in particular, are facing,
it would be extremely difficult for the Government to alter national

serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr Howarth. I am grateful
to the two other hon. Members who have joined me for this important
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:30:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000008">I
want to say first what the debate is not. This is not a debate that is
led by prudish intolerance in relation to sexual entertainment. I have
never been to a lap-dancing club, and my view is that real men do not
buy women for entertainment, but, as a Liberal, I accept that if adults
want to make such choices, that is up to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:30:47"></hs_TimeCode>. The debate
is about ensuring consistency in the application of the regulation of
sexual entertainment on our high streets. It is about ensuring that
performers in and patrons of sexual entertainment
venues—lap-dancing clubs—are properly protected and that
local communities are involved in the decision-making process about
where and when such venues should
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:31:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000009">The
fundamental issue is simple. If a permanent lap-dancing club opens
under the licensing regime adopted by the previous Government in the
Licensing Act 2003 and the Policing and Crime Act 2009, the community
is involved in making the decision and there would be significant
safeguards in place for those who work in and visit the establishments.
The 2009 Act, however, provides a specific exemption, stating that
premises providing sexual entertainment on an infrequent
basis—on no more than 11 occasions in a 12-month
period—do not require a licence and, therefore, do not need to
offer the same level of safeguards to performers and
patrons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:31:55"></hs_TimeCode>. In
Newquay, the exemption has led to lap-dancing nights being offered on
that so-called occasional basis in direct competition to a licensed
venue, but without any of the obligations that the licensed venue needs
to
meet<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000010">For
many years, I have had the pleasure of working closely with the people
and businesses of Newquay to secure a future for the town that is
sustainable and successful and to tackle some of the excesses of the
night-time economy, which over recent years have blighted the town. To
be clear, Newquay is a fantastic town. It sits within a stunning
natural environment and has, over the decades, welcomed millions of
visitors to enjoy its natural beauty and the entertainment that it has
to offer. The town has been through many transformations, from a
traditional fishing port and centre for the export of china clay, to
being the surfing capital of Britain and a terrific, family-friendly
visitor destination. Each time Newquay has reinvented itself, it has
breathed new life into the streets and delivered new opportunities for
the people who live, work and visit
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000011">Tourism
is now one of the town’s primary industries and attracts a wide
variety of visitors. The trade brings in much needed revenue for
businesses in the town, which include hotels, bars, pubs, clubs,
restaurants, surf 
<?notus-xml column=214?>hire shops, bakeries, designer-clothing outlets and the usual range of
excursion and entertainment providers to be found in seaside resorts
such as Newquay. Collectively, those businesses employ huge numbers of
local people and provide year-round income. Over the past decade or so,
however, the town has seen a rise in the number of sexual entertainment
venues—or, in the jargon, SEVs— and at one point,
Newquay, with a resident population of a little more than 20,000, had
five lap-dancing licences in
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:34:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
proliferation of lap-dancing venues within the town centre has been a
major concern of local people for a number of years. Clearly, the
venues were there to cater for the fivefold increase in population that
occurs during the summer months. They have, however, attracted
significant antisocial behaviour, as well as more serious crime and
disorder.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000012">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:34:23"></hs_TimeCode>
previous Government’s 2009 Policing and Crime Act helped to put
the community back in control. The town council, Cornwall council, the
Devon and Cornwall police, the fire brigade, determined local residents
and I have worked effectively together to use the powers under that Act
to reduce the number of venues to only one licensed SEV, and to ensure
that performers in and patrons of such venues are protected. That has
made a huge difference to the atmosphere in the town centre. Five years
ago, many people told me that they felt scared to go into the town
centre in the evening; families rightly complained about the ubiquity
of sexualised images in the main street and on the roads leading to the
town’s beaches. Working together, we representatives of the
community have been able to address such concerns with great
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000013">Lap-dancing
clubs are regulated by the local authority—in my case, Cornwall
council—and they are subject to stringent requirements that
protect patrons and performers, while allowing residents and community
representatives a voice in the location of the venues. Cornwall council
has adopted powers under the Local Government (Miscellaneous
Provisions) Act 1982, as amended by the 2009 Act, in order to regulate
sex shops, sex cinemas and sexual entertainment venues. The amended
legislation delivers more power to local residents, giving them a much
greater say in where SEV licences can be issued. It allows the local
community to object to great effect when an application is made, based
on whether the location is appropriate. The 2009 Act, however, also
allows premises to hold the exact type of sexual entertainment that
normally requires an SEV licence without a licence and without
safeguards, if it is held less frequently than once a month. My
understanding is that the exemption was designed to allow for one-off
entertainment events, such as the attendance of a strippergram at a
birthday party. Such provision was made with the best intentions, but
there is a real risk that it is too broad and open to
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000014">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:37:11"></hs_TimeCode>
example concerns a site within Newquay, for which the owner had applied
for a licence to become a permanent lap-dancing venue. During the
application process, a considerable number of objections from local
residents and businesses were received, and Cornwall council refused
the licence. The venue in question, however, has now begun to operate
sexual entertainment events under the exemption in the Act. This
involves not the occasional strippergram but the operation of a full
SEV during a whole 24-hour window once a month, with full nudity and
none of the protections and safeguards that 
<?notus-xml column=215?>performers and patrons should rightly be able to
expect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>. It
cannot be right that, when a venue has been refused a lap-dancing
licence by the local authority, following objections from local people
and businesses, it can then flout the will of the community and its
representatives and go ahead in offering sexual entertainment without
any of the protections
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000015">We
are debating the matter today because it raises serious questions about
how fair the exemption is for those businesses that comply with the
full licensing requirements for SEVs. Such venues comply with a large
number of conditions that regulate their business, which I will come to
shortly, but the cost is substantial—not only the cost of
complying with the regulations imposed by the licensing authority, but
the cost of the application itself. What must an SEV licence holder
think when a nearby property, which has failed in getting a licence,
still proceeds to stage sexual entertainment in direct competition and
without the relevant safeguards that the licence holder must
fund?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000016">The
business environment in Newquay, as in many of our towns and cities, is
a competitive one, with significant numbers chasing a limited market,
so, logically, were an SEV to be surrounded by a number of highly
competitive premises that have one owner, it might well be challenged
by more than one of those infrequent, occasional events each month. In
such a case, those who have sought to comply with the law would see
little point in going through the licensing regime, and perhaps switch
to less regular and unregulated sexual entertainment
events<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:39:23"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
wish to be alarmist, but it is not unreasonable to suggest that a town
such as Newquay, which saw a surge in lap-dancing venues, but tackled
the issue head-on and imposed significant restrictions, could again see
a large rise in unregulated sexual entertainment events, all happening
in spite of the wishes of the community, Parliament or the local
council. That is
wrong.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000017">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson) knows that the
regulations covering SEVs are not light touch. They rightly impose
stringent conditions for the protection of all those involved in sexual
entertainment. Those conditions are stringent because there is so much
at risk in sexual entertainment. It is of great concern to me that
expansion of unregulated sexual entertainment could put vulnerable
people at risk. SEV licences ensure that the impact on the surrounding
area is limited.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091030000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000018">Some people
will always object to SEV licences being issued, regardless of where
they are and what measures are put in place to protect the surrounding
community, but the licensing regime introduced by the previous
Government allows local authorities to introduce significant
protection, and the use of occasional or infrequent exemptions within
the 2009 Act undermine the previous Government’s intention. I
hope that my hon. Friend the Minister will confirm the present
Government’s intention to ensure that venues are properly
regulated and managed, and that performers and patrons are properly
protected. For example, an SEV licence will explicitly prohibit the
soliciting of custom in the street and the general locality including,
in Newquay’s case, the whole town. That anti-touting rule
ensures that SEVs can operate within communities with minimal impact on
other businesses, passing trade and house prices.</hs_Para>

particularly important in places such as Newquay that have strived in
recent years to become more family-friendly resorts. Local businesses
and residents have worked successfully and hard on that. My hon. Friend
will be aware of initiatives such as Newquay Safe, which has brought
together all stakeholders in the town to tackle anti-social behaviour
and to reduce the cost of policing Newquay at the same time as reducing
the amount of crime that is reported and recorded there. We have had
significant
success.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000020">SEV
licences require the interior of lap-dancing venues to be hidden from
the street so that sexual entertainment events inside can be seen only
by patrons and not by passers-by. If that requirement was not in place
in places such as Newquay, the entertainment could be seen by anyone,
from children on the way to the beach to pensioners on their way to
local tea rooms. SEV licences place restrictions on advertising, and it
is easy to understand why the regular holding of sexual entertainment
events in unlicensed premises within the exemption might lead to images
or advertisements that could damage an area’s reputation and put
sexualised images in front of part of the population that simply does
not want to see them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091030000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000021">Perhaps the
most important provision in SEV licences is safeguards for the welfare
of performers and patrons, which are exactly what the exemption does
not provide. I think we all accept that lap dancing is an unusual and
intimate environment, and the availability of alcohol at venues means
that there is a significant danger that performers and patrons may find
themselves in difficult situations. SEV licences include incredibly
strict provisions to place the entertainer in the safest environment
possible in the circumstances. That is achieved predominantly through a
strict 3-foot rule that performers must remain at least 3 feet from
patrons. That is an essential protection that reduces the risk of
harassment or abuse of sexual entertainers and reduces the risk for
patrons. Should even limited contact be allowed or suggested, the
patron is at risk of allegations of a criminal act. With patrons and
performers prohibited from touching each other by maintaining the
3-foot rule, there is a clear dividing line that affords safeguards to
both
parties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000022">All
aspects of sexual entertainment must take place in open, supervised
areas or in private in the presence of designated staff and under the
umbrella of closed circuit television. SEV licences also require all
restrictions to be enforced by designated supervisors or floor-walkers
who must be fully trained and in such number to guarantee the safety of
those inside the venue. If we are to have lap dancing in our towns and
cities, the safeguards are vital to ensure that the experience is
entertainment, not
exploitation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000023">Venues

concerns from the local police sit alongside the real concerns from
town councillors and Cornwall councillors who have worked to ensure
that if we have the industry in our towns and cities, it must be as
safe and as properly managed as we can achieve. Sadly, it is
conceivable that a sexual entertainer working in an unfamiliar venue
that does not afford its patrons and performers the protection of
having gone through the licensed SEV process could be subject to a
serious sexual assault, and possibly even worse. We should not allow
legislation that is easy to change to put any individual in
harm’s way in that
respect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000026">What
can be done? My hon. Friend the Minister will be pleased to hear that
much can be done. The exemption was made in good faith so its removal
may seem to be excessive. However, it is entirely conceivable that
occasional sexual entertainment events could simply be subject to the
same stringent requirements of the sexual entertainment licence
process. That would require minimal legislative effort because the
existing law allows the relevant national authority to order, amend or
repeal the exemption clause without new primary legislation. That is a
key point. The Government could deliver that with minimal effort. My
hon. Friend need not remove the infrequency clause altogether. He could
simply ensure that when it is used it meets the standards of the
nearest SEV licence that has been issued by the relevant local
authority.</hs_Para>

alternative that Cornwall council’s licensing department has
suggested is to look at a mechanism similar to temporary event notices
that are in existence under the Licensing Act 2003. That would give the
local authority and the police an opportunity to consider and to object
when applications were made for venues for one-off or infrequent sexual
entertainment. Such a regime could also require premises to meet
certain criteria providing adequate protection for performers and
patrons. Those who wanted to stage sexual entertainment at occasional
venues would have to meet the requirements placed on more permanent
venues, ensuring safeguards against sexual assault or false allegations
being made. Crucially in that scenario, local authorities could comment
on and even refuse an application if they thought it appropriate to do
so, or to add further restrictions. That could restore the vital input
of local residents when deciding when, where and in what way such
events take place in their
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000028">The
problem is not just in Newquay. In major cities throughout the country
the sexual entertainment industry is exploiting this loophole in the
legislation and is moving underground. We want to avoid that at all
costs. The Government have the opportunity to act early. The Minister
could make a significant difference, and the problem could be sorted
out long before whole towns are teeming with competing, unlicensed
sexual events, before the views of whole communities on whether, where
and how such establishments exist are sidelined, and before anyone is
put in harm’s way. My request to my hon. Friend is that he
undertakes to look at the matter urgently. A small step from the
Government could make a significant

to serve under your chairmanship this morning, Mr Howarth. I
congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:49:54"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert) on securing 
<?notus-xml column=218?>this debate and on setting out so clearly the current provisions and the
particular problems with them that he has found in his constituency.
Like him, I have never visited the establishments we are discussing; it
will be interesting to hear whether the Minister has.</hs_Para>

clubs are a relatively new phenomenon in the UK, with the first clubs
opening in about 1995. It has taken quite some time to refine the
regime for controlling their operation. As we have heard in
today’s debate, various licensing regimes have not been able to
stop the proliferation of lap-dancing clubs, which is now a genuine
concern for members of the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:49:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

think we are all agreed that we do not want to ban such establishments,
it is quite right that the licensing regime recognises their special
nature and the problems that they cause to local communities. It is
perfectly understandable that people have concerns about the opening of
such establishments in their local areas.</hs_Para>

establishments are a part of the sex industry, and there are a number
of valid reasons why people object to their existence. We have heard
today about some of the problems in Newquay. I think all hon. Members
would agree that it is vital for communities to have their say if and
when applications are made for such clubs to
open.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000033">When
such clubs first appeared in the UK in about 1995, there was no
specialist licensing regime. The opening of sex shops and sex cinemas
required specialist licences from the council, which had a range of
powers to limit the availability of such establishments. There was also
a specialist category of licence for sex encounter establishments, but
that legislation applied only to London at the time. In all cases,
while councils were responsible for specialist sex licences,
magistrates retained powers over alcohol
licensing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000034">That
dual licensing approach was ended, as we have heard, by the Licensing
Act 2003, which aimed to bring all licences for premises selling
alcohol under one regulatory framework, under the direction of the
local authority and guided by the four principles of licensing. They
are the prevention of crime and disorder; public safety; the prevention
of public nuisance; and the protection of children from harm.</hs_Para>

intentions behind the 2003 Act were good, its application caused
problems. There seemed to be widespread confusion as to whether a
premises needed to declare adult entertainment as an integral aspect of
the application and whether a council could take a position on the
opening of such venues in its licensing statement. Several communities
found that they could not prevent such premises from opening, and the
application of the four basic licensing criteria seemed to vary
extensively in relation to the opening of such
establishments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000036">At
this point I would particularly like to pay tribute to the work of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:53:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods) and of the
campaign group Object. They did fantastic work to raise awareness of
the operation of the 2003 Act regarding lap-dancing clubs and suggested
a way to control such venues.</hs_Para>

government, Labour listened to those concerns. We realised that the
2003 Act had given rise to unforeseen consequences, and we therefore
changed the law. Changes to the control of lap-dancing clubs were
introduced under the Policing and Crime Act 2009 by the then-Home
Secretary Jacqui Smith, and we now have the present regime.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=219?><hs_Para UID="13091030000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000038">Under the
powers contained in the 2009 Act, councils could decide to designate
strip clubs, lap-dancing clubs and other similar establishments as
sexual entertainment venues. Those in turn were controlled under the
Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, in a way similar
to that suggested by my hon. Friend the Member for City of Durham
and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:54:31"></hs_TimeCode> supported by
groups such as Object.</hs_Para>

new powers are adoptive, meaning that councils may adopt them if they
choose to do so. If they choose not to, lap-dancing clubs will continue
to be licensed by the 2003 Act. It would be helpful if the Minister
could set out how many councils have adopted the new approach. It would
be interesting to know, given that the legislation was framed to give
councils an option of taking that route, whether the vast majority have
chosen to do so.</hs_Para>

use their discretion and adopt the new powers, both the council and
local residents will have a much greater say over the operation of
lap-dancing clubs. It will mean that the operation of such clubs will
have to be reviewed annually; allow local people to object to the
opening of a club if it is deemed inappropriate for the character of an
area; and, even without objections, allow a local authority to reject
an application on the basis that it is inappropriate given the nature
of an area. The powers also allow a local authority to set a limit on
the number of lap-dancing clubs in an area; limit the opening of such
clubs to specific areas; and impose a wider set of operating conditions
than can be imposed under the 2003 Act.</hs_Para>

said, it is down to councils to decide whether they want to use those
powers. I am pleased to see that a number of Labour councils have been
at the forefront of using the powers to ensure that local residents get
a say in controlling such nightclubs. In particular, I commend
Swansea’s Labour-controlled council, which has conducted an
extensive consultation and decided that the maximum number of
lap-dancing clubs in its city should be zero, reflecting the wishes of
residents. It was interesting to hear about the situation in Newquay,
with the five lap-dancing clubs before the change in legislation
reduced to one using those
provisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000042">On
the issue of infrequency and the loophole in the legislation, the hon.
Member for St Austell and Newquay has set out clearly what that means
on the ground to local communities. He is not alone in raising those
concerns about the exemption. I would like to pay tribute to the
Fawcett Society in particular, which has been highlighting that issue
over a few months.</hs_Para>

appreciate hon. Members’ concerns about such venues. Not only is
it a concern that such venues can operate outside the normal licensing
regime that other establishments have to comply with, and circumvent
the controls that councils would place on their operation if they were
subject to a licence, but it is understandable that people will have
concerns about having lap dancing going on in, say, their local pub.
The fact that such premises could be normal pubs for most of the time
only makes it even more inappropriate that they are able to host such
entertainment once a
month.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000044">Labour
thinks that the issue needs to be reviewed and would be happy to work
with the Government on that.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T09:58:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for St Austell and Newquay has 
<?notus-xml column=220?>suggested some positive ways of addressing the problem. I would be
grateful if the Minister could tell us whether local authorities are
monitoring and keeping a record of the use of the exemption. Do the

forward to what the Minister says about the matter. I know that the
Government are keen to reduce regulation and do not want to see
bureaucracy placed in the way of businesses; I have heard the Minister
talk at length about that. However, in the present case, is he
satisfied that there is sufficient regulation? I know that in recent
legislation, the Government have reduced the bureaucracy relating to
obtaining temporary event licences. Would he like to pursue that route,
as suggested by

Minister, who is responsible for all licensing policy, will recall that
one of the central commitments of the alcohol strategy was to rebalance
the licensing regime in favour of local communities. It seems that the
flouting of provisions related to the licensing of lap-dancing clubs
needs to be addressed by tilting the balance back to the local
community. Indeed, not only was that general claim about giving the
community more power contained in the alcohol strategy, but it was
followed up by the launch of a consultation that was supposedly
intended

course, that was before Lynton Crosby seemed to get involved in the
whole alcohol debate, so I have a feeling that we might not be hearing
much more about the alcohol strategy that the Government are to pursue,
but I would be grateful if the Minister could say something about
whether he is still committed to the aims that were set out just a few

changes that the Government have made seem to fly in the face of the
commitment to give more power back to local communities. I want to
raise with the Minister the announcement from the Department for
Communities and Local Government, which seems to involve local
communities losing their right to object  to a change of use
under planning law and potentially making the opportunity more
available to businesses to set up lap-dancing clubs. As I understand
it, they could turn a restaurant into a lap-dancing club without having
to go through the normal planning applications. Would the Minister like
to comment on whether that is really allowing communities to have their

Friend the Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn), for their work in
relation to the “Save our High Streets” campaign, which
has been so effective at highlighting the dangers of some of the
Government changes, which could make the opening of lap-dancing clubs
more likely. Labour is very serious about looking hard at what happened
with the Licensing Act 2003 and the changes that were made more
recently, and about ensuring that the law actually does what local
communities want it to do. As I said, I am very willing to look, with
the Minister, at ways in which we could work on a cross-party basis to
ensure that that

I deal with one other issue? I am referring to the women who work in
lap-dancing clubs. Some women choose to become erotic
dancers—they make that choice 
<?notus-xml column=221?>themselves—but, like in the rest of the sex industry, there are
many people working in this part of it whose choice is not so free. We
know that the sex industry is responsible for a great deal of human
trafficking and modern-day slavery. The Government have spent a lot of
time over the summer talking about the proposed Bill to deal with
modern slavery. Any progress in that area would of course be welcomed
by hon. Members on both sides of the House, but as always the detail is
rather sketchy, particularly about the support for victims. Perhaps the
Minister can use this opportunity today to explain how that Bill would
fit with the licensing regime, what interface there would be with
regard to licensed premises that are found to have women working in
them who have not made that choice about entering employment in the sex
industry, and how that would fit with any provisions in the modern
slavery

others on behalf of the residents of that town. It was extremely

subject that we are considering today is very specific, tightly drawn
and important, particularly in areas that attract large numbers of
visitors. My hon. Friend made the interesting point that the population
of Newquay increases, he estimates, from 20,000 to about 100,000 over
the summer. Other places in the country, particularly seaside towns,
also experience that surge in visitors, which puts particular pressure
on local services, and the demands of those visitors, in terms of the
entertainment that they are interested in, can change the nature and
character of a town during the peak visitor period compared with other
times of the year. That has been a point of particular interest for my
hon. Friend and, as I have said, he represents the interests of the

aware—indeed, he has spoken about this—of the legal
framework for the licensing of such venues, which was most recently

Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982. The 2009 Act
inserted into the 1982 Act a new category of sex establishment called a
“sexual entertainment 
<?notus-xml column=222?>venue”, which brought the licensing of lap-dancing and
pole-dancing clubs and other similar venues under the regime set out in
the 1982 Act. A “sexual entertainment venue” is defined
as premises at which relevant entertainment is provided, or permitted

2009 Act set out the fact that decisions on licensing applications are
best made at local level. We have touched on that during this debate,
and I must say to the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana
Johnson), who speaks for the official Opposition, that it is our
intention to try to empower local communities. I think that it is a
difficult for her to criticise the Government for being insufficiently
vigilant when it comes to empowering local communities when, at the
same time, she constantly criticises us for not taking a more active
role in imposing the will of central Government on those local
communities and local
councils.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000059">Obviously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T10:09:37"></hs_TimeCode>,
if we give local councils room for manoeuvre, some flexibility, and the
discretion to make judgments about what is in the interests of the area
that they serve, they may come to different conclusions. That is the
essence of local democracy. If they were all obliged by central
Government to do exactly the same, there would be no point in having
local elections or local consultation, because there would be one
single blueprint imposed by central Government. That is a reasonable
political philosophy. People on the left tend to be in favour of
standardisation and centralisation, but if someone is liberally
inclined, as I am and I believe the Government are, they tend to take
the view that people should be given greater discretion over how they
live their life and that individuals and individual communities should
enjoy a degree of autonomy to make decisions in their own interest. It
is not the intention of central Government to steamroller every local
council or to say that in every circumstance we know best. We want
elected local councillors to make decisions that they think serve their

been done or not done by each local authority. The decision is for
local authorities to make, which brings us back to the point that I
made a moment ago: even if I had a list, the Government do not presume
to tell local authorities what approach they should take as long as
they act within the confines of the law, as drafted and enacted under
the previous Government, who took the view that it was right to give
local authorities some discretion. One could say that that was rather
uncharacteristic, because the previous Government, particularly the
previous Prime Minister, tended to manage things tightly from the
centre. That is the position however, and this Government are inclined
to take the view that local councils should make judgments that they
believe to be wise on behalf of the local community. One council may
take one approach and another council the opposite approach, but that
does not mean that one is right and one is wrong; they might both be
right, because the demands of the two different communities may be
different.</hs_Para>

not impose unnecessarily onerous burdens on business in a way that
makes it less likely that they will create new prosperity and new jobs
in their communities. I am pleased that under this Government well over
1 million new private-sector jobs have been created and the economy is
beginning to turn a corner, despite the predictions of the official
Opposition that at this stage we would have strongly rising
unemployment and a flatlining economy. The official Opposition never

type would last for more than 24 hours, but perhaps that shows a lack
of imagination on my part, because that stipulation is in the

reason for the narrowly drawn exemptions is because the Government
recognise the virtue in flexibility—interestingly, when the
legislation was drafted the previous Government recognised
this—as we want businesses and local communities to have
discretion and room for manoeuvre. Whenever legislation of this type is
drawn up, one-off occasions that may not have been envisaged by the
House come to light, and it can be frustrating not to have flexibility
built into the system for such circumstances. Exemptions were included
because it was recognised that not all premises that provide
“relevant entertainment” should be classed as sexual
entertainment venues. It was argued during the passage of the 2009 Act
that premises such as a pub hosting a one-off birthday party at which a
strippergram has been booked, for example, should not require
regulation in the same manner as lap-dancing clubs that offer
entertainment every night, or even every week or month. Most people
would recognise that
distinction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000072">Premises<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T10:19:41"></hs_TimeCode>
that hold infrequent events continue to be regulated under the
Licensing Act 2003. Hosting regular sexual entertainment without the
relevant licence would represent a significant breach of licensing
conditions, so there is a licensing framework, but it is not as
prescriptive as that in the 2009 Act. The previous Government and this
Government view that as the right balance to strike. However, we now
get to the nub of the point made by my hon. Friend in his speech and in
his intervention, which is whether it is possible for ingenious bar
owners to use the exemptions in a way that gives 
<?notus-xml column=225?>them more scope to provide regular entertainment of  a sexual
nature than was envisaged by Ministers and Parliament when the
legislation was introduced in
2009.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000073">My
hon. Friend said that an individual could own four or five venues in
one town and put on sexual entertainment evening every Saturday night
through the summer season—May to September—at one of the
venues, advertising it in the others. The individual could do that
within the flexibility afforded to him or her by the 2009 Act, and
could make a virtue to holiday makers of the entertainment being
offered at the end of their week-long holiday, even promoting it as
part of a series of activities across the four or five bars. If other
people in the town who were running sexual entertainment evenings or
events had straightforwardly registered and complied with the Act but
did not seek to operate within the flexibility afforded, competition
could be created between them and those complying with the Act but
using the exemptions in a way that was not envisaged by Ministers and
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000074">Perhaps
such individuals’ behaviour is not as assiduous and deliberate
as I have described, but it goes beyond the spirit of the exemptions.
It happens in Newquay and, I suspect, in other parts of the country
where large numbers of people go on holiday, particularly young
visitors, including groups of young males—or in some cases
perhaps not so young. In those places a judgment is made about the
market for such
entertainment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000075">I
am happy to extend to my hon. Friend the offer of a meeting with
officials and, subject to his discussion with them, perhaps a meeting
with me as well, not to consider, for the reasons I and others have
given, how to scrap the exemption, because we see virtue in
flexibility—and there would be a risk of unintended consequences
if we removed it altogether—but to discuss whether the
flexibility is subject to abuse and there is scope to make changes so
that it is exercised in line with the spirit of what Parliament
intended when the legislation was enacted in 2009. I want to sound a

residents in Newquay, and no doubt in other parts of the country. We

am not saying that anyone is abusing it by breaking the law—but
if they do so they should face the consequences—but that they

is an important debate, because whenever the broader public debate
turns to the somewhat thorny subject of pension provision, a contrast
inevitably tends to be drawn between those who enjoy generous public
sector retirement packages and those who rely on rather more meagre
contributions to a private sector pension. The former group is always
accused of being insulated from the real world, its members living in a
gold-plated retirement heaven for which the taxpayer foots the bill. Or
so at least the characterisation goes, because most public sector funds
are unfunded and are therefore paid out of general taxation, which is
not the case for local government

England and Wales, there are some 89 different local government pension
funds that invest an overall sum in excess of £150 billion.
Technically, those funds are backed by local government, but unlike the
unfunded public sector schemes, the running of proper funds better
recognises the costs of pension obligations and brings to bear a
greater degree of financial discipline. The Government, however, think
that the current scheme, with its myriad funds collectively paying out
some £350 million in fees annually, is inefficient.
They also believe that investment performance could be improved and
that a higher level of accountability to local taxpayers should be
introduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:01:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000084">I
understand that the Government’s preferred alternative is
pooling, with independent funds fully merged to produce cost
efficiencies and to open the possibility of investment in bulky,
illiquid assets outside the scope  of smaller funds. That
alternative is not without risks and problems. Well funded schemes
might, in effect, be bailing out less well funded schemes. With new
bodies appointed to manage pooled funds, there would likely
be less accountability and employer-employee representation. It is also
a somewhat flawed assumption that larger investment funds will
necessarily deliver better investment returns at a lower cost. Of
course, there is a broad risk to all of us that politicians of whatever
political colour might be tempted to use the large investment funds to
pay for economically unsound infrastructure projects. Local council tax
payers will end up footing the bill if we get that

something needs to be done is not disputed. In running their own funds,
local authorities are exposed to pressures to which other public sector
employers are not subject. Rarely have public sector schemes been fully
funded, which has not been problematic historically because, of course,
benefits are paid out over many years. Furthermore, until the financial
crisis hit in 2008, strong economic growth, positive investment returns
and a rapidly growing public sector work force ensured a net positive
cash flow into the local government pension scheme, which mitigated any
risk of a benefit shortfall.</hs_Para>

outlook, however, has been deteriorating. In 2010 the average funding
level for local authority schemes was about 80%, but many analysts
expect that to fall to 
<?notus-xml column=228?>about 75% when the 2013 valuation is released, with the growth in cash
deficits being of particular
significance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:03:48"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is concern that that could prove to be something of a long-term
trend. Indeed, a 2012 report by the Office for Budget Responsibility
estimated that by 2017 the public sector work force would have shrunk
by some 710,000. Of course, a reduction in that number means fewer
active scheme members. Also, many of those who are paying in are
supplementing constrained household budgets by reducing their monthly
pension contributions. Increased life expectancy also proves an
additional pressure, as does the current investment climate and the
impact of the financial crisis. Indeed, in the five-year period to the
end of 2012, the local government pension scheme underperformed against
the long-term return target assumed on its assets by an average of some
2.8<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:04:38"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000087">No
one disputes that there are big challenges for those managing the local
government pension scheme, and it is right that the Government are
proactively considering ways to address those challenges. There is,
however, growing concern among local authorities that we are rushing
headlong at the wrong alternative, which risks unintended consequences.
The Minister has in the past made clear his preference for a pooled
scheme that would reduce management fees and result in greater
collective investment power for councils, but there are considerable
legal, compliance and investment issues that must be addressed when
funds are consolidated. Governance can differ and the quality of
portfolios obviously varies. Scheme maturity, cash-flow
characteristics, investment strategies and deficit positions can all
differ considerably. Addressing those issues will inevitably impose
further costs, some of which will be borne by local council tax

local authority that has acted prudently by paying regularly into its
pension fund and keeping salaries under control, for example, would
likely be asked to contribute more to a pooled fund in order to plug a
hole caused by a less prudent authority. A rise in council tax for that
responsible authority would inevitably be required, with its residents
effectively bailing out councils with historically poorer performing
funds, which, at the very least, is democratically dubious. With
£1 in every £5 of council tax currently being spent on
employer contributions to the LGPS according to figures recently
released by the TaxPayers Alliance, the implications for increased
liability are
clear.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000089">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:06:28"></hs_TimeCode>
is also dangerous to assume that very large, pooled funds are
necessarily better performing than smaller funds. In investment there
are potential diseconomies, as well as economies, of scale. Monopoly
providers, more concentrated risk and a lack of diversity may all end
up being a significant drag on investment returns. Active managers
understand that good investment opportunities are finite, and they will
close strategies to new investors if additional inflows risk
compromising returns for existing investors. Indeed, many of the
best-performing LGPS funds in the long term have actually been the
smallest. One such example, which is obviously close to my heart, is
the City of London corporation’s investment returns. One might
argue that the corporation has expertise close to hand, but none the
less, the returns are significantly higher than the average of larger
funds over the past three and five years. It is likely that the lower
costs that could be gained from pooling are only a fraction of those

address a specific London issue of which the Minister will be aware.
The London Pensions Fund Authority, currently under the chairmanship of
a former private equity specialist, Mr Edmund Truell, has been leading
the charge in favour of consolidation and making known its interest in
managing the pooled funds of the capital’s 32 local authorities
and the City. I believe that bid is backed by the Mayor of
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:07:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Minister will be aware that the bid has become a source of considerable
concern among London councils, many of which believe that, if there is
to be any merger of funds, it must be conducted by an organisation that
better understands the LGPS and its sensitivities. Concerned
authorities contend that the performance of the LPFA has been quite
poor, and many feel that the LPFA simply has insufficient oversight,
governance and representation. In that regard there is already a high
level of accountability within the current system. Each administering
authority is required to prepare a separate set of audited accounts
that are fully accessible to local
taxpayers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:08:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I
wish to put those anxieties on the record, but they are not my primary

authority pension holders and local taxpayers alike should be worried
about the broader risk of any merged fund being subject to political
interference. It might sound superficially attractive for
London’s local politicians and Mayor to have access to a new
pool of capital, which could support housing and other infrastructure
projects across the city, but by the same token, how do we prevent that
resource from possibly being subject to undue, partisan political
influence? Much has been made of the Government’s desire to
promote important infrastructure projects as a means of boosting
growth, and I support that goal, but when such projects have stalled
the finger has often been pointed at the lack of available private
finance initiative funding or at the absence of investor appetite.
However, investors tell me that, typically, the problem is not a dearth
of available funds. There is, in fact, an enormous desire among large
private sector investors to locate British projects in which to invest.
The problem, as they see it, is the lack of sensible investment
opportunities out there.</hs_Para>

High Speed 2 railway project springs to mind. Perhaps the Government
are not cowed by the prospect of an unashamedly Tory Mayor digging into
the public pension pot, but what if the incumbent Mayor looked and
sounded a little more like Mr Ken Livingstone, the erstwhile Mayor? I
am not suggesting that local government pension funds should not invest
in public projects, but there is a significant risk that fund

good news is that pooling is not the only way of making the

When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T11:12:05"></hs_TimeCode> the team

combined amount of the three funds—about £2.3 billion of

merging, potentially poorer returns and considerable conflicts of

the Member for Cities of London and Westminster (Mark Field) for
raising the important matter of the effectiveness and efficiency of the
local government pension scheme. It is a hugely important issue for
local government, as well as for taxpayers and beneficiaries of the
scheme, and it is good to give it an airing. It often does not get the
coverage it probably should, and I am disappointed Opposition Members
are not here to discuss
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000100">My
hon. Friend said the funded nature of the scheme ensures better
financial discipline and recognition of the cost of pension
obligations, and I thoroughly agree. Since taking responsibility for
the scheme, I have been hugely impressed by the performance of many of
the  89 individual pension fund authorities in England and
Wales. I have been particularly impressed with the work some of them
have been doing since we started this more public debate on working
together. As my hon. Friend outlined, Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire,
authorities in London and others are looking at what they can
achieve.</hs_Para>

I meet the schemes’ representatives, and when I speak at
conferences, it seems that all the schemes share the view that we need
to look at whether 89 is the right number or whether it should be
lower. Equally, however, every one of them is clear that, even if the
number is reduced, they should be one of those that remains, because
they all claim to be the best fund in the land when I speak to them. I
understand and appreciate that passion, but I have also seen enough
data and evidence to be equally concerned by the mixed performance
across the board, with inconsistency in investment performance and
variation of fund management costs across the 89 funds.</hs_Para>

is not to say that the scheme as a whole is inefficient in any way, but
I accept my hon. Friend’s point that there is room for
improvement. That is why, on 21 June, I made a call for evidence on the
scheme’s future structure. That call for evidence runs until the
end of September, so I am sure my hon. Friend will forgive me if I say
there is a limit to what I can say in response to his points. I
appreciate he is seeking a firm and unequivocal response from the
Government, and rightly so, but I am sure he recognises that it is
important for me and the Government to keep an open mind during the
call for evidence. It would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to
express any determined preference or to give an indication of the
Government’s position at this stage in the consultation process,
but I will respond to some of my hon. Friend’s more general
points and explain in more detail why I have made a call for evidence.
I hope that will go some way towards answering some of his
points.</hs_Para>

are asking the whole public sector to live within increasingly
difficult financial constraints, and local government, as Members know,
is no exception. Within the LGPS, between 1990 and 2012, the
contributions paid by scheme employers as a proportion of total scheme
income increased from 37% to 51%. The level of investment income going
towards that cost has remained steady at around £3 billion,
which means that, in percentage terms, it has actually decreased from
43% of total scheme income in 1999 to just 25% in 2012. It does not
take a degree in rocket science to realise that costs are escalating at
too fast a pace and that too much of that cost is falling to employers
and taxpayers. The LGPS currently costs taxpayers £6 billion a

contributions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091030000106" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091030000106"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>I
can also report that the reform package agreed by Government for the
LGPS will ensure that the cost of the new scheme to employers and
taxpayers, when it is introduced in April, will not exceed 13% of
pensionable pay. If, at future scheme valuations, that cap is exceeded,
steps will be taken to recoup the excess cost, back to the agreed 13%
cap.</hs_Para>

are, as has been noted, other costs associated with the scheme, which
must be subject to rigorous examination—in particular the cost
of scheme administration and fund management. For example, in the year
ending March 2012, those costs were £127 million and
£381 million respectively. I repeat my belief that there are
many excellent fund authorities, both small and large, delivering
first-class levels of service at a fair cost to the tax payer, but we
need to go further to ensure that every fund authority in England and
Wales performs at the same high level that we know is possible, with
none of the inconsistencies or variability that are so evident today.

taking that decision, I recognised that improving the efficiency and
effectiveness of the current arrangements through collaborative and
partnership working might result in a saving of some kind. Recent
evidence from funds that have already formed partnership agreements
suggests that that might be in the region of 10%, but it is open to
question whether that range of savings will be enough, given the tight
financial settlements that local authorities face in the time ahead.
That is why I am determined to explore new and fresh ways of working,

repeated in the call for evidence, I am not ruling anything in or out.
At the same conference, I made known my views on fund mergers. I made
it clear that I am not wedded to the existing number of
funds—89—in England and Wales, and that remains my view.
I have also said on a 
<?notus-xml column=233?>number of occasions that I would not shy away from reducing the number
of funds if that is what it takes to improve the efficiency and
cost-effectiveness of the scheme. There is one thing I would rule out:

hon. Friend went on to make the important point that, because of their
size, some fund authorities do not have the staffing structure or
resilience that some of their larger counterparts enjoy. Some fund
authorities are experiencing recruitment and retention problems at a
time when many long-standing and experienced staff have retired or are
close to retirement. I suggest that one way of resolving those concerns
would be to base the scheme around a smaller number of fund
authorities, which, in time, could develop as centres of excellence in
the way that my hon. Friend has outlined this morning. He gave examples

we can better assess the current position of the scheme and the 89
individual fund authorities that administer it and manage its

that we must understand the problem before attempting to resolve it. We

T. C. Davies</B> (Monmouth) (Con):</Member> Five years or so ago, with
apparently irrefutable evidence that the Earth’s temperatures
were rising out of control as a result of carbon dioxide emissions, the
then Government, with support from left and right, passed the Climate
Change Act 2008, which committed the Government to cutting emissions by
80% by 2050. In order to do that, the Act introduced a series of
measures, a raft of extra taxes and a whole bureaucracy, which have
made it ever more expensive for home owners and, just as importantly,
businesses, particularly large manufacturing industries, to buy gas and
electricity. That has had the perverse effect of making cheap forms of
energy, such as coal and gas, expensive and subsidising expensive forms
of energy, such as solar and wind, so that they can
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T14:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000006">The
2008 Act was based on the belief that reducing CO<Sub>2 </Sub>emissions
would reduce global temperatures, or at least stop the increase that
was apparently going on at the time. Britain’s carbon dioxide
emissions are actually tiny; they are about 1.6% of total world
CO<Sub>2 </Sub>emissions, which I believe is less than China’s
year-on-year increase. Furthermore, the Government have argued—I
respect the Minister greatly, but I am afraid we will have to disagree
rather a lot this afternoon—that the costs will not be that
significant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000007">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T14:29:59"></hs_TimeCode>
few years ago, the phrase on everyone’s lips was “peak
oil.” The greens were setting up transition towns all over the
place and arguing that we should go back to weaving baskets and driving
horses and carts, because we were about to run out of oil. The
following week, the same people would be complaining about all the oil
and gas that there was, which I thought at the time was a bit strange.
In any case, the idea of peak oil was one that we all followed and, to
me at least, it made a little bit of sense to try to develop our own
forms of
energy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000008">Finally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T14:32:09"></hs_TimeCode>,

T. C. Davies:</Member></B> First, as I have just said, climate change
is happening, just as it has always happened. Secondly, we must
consider the nature of what has been suggested is going on. Carbon
dioxide is a warming 
<?notus-xml column=237?>gas—that is a scientific fact. There has been an increase in
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere since we started
industrialising—that is also a fact. Where I beg to differ is
that it is not proven that the carbon dioxide that has gone into the
atmosphere is responsible for the relatively small amount of warming
that has taken place since industrialisation. The total amount of
warming that we are talking about is some 0.8° C; it is a very
small amount in the scheme of
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000020">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T14:37:33"></hs_TimeCode>
we started to industrialise, we were coming out of a very cool period
known as the little ice age; it was so cold that the Thames used to
freeze over and they used to have ice fairs on it. That is part of a
pattern of cooling and warming that has been going on for several
thousand years. We had a warm period during Roman times, and things
became cooler again during the dark ages before becoming warmer during
the mediaeval warm period. The temperature then became cooler before it
started warming up

that 0.8° rise is a result of the natural warming that should
have taken place? Perhaps she could also tell me why we cannot make a
straightforward correlation between CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions and
temperature. If she is right, as the amount of CO<Sub>2</Sub> going
into the atmosphere increases, temperatures ought to increase, but that
is not what happened at all. We have seen increases and decreases.
Temperatures went up in the first half of the last century, but after
the second world war, as we industrialised and started to pour much
larger amounts of CO<Sub>2</Sub> into the atmosphere, temperatures went
down again until, in the 1970s, everyone was predicting a forthcoming
ice age. Temperatures then started to increase again until about 1997.

x amount of CO<Sub>2</Sub>. The Met Office has then gone on to conclude
that a similar amount of CO<Sub>2</Sub> put into the atmosphere will
create a similar increase in temperature, which is absolutely unproven.
There is no reason to assume that just because a certain amount of
CO<Sub>2</Sub> has caused a certain increase in temperature, a similar
amount will cause a similar further increase. The Met Office has also
assumed that the increases in temperature will cause all sorts of

climate change rests on incremental year-on-year temperature increases.
One must look at trends when looking at the science. We are dealing
with long-term trends. We are not dealing with weather; we are dealing
with climate. Although my hon. Friend is right that there has been no
substantial absolute year-on-year increase since the beginning of the
century, the fact of the matter is that in terms of average global
temperatures, the 1980s were significantly warmer than the 1970s, the
1990s were warmer than the 1980s and the years 2001 to 2010 were by far
the warmest 10-year period on instrumental record since 1850. It was
not the same 
<?notus-xml column=240?>year-on-year incremental, but taken across the decade, it was by

showing me a graph. The point that I made earlier is that the graph
would need to be 10 km long to give any real sense of what is going on

weather; we are talking about climate. Climate is not something that

CO<Sub>2</Sub>. They interact. On his point about the last 12 or 15

they do not have a clue what they are doing. Based on the precautionary

is important. Water vapour is a far more important warming gas than

anyone mentions nuclear power, they jump up and down in a rage.
Fracking for gas has driven down not only energy prices in America but
its carbon dioxide emissions. America is one of the few leading

T. C. Davies:</Member></B> I do not argue that nuclear is  the
cheapest form of electricity generation, but it does generate
electricity without carbon dioxide emissions. A recent report by the
Royal Academy of Engineering suggested that nuclear power was certainly
cheaper 
<?notus-xml column=243?>than offshore wind and probably cheaper than onshore wind. No one is
arguing that nuclear is the cheapest form of electricity. If we want
cheap electricity, we can burn coal; we have loads of it in Wales.
There is no problem getting cheap energy; the trick, to keep everyone
happy, is cheap and reliable energy without carbon dioxide emissions.
Nuclear is one way of achieving that, fracking and using gas is
another, while yet another way might be a Severn barrage, although I am
not sure whether the economic case stacks up. A barrage could certainly
generate a large amount of the UK’s electricity without any
carbon dioxide emissions, but what is the response of Friends of the

150 years. Analysis of the paleoclimate archives indicates that in the

1983 to 2012 was, according to the scientists, “very
likely”—with a 90% or greater probability—the
warmest 30-year period of the past 800 years. They have that fact with

ambitious and most uncertainly based legislation that the House has
introduced during my time in Parliament. It was introduced with no
discussion of cost. I was the only person who considered the impact
assessment before the debate, because the Table Office told me that I
was the only person to have taken a copy of it. It showed that the
likely cost of the then Government’s measures, based on their
own figures, and even excluding transition costs and the cost of
driving industry overseas, were twice the maximum benefit. That was not
discussed at any stage during proceedings on the Bill, not even when,

the cost of cheap fuel driving out a less reliable and more costly

poverty. There is an almost schizophrenic approach to this question: on
the one hand, we complain about the effects; on the other hand, we
vigorously pursue a policy that produces those
effects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000111">Every

Europe—this was in a European study—costs about
€600,000, which is far more than jobs in other sectors. For the

am glad that there is at least a wider debate about the issue. The one
thing we know is that the general public have not been convinced; that
is why there have been scare stories about food stocks running out,
cities being submerged, 20-metre increases in tides and wildlife being
wiped out. Indeed, Professor Schneider and Sir John Houghton both said
we needed scare stories, because that is the only way to focus people
on the issue. Of course, in their boldness, the likes of the Met Office
and the BBC have given their scare stories far too short a time period,
and they are now being proved wrong. It is okay if people say something
will happen in 100 years, but if they say it will happen in
10 years, people will remember, and if it does not happen, the scare
will not have much of an effect.</hs_Para>

Mowat</B> (Warrington South) (Con):</Member> Up until now, there have
been two main groups in the debate: those who accept that man-made
global warming is happening and, therefore, that we need the Climate
Change Act; and those who repudiate the idea that it is happening and
who think, therefore, that we do not need the Act. I am actually in a
third set: I am prepared, on the balance of probabilities, to accept
that man-made global warming is happening and needs to be addressed,
but I have some severe reservations about the Act, and particularly
about the thrust of climate policy in this country.</hs_Para>

do I accept the science? First, I am ignorant. Frankly, there is too
much certainty on both sides of the debate. I agree that the science is
not settled, but Members on both sides of the debate talk as if they
were more certain of everything than I am of anything. My ignorance on
this issue leads me, under the precautionary principle—I have a
degree in applied science, although that does not make me an
expert—to accept that much of the balance of science, as has
been correctly said, says that man-made global warming is

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:24:43"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) said, the
science is clear: greenhouse gases and water vapour increase
temperature, and other things do too. What we do not know, and what the
whole debate in science is about, is the weight of those
factors.</hs_Para>

are people, who are probably cleverer than anybody in this room,
wrestling with that issue, and I do not intend to get into it, other
than to say a couple of things. It is probably true that the
temperature has not risen for the last 10 or 12 years. Does that, in
itself, undermine the thrust of the science and the models? It does
not. There will always be a probability of such things, given the noise
in the data. However, the Minister or the Opposition Front-Bench
speaker might like to tell us how many years of no warming we must have
before we seriously question the models. At the very least, the fact
that we have had so many years of small amounts of warming tends, under
Bayesian probability theory, to take us to the lower end of the
forecasts.</hs_Para>

I say, I accept the science. We have seen the Stern report, warts and
all, and the costs involved. Parliament put in place the Climate Change
Act and the 80% reduction to try to keep the temperature rise to
2° C by 
<?notus-xml column=251?>2100, and it was helped in that by five Budgets. There are some good
things in the Act. First, it focuses on carbon, not renewables. EU
legislation focuses almost entirely on renewables, which is why we are
sucked into the false impression that countries such as Germany, which
produces significantly more carbon per unit of GDP or per capita than
us, are the good guys, who can burn coal and have renewables. Frankly,
if a country wants to reduce carbon, it does not have renewables, it
stops burning coal.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:26:42"></hs_TimeCode>So that is a
good aspect of the Climate Change Act. The Act is also clear and hard
to fudge. It is also inflexible, which is a strength and a
weakness.</hs_Para>

issues I have with the Act are threefold. First, it is, broadly
speaking, uncosted. Secondly, it is inflexible, and I will return to
that in the light of some of the facts, which are changing. Thirdly,
and most importantly—I disagree with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:27:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

the Act being uncosted, it may well be right for the world to address
the issue of climate change, but that does cause fuel poverty. That
might be a price worth paying, although that case has not been made
very much, and the Government might pursue it a little more. Of course,
carbon leakage also means, at the margin, that we are losing jobs in
some industries—particularly heavy industries in the
north—because they rely heavily on power. It always strikes me
as a little odd, at a time when we are trying to rebalance the economy,
that we are putting manufacturing at a potential disadvantage, although
that has not wholly happened yet, and we will see how things pan
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

real problem is that the Act is unilateral. It has been said that
Britain produces 1.5% of the world’s emissions, which is about
the amount China’s emissions increased by last year. The Act was
predicated on the assumption that we would take a world leadership
position in all this stuff and that the world would follow us. However,
it increasingly appears that the world does not wish to follow us, and
we are seeing that in a number of ways; there are words and there are
actions. The Minister mentioned Germany, and I alluded earlier to its
decision to abandon nuclear power, build dirty coal stations at great
pace and to refuse to use carbon capture and storage technology,

ours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0001.htm#13091045000127"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>

warming, just as there has been very little in the past decade, and on

that is a price worth paying instead of having further gas stations and
carbonisation. We have got our Act: let our lights go out. Fourthly,

difficult—certainly in four minutes—to know where to

change is happening, and believes that it is all conspiracy, they are
hardly likely to believe that there should be a Climate Change Act or
that it should affect either how people act in the economy, or how
legislation proceeds—exactly as a businessman who believed the

understand how far back we are going in the debate; but I think that,
as far as where it is heading, it is based on a fundamental
misunderstanding of what science does. There is no final, settled
scientific position on climate change; nor is there such a settled
position on virtually any other major issue in science. That is how
science works. It is based on hypotheses and their refutation, and
further hypotheses. As far as scientific hypotheses go, and as far as
the debate in the scientific community is concerned, the idea that
anthropogenic global warming is clearly producing substantial change in
the climate—not the weather, but the climate—is,
relatively, one of the most certain.</hs_Para>

the gravitational field but I noticed hon. Members being careful to
take account of gravity when they entered the Chamber and 
<?notus-xml column=253?>to keep their actions on the right side of science. That is what we need
to do in relation to global warming. We shall shortly see from the IPCC
fifth report that there is an overwhelming, if not complete, case for
considering that substantial global warming not only happened through
the industrialisation period, but is cumulatively in store for the
world, as the result of anthropogenic activity.</hs_Para>

not say that we should opt for adaptation rather than mitigation. The
Climate Change Act 2008 has stood the test of time since it was passed
in informing our policies in that respect. The question of scrapping it
now goes to the heart of what we, as legislators, are here to do. We

is the Act working in its own terms? I often think that that is the
best way to approach arguments—not to start with one’s
own premises, but to consider those of the opposition. The Act is
supposed to be bringing down carbon dioxide. Is it doing that, or
helping to do it? The facts are that since 1990, instead of producing
an extra two parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere per
year, we are producing three. In Europe, the production of carbon
dioxide since 1990 is down by 15%, but consumption is up by 19%, so in
fact more carbon dioxide is being put into the atmosphere as the result
of activity in the European Union. To put the matter at its simplest,
if there is a carbon tax in Europe—if we charge for
carbon—and not in China or India or elsewhere in the world, we
are giving those countries an export subsidy. If that were to be put
down as a straightforward argument, or motion, in the House of Commons,
no one would support it. To put things another way, the policy is one
of deindustrialisation, as

is the policy affordable—for the country, as well as for
individuals? There is an excellent paper by Liberum Capital, which I
would advise anyone to read, on capital markets in utilities, and
particularly energy, in the next 15 years. The paper expresses a belief
that there will be several critical points in the next 15 years when
the lights may well go out. To take the analysis at its simplest,
replacing the current energy-producing power plants would cost the
country an extra £250 billion. I remember when £1 million
was a lot of money, but £250 billion is, as a friend
of mine used to say, a very lot of money, and capital markets cannot
produce it—or are most unlikely to. I shall send the Minister
the paper, if he would like to look at it.

a member of the Science and Technology Committee, I had a very close
look at what was happening at the university of East Anglia and the two
inquiries that went into it at the time. Looking at it closely, we see
that there was not science going on there. There was a group of
enthusiasts who were pretending to be scientists, because what they
were doing was not testable. In terms of the critical things that were
in the public domain, Muir Russell’s report did not ask the
basic question about whether e-mails had been deleted in the university
of East Anglia, and the Oxburgh report, which was supposed to look at

am very proud to be speaking today in support of the Climate Change Act
2008, which was seminal legislation. Passing the first legally binding
climate change target showed that Britain was serious about tackling
one of the greatest challenges if not the greatest challenge that
humanity has ever faced. Like my hon. Friend the Member for Brent North

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:41:27"></hs_TimeCode>proud to belong
to a party that took action to secure our planet for future generations
when we were in government. I am prouder that Parliament passed the Act
all but unanimously, with just five Members voting against it. I note
that some of those five are in the room with us today. There was a
clear cross-party political consensus that something needed to be done
and a clear will to get on and do it, so I am saddened by the tone of
parts of today’s debate. It reminds me of a film that was
released just a few months after the 2008 Act became law. Many people
in this room may have seen it. It was called “The Age of
Stupid”. The plot is set in 2055 in a world savaged by the
effects of global warming. It focuses on a lead character looking back
to the beginning of the  21st century and wondering why we did
not combat climate change when we had the chance. I am not sure whether
the producers are planning a sequel, but at times I have felt as though
certain speakers that we have heard today have been auditioning for a

us take one example—flood defences. According to experts at the

a year. Just last week, a new study by the Met Office—I
reinforce the fact that I respect that organisation; I do not think

exacerbated half the extreme weather events that happened last year.
That has huge implications for us here in the UK and particularly for
our flood defences. Last year

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:50:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Monmouth (David T. C. Davies) has performed a useful
parliamentary service in allowing the issue to be aired. Although
profound climate scepticism may be only a minority interest, such
sceptics voice a view shared by a number of my constituents and people
in the newspapers. It is a view heard on the Clapham omnibus and it is
right that we hear such views and debate them in the open. I agree with
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:50:59"></hs_TimeCode>my right hon.
Friend the Member for Hitchin and Harpenden (Mr Lilley) that
a cloying consensus in Parliament does no service to legislation or
national debate. However much I profoundly disagree with some of the
arguments, it is right that we have the chance to air them in
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:51:20"></hs_TimeCode>.

have seen an unprecedented increase in the pace of change over the past
100 years: unprecedented growth in population and the spread of
industry; dramatically increased use of oil, gas and coal; and the
continued cutting down of forests. Those factors have created new and
daunting problems, and hon. Members know what they are: acid rain and
the greenhouse effect. In 1989, Margaret Thatcher used a huge slice of
her party conference speech to talk about threats to the environment
and the specific challenge of climate change, which she took very
seriously. She went to the UN, where she was the 
<?notus-xml column=258?>first world leader to call for concerted international action on global
warming. Asserting that that is at odds with being a Conservative is
profoundly wrong.</hs_Para>

do not rely on hon. Members for my science. I am not a scientist. I do
not profess to understand all the science, let alone to be a definitive
arbiter on climate change, but it is incumbent on politicians,
particularly Ministers, to take advice from the most respectable and
reputable scientific institutions and academies. My hon. Friend the
Member for Monmouth did himself no service by talking down the Met
Office. It is not perfect; none of us are and nor is any human
institution, but it is an excellent institution, with an excellent
global reputation in its
field.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000170">Climate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:54:23"></hs_TimeCode>

Members should look to the American Association for the Advancement of
Science; the World Meteorological Organisation; our own Met Office; the
European Science Foundation; the American Physical Society; the Polish
Academy of Sciences; the World Health Organisation; the national
science academies of the G8 plus 5; our own Royal Society; the American
Geophysical Union; and of course the IPCC. It is not true to assert
that there is unanimity among scientists—there never will be,
because science constantly evolves—but the great weight of
scientific opinion, and certainly the expert opinion on which Ministers
should draw when framing public policy, is clear on where the balance
of risks lie. Of course, there is a risk that we have got it wrong, but
the prudent action based on the greater risk is to take steps to avert
dangerous man-made climate
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:55:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Gardiner:</Member></B> I agree with the point the Minister makes. Would
he care to reinforce it by pointing out that the IPCC does not simply
represent a consensus of scientists, but talks about degrees of
probability, levels of confidence and the percentage of risk? It does
not try to say, “Everybody has agreed”, but varies the
stated risk depending on the level of agreement and the certainty of
each

other key suggestion is that we are acting in isolation. If that were
the case, I would have some sympathy for the arguments made. We may
have been a leader in climate change legislation, but 32 countries,
from China to Ethiopia and Vietnam, now have some sort of climate
change framework. Mexico and South Korea have modelled their climate
change Acts and legislation on those from Westminster. India’s
12th five-year plan incorporates a range of recommendations from its
low-carbon expert
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:56:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Indonesia
has just passed a ministerial regulation, based on climate science, to
expand thermal energy. We may be at the forefront, but we are not
totally alone. We must make more progress. The world has a last chance
in 2015 to get its act together and come together with effective,
concerted international action if we are to have any chance of keeping
the rise below

Act. I was involved as a Front Bench spokesperson and served on the

expenditure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000177">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:58:23"></hs_TimeCode>

for Blackley and Broughton (Graham Stringer) said that climate change
policy would add one-quarter of a trillion pounds to our projected
energy spend. The widely accepted figures from the Department of Energy
and Climate Change show that, taking everything into account, we will
have to spend something in the region of £110 billion in total
over the next decade on energy measures. I do not recognise that
quarter of a trillion figure. We must bear in mind the fact that the
£110 billion investment will not only help us to
prepare for a low-carbon energy economy, but pay for
energy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:59:27"></hs_TimeCode>

views on global warning.
Energy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:59:27"></hs_TimeCode>
efficiency is the surest way to help the fuel poor. There is no good
excuse for wasting energy, however it is generated. We should be ever
mindful of the need to drive energy efficiency as a way not only of
reducing carbon emissions or helping people to cut their fuel bills,
but increasing the economic competitiveness of UK plc. The Government
have put a greater emphasis on energy efficiency than any of their
predecessors.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000178">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T15:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>

4 August next year, it will be exactly 100 years since the outbreak of
hostilities in what became known as the great war and then, more
commonly, the first world war. Few wars in history have been as tragic,
bloody and devastating as that war; it is perhaps strange, therefore,
to commemorate the outbreak of something so awful. It is right,
however, that the date is marked and lessons learned from a conflict
that left 16 million dead and almost every community in this country
severely affected. The pain and suffering that we experience from the
first world war is mirrored throughout the Commonwealth, where
thousands lost their lives supporting the allied

of the most eye-catching initiatives will be to sow millions of poppy

Mentor-Morris and Mr Phil Berry were sharing a pint of beer in the
Royal British Legion club in Greenhithe in my constituency. They were
discussing the centenary, and how there should be some commemoration to
mark the occasion. One of them suggested getting schools and local

range of programmes—it will make an announcement next

museum that funding would be provided for a commemorative programme to
recognise the sacrifices that took place. I welcome that, and the

contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:10:07"></hs_TimeCode>.

point that has come through in this debate, as it does every time we
discuss the first world war, is the very welcome engagement of members
of the public—the ex-service community in particular, but also
more broadly—and the interest in the anniversary. The first
world war is absolutely integral to our history and, as a Government,
we are 100% committed to commemorating its centenary
appropriately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000197" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000197">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:11:21"></hs_TimeCode>
is worth reflecting on the scale involved—more than 16.5 million
deaths, military and civilian, including more than 1.25 million from
the then British empire, colonies and dominions alone. That often gets
me thinking 
<?notus-xml column=263?>about my own time in the Army, so much of which was curiously shaped by
the events of the first world war. For example, all
the training companies in my college, Sandhurst, were named after its
prominent
battles.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000198">Like
others, I was therefore absolutely delighted when the Prime Minister
announced the £53 million programme of funded activities, which
includes £5 million for school visits, at least £6
million from the Heritage Lottery Fund, and national events to
commemorate six key moments—the first day of the war; the battle
of the Somme; Armistice day, which will be commemorated in 2018; the
battles of Jutland and Passchendaele; and, of course, the Gallipoli
landings. At the centre of the programme lies the £35 million
project to refurbish the Imperial War museum’s first world war
galleries, which will provide the hugely visible
centrepiece.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000199">Another
stream of work is to encourage
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:12:03"></hs_TimeCode>
engagement, such as the Victoria Cross winners commemoration scheme
that was announced at the beginning of August, and the
website—something I was very keen on—to signpost people
towards sources of help for war memorials. In the county that we know
so well, several war memorials were put next to roads that were not
that well used in Kent at the time, but have since become busy
throughways, and those war memorials have suffered as a result. Such
things are

absolutely agree with my hon. Friend that if one thing is synonymous
with memories of the first world war it is the Flanders poppy, which is
one reason why I think that the idea is so clever. I therefore fully
understand his disappointment and that of the Royal British Legion

some
comfort.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000201">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:13:38"></hs_TimeCode>
first factor is that, as my hon. Friend will know, Ministers are not
allowed to direct lottery distributors on how to spend the money, and
it would be wrong if we were allowed to. We can set the strategic
direction of the lottery distributing bodies, as the Prime Minister has
done in this instance, but we cannot direct how they spend their money.
The Heritage Lottery Fund has offered to meet the project applicant,
and I encourage my hon. Friend to get involved in that meeting and to
get the Heritage Lottery Fund to explain precisely why it took its
decision. In that meeting, he can examine whether there is any scope to
reshape the application or to bring it back in some other
form<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:13:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000202">The
second factor is that many of us think that the idea is extremely good,
as I have already said several times, and I pay tribute again to those
who thought of it. It is precisely the sort of innovative idea that we
want to encourage as part of the
celebrations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:13:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
All I can tell my hon. Friend is that officials in various parts of
Whitehall are looking at how to take on the idea and see what can be
done to bring it to fruition. I hope that we will have an answer for

Shannon:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his very positive
response. Things have changed in Northern Ireland. The Minister will be
aware of that and of how things 
<?notus-xml column=264?>are progressing. The Irish Division and the Ulster Division fought
together at the battle of the Somme. For many years after the war, it
was a case of never the twain shall meet, but the Royal British
Legion—it operates along with other bodies in the Republic of
Ireland—will hold commemoration events in the Republic of
Ireland in conjunction and partnership with bodies in Northern Ireland.
Great steps of advancement have taken place, and I know that the
Minister will be aware of some of them. I was there about a month ago
with some of the people concerned, and we heard about the ministerial
involvement of the Republic of Ireland Government. If we can do that in
Northern Ireland, we can do it in relation to the Somme seeds idea put

suspect that this time would in any event have huge resonance in
Northern Ireland, because of the sheer numbers of people involved.
Clearly, given the peace agreement and what has happened since the
mid-1990s, the anniversary provides a unique opportunity that was not
previously there. No part of the United Kingdom was left untouched by
the first world war, but the effect on Northern Ireland was

do not know whether I had the chance to tell the hon. Gentleman this
the last time we had such a debate, but as we have a few moments to
spare I can say that I have discovered—perhaps he knows
this—that the first Member of Parliament to die in the first
world war was an Ulsterman. He was the MP for one of the Downs, I
think, and his grandson went on to be the Prime Minister of Northern
Ireland in the 1960s. He had done military service in the 1880s and
fought through the South African campaign, but he left and stood for
Parliament in 1910. He volunteered to join up again in 1914, and was
mown down within a matter of minutes. He was from an Ulster family. I
came across that from the periphery, because a relative of mine serving
in the Irish Fusiliers actually got through the whole lot. He was one
of the very lucky few who managed to do

in the debate, including the encouragement of students to visit the

to be highlighted and visited? I have obviously mentioned my project in
Folkestone—10 million men passed through the town, and people
can walk the routes—but many other sites linked with early air
raids, training facilities and military facilities still exist. Many of
them have been forgotten, and the centenary period will be a great time

with other changes to squadrons in the midlands, that means that the

people in Dudley and the wider black country make to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>. Thankfully
we have retained the Vicar street base in Dudley, without which TA

travel 30 or 40 miles to train and to fulfil their other
responsibilities in Telford.</hs_Para>

I have serious concerns about the risks to the Dudley and Telford
bases. I am worried that they could be at risk in the long term because
local reserve squadrons are best managed locally, not from a
headquarters 150 miles or so away. TA sub-units are hard to manage,
especially when problems occur. There are examples such as 37 Signals
Regiment, which has its HQ in Redditch, in a constituency neighbouring
my own. The regiment has had management issues at one of its squadrons
in Colchester, 160 miles away. In the recent TA review, the Colchester
squadron has been moved, to come under command and administration from
a more local Royal Signals TA Regiment in the south-east to ease that
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:34:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000218">The
success of the RMLY Regiment was down to its local laydown, with its
regimental HQ at Telford and squadrons at Telford, Dudley, Chester and
Wigan. I am concerned that it will be more difficult for the Dudley
squadron to develop an esprit de corps with other squadrons in
Nottingham and Fulham, and new headquarters 150 miles or so away in
Croydon. Similarly, the rest of the RMLY will be lost to the
Queen’s Own Yeomanry, which has its HQ at Newcastle upon Tyne.
That will end 217 years of regimental unity and shared history. This is
not just about the RMLY; it is about local TA
regiments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:35:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000219">It
is only because the RMLY is local that it has been the best recruited
yeomanry regiment and the third best recruiting TA regiment nationwide,
and it has had more soldiers on operations than any other yeomanry
regiment. Reserve regiments will now receive regimental recruiting
teams from the regular Army. Under the former local Telford, Dudley,
Chester and Wigan laydown, those teams would have had less travelling
to do and would have been more effective than they will be under the
non-local laydown of Croydon, Dudley, Fulham and
Nottingham<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:35:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000220">I
have a few concerns about that. First, if a sub-unit faces problems
with training, equipment or staff, the distances between bases could
become an issue when it comes to fixing the problem. Secondly, joint
training between squadrons is important to yeomanry regiments, but it
will be more difficult to deliver because of the distances involved.
Thirdly, TA employer support issues are handled locally by the Reserve
Forces and Cadets Association. During deployments, regimental TA
liaison officers are mobilised, but their interface with
soldiers’ families and employers will be more difficult without
local laydown, because of the greater distances
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:36:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000221">Those
changes mean that there will be no yeomanry regiment in the west
midlands and very few “teeth arm” reserve jobs in the

positions are less well recruited because, as I understand it, they are
less popular with reservist soldiers.</hs_Para>

Robathan:</Member></B> As I was saying before I was so rudely
interrupted, our reasons for changing the Army’s structure,
including a greater reliance on the reserves, are well known. Much
detailed and complex work has been done by the Army in support of the
complex task of restructuring the regulars and the reserves into what
will be a fully integrated, flexible and credible force by 2018. Many
difficult decisions have had to be taken in support of that work, but I
believe the end product will justify the means.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=269?><hs_Para UID="13091045000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000231">The hon.
Member for Dudley North
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-10T16:59:19"></hs_TimeCode> already be
aware that the principle of greater integration was established in the
report published by the independent commission to review the United
Kingdom’s reserve forces, which was published in July 2011. In
delivering the Future Reserves 2020 proposition, and Army 2020, we are
committed to expanding the volunteer Army Reserve to a trained strength
of 30,000 and to integrating it fully into the structure of the Army as
a whole. Achieving that has already involved hard choices on the
regular side to ensure that the Army plays its part in allowing the
Ministry of Defence to continue to live within its means while
maintaining an Army that can operate across the full spectrum of
operational capability and offer its reserve members fulfilment and
challenge.</hs_Para>

underestimate the challenge of growing the reserve to 30,000. However,
as I have said in the past, the target of a trained reserve of 30,000
is well within historic norms. In 1997, the Territorial Army was over
50,000 strong, and it had already been reduced to about 40,000 by 2000.
By 2009, it had declined in size to just over 26,000. That shows that
the current initiative to increase its trained strength to 30,000,
while challenging, is perfectly achievable. However, given its
importance to our nation, that will require support and encouragement
from all of us, which is why it is valuable that the hon. Gentleman has
raised this
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000233">We
recognise, of course, that while previously the Territorial Army was
essentially designed to augment the regular Army, it will in future be
a vital part of an integrated Army, ready and able to deploy routinely
at sub-unit level, and in some cases as formed units. Having said that,
I should not overlook the contribution to operations already made by
reservists, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned. In the past 10 years,
almost 30,000 members of the TA have deployed on operations overseas.
Since 2003, more than 70 members of the TA have received operational
honours, while 21, sadly, have died on operations in Afghanistan and
Iraq. I know that those present today will want to join me in saluting
their
sacrifice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000234">We
are investing heavily in the reserves to ensure that they will be
trained, equipped and supported accordingly for the new role they will
be expected to play. We plan that, over time, reservists will have
access to the same training equipment currently used by regulars. In
exchange, we expect them to commit to specific amounts of training time
and, for the Army in most cases, to accept liability for a maximum
deployment of up to six months plus pre-deployment training in a
five-year period, dependent on operational demand. There will be
opportunities for shorter periods of deployed service commitment for
those in some specialist roles. Reserves will also routinely fulfil
roles that were historically the preserve of the regulars, and officers
and soldiers will have command opportunities that have not always been
available in the recent past.</hs_Para>

will provide career prospects that have not necessarily been available
hitherto for reservists. Similarly, the skills and experience gained by
reservists will be of considerable value to their civilian employers,
making the proposition all the more attractive. Alongside the
improvements and changes being made to the offer, we are overhauling
the structure of the Army reserves to align with the regular structure,
which is what will allow the Army to become a single entity.</hs_Para>

specific circumstances of the Royal Mercian and Lancastrian Yeomanry
and the changes we will be implementing, I understand that there has
been some concern among those serving in the regiment and in the local

squadrons of the regiment will remain in use, and it is intended that
the squadrons will continue to bear the historic names handed down over
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091045000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/halltext/130910h0002.htm#13091045000237">The
RMLY was formed in 1992 and is the youngest of today’s four
yeomanry regiments. It was established following the amalgamation of
the Queen’s Own Mercian Yeomanry and the Duke of
Lancaster’s Own Yeomanry as part of the “Options for
Change” programme initiated to redesign our defence forces
following the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the cold war.
The antecedent regiments of the RMLY, the oldest of which was raised in
1794, are steeped in a rich and distinguished military history, having
served with distinction in South Africa and seen action during the
world wars in many theatres in roles as diverse as cavalry, artillery
and signals. That heritage will of course be preserved for future
generations. Since we have time, I will digress in a way that I was
told not to: one of the regiment’s squadrons, based on the
Cheshire Yeomanry, was involved in the Peterloo massacre, but it was a
long time ago, so we need not argue about that now.</hs_Para>

structure, the overall number of yeomanry regiments will remain the
same, although the number  of squadrons will be reduced. Three
of the regiments will be in the adaptable force, paired with regular
light cavalry regiments, while the Royal Wessex Yeomanry will provide
support to the reaction force. The changes have been designed to allow
better regular-reserve  unit pairing with all the associated
benefits that that brings: improved access to training facilities

opportunities for recruitment.</hs_Para>

Defence Secretary said on 3 July, it will be necessary to merge or
close some units and raise some other new ones so that they can more
easily be paired with regular counterparts. The Army will also
consolidate some small detachments, most of which have been poorly
recruited over recent years, to enable better pairing
arrangements.</hs_Para>

arrangements have meant that the current regimental headquarters of the
RMLY in Telford is not well placed to pair with any of the regular
light cavalry regiments, all of which are many hundreds of miles away
in Leuchars, Catterick and Swanton Morley. Other yeomanry regiments
already in the north-east and south-east are well placed to pair with
Catterick and Swanton Morley respectively, but the distance between
Telford and Leuchars is thought to be too great to enable an effective
pairing relationship. Therefore, the decision has been taken to leave
RMLY squadrons in situ by resubordinating them to the nearest of the
two other yeomanry regiments, and to move the regimental headquarters
to Scotland where it will take command of the existing yeomanry
squadrons in Belfast, Ayrshire and Fife and be very well placed to pair
with the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards in Leuchars. The RHQ is largely,
although not exclusively, composed of regular staff and instructors. I
particularly congratulate the RMLY on the recruiting
successes mentioned by the hon. Gentleman.</hs_Para>

necessary endorsement, the regiment in Scotland will be renamed the
Scottish and North Irish Yeomanry. As I mentioned, the locations
currently occupied by RMLY squadrons will remain in use, and it is
planned that, subject to endorsement, the squadrons themselves will
retain their titles, although their command will be transferred to
other yeomanry regiments. That means that there will be little
disruption for the people attending the units. They can continue to

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government (Brandon Lewis):</Member></B> I am pleased to announce that
the Government intend to reform the burdensome rule requiring all
parish council cheques and other orders for the payment of money to be
signed by two councillors. We consulted on this reform last year and
received over 500 replies. Of these 78% were in favour of the reform,
including the key national accountancy and audit organisations
concerned.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091033000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/wmstext/130910m0001.htm#13091033000016">We
propose to implement the reform by a legislative reform order under the
Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006. The order will apply to
parish councils and charter trustees in England and community councils
in Wales. The order will be laid in draft, accompanied by an
explanatory document, as required by the 2006
Act.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091033000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/wmstext/130910m0001.htm#13091033000017">The
Government place great importance on maintaining a strong system of
financial control for parish councils to safeguard the public money
they are responsible for against fraud and other losses. We intend the
outcome of this reform to be not only the freeing of the councils to
use modern methods of payment more efficiently, but also a more
effective control framework than the two signature rule on its own
provides.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091033000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/wmstext/130910m0001.htm#13091033000018">We
have worked closely with representatives of the sector and their
auditors to ensure such a framework is in place before the two
signature rule has been removed. We will be doing further work with
them in the coming weeks to finalise the arrangements. I will then lay
the draft order and the explanatory document at the earliest
opportunity, when both Houses are sitting. The explanatory document
will summarise the responses to the consultation and set out the agreed
control
framework.</hs_Para><hs_8Statement UID="13091033000009" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/wmstext/130910m0001.htm#13091033000009">Troubled

Government have set out an ambitious goal of turning around the lives
of 120,000 troubled families in England by the end of this Parliament:
getting children back into school; cutting youth crime and antisocial
behaviour across the whole family; getting adults into work; and
reducing the estimated £9 billion per year that these families
cost the taxpayer. Full details of the Government’s payment by

to the end of July 2013, upper-tier local authorities have reported
that they have turned around nearly 14,000 troubled families. The
figure represents a sevenfold increase from January which means
children are back in school for at least three terms where they were
previously playing truant or excluded; high levels of youth crime and
antisocial behaviour are down over at least six months; and adults are
getting off benefits and into work for at least three
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091033000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/wmstext/130910m0001.htm#13091033000023">The

the often long-standing and deep-seated nature of these

June 2012, I announced that all 152 upper-tier local authorities had
signed up to deliver the troubled families programme and, for most,
this started with the substantial task of identifying the families most
in need of intervention. As of the end of June 2013, they had
identified over 80,000 troubled families who will be targeted for
intervention by the programme. Of these families, nearly 50,000
families are already being worked with—up from 35,000 in March.

of the avoidable pressures on the NHS is flu. On average around 750,000
patients see their GP with flu symptoms and nearly 5,000 people die
each year. Flu levels have been relatively low over the past two years
but this does not mean they will not go up this year. And if cases of
flu do increase, the pressure on A&amp;Es will also increase. The best
way for people at risk from flu to protect themselves, their families

health care workers, by the very nature of their jobs, deal with people
who are unwell every day and on average, around 27,000 people spend
time in hospital with flu every year. NHS staff can play an important
role in not picking up the flu virus and 
<?notus-xml column=48?>passing it on to other patients who are often people who are already
poorly and vulnerable to infection by simply having the flu vaccine.
Less than half of front-line NHS staff get vaccinated against flu, and
in some hospitals this figure drops to fewer than one in five. This is
why we want to significantly boost the number of health care workers
getting the flu vaccine to 75%. Trusts will not be eligible to receive
a portion of the money in future years if they do not vaccinate 75% of
their staff this year, except in exceptional circumstances where they
can prove to the TDA, Monitor and NHS England that they have robust
plans in place to ensure they meet this ambitious target the following
year.</hs_Para><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13091033000206" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/wmstext/130910m0001.htm#13091033000206"><Sup>1</Sup>The

Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill 2013, currently in the

offence of having a dog dangerously out of control applies regardless
of whether it occurs on public or private property. This will provide
the police and the Crown Prosecution Service with an appropriate legal
base for taking forward prosecutions as necessary. The Bill also
creates an explicit offence where a dog is dangerously out of control

same Bill will also provide practitioners with faster and more flexible
powers that allow them to tackle all types of anti-social behaviour
within communities. For example, the Community Protection Notice is an
early intervention power that will allow officers to address
irresponsible dog ownership in any form. Notices served could require
an individual to remedy their behaviour by attending a dog behaviour or
training class for example. The adaptability of these powers removes
the need for numerous stand-alone notices for each separate form of
anti-social behaviour and also allows officers to develop innovative
local solutions that address the cause as well as the effect of the
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091035000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/petntext/130910p0001.htm#13091035000016">In

rates in this country have been too high for too long. Last year,
around 600,000 crimes were committed by people who had broken the law
before. Almost half of all offenders released from our prisons offend
again within a year. That goes up to almost 60% for those sentenced to
prison terms of under 12
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091035000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/petntext/130910p0001.htm#13091035000037">The
pressing need to drive down reoffending rates means that we need to
look again at the way offenders are rehabilitated. This is why, on 9
May 2013, the Secretary of State for Justice, Chris Grayling, announced
new measures to ensure that, for the first time, every offender
released from custody receives a minimum of 12 months supervision and
rehabilitation in the community. The Government are legislating to
extend this statutory supervision and rehabilitation to the most
prolific group of offenders—those sentenced to fewer than 12
months in
custody.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091035000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/petntext/130910p0001.htm#13091035000038">We
are also putting in place an unprecedented nationwide “through
the prison gate” resettlement service, meaning offenders will be
given continuous support by one provider from custody into the
community. We will facilitate this by ensuring that most offenders are
held in a prison designated to their area for at least three months
before
release.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091035000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/petntext/130910p0001.htm#13091035000039">We
want to draw on the best services that can be offered by practitioners
across the public, private and voluntary sectors, so that we can
deliver better support to more offenders. This is why we are opening up
the market to a diverse range of new rehabilitation providers. These
providers, who will deliver services across 21 Contract
Package Areas, will have the freedom to innovate and to focus on
turning around the lives of offenders but will only be paid in full for
real reductions in reoffending. Our plans will also use competition to
drive greater efficiency, which is vital to free up the resources we
need so that we can extend rehabilitation to a wider group of
offenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091035000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/petntext/130910p0001.htm#13091035000040">The
competition process has been designed, as far as possible, to allow a
range of different kinds of entities to be able to bid to deliver
services. This could include alternative delivery vehicles and mutuals
designed by individuals within existing Probation Trusts. All bidders
will need to demonstrate that they reach the required quality standards
across all elements. The Contract Package Areas are of a variety of
sizes and values,  in order to make sure more medium and small
organisations—including mutuals designed by existing probation
staff—can join bids to take part in delivery of
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091035000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/petntext/130910p0001.htm#13091035000041">Public
protection remains our primary priority. This is why we are creating a
new National Probation Service, working to protect the public and
building upon the expertise and professionalism which are already in
place. Probation staff make a vital contribution to protecting the
public from the most dangerous offenders and will continue to do so.
Under the new system, every offender who poses a high risk of serious
harm to the public will be managed by the public sector probation
service.</hs_Para>

also recognise that risk levels can change, which  is why we
have designed a system where cases will  be referred by the
provider to the National Probation Service for a reassessment of risk
if there is a significant change in the offender’s
circumstances, or intelligence received indicates that the risk of
serious harm may have escalated to high. If the National Probation
Service assesses the case as having escalated to high it will take over

Ministers to set, by regulation, the drink-driving limit in Scotland
which had been previously held exclusively by the Secretary of State
for Transport. It is now for the Scottish Ministers to decide whether
to raise or lower the existing limit or to keep it the same.

The Government also announced that the UK would seek to rejoin 35

helicopter accident has, to date, not identified any evidence of a
causal technical failure. Therefore, at this stage, the European
Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), that has regulatory responsibility for
the design of the helicopter and the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA),
that has responsibility for the safe operation of the UK helicopter
fleet, have no evidence to suggest that there is an issue that should
lead to the grounding of the Super Puma model. However, both
organisations will continue to monitor closely the investigation as it
progresses and take what action may be necessary.</hs_Para>

Hoban:</Member></B> We do not provide an alternative to child
benefit when a family no longer qualifies for it. Apprentices aged
under 19 are paid at least £2.65 per hour (increasing to
£2.68 per hour on 1 October). Depending on their income,
families may qualify for additional support such as housing benefit or
working tax credit. The young adult may qualify for benefits or
additional support in their own right, depending on their
circumstances.</hs_Para>

moved from fortnightly to weekly signing once they had been unemployed
for three months. This additional support only lasted for 13 weeks and
took no account of the claimants' circumstances or job readiness. The
measure announced in the spending review will result in additional
support from the outset of the claim which will be targeted at those
who need it most. This support will continue until the claimant either
finds work or goes onto the Work

August to tackle bin blight (unsightly bin clutter), the Department has
received over 60 letters of enthusiastic support for this stance from
members of the public. The Government is to publish new guidance which
will require suitable provision to be made for proper waste storage in
new homes. This will help avoid bins dominating residential streets or
contributing to increased odour and roadside litter. This is part of
our wider programme of tackling the failed waste collection policies of

2009 the Department has had to reduce its headcount

are ubiquitous in the earth's crust but can become concentrated during
industrial activities. The radioactivity of any wastes arising from
hydraulic fracturing would be low. By law any proposed industrial
activity that may result in the accumulation of low level radioactive
waste requires permission from the relevant environment agency.
Permission is contingent on the development of a waste management plan
for all anticipated radioactive waste arisings. The applicant must also
secure disposal (transfer) routes through companies that are themselves

regards to recruiting into the armed forces running parallel with a
redundancy programme, it is vital that all three services continue to
recruit in order to maintain the right mix of trained and experienced
personnel for the future and to avoid the mistakes of the past that led
to critical skill shortages in some roles. As experience has shown,
once active recruitment ceases, it takes at least three years of
marketing to regain recruiting momentum. In addition, as the armed
forces are an organisation that relies on promoting from within, there
is a need to ensure that an appropriate number of new recruits are
taken on to move up through the system. Maintaining the inflow of new
recruits remains a priority because it is essential in ensuring that
the armed forces are appropriately manned to meet the future
operational demands placed upon
it.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13091059000068" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/text/130910w0001.htm#13091059000068">Aviation</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13091059000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/text/130910w0001.htm#13091059000509"><B><Member PimsId="2052" UID="13091059001702" xid="443" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/text/130910w0001.htm#13091059001702">Mr

have a wide range of mechanisms in place to monitor the progress of
bovine TB in England, including the publication of monthly national and
regional statistics on the TB incidence in cattle, annual reports of
bovine TB surveillance for England and GB and quarterly field
epidemiology reports for the low risk and edge areas of England. The
introduction of a simplified TB surveillance testing programme in for

being made to enforcement across the EU of existing rules on the long

reducing the maximum journey time for horses and better protection for

Poulter:</Member></B> An Independent Review of the Regulation of
Cosmetic Interventions (the Keogh review) was published in April 2013.
A copy of the review has already been placed in the Library. The Keogh
review made 40 recommendations. We support the principal conclusions of
the review. However, implementation of the recommendations raises a
number of complex issues, which we are working through, and involves a
wide range of partners. We will be publishing the Government response
later this autumn.</hs_Para>

Grant:</Member></B> At around £2 billion a year we have one of
the most expensive legal aid systems of its type in the world. The
consultation paper ‘Transforming Legal Aid: delivering a more
credible and efficient system’, contained 
<?notus-xml column=691?>a range of measures aimed at reducing the cost of and promoting public
confidence in the legal aid scheme, including a proposal that providers
would only be paid for work on an application for permission to proceed
with a judicial review if permission is granted by the court.</hs_Para>

noted in the impact assessment, under our proposal set out in the
consultation paper the provider would need to make an assessment of
whether the application is arguable and therefore permission should be
applied for. There may therefore be a fall in permission applications
made. This may reduce the number of cases the Legal Aid Agency (LAA)
need to process and reduce the number of hours required in court for
these cases with an associated saving for Her Majesty's Courts and
Tribunal Service (HMCTS). We have also noted in our assessment that
there is the potential for an increase in requests for reconsideration
of the permission application at a hearing, or onward permission
appeals to the Court of Appeal where permission has been refused, which
may result in an impact on HMCTS from reconsidering the
applications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091059001233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130910/text/130910w0002.htm#13091059001233">In

possibility of increased applications for costs from public authority
opponents, it is already the case that providers should generally agree
costs as part of a settlement or seek a costs order form the court, as
