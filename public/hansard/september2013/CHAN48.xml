order, Mr Speaker. In Question 3 in Scottish questions today, something
was referred to as a “separate Scotland”. I do not know
what a separate Scotland is, and I presume that you do not know what a
separate Scotland is, and certainly nobody is trying to create one. It
is an argumentative term and a pejorative one used by the opponents of
Scottish independence. I raised this issue with the Clerks yesterday
and they agreed that the term should not have been on the Order Paper
today. Can you assure me that “separate Scotland” will
not appear again in any question on the Order
Paper?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143000185"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="13091143001641" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143001641">Mr
Speaker:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his
point of order and for his characteristic courtesy in giving me advance
notice of his intention to raise it. He is, essentially, asking me
whether the use of the word “separate” contravenes the
rule against argument in parliamentary questions. The very fact that I
am being invited to make a ruling suggests to me that a degree of
controversy surrounds the word. There is a perfectly serviceable word
that is used in legislation—“independent”. I think
it would be best if we stuck to that in future where the rules of the
House require neutral expressions. However, the use of the phrase
“a separate Scotland” in debate or in
supplementary questions is not unparliamentary. I hope that that is
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:38:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Bill could make every doctor a researcher and every willing patient a
research participant. This country has already produced 34 Nobel prize
winners in medicine, but we want more so we must ensure that the UK

change the way we

NHS is an amazing asset to innovation because it has a huge wealth of
information, all consented to, all anonymised, that is helping it find
new answers. The end result could be that every willing patient was a

NHS, they would be playing a part in the fight against disease. Echoing
those words, the Government’s life sciences

that vision, which is shared by doctors and charities, might soon hit a
roadblock—a seemingly immovable object—of the law, so
that is what the Bill is designed to remedy. Let us imagine that a
doctor is standing beside a patient and considering a sensible, peer
group-approved innovation, to which full consent has been given, after
other options have been exhausted and there is little else that can be
done. At the moment, that doctor is stopped by the law—or the
fear of the law, which is the same thing. The doctor must ask himself,
“Do I really want to go along this route of innovation because,
if I do, I will depart from the ‘standard procedure’, and
then if anything goes wrong, there will be a trial at which I could be
found guilty of medical negligence. Should I put my livelihood, family
and reputation at risk, or should I stick to the well-worn 
<?notus-xml column=984?>path from which no liability can
arise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>?”
The law at present obliges the doctor to follow the status quo, even
though they know full well that that standard practice leads only to a
short period of poor life quality followed by death, and that is how
scientific discovery is blocked by the current state of the
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:46:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143000204">That
is not how it was in the past, when innovation happened much more
readily. For example, penicillin did not face such roadblocks. Present
law, however, mandates that patients receive only the standard
procedure, which is really the endless repetition of a failed
experiment. The problem is that the law defines medical negligence as a
deviation from that standard procedure, so the law’s insistence
on following the standard procedure is really a barrier to progress on
curing cancer. Any doctor’s deviation from standard procedure is
likely to amount to medical
negligence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:47:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143000205">Standard
procedure is defined simply as a procedure that would have been
followed by a competent body of medical persons skilled in the aspect
of medicine in question. However, innovation, by its very definition,
is something new—a deviation from what went before that did not
work. Without deviation from standard procedure, there is no innovation
and nothing changes, and the treatment of many cancers has not changed
for decades, which is one of the reasons there is no cure for

an automatic and serious risk that he or she will be found guilty of
negligence, if the treatment is less successful than hoped. When there
is only one established practice, even if it is the same course of
treatment that has been applied unchanged for 40 years without any
particular history of success, it will be impossible for a doctor to
depart from it with confidence that he or she will not be exposed to

might ask why a change to the law is suddenly so urgent. It is because
while the law may not have changed much, society has. The number of
lawsuits filed against the NHS has doubled in four years. Last
year’s payout was £1.2 billion. The Treasury provision
for claims against the NHS has now reached £19 billion. Doctors
are therefore increasingly frightened of being sued and even less
likely to feel able to innovate. Furthermore, risk-management processes
in the NHS and insurers’ policies only strengthen this roadblock
to innovation. A growing fear of litigation has stifled innovation,
which is why we need a change in the law to realise the well-expressed
vision that every doctor can be a
researcher<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143000209">We
certainly do not want patients to be treated like mice, so the Bill
would set out in law for the first time the obvious difference between
reckless experimentation and responsible, scientific innovation. The
Bill actually strengthens the ability of the medical profession to
prevent reckless conduct and to control innovation properly. The good
doctor will therefore feel safer in the work that he or she does, and
the bad doctor will more easily be revealed as
negligent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:50:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Bill do that? It will require the formal approval of any proposed
innovation by a hospital’s multi-disciplinary team of doctors,
so not only will the innovation need the fully informed consent of the
patient, but a hospital’s own multi-disciplinary team of doctors
will have to approve it. This is a severe test, more severe than the
two doctors’ authorisation that is required by law in order to
carry out, for example, an abortion under the Abortion Act 1967, or the
two psychiatrists needed to authorise sectioning someone in a mental
health institution under the Mental Health Act 1983. Under those
provisions, the authorisation of two medical professionals is required.
To authorise innovation as I propose, a panel of medical professionals
will need to consent. It is a severe test, but however severe, it is
better than the current position, in which the road ahead to any
innovation in cancer treatment is closed by
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T12:51:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143000211">The

This is a continuation of other Bills that have been introduced over
the past 
<?notus-xml column=988?>three years on the constitution of this country. They all aim at one
thing—giving advantage to the parties in the coalition in the
upcoming general election. Yesterday we saw their attempt to hide from
lobbying groups and not be answerable to them. Now they are trying to
curtail the influence of the trade unions and the support that they

evidence, which I think feeds into amendment 103, because it is
critical to the operation of the entire part, in relation to clause 36.
My second point about the Department’s consultation is that it

established in law already. The facts bear this out, and I will give
some of them to highlight how detailed membership information already
is, as shown by the extensive annual reports published on the
certification officer’s website. First, the certification
officer’s annual report for 2012-13 says that 166 trade unions
submitted returns—not membership lists but
returns—recording a total of 7,197,415 members, a figure that
does not appear to be inaccurate, compared with 7,261,210 in the
previous year: again, a very exact figure. The largest reduction in
membership was in the construction sector, which perhaps says more
about the Government’s policies than trade union
membership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T13:24:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0001.htm#13091143000307">Secondly,
the annual return has to include a copy of the auditor’s report
on the accounts, allowing the certification officer to compare revenue
from dues with the numbers reported. In 2012-13, the last full year for
which returns have been published on the certification officer’s
website, the returns showed that income from members increased by 1.3%
to £873 million. The returns also show that the total number of
contributing members was about 90.5% of the total membership, compared
with 89.4% in the preceding year. There are a number of detailed
reasons why those figures differ, but to go into them would rule me out
of order. As I am trying to demonstrate, the information is already
available in the public domain for anyone to dig into. It is on
the certification officer’s website, transposed from the annual
reports of each of the 166 trade unions that submitted their
returns<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T13:25:37"></hs_TimeCode>. I would
think that any reasonably independent person looking at those publicly
available reports would agree that the Government already have
extensive information-gathering powers on the finances and membership
of trade unions.</hs_Para>

secretary of a trade union, whether it is affiliated to the Labour

membership list if any of it was found to be inaccurate, but the point
is that legislation on the accuracy of membership lists already exists.
It is in the union’s best interests—this has nothing to
do with strike action—to have and maintain accurate membership

people who have a proper complaint about a trade union’s
membership list to make it through the normal channels, and the
certification officer would then determine whether the complaint was
vexatious or had merit before, on top of all that, deciding whether to
instigate a process. If people wish to make legitimate complaints about
a trade union’s membership, this Bill gives them a mechanism to
do so, but our proposal is that they should be able to do so only if
the professionalism of the certification officer proves that that
process it is required. Given that there have been only 10 complaints
since 1987, I think the certification officer is pretty wily in

forget where we were, but I will go back to discussing amendment 103
and consequential amendment 121. Amendment 103 would prevent vexatious
claims. The Lib Dem Minister should think about that carefully. The
principle behind introducing the draconian fee of £1,250 for
people who want to seek justice through an employment tribunal was that
it would prevent vexatious claims. A Bill that deals with trade union
membership lists should therefore deal with the fact that vexatious
claims might be made to the certification officer. The amendment would
resolve that by giving the certification officer the power to consider
whether vexatious claims had been
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T13:48:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000359">Secondly,
the amendment would prevent third parties from submitting unwarranted
queries. Interestingly, third party submissions are mentioned in the
consultation but not in the Bill. I wonder whether the Minister could
address that point when she comes to the Dispatch Box. The amendment
would reduce unnecessary costs for trade unions. The Government parties
tend to forget that any additional costs for trade unions from
draconian legislation—there is no evidence for the Bill and it
does not resolve any identifiable problem—is merely pushed on to
the 7.2 million members, whose membership fees are then increased.. Any
additional costs hit ordinary workers who are already engulfed by the
Government’s cost-of-living
crisis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000360" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000360">The

true that the 7.2 million trade union members will be worse off as a
result of the measure, because the burden of any significant additional
costs on trade unions from duplicate legislation—they already
conform through the Data Protection Act and the Trade Union

therefore ask the Minister to answer a number of questions on this
group of amendments. Has the certification officer asked for the
additional powers? Has the certification officer approached the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills to say that those powers
are necessary, and that he would like the Government to legislate to
ensure they are introduced? Has DBIS consulted the certification
office, trade unions and other relevant organisations on whether the
powers are required and, if so, why? Have there been meetings between
certification office and DBIS officials on the subject at which anyone
described a need for a problem to be resolved? Have the Government
considered the two-out, one-in regulation policy, or demonstrated what
measures will be removed to alleviate the burden of regulation on trade
unions? Lastly, will the Minister give the certification officer
additional resources to deal with the problem? If the answer is yes,
there will also be an onus on trade unions to find additional
resources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000364">Amendment
106, on additional resources, is fairly standard and self-explanatory.
The new bureaucratic process will be costly for trade unions, and those
costs will ultimately be passed on to the trade union membership. At a
time when we should do all we can to encourage a healthy trade union
membership in the UK, we must not put the burden of this ideologically
driven policy on to those hard-working members. Under the amendment, a
charge to cover the costs of production can be levied. There is a

when I look somewhat more charitably at amendment 103, I note that it

because the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is packed
with Liberal Democrat Ministers. Who knows? Perhaps it is the
Government’s more general reluctance to look at legislation
governing unions and industrial relations. In any event, the toothless
nature of the certification officer remains, despite so much having
changed since 1984. For example, on the membership register, in the
mid-1980s membership records were for the most part probably kept on
paper. Official management and database IT systems were not very
developed. E-mail did not exist for everyday use and communications
with members and voting had to be in person or by post. Of course,
postal voting at that time was seen as a novel

votes—union intimidation being rife at the time.</hs_Para>

40% of total union membership. As such, it follows that the larger
unions are becoming increasingly powerful politically and economically,
and with power comes responsibility and the duty to be accountable. We
can make a comparison with companies and the difference between how
private and public companies are regulated. It is therefore right that
union obligations to administrate themselves correctly, such as
membership records, are subject to a suitable level of oversight and
scrutiny, and the clause provides for that. I note that the Labour

point of amendment 103 is to ask the purpose of the clause, and that is
right. If the purpose is to deal with auditing members, perhaps we
should be talking about what constitutes a member and what is to be
audited. Would it include the associated membership that we saw in the
miners compensation scheme, for instance? Should the audit include a
description of their rights as members? Alternatively, do we want to
know accurately the number of members, so that this can be tied to
union political contributions? If so, the Bill might not be as
effective as some people think. That is because trade unions have not
necessarily been affiliating the same number of members as have been
contributing to the political fund. They may affiliate phantom members
in order to get more union votes on Labour party matters. I am unsure
what effect auditing membership numbers would have in that situation,
other than to verify how bizarre Labour’s relationship with the
unions can be. Again, however, a sense of direction for future reform
from the Government would be

support this legislation, because I can see nothing to object to in
principle—it basically just repeats and fortifies what has been
around since the 1980s. I hope that hon. Members do not take what I
have said as anti-union, because I am not anti-union. However, I
strongly believe that union law is way behind the times and desperately
in need of reform. Can anyone really argue that legislation and
procedural regulations passed in the mid 1980s are still adequate now?
Although I disagree with Labour’s amendment 103, I appreciate
its wider implication of showing up the lack of Government purpose and
direction behind these provisions. Given the time the coalition
Government have had to formulate policy on these key issues, which have
a significant impact on the people of this country, we could and should
be doing much better. This is a missed opportunity to reform industrial

hope you will forgive me, Sir Edward, if I digress a little—I
will not take up too much time—but we were told that the reason
for introducing a lobbying Bill was that there was a significant
problem with lobbying in this country. Everyone was talking about the
next scandal being lobbying, but we were in fact talking about, for
example, somebody being paid—a Member of Parliament, say, or
somebody else—to ask questions that are not within the rules. We
were also talking about people who have access to Ministers and are
able to campaign and lobby for private companies—for example,
Lynton Crosby and people like that. What we were talking about was
money changing hands and others not knowing what was happening. That
was what was meant by the scandalous part of lobbying. As a Member of
Parliament, I should not be asking questions in the House or raising
issues because somebody is sponsoring me or giving me money to line
someone else’s pockets, make a company richer or help it to
secure a contract that it should perhaps not

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:15:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) pointed out, who are
members of trade unions and pay their subs. The Bill would mean that
trade unions had to spend more money on trying to comply with the
system. Surely that cannot be right.
Trying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:15:12"></hs_TimeCode> to put
that provision in legislation dealing with lobbying as a whole is
completely wrong. It is unfair. What is the mischief that the
Government are trying to deal with? The mischief is big money and
corporate enterprises, yet this legislation does nothing to address
such lobbying. All it does is impose a financial burden on unions that
rely solely on subs from their members.</hs_Para>

Government are often accused of being out of touch and only looking

message that actually they do care about the ordinary person and are
perturbed that their living standards and wages are going down. The
Prime Minister was not willing to acknowledge those issues at Prime
Minister’s questions. The issue of living conditions was put to
him time and again, and he was asked about the living wage, yet he
refused to answer or to acknowledge the fact that people’s
living standards have gone down. We are talking about the same people

McPartland:</Member></B> Some Members have been teasing the
Conservative party about its refusal to publish its membership figures.
Clause 36 clearly states that unions with fewer than 10,000 members can
self-certify. However, a Conservative party association with more than
a certain amount of money will have to send its information to the
Electoral Commission. That information will include membership numbers,
but if they are below a certain level, there will be no need to send
it. This part of the Bill therefore contains very similar provisions to
those that are already in place for members of political parties, as
well as trade
unions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/8D54EF84B158C0B285B1B0B3DE614728264B2D6C" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 September 2013">Wednesday

Clause 36 comes on top of a whole range of other pieces of trade union

by employers trying to get injunctions to stop strike action. Often,
when those cases come before a full court, the employers are
unsuccessful, even though they might have been successful in getting
the strike stopped at the initial stage. Does the hon. Gentleman think
that this clause has been designed to create yet another hurdle for the

introduces a duty to provide a membership audit certificate. I
genuinely cannot imagine that many of the unions will be bothered by
it. The reality is that they all want to know where their members are
so that they can communicate with them. Most unions do not send letters
out to their members simply asking them to take strike action. They
also want to sell them services and to make the union a part of their

councils around the country have to confront a number of issues with
vexatious claims and are currently struggling under the freedom of
information rules introduced by the previous Government. It may well be
an issue that needs to be looked at further. It is a law of unintended

most small workplace environments, a large proportion of the employees

emotional struggle for them; I saw that a lot when I was growing up in
Liverpool. If a person is being called out on strike by union members
in the area but does not want to strike, I think it is perfectly
acceptable for such an employee who is not a union member to be
expected not to cross the picket line. However, it is perfectly
acceptable for them to question whether the ballot was accurate. There
is personal and social pressure put on people and it is
understandable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000441" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000441"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Anderson" PimsId="4738" UID="13091143001780" xid="807" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143001780">Mr

the Member for Huntingdon said that the purpose of the legislation is
to take things back to the 1980s so that that exists as the status quo
now. I am not particularly interested in the ideological arguments
going back and forth across the Committee. I genuinely believe that the
purpose of clause 36 is to help people who feel that they want to make
a complaint but cannot. I heard the shadow Minister talk earlier from
the Dispatch Box about the possibility of a charge of £1 or
£2 being exercised in respect of clause 36. I imagine that most
trade unions would hate that because it would probably cost more to
administer the charge than it would to send off the
certificate.</hs_Para>

The biggest challenge those unions face—it is perhaps a reason
why the Bill might help them focus more resources on the
issue—is simply the fact that people move home. It is not a
matter of losing members of the trade union movement; it is simply a
matter of trade unionists moving house between different areas. That
creates a massive turnover. We all have experience of moving house and
know we have to pay the Royal Mail a fee to redirect our mail for a
year. Moving home is a big issue; it is one of the key problems

its confused content and its incompetent and chaotic handling, this

I led the opposition to that Bill. It was a Bill without allies and
with a remarkable range of critics that saw Lord Tebbit and the trade
unions finding common ground. The Leader of House, when he was Health
Secretary, was forced to pause, review and reflect upon that Bill. The

deal specifically with clause 36 and the amendments. My hon. Friend the

Constitutional Reform Committee, told us that his Committee had

had been no mention of part 3 or of trade unions. He said
that, according to his calculations, this part of the
Bill—including clause 36—had been published the day
before the summer recess, eight working days before we were required to
consider it in Committee today, and he rightly pointed out that the

the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray) asked what was the problem
with which clause 36, and part 3 as a whole, had been designed to deal.
Even the hon. Member for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly) rightly asked the
same question, albeit in different terms. He asked what intention was
behind the provisions in clause 36. Our debate so far has clearly shown
that there is no evidence of a problem, that there is no public call
for these changes, and that there is no principled case for them. We
can only conclude that the intention, or the purpose, of the
clause is to tighten the legislative leash on trade unions and their
ability to take proper, lawful industrial
action.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/D2F25D618A77582A14FB3981CFCDAC4FFB53E387" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 September 2013">Wednesday

must inform Ministers that last year industrial action was at an almost
record low. The level was very low throughout the 13 Labour years, but
last year it was only a quarter of the level that it was in 1996, the
last year of the last Tory Government. In other words, four times more
days were lost through industrial action in 1996 than was the case last
year. Wide-scale industrial action is not a problem in this country,
and for that reason any case that might honestly be built and presented

member of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, the hon.
Gentleman will be aware that the steps, linked to the clause, that any
union needs to take before contemplating industrial action are already
highly complex. They are legally specified, and they set a number of
very high hurdles for any group of trade union members who wish to
consider industrial action. As for his general point, it is often the
determination of union members to take industrial action if necessary,
and as a last resort, that causes employers to see sense, negotiate
properly and, in many cases, solve the problems at
hand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000472" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000472">Let
me sum up the position. The number of days lost to strike action is at
a near all-time low. Industrial action is always a last resort. The
series of legislative steps that any group of trade union members must
take before engaging in lawful industrial action are already highly
complex, lengthy and tightly specified in law, but clause 36 will make
that specification much tighter, and will make it much more difficult
for unions to take such action. As my hon. Friend the Member for North
Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark) pointed out, there is no legal right to
strike in this country, and any industrial action lays a trade union
open to being sued for inducing and encouraging members to breach their
employment contracts. It is only the immunity from being sued, which
comes from following all the steps specified in existing legislation,
that will be made more difficult by the provisions in clause
36.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000473" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000473">Too
often in recent years, employers—not just large employers such
as Balfour Beatty, Serco and London Midland—instead of dealing
with the grievance at hand, and instead of consulting, negotiating and
discussing the problems that they face with their own employees and
dealing with the dispute, have looked for legal ground to try to
prevent any industrial action through the law courts. The duty in
clause 36 to provide the membership audits and certificates, and the
potential investigations on the back of any complaints under the
auspices of the certification officer, are likely to make it much
easier for employers to find legal grounds and to take legal action to
prevent union members from taking proper, legitimate industrial action.
Clause 36 will create a mountain of data and paperwork which will be at
the fingertips of employers well in advance of any particular risk of
industrial action or
dispute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000474" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000474"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:49:31"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Yasmin Qureshi" PimsId="5523" UID="13091143001800" xid="1016" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143001800"><B>Yasmin

know that the trade unions supply membership lists to ACAS, especially

found out that the reluctance to hand over accurate lists comes from
the employers; they have refused to supply ACAS with lists of their
employees to match things up with the trade unions so that they could
verify that they indeed had the membership numbers to trigger a ballot.
Trade unions have never held back their membership lists; they are
happy to give them over, but only if they have privacy for their
members and the assurance that the lists will not be handed over. ACAS,
of course, gives them that assurance.</hs_Para>

the Member for Inverclyde (Mr McKenzie) and others have asked, what
mischief does this part of the Bill seek to address? I really tried to
find out what the Government’s thinking is, so I looked at what
they said in the consultation paper, which was published in July. The
first reason they put forward for this move was as
follows:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13091143001430" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143001430">“As

that is the case, does it mean that we are now going to legislate in
respect of all membership organisations? Sir Edward, you are a
member of the Roman Catholic Church and if we are going to do that, we
might well introduce legislation to see whether the Catholic Church is

the greatest respect, so too does the activity of the Roman Catholic
Church, the CBI and the Institute of Directors. So why are we focusing
on this particular membership organisation? As has been said, the
reason is that this legislation is really about trying to impede the
operations of the trade unions in this country. Government Members
might argue that this measure has minimum cost and minimum imposition
of roles and responsibilities on trade unions. The impact study makes
an assessment that there will be only 6p of additional cost, although
that is still 6p. However, it also says, straightforwardly, that the
risks are that this will displace core trade union work. It will do
that; trade unions will have to devote their time and energies to this
and it will therefore displace their core trade union work of
representing their members. So it is about impeding the real role of

have seen the operation of challenges to membership lists in respect of
industrial relations and, in particular, of industrial action being

used the existing legislation and interpreted it so that any minor
discrepancy about a membership list is used in a rush to court to seek
an injunction to prevent industrial action from taking place. Some
examples have been given, but I have been involved in a number of
activities associated with trade unions where even though there has
been a 99% overwhelming decision in favour of industrial action, one or
two members out of thousands have been missed off the ballot and so an
injunction has been awarded. Therefore, the industrial action, along
with the will of the members, has been prevented from being
implemented. We tried to overcome that through legislation in this
House—I tried to put such legislation through on three
occasions, but it got talked out every time—but we have just
overcome it in the courts. We have received a decision in the
courts that enables minor infringements not to be taken into account

the Bill opens up a whole new vista of potential legal challenges. As
colleagues have said, it relates not only to industrial action,
industrial activity, ballots and so on; it could relate to the whole
operation of the union. Employers could trawl over membership lists, go
off to the certification officer and then we could get to court, where
the challenge will be about how the union operates overall. So lawyers
will be able to tie up trade unions in legal actions for years to come,
preventing them from undertaking what the impact study calls their

ask Government Members: what is the motivation for this measure? Some
of that has leaked out. They have listened to what has happened in
recent months—the anger there is among working people about the
cuts to their wages, the zero-hour contracts and the undermining of
employment rights. People are beginning to react. They do not usually
react at the depths of a recession, doing so when they are coming out
of one and when their living standards of some are rising. So we are
talking about a recovery for the rich but a recession for the rest.
That is when people get angry and when industrial action takes
place—that is when strikes happen. It is also when trade unions
need to be representing their members. So I think this measure is part
and parcel of the Government preparing for the potential for industrial
activity over this coming period. It is another mechanism by which they
will do everything they possibly can to undermine the rights of trade
unions and their ability to operate effectively in representing their
members. It is so short term, because all it will do is anger people
even more and as these impediments 
<?notus-xml column=1025?>build up, although they are relatively minor at first, people will
become more angry. Then, we will have wildcat action—action that
is uncontrolled—because people are so furious at how they are
being treated by their employers in collusion with the

me make one final point, because I want to understand. If the argument

Directors and all the other trade associations? They are membership
organisations and they have as much of an effect on the daily lives of
our population as trade unions, yet they remain completely unregulated.

regulate civil society generally. That is what the clause does: it is a
step along the path of regulation of wider civil society organisations.
What else? The Countryside Alliance? We might be up for that, just to
see where the money comes from, but there are a range of organisations
whose rights, privileges and privacy we want to be respected for
reasons of basic civil liberties. Why are trade unions being singled
out in this manner? The Bill is being targeted and comes at a time when
the Government are predicting that they will be faced with trade
unionists who are very angry about not being able to share in what is
supposed to be an economic recovery. It is about the exercise of trade

hon. Friend the Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy
Clark) mentioned the legality of the Government’s legislation.
Let me be clear that our Governments have been condemned by the
International Labour Organisation and other international organisations
for two decades now because of their trade union legislation. It is not
just about the right to strike; it is about certain basic and
fundamental trade union rights. The clause, yet again, imposes further
duties that I believe to be completely contrary to ILO conventions. Yet
again, this country will be isolated in the world and 
<?notus-xml column=1026?>condemned for its attack on trade union rights,
which are incorporated in all those international statutes and
conventions as a basic human right.</hs_Para>

legislation—which we do not support—to go forward, they

there needs to be further action, fair enough. That is not the case at

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:14:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) just made. He made
some strong points—this is about the evisceration of the

have a series of questions on this clause that I would like the
Minister to deal with. My first question has been asked before, but it
is specific. What specific complaints about union record keeping have
been made and by whom over the last, say, three years? Secondly, as an
addendum to that, what evidence is there that unions are not keeping
accurate records? As we have heard before, under the 1992 legislation
there is already a duty on trade unions to keep their records up to
date. What has changed since then? What enormous problems are
associated with trade union record keeping that have led the Government
to their current position and to change things in such a radical
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:15:41"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

what assessment has been made of the impact on the privacy of trade
union members? I have many constituents, as I am sure we all have, who
are members of trade unions but whose employers do not know that. I
have had many conversations with constituents over the past three years
in which I have said to them that they do not need to inform their
employer that they are a member of a trade union and can keep it secret
if they are worried about future problems at work. Does the Minister
think that the increased access to trade union records and activities
will give people in that position any great confidence that their
details will remain private, or should they start to worry that all
sorts of people, potentially including their employers, might get
access to those records and perhaps start to use them against them?
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:16:45"></hs_TimeCode>The change in
the nature of work means that that is an important element of how trade
unions and the world of work operate. The days when we had great
concentrations of employers, all of whom were often union members, are
gone. These days, we often have smaller work forces and only a handful
might be trade union members. That group of people might not want their
details to be exposed to public

for Stevenage (Stephen McPartland), large general unions, particularly
Unite and the GMB, can easily lose 12% of their membership,
particularly at a time such as this. Their membership tends to stand
still because they can recruit another 12% in the same sectors to take
the place of those members who have been lost because of jobs being
lost, factory closures and so on, but just to stand still they have to
recruit 12%. The level of churn means that it is difficult to keep
records up to date, no matter how many resources are devoted to record
keeping. Of course, up-to-date records are dependent on members
informing the union that they have moved house, for instance, or
changed occupation. That does not always
happen.</hs_Para>

Cryer:</Member></B> I completely agree with my hon. Friend. There is
also the situation involving payroll companies. If such a company
offers to take over all an employer’s payroll responsibilities,
the duties to pay pensions, national insurance and sick pay are
divested to that payroll company, meaning that that semi-detached
element in the workplace is responsible for maintaining many records,
which makes keeping everything up to date even more complicated and
difficult. Another aspect is the casualisation of the workplace,
because there are some sectors of the economy in which full-time
permanent employment is almost being abolished. Again, that situation
will make it more difficult to comply with the Bill’s

putting as many obstacles as possible in the way of trade unions
carrying out their normal and reasonable functions, as is apparent from
part 3 of the Bill. The points that hon. Members have made about this

1993, when the unions were approaching the 10-year ballot for their
political fund, I was appointed by a group of trade unions—more
than 30 of them—to run the campaign, along with a colleague,
Derek Gladwin, who became Lord Gladwin. Sadly, he is now dead. We ran
that operation, balloting more than 6 million trade unionists. I did it

is difficult to answer the question why the Bill is necessary. The
first legislation was in 1871. That legalised trade unionism, and it
gave unions the option to register as trade unions. The vast majority
of the major unions eventually did so. It is interesting that the term
“trade union” in those days included employers
associations. Somewhere or other that has been lost in all the
processes and all the amendments made to the legislation over the
years, culminating in the consolidation of trade union and employment
law in the 1992 Act, which was referred to
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:30:29"></hs_TimeCode>earlier.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000541">It
is interesting to look at certification officers and how they have seen
their role. As I mentioned in an intervention, I organised a conference
some years ago at which the certification officer of the time spoke
about his functions. As he saw it, his function was to deal with
complaints made by members that a trade union had failed to maintain an
accurate register of members, and to see that trade unions kept proper
accounting records, had their accounts properly audited, and submitted
annual returns for the investigation of the financial affairs of trade
unions and for ensuring that the statutory requirements concerning the
actuarial examination of members’ superannuation schemes were
observed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:31:14"></hs_TimeCode>. I have
not had the time to check the detailed provisions of the 1992 Act, but
it seems to me that it encapsulates everything that the Government want
to do, and that that is within the existing powers of the certification
officer and the system.</hs_Para>

have a major problem in this country, and it is a problem for
all the political parties. I believe it is a serious problem and that
the country pays a high price for it. For some of our near neighbours,
the Germans and the Nordic countries, there are certain areas where all
the parties agree, and they are all social and community areas,
including rights at work and the operation of trade unions. We have a
system where one Government come in and want to rip up everything that
has gone before—not just in respect of trade unions, but in many
other areas—then another Government come in and do the same in
their

was a Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Employment Minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry in 1997 when we came into power. Trade
union issues were seriously discussed in the DTI and round the Cabinet
table at that time, because we did not want just to take a lurch back.
Matters were discussed seriously with the trade unions in advance and
they knew what was coming.</hs_Para>

right to ballot, that right would not be removed. That was
sacrosanct—a red line.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>, it was
decided that we needed to review trade union laws and to do so
comprehensively. There was no point in putting only our side of the
case and banging ahead with the sort of stuff that we are seeing
now—Beecroft, as has been mentioned, the constant erosion of
workers’ rights and constant efforts to undermine trade unions. 
<?notus-xml column=1031?>We decided to call in the TUC and the CBI and to ask the director
general of the CBI and the general secretary of the TUC, Adair Turner
and John Monks, to go away and look at all the issues that needed to be
considered. They were asked to come back and tell us what they agreed
on, what they disagreed on but could negotiate, and what they
positively disagreed on. I remember sitting in the Secretary
of State’s office when Adair Turner and John Monks made their
report after months of consideration. We were all staggered by what
they had done, because the CBI and the TUC had agreed on much more than
we ever imagined. We set a programme based on the facts, the evidence
and the thorough inquiry by the people who are the experts in this
game—not the politicians, but business and the representatives

trying to be polite to the Government. I must say that I have not had
any contact with the certification officer for some time, but I know
from the years when I did have contact that there were
problems—it would be unfair to say that there were not. When I
was in the job, a number of trade unions were very unhappy with the
changes that had been made in 1984 and were not complying. I know from
my contact with the trade unions that that is all resolved, and the
record speaks for itself. The certification officer does a job that is
required of him. Some people might think that he requires too much of
the trade unions, but the fact of the matter is that they have accepted

decision on the legislation that was to proceed was taken under the
process I have mentioned, and everything agreed between the CBI and the

industrial action. We looked at a whole range of 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>areas. One key area was the problem of recognition disputes, when unions
had built up a membership in a company and wanted recognition. Many
such disputes ended up in the courts and in difficult strikes. We
wanted to take the heat out of all areas of conflict. All of that was
implemented in the Employment Relations Act 1999. The evidence was a

strikes—my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:38:25"></hs_TimeCode>

the Conservative years, and the previous Labour years, to be honest,
the level of strikes was far too high. That legislation and that
process brought that to an end, and at the time both sides were happy.
Even before that legislation was implemented to set in place a process
for dealing with recognition disputes, and the effort was to take them
out of the courts and minimise conflict, over 1,000 new recognition

of the major problems with this Government is that they have a
one-sided approach that demonises trade unions and in every way
possible places barriers in the way of the trade union movement. There
is no realisation of what happens on the ground. Most trade unions are
there not to carry out strikes or disrupt the employer, but to protect
their members. As part of the process I mentioned, we did a lot of
balloting and held focus groups to find out why members signed up to
unions. The important thing for most of them was the insurance policy
that they got—the fact that the union would support them if
there was an argument with their employer, and in particular would pay
for the lawyers in an unfair dismissal case, for example. That
is what members bought
into.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0002.htm#13091143000554">One
of my concerns about the Government’s approach is that the

difficulty is the churn rate. My hon. Friend said that it was 10% or
15%, but the churn rate for the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied
Workers, or USDAW, for example, is 25% or sometimes 30%. Every year it
has to replace 25% of its membership. A lot of members go on to other
jobs. They pay their union dues by direct debit and think they do not
need to bother to tell the union that they have changed workplace,
because they are still working in the same business and paying their
union dues. That is difficult for unions. There are lots of practical
issues such as that.</hs_Para>

massive skill shortage in the North sea. Wages are being ramped
up—not a problem in the rest of the country, I
know—because people are being enticed to other companies, but
still working in the same business, travelling on the same unsafe

It is incredibly important to put these issues into context. Over

to pay many millions of pounds to lawyers in defending those membership

to all the logistical problems, many employers, not just those in the
North sea industry—I think this also applies to virtually every
shipping company based in Britain—now offshore their workers so
that employers national insurance contributions do not have to be paid.
The Chancellor has decided that that situation should change, but I am
not sure whether he has yet introduced the necessary regulations or
legislation. When the employers are not paying national insurance and
the workers are moving from system to system, it is very difficult for
the trade union to make

difficult for the unions when they have major problems trying to
contact their members on the North sea—even when they know they

Labour Government did not recognise the problem, because it was easy to
resolve. If the Minister is seriously worried about it, he could easily
implement an obligation on employers to give information to trade
unions about their current work force which would be virtually
cost-free. It would not place a huge responsibility on employers to ask
them to provide that information so that everybody can be sure that
there is accuracy, particularly as regards any industrial ballots that
may take place. There would be much more good will if the Government

to the legislation initially, they accepted the change in the law. They
accepted that the TULR regulations had to be adhered to, and they have
done so—reluctantly, although now it is not too much of a
problem. In fact, in many ways it helps trade unions to keep people
pressed to ensure that they have up-to-date names and addresses for all
members. The trade unions were not receptive at the time; they are
happy now. Indeed, I have not spoken to any union or union
representative, or even any union member or non-union member—not
one person—who has told me that we need more legislation on
union names and addresses in the register. Although the unions were not
happy about the 1992 Act initially, it has been acted upon and
delivered. There are not many complaints, as we have heard, to the
certification officer because of problems with the names and addresses
in the register or the legislation, so everything seems to be in order.

Lavery:</Member></B> Speaking from vast experience, it is always in a
trade union’s interest to maintain the best possible record of
its members, for a whole raft of reasons. A good trade union does not
stand on its hind legs every week screaming, “Strike, strike,
strike!” A good trade union needs the correct names and
addresses of its members, so that it can address all the problems that
society currently faces. This is not just about strike action, which
was mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:17:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly). That is always a last resort. But I will
tell you something, Mr Sheridan. I was on strike for a full year during
the miners’ strike, and what a brilliant year it was! I was
fighting not for myself but for the wider society, for jobs and for
communities up and down the country. It gives people a lot of pleasure
if they are taking action and suffering greatly for those reasons. My
father and my four brothers were all on strike—my mother had a
hell of a job—but we enjoyed it because we were fighting for
others. That is what the trade union movement is about, and that is why
I get terribly upset by the constant union-baiting from the Liberal
Democrats and of course the Tories.</hs_Para>

is in everyone’s interest to keep accurate records. Under the
measures that were introduced in 1992, trade unions have to have that
information for balloting reasons, among others. They normally have to
send a full membership list with the annual return form, the AR21, to
the certification officer anyway. The problem was that whenever we
tried to take any type of democratic industrial action, the employer
would say to me as the local representative, “You’d
better have the right names and addresses. If you haven’t,
we’ll get an injunction. Then, under the law, the union will be
liable for any loss to the company resulting from strike
action.” At the same time, the employer obviously had a list of
everybody’s 
<?notus-xml column=1041?>names and addresses. A responsible employer has
everyone’s name and address in order to pay them—some
trade unionists might prefer to keep their identity private—so
surely it should be incumbent on the employer to allow any change in
name and address to be passed on to the relevant trade union so that
the union can act in accordance with the law. Is that too much to ask?
It is feasible, but it is a
trap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:20:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000622" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0003.htm#13091143000622">I
was a representative at different levels of the union, and we would
sometimes appear in front of the certification officer and often the
High Court. If industrial action occurs, it might be said that
somebody’s name has been spelt incorrectly or that somebody has
died without people being aware of it in order to try to get that whole
democratic process abolished. That is the problem with this
legislation.</hs_Para>

Unfortunately, this coalition, with Liberal Democrat support, will

the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna), who has highlighted another issue
relating to another problem with these lists. They will allow
organisations to increase blacklisting, which is already the scourge of

blacklists. At the end of the day, these people and their families can

is a problem with the data. The new rules will mean that three new
groups will have access to individual membership details—three
new opportunities for data to escape into the public domain. Several
organisations have raised a concern—I have already mentioned
it—about the legality of that. The trade union movement and its
individual organisations have a duty under the Data Protection Act to
ensure that the information they hold on individual members is kept
secure, but this new legislation when passed—not
“if”, because it will be passed—will prevent that
from happening. There will be a legal contradiction about who is right
and it will be up for legal challenge.</hs_Para>

in any other country, action such as this on the part of a

and paused, as they have in the past. It is time that they consulted
others, got the legal position right, and then returned with reforms

There is a thread running through this debate. It is not about the

to tip the balance of power in favour of the coalition parties at the
2015 general election. It is a deliberate ploy, and people can see
through it and see it for what it is. The Government want to put this
Bill in place quickly so that from 8 May next year there will be a year
when trade unions and civic society are banned from speaking, because
the Government want to try to make people forget the mess they have got
this country into and the things they have done such as introducing
tuition fees and the bedroom tax, and not responding positively to the
Robin Hood tax campaign. They want a vacuum in that year so no one can

demand of us and that they will want to demand of us coming up to an

am clear that the reason why the Government will not pause and reflect
is because they want to ram this measure through. There is a timetable
involved. The Conservative party has decided that 7 May 2015 will be
the date of the next general election, so 8 May 2014 is the day when
campaigning stops, when criticism stops, when the charities have to
shut up and when the trade unions have to watch what they are doing. We
will get through the process of the Bill going to the Lords and coming
back here just before Christmas. It will then be banged on the head and
the Queen will put the stamp on it before 8 May 2014, so that
Government Members can try to hide from their liability for the state
they have got this country into. It is not on. This measure is not
needed and it should be withdrawn. I will be supporting the very
moderate amendments that have been tabled by Labour’s
Front-Bench team, but it must be said that we are being led by the
coalition, which is doing this for no other reason than self-interest,
just as was the case on other constitutional matters. They are trying
it on in this way and if the measure gets through it will be a disgrace
for democracy in this
country.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/22768E250B913E02F825A2BFF5A9F18A45D2627D" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 September 2013">Wednesday

are already required to keep an accurate and up-to-date list of their

how that is an important requirement and how it is in the interests of
members. Many unions serve a large and diverse membership across
different employers, job types and regions, and of course we all know
that unions can take action that may have widespread consequences
beyond the immediate members of the organisations. That is why it is
reasonable that the Government should examine the formal requirements
for the unions’ responsibility to keep their membership records
accurate and up to date and that unions should be able visibly to
demonstrate that they know who their members are and that they can
communicate with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000665" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0003.htm#13091143000665"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:41:34"></hs_TimeCode>Of
course, accurate membership records are essential to ensuring proper
democratic representation and, of course, they are important for
administrative efficiency, particularly when a postal vote is
necessary. Good membership records make that process much easier. Of
course, members need to be confident that the activity their union
undertakes is representative of the view and wishes of its members
generally. For example, if there has been a low turnout in a postal
ballot on general executive positions, members should be confident that
that is because some people are choosing not to vote and not because
they have in some way been disfranchised. As union activity can also
affect everybody’s daily lives, it is important that the general
public can have confidence that the unions’ actions are also
based on a representative view of their members.</hs_Para>

recognise that there is already significant regulation in place. That

I take further interventions, let me mention the impact assessment. A
full impact assessment was published, submitted to the Regulatory

informed by evidence collected during targeted consultation over the
summer. I apologise to the Committee that that was not placed in the
Vote Office when it should have 
<?notus-xml column=1048?>been, due to an oversight. It should have been there last week, of
course. The situation has been rectified—that was done shortly
after the issue was raised in the House. For the benefit of the
Committee, let me cite the impact assessment. Using the best estimate
figures that have been put together, the assessment identifies that the

certificates across all 166 unions will be £461,225—less

Swinson:</Member></B> I hope that I can give the hon. Gentleman some
reassurance. It is not a question of every single membership entry
having to be audited; it is about the process the union has in place
for doing so. The certificate needs to be provided to give assurance on
that. He also said—a few Members mentioned this—that the
proposed powers somehow exist already, but they are actually very
narrowly drawn. The certification officer’s power to investigate
a complaint by an individual member applies only to that
individual’s membership record; it does not extend to other
members in the organisation. Indeed, it does not give those who might
not be a member of a trade union the ability to complain. Of course, a
member might not know that there is a problem with their records.
Indeed, if they are not receiving information from the union, they
might not know when there is a ballot for a committee, for
example.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000704" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0003.htm#13091143000704">I
will turn now to the specific amendments and respond to some of the
points that have been raised. Amendment 103 would remove the annual
duty to provide a membership audit certificate. Instead, the
certificate would need to be submitted only if a complaint were
received by the certification officer and he thought that it was
necessary. Amendment 121 would go along with amendment 103 by removing
the duty to appoint an assurer. I do not think that the amendments are
useful, because they stop the key policy objective. I agree 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>that there is clearly a difference of opinion between both sides of the
Committee on the reasonableness of the measure, but that is why the
Government do not support the amendments. The current arrangements just
do not give that assurance, because they rely on members proactively
checking the register. Even if they do check the register, they cannot
see all of it and they do not know whether other names and addresses
are up to date; and nor would they know who should and should not be on
the register.</hs_Para>

104 would allow for delaying the submission of a membership audit
certificate if the union were appealing. I absolutely understand that
unions do not want an assurer to send mistakenly or maliciously a
qualified certificate to the certification officer without their
knowing about it, but I believe that the amendment is unnecessary and
hope to give some reassurance why.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:55:18"></hs_TimeCode> current
drafting states that the assurer will send the copy of the membership
audit certificate to the certification officer only after it is
provided to the union, which means that the union will already have
seen the certificate and had that opportunity to talk with the assurer.
Of course, it is worth noting that it is the union that will appoint
the assurer, and it has every ability within the agreement it makes in
appointing an assurer to say that it would like the opportunity to see
the certificate and comment before it is sent

McDonnell:</Member></B> I think that most of us are still mystified
about the objectives of the clause, so I will put one scenario to the
Minister to test its purpose. The clause will enable someone who is not
a trade union member—a member of the Conservative party, for
example—to contest the membership list. This is about
communications between the union and its members, so if the union in
the run up to the next general election, say, sends out a letter to its
members urging them to vote for the Labour party, the Conservative
party member, who is not a member of a trade union, could contest the
accuracy of the membership list and, in that way, undermine the trade
union’s ability to communicate with its members. That is
possible under this legislation, and it betrays its

with other membership organisations were raised by various Members. As
I outlined to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T17:04:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Ayrshire and Arran, charities are regulated by the Charity
Commission, which has widespread powers that focus on financial
management because of the importance of donors and beneficiaries. The
commission can carry out regular supervision and monitoring, including
compliance visits. If a charity is under investigation, the commission
can freeze assets and suspend or remove trustees. In the case of
companies, the Companies Act provides the regulatory powers. The
information has to include names and addresses and dates of membership,
and fines and penalties are in place for non-compliance with these
duties. The IOD and the CBI are lobbying organisations incorporated by
royal charter, which means that the Privy Council is responsible for
significant aspects of their internal control. I doubt that unions
would think that those regulatory frameworks were appropriate to their
unique status.

but let me put on record that this is yet another case of a Liberal
Democrat doing the Tories’ dirty work for them in this Chamber:
again, that has been left to her. We are over four hours into this
debate and we have yet to hear one bit of evidence for clause 36 being
necessary or what problem it is trying to remedy. The Minister has said
absolutely nothing about that. The TUC, the certification officer, ACAS
and BIS officials are still to produce any evidence at all about the
problem in the system that this clause is trying to
remedy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T17:08:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091143000732" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0003.htm#13091143000732">Before
we test the will of the Committee on amendment 103, let me point out
that Labour Members are saying clearly that if there is a problem, the
Government should bring forward the evidence. The amendment would say
to the certification officer that if a complaint is made by any third
party and he decides that it is verifiable, he can then take the power,
if he so wishes, to instigate action under the clause. That is a very
modest change to a very draconian part of this ramshackle
Bill.</hs_Para>

107, 116, 117, 119 and 120 address the concerns of trade unions, the
Political and Constitutional Reform Committee, lawyers, trade unionists
and organisations such as Liberty, which believe that clause
37 could result in the improper use of sensitive material and
accidental disclosure. It also raises questions, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) mentioned in his contribution on the
previous group of amendments, about international law,
specifically articles 8 and 11 of the European convention on human
rights.</hs_Para>

107 and 119 place a legal duty and obligation to provide total
confidentiality and an express statutory duty of that confidentiality
for the assurer, in addition to the oblique references already in
proposed section 24ZF. The assurer should therefore have a statutory
duty of confidentiality to the union and, more importantly, the
union’s membership. The amendments also ensure that the assurer
agrees not to engage in conduct likely to lead to a breach of a
union’s obligations under the Data Protection Act

should be noted that union membership is in the significant category of
sensitive personal data. It is not known how far the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills has consulted the Information
Commissioner’s office on the Bill. There is a significant risk
that the union might be held accountable for breaches by the assurer.
Will the Minister address what discussions she has had with the
Information Commissioner’s office on the new assurer position,
and what its thoughts were on the ability of trade unions to both
comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 and be responsible as the data
holder to an assurer who, by nature of the definition of the Bill, is
independent from that data controller in terms of the trade union? The
1998 Act is clear and it may be worth considering this issue in detail,
Mr Sheridan. When one overlays the Data Protection Act with the Trade
Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992, we can see how
unnecessary the proposed changes

data protection law and the European convention on human rights. That

As we have said, trade union membership falls under “sensitive
personal data”, which means personal data consisting of
information about many aspects of a person, including—these are
the important aspects for this Bill—their political opinions and
whether they are a member of a trade union, within 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>the meaning of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act
1992. The presumption is that because information about such matters
could be used in a discriminatory fashion and is likely to be of a
private nature, it needs to be treated with greater care than other
personal data. The nature of those data is also a factor in deciding
what security is appropriate in securing them. That is the purpose of

Murray:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an incredibly good point. One
of the key aspects of the Trade Union and Labour Relations
(Consolidation) Act 1992 is to ensure that trade unions’
membership lists are up to date. The current categories are set out in
sections 24(1) and (2) of the 1992
Act—my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T17:31:33"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery) spoke about them a few
hours ago—which contain provisions to ensure that anyone unhappy
with their personal data being held by the trade union can apply to the
certification officer for a ruling on whether those data should be
held. There are therefore already strict rules about the data, which is
right, given, say, blacklisting and whether data on trade union
membership become an issue.</hs_Para>

purpose of amendments 116 and 117 is to restrict data collection in a
trade union to collection from the data controller only. The data
controller can subsequently obtain the required information from
individual branches or sections, as mentioned in the Bill, but the
responsibility for that must come from the data controller of the
union, who has the legal obligations both under the Data
Protection Act and their responsibilities to the Information
Commissioner. Inquiries to other centres makes the job of the data
controller near impossible. Trade unions manage their membership data
carefully; that should be explicitly maintained in the Bill.</hs_Para>

being blacklisted for being members of a trade union. That
is the reasoning behind amendment 120, which would restrict
disclosure of a member’s data to where the member had
consented—that is, given explicit consent under the Data
Protection Act—and the investigation of criminal proceedings.
The list of other such circumstances set out in clause 37 is unhelpful
in dealing with people’s data protection concerns and the
blacklisting issues that might arise. Proposed new section 24ZG(3) of
the 1992 Act, as set out in clause 37, is too widely drafted and
creates other legal responsibilities that the data controller might not

against such activities. May I respectfully suggest to the Minister
that, rather than increasing the regulation of trade unions through

No, the RAC would not be covered by part 3, which deals

will not even tell us how many members it has, despite the fact that it
could well be argued that it has a major vested interest in public
opinion and how the laws of this country are determined. Should not the
Conservative party therefore be obliged to tell us how many members it
has and whether or not its membership lists are accurate? That seems to
be falling on deaf ears with the Government. I pressed Members

Friend the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) when we

with the assurer and certification officer, rather than getting on with

my hon. Friend was present during the last debate, but I can tell him
that the certification officer figures are pretty stark. There have
been 10 determinations since 1987, none in the last eight years and six
between 2000 and 2004, of which five were dismissed and the sixth did
not even constitute a formal determination. A new, erroneous part of
the Bill could easily cause a certification officer to be dragged into
a position that affected his neutrality—which, incidentally,
trade unions and their members respect. Unions and certification
officers work closely together, and certification officers are always
keen to make the point that they are not opposed to each other, but
share the aim of ensuring that unions operate correctly and within the

a complaint to the certification officer resulting in an in-depth
investigation at great cost to both the public purse and the trade

for that process to operate correctly the employers also have a
duty of responsibility to the trade union membership audit
certification process. Amendment 115 would give the assurer
the right to access reasonable information from employers if it was
determined that that information would be necessary for the performance
of the assurer in determining the accuracy of a membership list. It
would also allow for access to data that may satisfy the assurer that
the trade union has taken all reasonable steps in compiling the
membership register. Many unions have indicated that a lack of
information from employers provided in an efficient manner is the main
cause of the vast majority of inaccuracies in their membership lists.
Giving the assurer the powers to make reasonable requests to employers
for information means that there can be confidence that membership
registers are indeed accurate. If anything comes out of this process

Lavery:</Member></B> Like most people in the Chamber, I am unaware of
why we need assurers. The certification officer, under the trade union
and labour relations—TULR—regulations, clearly states
that when a trade union submits its annual accounts, its AR21, it must
also submit a copy of the names and addresses of the membership. I am
puzzled—discombobulated, perhaps—by the fact that the
Government are suggesting that we need somebody in the middle to ensure
that that
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T18:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>, because
if a union does not submit its membership with its AR21, it is
in big trouble with the certification
officer.</hs_Para>

might be corrected on this, but—perhaps because he has not been
consulted—the certification officer’s website does not
refer to whether many trade unions are submitting their accounts under
the AR21 without submitting the names and addresses. Why on
earth—please, somebody tell me why—are we now looking to
operate with someone called an assurer? I am assured already, Mr
Sheridan. I worked in the trade union movement and greatly disliked all
the regulations heaped on the unions by the Conservative Government,
but, as with everything else, we had to forge ahead. We adhered to the
law.</hs_Para>

decide what they want in that union’s rules. It should not be
for Government diktat to insist what an independent trade union should
and should not have in its rulebook—surely that is undemocratic.
Under the democratic process, what should and should not be in a
union’s rulebook is decided at conferences following discussions
among delegates from the regions, not by the coalition Government. My
hon. Friend raises an interesting point because if the Bill is passed,

discussed earlier. There is a legal contradiction in relation to the
trade union’s obligations under the TULR regulations to adhere
to the Data Protection Act, which protects members’ private and
personal details from being released. The new legislation gives powers
to the likes of the assurer. Who knows who these assurers will be and
what they could do with that information? It is therefore very
important that we look at this. These assurers could be anybody. It
would be very difficult to know whether they are part of an
organisation that assists in blacklisting. The confidentiality of
people in the workplace is a live issue. Why add another layer of
bureaucracy by having these assurers? It is absolute poppycock. It is
nonsense. Whoever dreamt it up should be fired. Hundreds, if not
thousands, of people are affected by blacklisting and the situation
could get an awful lot worse if the Opposition amendments are not
accepted. Like many others here, I am sure, I have spoken to people who
were not even aware that they were on a blacklist but subsequently
found out that, for years, the reason why they had been unemployed,
their kids had not had the best uniforms at school and they had been on
benefits was that they had been on a blacklist. That seriously concerns

112, let us look at the real world—the practicalities. This is
about employers sharing information and accurate details with trade

complete transparency, openness and sharing of information. However, if
that situation does not exist, that is not the case. The TULR

In can be a case of trying to get recognition in a company where
members have been recruited. Usually it is when members in an
unrecognised work force have problems that they go to a trade union.
Time, energy and effort will have been spent recruiting the number of
members to hit the threshold required to be able to apply for
recognition. It is unbelievable the steps that employers will take to
try to scupper those numbers. They will suddenly take on temporary
workers. If the union is applying for recognition for a particular part
of 
<?notus-xml column=1077?>the work force, they will move people from one part
of the company to another to suddenly boost the numbers so that the

would like to run through some of the things that we did when I was a
trade union official to try to ensure that our membership records were
as up to date as possible. A couple of times a year we sent out
magazines to every single member of the trade union, and there was
always a big advert saying, “If you move house, change jobs or
change your telephone number, let us know.” It has become
increasingly hard to keep membership records accurate. Historically
people had land lines and did not change their telephone number;
nowadays, a lot of people do not have land lines and mobile phone
numbers can change quite frequently. There are an enormous number of
inaccurate phone numbers in the records of trade unions, as there will
be, I suggest, in any organisation. The situation is incredibly
difficult. Any<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T18:28:02"></hs_TimeCode>
other mailing to members would have another advert or a paragraph
saying, “If any of your details have changed please let us
know.” We had branch audits where it would be a specific task in
a certain branch to go through the membership records and physically
talk to people about them. I do not think that trade unions could do
any more to keep track of their

issue is that the world has changed. This goes back to my point about
having to be practical; in my view, nothing in this clause is
practical. Trade union workplace branches, which historically the
unions were built on, virtually do not exist any more because the world
of work has changed. People do not start work when they leave school
and stay there until they retire. We do not have mass employers of
thousands of people where people remain in their jobs and can gain
promotion and go through the ranks in one company. That is not
today’s world of work. In those days, it was quite
straightforward to keep track of the membership.</hs_Para>

assurance needs to be independent if it is to be credible, which is why
trade unions of more than 10,000 members must appoint a qualified

audit certificate will provide confidence in the list. It is much more
proportionate for smaller unions, for which it is much easier to keep
details up to date—smaller unions have fewer than 10,000

protections are in place. The assurer would have to comply with the

assurer would also be a data controller, so the Information

significant powers under the Data Protection Act, which include serving

take and—where required to address a serious contravention of
the duty—imposing a fine of up to £500,000. Failing to
comply with an enforcement notice by the Information Commissioner is
also an offence, so there are significant protections in

hon. Member for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) and others raised
the important issue of blacklisting. Let me reiterate on the
record—my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I have
said this on various occasions in the House—that the
blacklisting of trade union members is unacceptable and illegal.
Following an investigation, of which the Committee will be aware, that
uncovered the Consulting Association’s blacklist, the law was
strengthened at the end of the previous Parliament by the Employment
Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010. That was also when
the maximum fine for a breach of data protection rules was increased to
£500,000.</hs_Para>

Committee will also be aware that the Select Committee on Scottish
Affairs has been conducting an inquiry into this issue. In July, the
Committee contacted the Secretary of State to say that it had new
information that blacklisting continues. We have always encouraged
anyone with evidence of blacklisting to come forward so that we can
investigate. The Scottish Affairs Committee is the first to get in
touch formally to say that it possesses new information. We are
grateful to the Committee for passing that information to the
Department. We have referred it to the Information
Commissioner’s Office, as the appropriate body to investigate
any breaches of the Data Protection Act. I understand that the office
is requesting more information from the Committee, so that it can
examine it and investigate. My right hon. Friend and I will of course
continue to take a close interest in this matter. If any evidence of
blacklisting is found, the perpetrators must feel the full force of
the law.</hs_Para>

me turn to the amendments in this group. Amendment 107 would make the
assurer owe a duty of confidentiality to the union and its
members—this deals with the concerns raised about data
protection. I hope that the protections I have outlined will reassure
hon. Members about compliance with the existing legislation, even
though it is not explicitly mentioned in part 3—the convention
is to keep legislation concise and not to repeat existing legal
requirements. I am happy to reassure the Committee and put it firmly on

108 would require the Secretary of State to set out eligibility

career ambitions of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T18:52:49"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wansbeck—along with what qualifications, status and
experience assurers must have. Our approach 
<?notus-xml column=1084?>will be the same as for independent scrutineers of trade union ballots
and elections. It is important that the assurer has widespread
credibility with unions, their members and the public. The order will
say which organisations are eligible or list the criteria that must be
met. We imagine that assurers will probably be recognised
professionals, such as solicitors, auditors or independent scrutineers.
The responses to our targeted consultation over the summer supported
that approach. I am not sure whether the hon. Gentleman falls into any
of those categories, but he might be interested to know that we will
need to consult on the content of the order, and I give the Committee
an assurance that we will do so. There will therefore be an

amendments are not necessary to achieve that aim. We can trust the
unions to do this, and they will be able to pass a resolution to get
rid of an assurer for any reason. It will be up to the unions to
decide. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T18:55:39"></hs_TimeCode>
relationship between the assurer and the union is rightly one for the
union to define. We have added a minimum level of protection in the
Bill to ensure that an assurer is not reappointed if they are not
qualified, are incapacitated or have decided that they do not wish to
be reappointed. In general, however, it is better that the union should
be responsible for the terms of the relationship with the assurer. That

111 would expect the assurer to give an opinion as to whether the union
had complied with the duty to keep its membership register accurate and
up to date. This would replace the current proposal to give an opinion
on whether the union’s system for compiling the register was
satisfactory for that purpose. What is being proposed in the amendment
would be far more 
<?notus-xml column=1085?>costly and onerous to the union. In some cases, the
assurer might conclude that they needed to carry out a thorough audit
of all the content of the register. We believe that a systems check is
more proportionate, and that is what we are setting out.</hs_Para>

112 has been mentioned by the hon. Member for Sunderland Central (Julie

would<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T18:56:19"></hs_TimeCode> add an
additional requirement to the membership audit certificate. This would
be to include the assurer’s opinion as to whether the employer
had shared “timely and accurate details” with the union.
The hon. Lady took the view that bad employers would try to prevent
unions from having the right information. As I mentioned earlier, there
is already statutory protection to ensure that unions cannot be held
accountable for information that they do not possess, or for
inaccuracies that are beyond their
control<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T18:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
also important to note that we will produce guidance for employers, to
help them to assist unions to comply. It is important that employers
should comply with their requirement to provide information to unions,
and we believe that that additional guidance will be helpful in that
regard.</hs_Para>

166 seeks to assist the assurer by requiring the Secretary of State to
produce guidance and define in statute what is
“satisfactory” and “not satisfactory”. The
amendment is either necessary or desirable. What is satisfactory or not
will vary from one union to another, and a one-size-fits-all definition
would be onerous for some and ineffective for others. Our approach is
to retain flexibility. Assurers will be professionals, and it is
reasonable to rely on their professional judgment and ability to apply
these phrases appropriately. Ultimately, the membership audit
certificate represents only the opinion of the assurer. It is only the
certification officer who has the power to make a

That could result in the assurer being unable to ask questions of the
right people. They should obviously be able to question those who
handle sensitive membership data, but they should also be able to
question others who understand how those data are kept up to date. In
some cases, that might be one and the same individual, but in others it
might not be. So the form of words that we have used in the Bill, which

115 seems to suggest that a union should not be penalised for errors
when the correct details are held by the employer. I have already set
out why existing legislation renders such an amendment unnecessary.
There is already a “reasonably practicable” test, and we
will be issuing improved guidance. Amendment 117 would mean that the
union could supply information to the assurer to help them to carry out
their role only if it did not conflict with the union’s
responsibility to comply with data protection requirements. I have
already outlined the safeguards relating to data protection. The
assurer will have to be able to see the register if they are to carry
out their responsibilities effectively, and the amendment could prevent
that from happening.</hs_Para>

the course of the debate, there was considerable discussion about on
which of the commendable amendments in the group we should seek to test
the opinion of the House. Having listened to the helpful advice of

the Members for Shipley (Philip
Davies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T19:26:54"></hs_TimeCode>) and for
Bury North (Mr Nuttall), the balance of opinion is that the best choice
would be amendment 14, which would provide that people could not be
prosecuted for having unlit skips if they had taken reasonable steps to
ensure that they were lit. In other words, the amendment would mean
that there would have to be a lack of responsibility before a criminal
act could be
committed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T19:27:50"></hs_TimeCode>. There
was acceptance across the House that such an amendment would be

the Member for Harrow East (Bob Blackman), on behalf of the promoters
of the Bill, will accept amendment 11, which should interest those who
think that such occasions are rather a pointless exercise. It is clear
that the promoters of this Bill are much more willing to accept
amendments than the promoter of the Transparency of Lobbying, Non-Party
Campaigning and Trade Union Administration Bill—the Government.
The Government should learn a lesson from how we conduct private
business, during which if it is thought that the arguments being made
about amendments are reasonable, those amendments are accepted without
anyone feeling that they are losing face. I congratulate my hon. Friend

deals with charging points for electric vehicles. Many moons ago,
perhaps even more than two years ago, I was told that the reason why
the Government were so keen to ensure that the Bill got on the statute
book was its provisions on charging points for electric vehicles. The
fact that the Bill has been on a very slow curve since then is
indicative of the many practical problems that are being experienced by
people who want to promote electric vehicles and a green economy. That
is why the issue of charging points has not been as significant as the

declare my enthusiasm for the idea that there should be electric

on subsidies. I am suggesting that the cost of charging an electrically
powered motor vehicle should be self-financing. Obviously, when someone
goes into a public off-street car park and charges their vehicle, they
can expect to pay for the parking, the service and the electricity. I
am not suggesting that other car park users cross-subsidise those who
have chosen to have electric vehicles. Electric vehicle users are
already cross-subsidised to an extent because of their different

Chope:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is getting into an interesting
argument on which we could have an academic discourse. Obviously, to
encourage an embryonic service, we might have to provide it and hope
that people start using it. Many years ago, when I was the Minister
with responsibility for roads, I was involved in promoting the use of
lead-free fuel. It seems amazing, Mr Deputy Speaker that, within our
living memory, we moved from full-leaded fuel to the unleaded version.
To begin with, relatively few vehicles went on unleaded petrol. If a
pioneer bought a vehicle that used unleaded fuel and there was nowhere
to fill it up, it would have been a deterrent to people taking up

if there is a requirement for them to provide that. What is the point
of giving them a power without any certainty about whether they will
exercise it? My hon. Friend paints a scenario in which the public
sector can be kept out of this completely. Indeed, I could support that
where there are no public sector London local authority-owned car
parks. However, if London local authorities wish to take powers to
establish charging points for electric vehicles, my point, and the
point of these two amendments, is that they should provide them in all

counter-argument relates to the provisions in part 5. If London local
authorities are to be given powers to set up charging points we should,
at the same time, say that they shall set up charging points.
Otherwise, we could have a situation where they pick and choose where
they think it will be most advantageous for them to set up the charging
points, and effectively undermine the potential private sector
involvement to which my hon. Friend refers. One consequence of part 5
may well be that in London the private sector will be inhibited 
<?notus-xml column=1101?>from coming forward to provide and operate charging apparatus, because
local authorities will be competing unfairly by providing that
apparatus in their best positioned off-street public car parks, rather

that if the London authority is going to provide charging points, it

charging point on a highway, the highway authority should be
responsible for it, rather than the person who is setting it up. If
anyone wants to set up private off-street charging points for electric
vehicles, I would encourage them so to do. They would not need the

back to the question of whom we are trying to encourage to use electric
vehicles, and hence to use electric vehicle charging points. If using a
charging point can make someone liable at law for events for which that
person would not have been responsible but for the provisions of this
statute, that in itself will deter people from using electric vehicles.
I know of no legislation that provides for someone who fills up his
tank at a petrol station to be automatically liable, as the person in
charge of the vehicle, irrespective of whether he or she is at fault. I
assume that normally, whether the petrol station was owned by a private
sector company or by a local authority, its owner would, could or
should be
responsible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091168001463" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0004.htm#13091168001463">Important

view, for what it is worth, is that we should not compel London local
authorities to provide and operate charging apparatus in every public
off-street car park, as amendments 21 and 22 propose. There might be no
demand in certain parts of some London boroughs. We might not really
want local authorities doing it themselves anyway. Perhaps we would
like other people involved in provision, not least to get some
competition going. Competition, of course, is the best way to drive
down prices. I seems to me that the monopoly
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T20:59:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
envisages, unusually, would not be in the best interests of the
consumer or the taxpayer, who might end up paying unnecessarily to have
charging apparatus installed in places where it is not needed and never
will be. Putting such apparatus in every public off-street car park
under the control of the local authority seems extremely demanding. It
is something that I cannot support. I urge my hon. Friend
not to press amendments 21 and 22, and on that basis, I could not
support amendment 23, as it is consequential to amendments

everybody in the whole country, apart from London local authorities, is
responsible for any accidents, damage or incidents that happen as a
result of their equipment. I am sure that the Government’s view

their own stuff. It is utterly unacceptable to say that we are going to

person in charge at the time may well have control of the
cable—it is probably self-evident that if they are using it they
have control of it—but to say that they have responsibility for
that piece of equipment is a step too far. As my hon. Friend said, we
would not expect somebody filling up at a petrol station to take full
responsibility for the pumps they were filling up from. I cannot
believe that anybody in this House would think that.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:09:36"></hs_TimeCode> people should
not take full responsibility for the pumps when they are filling up
their car with petrol, why on earth should they take responsibility for
the cables when they are charging their car? The same rules should
apply. It might be a different form of fuel, but the same principles
should apply across the board. Leaving aside control of the cable, it
is unacceptable to impose responsibility for it. For that reason alone,
I support my hon. Friend in wanting to strike out subsection
(8). Of course, if it did not include the words “responsibility
for”, I might take a different view, but as it stands it is
unacceptable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>.

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch is on to a good thing with

to consult. The title of the clause is: “Duties to consult or
obtain consent”. Somebody taking a fleeting look at the Bill
would think that obtaining consent was an important part of it, but my
hon. Friend is right that subsection (1) mentions only consultation,
which is not good enough. Consent must be obtained; otherwise it is a
potential affront to local democracy. What on earth is the point of
consulting if no regard is to be given to the views of the
consultation? That would be a pointless exercise. If an authority has

Davies:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. One could
argue that it should be the other way around: companies such as Network
Rail are not accountable to the public in the same way as the planning

the consent of the relevant local authority to be

point is—I am sure we all have examples of this in our
constituencies—that the public have completely lost faith in
consultations, and this Bill reinforces that. People are conned into
thinking that statutory consultations are meaningful and that they
matter and will make a difference, only to find that their views are
completely ignored and overridden. People lose faith in the whole
process and end up not engaging in anything, because they think it is a
waste of

am afraid that this clause reinforces something that does a great
disservice to our democracy: sham consultations which people go through
simply because there is a statutory requirement to do so. Nobody takes
notice of them, because the decision has already been made and they are
a minor inconvenience. People say, “We’ve got to waste a
bit of time on this consultation, go through the motions and look as if
we’re doing something,” knowing full well that not a
blind bit of notice will be taken of what anybody says. The only thing
worse than not consulting people is to consult them and take no notice
of them. I say to the sponsor of the Bill that if there is no
requirement to take any notice of the consultation, do not have a
consultation in the 
<?notus-xml column=1115?>first place. The local authorities should be open and honest about the
fact that they do not care what local residents think and plough on
with what they are doing, without going through what we all know is an

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch is therefore absolutely right
to say through amendment 37 that consent must be obtained to ensure
that the process is democratic and locally accountable. I believe that
the sponsor of the Bill is, like me, a big fan of the
Government’s localism agenda. It seems to me that clause 18(1)
flies in the face of localism. If we really believe in localism, we
should seek to gain the consent of people as low down the chain as
possible and at the most local level. If the sponsor is a supporter of
the localism agenda, he should want to ensure not only that local
people are consulted, but that their views count. Their decision should
be final in matters that affect them. It should not be possible for a
much wider and greater London authority, such as Transport for London
or whoever it might be, to ride roughshod over those local
views.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091168001548" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0004.htm#13091168001548">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:16:48"></hs_TimeCode>
a keen supporter of the Government’s localism agenda, I have to
support amendment 37. I hope that, on reflection, the sponsor of the
Bill will see the merits of that. That would save an awful lot of aggro
later down the line. If he wants to see the effective roll-out of
electric vehicles and charging points, and all the infrastructure that
goes with that, he should realise that it would be done best and
probably quickest if it had the consent of the local people who would
be affected. The best way to stop such things in their tracks is to
create the uproar that occurs when local people see that their views
have not been taken into account. That will stop other people from
going down the same route and will probably end up slowing down the
roll-out of these things.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:17:32"></hs_TimeCode> know that his
priority in clause 18(1) is to speed up the process and ensure that the
roll-out happens as fast as possible, come what may, but I think that
it will slow down the process in the long run as people say that they
are not satisfied with being consulted and then
ignored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:17:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091168001549" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0004.htm#13091168001549">With

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch made a compelling case for
amendment 40, which would leave out clause 19. He can always be relied
on in debates such as this to find something that, when put under
scrutiny, collapses before our very eyes. If there is one amendment in
this group that shows part of the Bill to be utterly ridiculous, it is
amendment 40. As he made clear, existing statute suffices. We should
not want to add extra offences to the statute book. My understanding is
that the Government’s agenda is to remove unnecessary offences
from the statute book. Given that my hon. Friend has pointed out how
unnecessary this offence is because it is covered elsewhere, this is a
perfect example of where the Government can deliver on what they say
and strike out an offence before it even comes into effect. I hope that
the sponsor of the Bill will support the Government’s agenda of
striking out unnecessary offences and show them that he means
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

think that clause 19 is worse than that, as I set out in my
intervention. I agree with my hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch
that we do not need this offence, but some people may still think that
we do. Whether or not people think we need the offence, the way in
which the clause is drafted makes it a complete nonsense anyway,
because it focuses on making somebody not guilty of the offence if

to whether any electricity theft is taking place, as my hon. Friend the
Member for Christchurch
has<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:20:13"></hs_TimeCode> set out.
Anybody could be operating the charging apparatus, but it is the person
who is paying for the charging apparatus at the time who should give
permission. Who is holding the baby or operating the machine at the
time is irrelevant; it could be anybody. Therefore, even if an offence
is necessary—I am convinced that it is not—the measure
gives a get-out-of-jail card to the wrong people on the wrong premise.

focuses his and the House’s attention on amendments 27, 28, 37

an awful lot to commend them. The logic of those amendments is with my

enthusiastically support them. However, if he sees fit to press the
other amendments, and particularly amendment 21, I am afraid that,

commencing my response, it is important to note that we are talking
about the future of the motor industry in this country. I take the view
that within the next couple of years the private vehicle of choice will
be the electric car. It is therefore essential that electric charging
points are placed around London in appropriate places for people to
charge their vehicles—there is currently limited
capacity—so that we can encourage people to take up this new
form of transport.</hs_Para>

I respond to the amendments, it is important to note that there are two
sets of provisions: one for car parks, which may be operated by the
local authority, Transport for London, London Underground and other
bodies; and the other for the public highway, where the provision is
likely to be, although not exclusively, where meters and so on are
currently provided. They will operate in tandem. The point at which the
vehicle can be connected to the charging point will be provided, and
the issue is then the cable connection between the charging point and
the vehicle. Motor manufacturers may come up with different
arrangements for that connection and we cannot pre-judge that.

21 would require a local authority to provide the charging apparatus in

charging points at every car park. London authorities are clear that
they want to do this—they do not need to be told that they must
do so. I therefore urge

permission for all the different boxes that are going to placed
alongside parking meters on the public highway, it would again lead to
complete overkill. What the promoters suggest—and planning
authorities in London, by the way, have given their consent to
it—is that they are happy to be consulted without having to go

deals with the unlawful use of electric charging points. It should be
borne in mind that such charging points will be in car parks run by
local authorities, or on the public highway. My hon. Friend said that
the issue of electricity theft was behind the amendment, but
electricity theft nearly always takes place within the confines of
property, and is perpetrated by people who bypass a meter or do
something similar. What is needed in this instance is a provision that
makes it an offence to interfere with devices that are on the public
highway, or to misuse them in any
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000045">It
should be made clear to members of the public that if they interfere
with such devices, they will face a penalty in a civil court. I believe
that the penalty has been set at level 3, which currently means a fine
of up to £1,000. However, I understand that the Ministry of
Justice is still consulting on an increase, and that the amount could
rise to £4,000. Of course, every case will be judged on its
merits, and, were someone convicted of such an offence, it would be up
to the court to decide what the penalty should be. That, I think, is
wholly appropriate.</hs_Para>

are keen to ensure that there is a designated offence in this regard,
and I agree with them. There are to be at least 25,000 charging points
in London. Given that local authorities are already experiencing severe
problems with thefts from parking meters and similar devices in London,
we must make it clear to the public that interfering with charging
points could be dangerous. We need a specific deterrent rather than
relying on the offence of electricity theft, because interfering with
these devices would not just be theft. It could, for instance, be
vandalism.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/62D41A721D063B3F9FF4B61CD24A1363A77A5D18" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 September 2013">Wednesday

constitute a very dangerous precedent, because local authorities would
have to use some other part of the law to enforce the rules. Given that

entirely superfluous. Given the Localism Act 2011, I question whether
there is a need for specific provisions to give London local

their own petrol stations, so why does this Bill contemplate giving
them the power to provide charging points for electric vehicles? Why
the difference? At the start of the 20th century were our forebears in
this place suggesting that the local authorities of the day set up
petrol stations for the newly invented combustion engine? I suggest
that they were not. On that basis, I am suspicious about amendment 21

hon. Friend the Member for Christchurch that
if<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T21:57:10"></hs_TimeCode> they are

24 would remove clause 16(2), which gives local authorities the power

the Member for Christchurch tabled this amendment, as it goes against
what I would have thought were his normal instincts in these matters.
Nevertheless, it has been tabled and we must consider it. It has a
number of consequential amendments, all relating to “authorised
persons”. Reference has been made to those, so, for speed of
debate, I will not go through them again. The point is: if London local
authorities are going to be given this power, it is entirely fair and
reasonable that they should have permission to allow another authorised
person, if they so wish, to do this work on their behalf and operate
these charging points.</hs_Para>

subsection (7), which would be removed if amendment 27 were

There can be no other reason for it. If they were not negligent, they
would not have anything to fear; there would be no problem. I am

for use as charging spaces, that will affect other car park users. I
could well envisage many disgruntled people who are trying to park
driving past a lot of empty spaces that have been kept for use only as
charging bays. I fear that the problem in practice will not be people
making illegal use of the electricity, which I shall deal with when I
speak to amendment 40, but people parking their petrol and diesel
vehicles in spaces provided for electrical charging points, yet that is
not covered by the Bill. Perhaps that problem has not been thought

put anyone off making unlawful use of a charging point, but rather than
putting people off, why not encourage them to use the points? Why not
say, “Here is an electric charging point, so if you want to use
it, do so”? When one pays for fuel at the pump with a credit
card, after putting in one’s card and entering the number, a
specific amount of fuel—usually up to £99—can be
drawn down. There might be a technical reason, but why could we not do
the same for electricity? Why could not people enter their card and
code so that electricity up to a given amount could be dispensed? That
ought to be the way forward because we then would not need to
create an additional offence. That explains my rationale for supporting
amendment 40, leaving aside the other good arguments that we have
already heard, with which I entirely

Chope:</Member></B> This is a notable debate for a number of reasons,
but one is that we have not heard from either the Minister or the
official Opposition spokesman, yet we understand that the development
of a network of charging points for electric vehicles is a key
policy of both the Government and the Opposition. The
way of implementing such a policy in London is what we have
been discussing for the past couple of hours. I find it extraordinary,
if not disturbing, that we have not heard from the Minister in response
to the genuine questions raised during the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000076">It

which my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Harrow East has dealt with the debate is first
class. The whole purpose of scrutiny in the House is for questions to
be asked and answers to be given, and for that to be done in a
civilised way. It may well be that people have misunderstood the
meaning of the Bill. They may have made nonsense of an amendment, but
the only way of testing that process is through a civilized exchange
across the Floor of the
House<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000077">My
hon. Friend has shown during today’s proceedings and in previous
discussion of the Bill that if the Government are interested in
bringing forward Ministers who are good at responding to debates,
taking seriously the process of scrutiny and answering the questions,
my hon. Friend is a model Minister in waiting. He has shown that he
grasps the whole purpose of our Parliament, which is to scrutinise the
Executive, and the purpose of the Executive is to respond to that
scrutiny.</hs_Para>

come in for a bit of stick tonight in relation to some of the
amendments in the group, I remind the House that it is a long-standing
convention that if one tables an amendment and it encounters quite a
lot of opposition, one then downgrades one’s amendment by
saying, “Well, after all, it is only a probing
amendment.” By force of argument, not least from
my<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow East, and from

the Members for Shipley and
<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>for Bury North,
I have been forced to downgrade my lead amendment to a probing
amendment. However, it has been very effective in probing and getting
out of the promoters what they have in mind and why that amendment is
ill-conceived, like many of the others that go with it. Had the
Minister responded, I might well have been pushed back into a
more aggressive mode and become a little
more stubborn.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="1309121000220" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000220">10.15

the Member for Harrow East 
<?notus-xml column=1127?>and the three of us who have spoken from the Back Benches in relation to
amendment 37, which relates to clause 18, and amendment 40, which
relates to clause 19. He opposes amendment 37 on the basis
that it would be demanding to expect local authorities to deal with
potentially 25,000 planning applications, as we are talking about
25,000 charging points across London, and I conceded that that is
correct.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000080">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>
the other hand, I envisage enormous difficulties if the 25,000 charging
points are installed in places where local residents do not want them
to be. They are also a potential nuisance, because we do not yet know
how much noise they will generate. Will they be as loud as a fridge
freezer at night, or louder? We do not know how much of a nuisance
vehicles coming to charging points will be, or how long the process
will take. When there is a shortage of charging points, will there be
queues of vehicles waiting to use them, and might that obstruct the
streets? There are many big issues that could affect London
residents.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000081">Although
clause 18 refers to consulting, it makes no reference to meaningful
consultation or to local authorities having to listen to the views of
residents. Without the wording being changed, all we can say is that if
local authorities do not listen to the views of their residents on
this, the whole means of bringing forward charging points to facilitate
the expansion of electric vehicles in London will be inhibited and
could become very unpopular. That is one of the concerns referred to
during the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:18:08"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
recall, clause 18 also refers to consent having to be obtained from
Network Rail and London Underground, which is a result of the petitions
that those organisations put in against the Bill. It is a pity that
residents did not petition, as they might have been able to obtain a
similar
concession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000082">Amendment
40 would delete clause 19. If we are talking about creating new
criminal offences, we need to be very clear that they are needed.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:19:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harrow East, in defending the Bill’s position,
did his valiant best. He referred to the problem that many local
authorities already have with theft from parking meters, but he did not
suggest that that should be subject to a separate
offence, because it is already covered by the Theft Act. He also said
that he did not believe that the issue of interfering with a charging
apparatus could be ignored when drafting a Bill such as this. However,
as my hon. Friend the Member for Bury North made clear, that would
probably be an offence of criminal damage. Do we need a new criminal
offence under clause 19? The wording of the clause would not
even cover interference, as it specifically refers to the use
of</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1309121000203" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000203">“charging

do not yet know, because the technology and designs are still being
developed, whether the charging apparatus will be the kind into which
an electric kettle can be plugged—a person might be able to have
their tea. Surely, however, it is sensible to legislate on the basis
that there is already a clear offence of theft of electricity. Anybody
who uses the apparatus without authority will be stealing the
electricity. That is clear. If they interfere with or vandalise the
charging apparatus, they will be guilty of criminal damage. There is no
need for the offence in clause 19; it would just litter the statute
book, and we do not want to create more criminal offences.</hs_Para>

the additional point made by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley, who
said that clause 19(2) is badly drafted and makes it look as though we
were dealing with the wrong person from whom permission would need to

against clause

Health England’s site at Porton Down is therefore unique. It
possesses two distinct world class capabilities: first, the
translational research facility, which partners with academia,
international agencies and companies seeking specialist expertise in
turning research concepts into tangible products; and secondly, the
production, development and manufacturing capability, which represents
about a third of current operations. It is important to emphasise that,
although the facilities are separate, their co-location means they work
closely together and ensures that there is a cohesive resource to
support the Government in the event of a national microbiological
emergency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000164">Immediately
adjacent to Public Health England’s facilities at Porton are the
Defence Science and Technology Laboratory’s new multi-million
pound headquarters. Some DSTL functions are complementary and
contribute to the overall emergency response capability. Indeed,
originally, the PHE and DSTL sites worked under the same banner. They
continue to work closely together. That DSTL chose recently to relocate
its headquarters to Porton Down as a result of its own estate
consolidation was a vote of confidence, and a demonstration of the
value that the Ministry of Defence attaches to being close to the
CEPR.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000165">As
was acknowledged in the previous debate three years ago, the laboratory
facilities are in need of modernisation, both because of wear and tear
and in order to reflect the increased demands placed on Porton owing to
the expanded responsibilities of Public Health England. It was to
address those problems that Project Chrysalis was created in 2008 under
my predecessor. The project was designed to investigate the cost of
refurbishment and subsequently to explore the possibility of moving
some of Porton’s facilities to a new site in Harlow, where they
would be consolidated with other laboratory sites in the Public Health
England
portfolio.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000166">In
theory, this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:44:25"></hs_TimeCode>
would create a single science hub for Public Health England. In
practice, the complexity of a move has generated as many questions as
it answers. The geographical distance between the various PHE sites has
never been raised as an issue before. This is because there are few
functional dependencies between the different agencies, so I still
maintain that the assumed 
<?notus-xml column=1132?>advantage of geographical proximity will not, by itself, validate the
business case for a move. However, there is a natural synergy between
the research conducted at DSTL and CEPR. A single hub proposal also
potentially loses the advantage of a site surrounded by Ministry of
Defence land, which minimises the risks of working with animals and the
most dangerous diseases in the world.</hs_Para>

was therefore relieved when, in August 2012, the decision was made to
delay the conclusions of Project Chrysalis because the Treasury
believed that considerably more work needed to be done on the outline
business case to demonstrate value for money. At this point, Public
Health England also commissioned a review by Professor George Griffin
to look at whether the concept of a single science hub was worthy of
further investigation. He concluded that it was, and in April this year
Public Health England began a further review into how the business case
fits with its vision for the future of its facilities overall. Running
in parallel with this review, I understand that the Cabinet Office has
recently instigated a separate examination of the future of the
development and production facilities at Porton. It is these two
reviews that have prompted me to seek this second debate
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000168"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:46:37"></hs_TimeCode>Although
I fully accept that it is not for me to dictate the outcome of any

now under way, both of which have implications for the wider scientific
infrastructure of the UK, and we must get those decisions
right.</hs_Para>

first piece of work, now termed the single science hub, is essentially
examining the business case for a consolidated PHE facility in Harlow.
Public Health England, as an arm’s length body of the Department
of Health, has a specific core mission to secure and improve the health
of the population. From that perspective, it is understandable that the
wider commercial activities around translational research may not be
deemed integral to PHE’s core purposes. However, from a UK plc
point of view, they are critical for the growth of the life sciences
industry in the UK. Some of the projects being carried out by this team
include the largest pre-clinical TB vaccine evaluation in Europe, and
supporting the US human health services with vaccine development. I
have no wish to see the UK’s expertise dispersed across the
globe in future due to the fact that it conceivably exists within PHE
but has ended up under the umbrella of a Government Department with a
narrower mission, where the skills could be seen as no longer
entirely fitting.</hs_Para>

crux of the issue is that Porton’s complexity means all its
combined capabilities do not sit comfortably with one Government
Department or agency. The work of translational research scientists is
perhaps more in keeping with the Department for Business, Innovation
and Skills agenda to drive growth in the life sciences industry, while
other work, in partnership with DSTL, is of interest to the Ministry of
Defence. Existing departmental delineations of responsibility must not
inhibit the right decisions about the future of translational research

second piece of work under way is confined to the potential of the
production and development facilities alone. It might be suggested that
Public Health England 
<?notus-xml column=1133?>could remove the need for investment in refurbished
facilities by entering into partnership arrangements or other
commercial propositions, but that could entail the UK losing its
sovereign capability to produce vaccines in a biological emergency. Key
public functions must be safeguarded, including the only anthrax
vaccine licence in Europe, as well as the emergency response training
undertaken across the public and private sectors. I recognise the
financial options for the production and development facilities, but
their relationship with translational research scientists is an
operating reality of what currently goes on at Porton and is of wider
value to the UK economy. They do not just generate new products for
market; they also maximise the potential receipts from the development
of new
ideas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:50:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000172">Exploring
the future of production and development separately means that there is
a risk that this valuable translational research capability could be
lost to the UK, because its role is not about short-term commercial
receipts, but about generating value for UK plc through high-level
research that requires a degree of investment and flexible, innovative
collaboration with other bodies and scientists abroad. The partnership
between translational scientists and co-located production and
development colleagues must therefore be fully analysed. Any
recommendations for the future must neither damage the wealth creation
potential of scientists at Porton nor put at risk the public health
protection capabilities that currently reside there. Critically, the
ongoing discussions must consult fully the expert staff on the ground,
to get an accurate reflection of their roles, whom they interact with
internationally and the ideas they have to catalyse Porton’s
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000173"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T22:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>I
fully understand the logic that leads some to believe that it makes
sense in principle to aim for a single science hub—as I note the
project has stealthily been renamed—to create a single site of
expertise for PHE. It is a neat concept on paper, but as I have
stressed for the past three years, Porton Down is a unique strategic
asset for the UK, and there is little sense in duplicating capability
that exists elsewhere across government in a time of austerity. The
need for new containment level 4 facilities at Porton could be reduced
if DSTL’s similar facilities next door could be
shared—something that I know DSTL is willing to
consider.</hs_Para>

suggestion this evening, as I described in a slightly different way
three years ago, is to look at a new model of ownership, based on the
principle that stronger partnerships are possible between the public
and private sectors without compromising important public health
requirements. Porton has become a globally recognised brand that
generates £18 million of royalty revenues every year through its
high-quality research licences and products. It generates five times
more external income than it receives in core funding from PHE and
remains a pioneering example of the best public sector expertise
generating growth for UK plc. The Government should therefore consider
ways to capitalise on this.</hs_Para>

urge the Minister to examine the potential of a public-private
partnership, which would give scientists at Porton the ability to
leverage new facilities through their royalty income stream, as they
themselves have suggested. Such a role would also enable Porton to
operate more strategically, providing a cost-effective way to protect
the UK’s microbiological emergency 
<?notus-xml column=1134?>response capabilities. In peacetime, it would operate as a national
translational research facility, with a key role in delivering the
Government’s life sciences strategy. This overall vision
represents a commercialisation of the facility’s scientific
potential, while protecting its public role in
emergencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1309121000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/debtext/130911-0005.htm#1309121000176">As

the work of PHE in protecting the nation’s health and preventing
disease. Porton provides some of the most specialist and
high-technology microbiology facilities in the country. However, the
main building at PHE Porton, as it is now known, was built 60 years

facilities with modern state-of-the-art buildings through the

hon. Friend mentions the distance between sites. The case for change

hon. Friend asks why PHE does not simply share high-containment
facilities with the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory. We need
to be clear that although PHE and DSTL will continue to collaborate
closely, public health needs dedicated high-containment facilities to

pleasantries of wishing you well in chairing the debate, Mr Walker, may
I express my particular thanks? Owing to the peculiarity of
parliamentary procedure, I was told that I was chairing the debate this
morning, but it would have been difficult to be in the Chair and making
my speech at the same time. I am therefore particularly grateful to you
for taking my place at this early hour in the morning. I am also
grateful to many colleagues for turning up to discuss this extremely
important subject. Indeed, I extend my thanks to Mr Speaker—I do
not know whether he selected the subject for debate or it came about in
another way—for making the debate
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T09:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000007">It
is often said that the first duty of Government is the defence of the
realm, and that is absolutely true. The first duty of Parliament is to
examine what the Government are doing in defending the realm. Over 25
years, the armed forces parliamentary scheme has played a significant
part in helping Members of Parliament from all parties to examine what
the Government are doing. I emphasise “from all parties”,
because it is important for the Opposition to have the opportunity to
find out more about the armed forces through the scheme. Frankly,
however, Government Back Benchers do not have easy access to the armed
forces, so using the scheme as a way of finding out what our people are
doing on the ground and finding out a little more about defence is an
extraordinarily important thing for Back Benchers of all colours to do.
I have put myself carefully in a Cross-Bench position at the end of the
Chamber this morning to illustrate that this is in no sense a party
political
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T09:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000008">For
25 years, the armed forces parliamentary scheme has done a fantastic
job in enabling Back Benchers—and, indeed, on many occasions,
Front Benchers—from both sides of the House to embed themselves
with our armed forces in the Army, Navy and Air Force, and to find out
what is happening on the ground. They are finding out not necessarily
about strategic matters or ground defence, but about how our boys and
girls, as we often call the members of all three of our armed services,
do their work on the
ground<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T09:32:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000009">We
are honoured to be joined in the Chamber by the Conservative Chief

25 years, the scheme has enabled an enormous number of
people—265, if my counting is correct—to find out what
happens to airmen, and soldiers and sailors of both sexes on the
ground. There is a third level to the scheme in the Royal College of
Defence Studies, where those who have graduated from the 
<?notus-xml column=274?>lower levels can find out more about the grand strategy and the bigger
defence picture. Largely, however, the purpose of the scheme is to find
out precisely what is happening on the

of that would be possible were it not for the imagination, initiative
and management over 25 years of Sir Neil Thorne, ably supported by his
excellent wife. [<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “Hear,
hear.”] The approbation around the Chamber confirms that
everyone this morning wants me to thank him extremely sincerely for all
the magnificent work that he has done in setting up the scheme and
making it work. It is completely out of order, Mr Walker, to
call attention to anyone in any gallery attached to the Chamber, and I
would not wish to incur your wrath by doing so, but were there anyone
in the Public Gallery who happened to have the name of Sir Neil Thorne,
we would be happy that he happened to be here and most grateful for
everything that he has done. It has been a magnificent scheme for 25

scheme has operated at four different levels—perhaps three in
future—and 265 people in total have gone through it. In the
introductory course, people learn a little about what the armed
services are doing in general terms. There is also a postgraduate
scheme, the advanced postgraduate scheme and the even more advanced
postgraduate scheme, as well as a number of other schemes, all of
which, I am glad to say—call me an anorak—I have very
much enjoyed doing. My interest and involvement in defence have come
about largely as a result of the scheme, so it has been a superb way of
learning about what happens on the

a year or so ago, the Lord Speaker, Mr Speaker and the Secretary of

Defence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T09:34:49"></hs_TimeCode> decided
that it was time to do two things: to re-establish the scheme as a
charitable trust; and to do so within Parliament. Happily, we have been
able to do that over the past year or so. Last night, in Committee Room
14, we relaunched the scheme under a new name, the armed forces
parliamentary trust. It is to be run by nine trustees: two appointed by
Mr Speaker, namely
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T09:35:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) and me; two from the House of
Lords, who I think will be Lord Wakeham and Lord Rogan; two from the
Ministry of Defence, Air Vice-Marshal David Murray and Sir Bill
Jeffrey, the last but one permanent secretary; and two from industry,
Helen Kennett of Rolls-Royce and Bob Keen of BAE
Systems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000014">I
am delighted that Sir Neil Thorne has agreed to become the ninth
trustee and that, in response to an invitation from Mr Speaker, he has
undertaken to become the life president of the scheme. We welcome Sir
Neil’s continuing involvement and interest. In all, that is a
good group of people to set up a charitable trust—a charitable
incorporated organisation, which is a kind of mini-charity under the
charity commissioners—which will be entirely within Parliament.
Only last night, Mr Speaker told me that he has found
accommodation in Parliament for our staff of one person, to whom I
shall return. The scheme will be wholly accountable and transparent,
with annual accounts, annual general meetings and the rest of it, as we
must have in modern

that he commits to take part in the scheme. We would welcome his
contribution—he will be the lowest of the low, the most junior
private soldier that it is possible to imagine, and we will put him
through an absolute beasting, but I am happy to give him that
reassurance. He has been a mild critic over  the years, so it
is useful and kind of him to come to the Chamber to offer his support

hon. Friend asked who would be paying for the scheme, and it is worth
expanding on that. Traditionally, it has been paid for by the defence
industry, and there have been four main sponsors. One of the things
that I have been doing over the summer is going round all the defence
companies, and I have now secured promises from at least 10 and
possibly 15 of them—all the majors, such as Rolls-Royce, BAE
Systems and Babcock, as well as others of a similar nature—each
paying a small amount of funding, which will be sufficient to cover our
anticipated
costs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000018">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T09:38:38"></hs_TimeCode>
reason why that is a better arrangement is because, with 10 or 15
sponsors, we can say that none is achieving anything. Indeed, my pitch
to them has been to say, “I would like some money
from you, please.” They have asked, “What do we get
back?” and I have replied, “You get absolutely nothing in
return whatever. This is CSR—corporate social
responsibility—for the defence industry. You get no lobbying, no
access nor your name on writing paper, unless we choose to do so, but
you get the warm feeling, Mr Rolls-Royce”—for
example—“ of knowing that you have helped with
the education of Members of Parliament.” All of them accepted

Gray:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an extremely good point. There
have hardly been any defence debates or oral questions over the past 25
years in which hon. Members have not stood up and said, “Thanks
to the armed forces parliamentary scheme, I know a little bit more
about the armed forces. Therefore, the following question comes from my
experience in the scheme.” My hon. Friend is absolutely right;
the defence companies do not want anything directly in return, but it
is good for them to know that there is a cadre of people in Parliament
who understand defence, are interested in and sympathetic towards
defence, and who have some kind of expertise when we consider broader
defence matters in future. No lobbying is involved, but there are
advantages for them in having a group of people who are more attuned to
defence questions. That is how the sponsorship will work. Everything
will be listed,<B> </B>declared 
<?notus-xml column=276?>and above board with minuted annual general meetings and so on. My hon.
Friend can be reassured on that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000021">The
scheme will continue the movement started by Sir Neil Thorne over 25
years ago. We believe that the ethos he established of embedding
Members of Parliament with the three armed services is right. Last
week, I was happy to visit to RAF Brize Norton with other hon. Members,
but we wore suits, we were VIP visitors and we did not get together
with people on the ground or learn what they were doing. The whole
ethos of the scheme is to be there as one of them and fully involved as
an ordinary individual with people of all ranks.</hs_Para>

important to maintain that ethos and to do so in a similar way, with
visits of up to 20 or 22 days. The trustees are considering whether 15
days would be slightly easier, but broadly speaking the visits will
remain the experience that hon. Members have enjoyed over the past 25
years or so, and they will no doubt tell us about it. I say
“enjoyed” intentionally because the scheme is not only
educational and helpful to our defence industry and to hon. Members in
defence debates but good fun. That is key. The visits are fantastic
fun, and it is important that that ethos
continues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000023">We
are continuing the movement, as the military say, rather than starting
something brand new. The organisation is wonderful, but it needs a bit
of change and thanks to what Mr Speaker, the Lord Speaker and the
Secretary of State for Defence have asked us to do, we are continuing
the movement under a new guise. The transition to the new scheme has
been helped by the Minister, who has handled negotiations with great
care and tact, for which I am most grateful. He had a useful group of
civil servants behind him, particularly Mr Roy Brown and Ms Anna Platt
in his private office, who were immensely helpful with the process. We
should pay tribute to them, and we should also pay tribute to Sir
Neil’s private staff, who have been much involved over the
years. It is great to thank them for all that they have
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000024">We
are close to establishing the new trust. As of yesterday, we appointed
a chief executive or chief clerk, Major Johnny Longbottom, a
Territorial Army officer who has had similar roles in the Ministry of
Defence. He served for six months in Afghanistan and is well qualified
and well suited in every way to be the new chief clerk or chief
executive—we will decide on the title later. Mr Speaker has
provided accommodation in Parliament; funding is on its way; our
application to the Charity Commission to become a charitable
incorporated organisation is in hand, and I hope that that will be done
reasonably swiftly. Most of the necessary practicalities to establish
the scheme in its new guise are in hand, and I very much hope that when
the House returns in October the first course will be ready to
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000025">At
a meeting last night, there were many applicants wanting to join the
scheme. They can do so in any of the three services at a junior or
senior level, or they can go to the Royal College of Defence Studies,
although that course is full at the moment. We are ready to go as soon
as the House returns in October, the first major event being a two-day
course at Shrivenham from 11 to 13 November. We should be in

swiftly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000026">Other
hon. Members want to take part in the debate, so I will not detain the
Chamber unduly, but it is worth reiterating that the scheme has done
great work. During 
<?notus-xml column=277?>the post-war period, plenty of Members were ex-military and there was a
strong military ethos in Parliament, but 25 years ago, Sir Neil Thorne
correctly identified that that ethos had disappeared and that knowledge
of the armed forces had declined significantly. He put that right by
establishing the scheme, and the fact that we now have such a good
understanding of the armed forces and defence in Parliament is largely
due to its
introduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000027">We
hope that we are facing a time when, after Afghanistan, we will have
fewer deployments and fewer soldiers, sailors and airmen on operations
for many years to come. Again, there is at least a risk that interest
in and knowledge of our defence capability will decline in the next 20
years. I believe that the continuing armed forces parliamentary scheme
will play an important role in maintaining interest in the armed forces
even when we are not engaged in kinetic warfare around the world. We
have as huge a role to play in the future as we had in the
past.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000028">We
must thank Sir Neil for the past 25 years. Thanks to the initiative of
the Secretary of State, Mr Speaker and the Lord Speaker, we are
establishing the trust as a way forward so that in 25 years when we in
this Chamber will, sadly, no longer be here, there will be another
debate in this same Chamber saying how well the scheme has worked in
the interim 25 years. I am most grateful to Sir Neil and to all who
have been involved, and I look forward very much to the great honour of

echo some of what has already been said, particularly about
Sir Neil Thorne, his wife Sheila and the dog—I have
forgotten its name, so I must apologise to Sir Neil. They have been a

constituents and, on a broader front, to the state as well, which is
important. Reference has been made to defence of the realm and that

elected in June 2001 when people said we did not have a real job to do

non-political, and in that sense it is non-political, but at another

and also helps others to understand the political process. Sometimes
when we go along to such things we have to sing for our supper. All of
a sudden, a major is giving us 200 troops, saying, “Go on, there
they are. Tell them why they are here. You have a go, because I have
been trying to explain it to them—you have a go.” It is
educative in that sense, but people also understand us, because they
can quiz us. We are a resource. If we participate, we have to make
ourselves available as a resource, because it is not a one-way street.

at different levels who say, “They are a pain and now, maybe
they know a bit too much. They are going to places, finding out things
and coming back with”—what were described earlier
as—“pesky, awkward questions.” Some people have a
slightly ambivalent view of the scheme, but that is all about the
friction that makes for the value of the process.

When I first started on the scheme, I went to the training college and
spent a week doing basic training. It was fantastic—very, very
interesting. I came away with a little card that all soldiers were
given at that time—I was doing it with the Army. The card was
about what they were trained to do. It was about their loyalty and
their sacrifice, about them putting themselves in a particular
position, and therefore about how the Government should support them. I
have it in my wallet, but I am not allowed to use visual aids in the

we came to discuss the covenant, it was interesting. We have been
discussing it, in my experience, right the way through the scheme, and

experiences, such as dropping into the Borneo jungle and being cooked a

have friends in various militaries across the world. Some are 
<?notus-xml column=280?>now commanding militaries in countries that are potentially, and
actually, in conflict with one another. I now know some of the
commanders of the business that is going on. Knowing each other gives a
different context to trying to understand how one can incentivise a
change. If someone has an idea of how the Chinese think, and they are
sitting next to a Chinese general on one side, a Pakistani general on
the other, a German and an awkward Norwegian, and having a debate, it

parliamentary scheme gives us that, sometimes by accident. We
participate with the military, and they are in coalitions all the time.
They are in the context of the places in which they work. All of a
sudden, we can be somewhere or another, and someone announces,
“There are some Chilean soldiers”, and we have to deal
with them. One thinks, “Chile? What do I know about
Chile?” It is an education in that respect, and, again, if
someone goes through the scheme in all of its different manifestations,
it provides a breadth of experience that could not be bought anywhere
else. It is a life experience, but more importantly, it is an education
in the ability to understand not only immediate political questions but
the context in which they operate.</hs_Para>

future, there will be a debate about whether uniforms should be worn.
Perhaps others will raise that issue today. I think it is really
important to wear them—I made a point earlier about boots
melting. It allows us to begin to understand what other people are
doing, and we should not abandon that idea. Sometimes we should mix in,
because otherwise, people say, “Which one shall we
shoot?” “The one without the uniform on”. That is
not terribly helpful, because it means we are not part of the group.
People say, “What you on, sir?”, “What are you
doing, sir?”, “Who’s he?”, “Is that
the armed forces pension scheme, sir?” I say, “I’m
on the armed forces parliamentary scheme —what are you
on?”—they ask because I am ancient, I suppose. We can
then have a debate, because in a sense we are not different; we are
just another dimension of them. Therefore, we can discuss things with
them in a different way.</hs_Para>

also begin to understand which way is up. It is interesting to watch
Members of Parliament learn how to iron—it is like basic
training for some of them—how to put a beret on and all the rest
of it. That is good entertainment, but it is more than that, because we
can understand some of the things that we are giving people, how they
work, and what it is all about. It is also about their ethos and what
they invest in all that. We can begin to understand why that is
important to them.</hs_Para>

finish by saying that we are having a debate about changing the mixture
of regulars and reserves. One thing that is interesting to me about the
scheme is that we would do 22 days before, but we are now talking about
15 days. A decade ago, people would say, “You are just signing
up like the regulars”. The scheme provides another way of
beginning to understand better what we are asking people to
do—to dislocate themselves from their community for short
periods of time. For those who not done it before, it gives a limited
insight into what that might mean and what we might be asking people to

the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray) for securing the debate. When
I arrived in this place in 2010, I was delighted to see that the armed
forces parliamentary scheme was in place. Why? Just before I was
elected, I attended the funeral in Redditch of a brave young soldier
who had died in Afghanistan and who was the same age as my son. As I
sat in the church with hundreds of others, I realised how little I knew
about the armed forces and how they operate. The scheme has given me
the opportunity to learn about the Army, meet the troops and travel the
country learning about the Army. I have had the opportunity to join the
Army at many locations, including Shrivenham, Devon, Windsor, Sandhurst
and, indeed, Afghanistan. I have met soldiers at all levels, and one of
the highlights was training with the officers on the downs near
Sandhurst. I slept in a derelict house and took part in exercises with
them. I can tell you, Mr Walker, that there was not much sleep had

going to Afghanistan was a massive experience and one that I will
remember for the rest of my life. Landing in Camp Bastion was an

happens there and to meet our troops, including some from

to home, 37 Signals has a base in Redditch, which I visited in my early

from, I had no idea, as they had never heard of the scheme before. But
we quickly moved on and now we are all great friends. Last year, I
joined them on their away weekend in Staffordshire, taking part in most
of the exercises—I think that I missed the six-mile run. I hope

Jubilee Room, I think—and I met Sir Neil, who informed me about
the scheme. From the outset, I was keen to hear more, as in the past I
had served with the Ulster Defence Regiment for three years and in the
Territorial Army Royal Artillery for eleven and a half years as a
part-time soldier. I really enjoyed my time in the Army. The scheme
gave me the chance to see it from a different perspective—that
of a Member of Parliament—and to understand what the soldiers
wanted us to do for them. That was always
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000056">The
armed forces parliamentary scheme gave me, along with other Members of
Parliament, a chance to join after passing a strict medical, taking
part in a physical exercise and having an interview with Sir Neil and
his good lady. I was privileged to be able to participate in the
scheme. Like other hon. Members, I place on the record my thanks to Sir
Neil and Sheila for their courtesy and good manners, for the attention
and support that they give everyone on the scheme and, in particular,
for the support that they have given to

was able to enrol in the scheme, which facilitated visits to Ministry
of Defence locations to meet service personnel and to hear what
soldiers wanted and what their views were. It is always good to talk to
a soldier. The officers will always give us the picture as they see
it—I do not say that as a criticism of course—but the
soldiers will always tell us exactly what the position is. We are able
to hear from the soldiers what their opinions are, and it is good to
hear them, because then we have both sets of opinions and we can mould
our thoughts about how to represent soldiers in Parliament on the
information that we
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000058">I
had an introduction to the defence academy at Shrivenham, where I was
able to see the bigger picture. We had an opportunity to see where the
focus of attention would be in the future. Is it oil? Is it water? What
are the mineral prospects for the world? We looked at Asia, Africa, the
middle east, Alaska, Antarctica—all the big issues. The hope was
that we would then be better able to understand the role of the British
forces and the pressures that they are

had the chance to go to BATUK in Kenya—the British Army Training
Unit Kenya—as well as going to Canada and Cyprus. That was good
to do not because we were getting out of the country and going on a

in Kenya and the new training camp that the 
<?notus-xml column=283?>British Army was creating and where the focus of attention was in east
Africa. There was the chance to see—I had never seen this
before—the tank formations and training in Canada and to see in
Cyprus the decompression of our soldiers coming back from Afghanistan.
All those things give us a bigger flavour of all aspects of life in the
armed forces. I had a week with the 1st Mercian at Catterick, and as

interesting thing was that no matter where I went in the world, I
always met someone from Northern Ireland who was either fighting a war
or cleaning up afterwards. We have a tradition of being a soldiering
nation. It was wonderful to meet people from Northern Ireland wherever
I went. I met a guy in Kenya—just sitting and having a cup of
coffee—who was from Newtownards. On the way to Afghanistan, I
met a guy who came from Comber. All these experiences and all the
people we met helped to shape our feelings about the armed forces. I

Parliament.</hs_Para>

visit gave us a chance to see what it was like to be in Afghanistan and
how the soldiers were performing and to get feedback from them about
things there. Whenever people are in Afghanistan, they are there for
six to nine months. We can also ask them how it feels to be away from
their families. Therefore, we got a bigger picture of the
soldier’s life and the issues in relation to their families back
home. We had a chance to visit the army and police training camp at
Lashkar Gah, and we were able to ask questions in Westminster about
when the police training college would be completed. It was to be
funded with $6 million. Again, we were able to ask the Ministry of

the operation just about defeating the Taliban? When I went to
Afghanistan, my idea was—I say this quite

persuading them that there was no danger in the allies and what they
were doing. It was about winning hearts and minds. My perspective

was a privilege to meet soldiers, to hear their concerns at first hand

able to see exactly what our troops are going through and to get their
perspective on the strategic defence and security review that took
place. It was a wonderful experience to hear what the officers and the
soldiers—the rank and file—thought of the strategic
defence and security review. We could then feed that into the process
when we came back to Parliament. That was another
opportunity.</hs_Para>

forces parliamentary scheme is a tremendous scheme. It is being

of the families and see the work that the welfare service does for
them. We have SSAFA—the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families
Association. It has people strategically placed all around the

work at home, but it was good to see its work on active duty, where our

on HMS Richmond with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:15:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

coming up from Malta into Menorca. The ships’ company had been
off the horn of Africa, dealing with piracy. We had meetings with not
only the junior ratings, but the leading ratings, as well as the
officers. I learnt how important it is in this day and age, with the
way that international conflicts take place, that a lawyer is onboard.
One of the serving officers onboard—the chief executive
officer—was a lawyer and able to say to her commanding officer,
“I think you need to be very careful about how you operate here,
because you run the risk of finding yourself involved in
something.” The ship’s company were absolutely petrified
of being sent back to Somalia and the horn of Africa, because it would
have mucked up their leave arrangements. I am told that if there is one
thing a commanding officer totally dreads, it is having to say,
“Sorry, chaps, we’re not going back on Thursday. You have
to go out and do a further week  or

long time before what he has achieved so far, and what he will continue

scheme is significant, but I want to make another point that has not
come up so far. My first contact with the forces was a difficult one. I
was the Health Minister who closed down the military hospitals, and I
was not terribly popular at the time. One of the arguments used was,
“You just don’t understand the forces,” which was
valid, but the reason for the closures was that the royal colleges were
saying that it was no longer possible to carry out the medical training
in the way it needed to be done, and the NHS needed to make a
contribution. Some 14 years on, the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine
is in my constituency, and we are in the reverse position of the NHS
having to learn from the medical services provided there. That
interaction is
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091135000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000097">I
then served on the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs for eight years,
and on the Select Committee on Defence, but visits as part of the
scheme have a very different flavour from the ones we do for Select
Committee or ministerial work—the relationships are different.
They key thing about the scheme—I was with the Navy—is
that it affords the enormous and rare luxury of suddenly being able to
spend four or five days thinking about only one subject. It also
provides contact with people from the captain to the cooks on board,
who really say what they think, and even though they 
<?notus-xml column=289?>are not our voters we feel that we had better listen to them and take
note. It is the nature of that exchange that is so
important.</hs_Para><hs_ParaIndent UID="13091135000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091135000117">I
want to make brief reference to sponsorship and transparency. In the
modern world, such a scheme must be absolutely transparent. Just like
my fellow member of the Defence Committee, my hon. Friend the Member
for Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney (Mr Havard), I do not think anyone has
ever tried to say, “This is what we think you should be doing.
This is a kind of sponsorship”—that might, of course, be
just be a reflection of how insignificant we really are. This is a
terrible admission: up until the point of the discussions on the scheme
I had no idea that it was not just the Ministry of Defence that was
picking the bill up. I had absolutely no idea that sponsorship was
involved. I think that that was one of those rare occasions when
ignorance is a sign of success.</hs_ParaIndent>

years’ standing on the former shadow defence team—he is

that people have been given privileged access to members of the armed

understanding that that privilege would not be abused. When one
considers the very large numbers of colleagues of all parties who have
been through the scheme, it is remarkable that there have been hardly

fortunate enough to be parliamentary members of the RCDS are taken on

Many people would have walked away if they found that they had to dig

mine were similar. I do not come from a military background. My father
had done national service, and that was the sum total of my experience.
How could I genuinely engage in defence debates, or even begin to
understand those serving our country? It has been made abundantly clear
today, and on other occasions, that the defence of the realm is greatly
important to the future of this nation. How could I really begin to

I first bumped into Sir Neil, he said, “So, will you be
joining?” I did, much to the regret, I suspect, of the Royal

I entered at a time when we were in the throes of going into the
conflict in Iraq in 2002 and 2003 and when there was a reconfiguration
of the scheme. I must admit that I enjoyed the scheme.

different interpretation of fun. In my last session, which took place

who have abseiled, they will be aware that when they are at the top

now, we are talking about understanding—or at least beginning to
understand—what people go through when they serve our country.
The scheme offers a genuine opportunity to mix with all ranks. It helps
us to understand what it means when people are doing a tour of duty and
what they are missing, because they are away from their family. That
understanding is vital to people such as myself and many others who
enter the House. We  are not like
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:45:31"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Colchester (Sir Bob

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:46:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) who, like me,
initially had no idea how the system was funded. As I have said, I have
never at any point been approached by anyone who has sponsored the
scheme to say what it was they were looking for. Young guys serving in
the Royal Marines have, justifiably and rightly, put me right about one
or two things. The scheme was clear-cut and open, but, regrettably, it
had to change because of the time in which we live.</hs_Para>

am delighted that the new scheme will have a comparable number of

and multi-day sessions. I missed out on a five-day session between
Gibraltar and Cyprus. I will say nothing more, other than that I was
somewhat relieved that I did not manage to make the session—I
could not afford the time. There was an incident that caused colleagues
who did take part to laugh deeply on their return. I actually picked it
up on the news in the evening and realised how lucky I was not to have

let me express some further sentiments—they are
heartfelt—about the contribution to the scheme made by Sir Neil
Thorne. Twenty-five years ago, we lived in a very different sort of
world. We still had in this place a large number of Members who had
served in the second world war or had pretty contemporary experience of
national service. Sir Neil rightly identified that that would not be
the case forever, and that is where we are today.</hs_Para>

Neil designed a scheme, 25 years ago, that would ensure that Members of

forces and how defence works. That is important because, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:49:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) said, although we get involved
with a whole raft of things here, the most important thing that we do
in Parliament—as it has always been—is connected with the
armed forces. That is absolutely central to what Parliament is all
about, and it is just as well that we have among us some 
<?notus-xml column=294?>understanding of defence and of how those who populate defence conduct
their business. That is what the armed forces parliamentary scheme has
been all about.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for North Wiltshire (Mr Gray) first on securing
the debate; secondly, on his hard work up to this point in securing the
scheme’s future; and, thirdly and most importantly, on his
election as chairman of the armed forces parliamentary trust. I fear
that he is something of a rarity in Parliament today in having a really
detailed understanding of the armed forces, and I can think of no
better person to take the scheme forward to its next stage.</hs_Para>

My hon. Friend the Member for New Forest East (Dr Lewis) made an
interesting point about trust and openness. I repeat that the world was
different 25 years ago. Today we are much more open and transparent in
how we approach issues, and if there was any difficulty at all 25 years
ago in exposing parliamentarians to what sailors, soldiers and airmen
got up to, that is far less the case today. One of the hidden benefits
of the scheme is that it allows that level of transparency, and my hon.
Friend is absolutely right to say that the number of instances of abuse
of trust on the scheme has been very
small<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:52:12"></hs_TimeCode> over

the extraordinary vignettes that we have heard, which were terribly
colourful, I fear that my contribution to this debate will be rather
more prosaic. Nevertheless, it is important to put on the record how we

understand that we are in a different place today from 25 years ago.
Public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T10:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>
expectations of bodies that interface with parliamentarians are
different from what they were in the 1980s. It is interesting—is
it not?—that we should be discussing lobbying and transparency
in this fortnight. It is appropriate that we should be making real
inroads into the next stages of this scheme during this short return to

would worry people—if not the public, then certainly the
press—in relation to the scheme.</hs_Para>

Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) in attempting to review the position of
all-party groups, and of the recommendations that he has made. Although
the scheme is not an all-party group, it is nevertheless an
organisation that involves parliamentarians and commercial sponsors.
Potentially, therefore, if the Ministry of Defence and Parliament had
not taken the gardening action that I think has been appropriate, the
scheme might have been open to criticism, however ill-founded. All of

extremely useful for the men and women who serve in our armed forces to
know that Members of Parliament are not a race apart and do
not—at least in the main—have horns growing from their
head. When one gets past the inevitable question or joke about
one’s expenses, including quips such as, “You’ll

reassuring. I am talking about extraordinary valuable citizens in the
armed forces—they are citizens like no others. We owe it to them

understand what makes them

am sure that the scheme will be hugely popular. I am given a lot of
assurance in making that assertion by the fact that 35 parliamentarians
have enlisted for what we might call the interim scheme, which is
currently operational. It is in no way a substitute for the previous
scheme or indeed the scheme that will succeed it, but at least it
allows Members of Parliament to have some sort of continuity of
interaction with the armed forces. I am delighted that in this
interregnum we have been able to facilitate a programme of visits to
military establishments, so that we can continue that programme now

grateful for the opportunity to bring this matter to the attention of

matter in Wales, so I will speak fairly generally because I do not want

also put on record my appreciation and recognition of the important
role that national parks play in many of our communities. National
parks bring in people, boost tourism and contribute to the life of
local communities. This debate is not about the relative merits of
national parks but about national park planning, and the distinction is
important because, whether or not it is perceived, local businesses and
householders across my part of Britain feel frustrated, and I know
others share a similar
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091136000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091136000027">I

businesses and jobs; secondly, accountability and confusion within the

on the impact on business, today’s debate is fortuitous in some
ways, because the Federation of Small Businesses in Wales has produced

each of those findings is negative. I will highlight three of the

have some sympathy with national park planning officers because, in a
sense, they are charged only with the implementation of policy, which
is sometimes made some distance away from where they sit, but it is
important to stress that national parks are a little bit more than
simply custodians of the landscape. We are not talking about
Yellowstone national park; we are talking about quite densely populated
areas. What makes the national parks is the population and businesses

Hart:</Member></B> I am grateful for that intervention. We can look at
it in two ways. First, the inward investment linked to national parks
is hugely valuable in of our adjoining constituencies, but—this
is my penultimate point—at the moment there is no provision in
the planning application system for officers to consider social and
economic factors. Ultimately, landscape and ecological factors always
take precedence, which is a

National parks do not benefit from having a democratic process. Does he

my recommendations. Although elected councillors sit on national park
planning authorities, I think members of the public feel that those
authorities are still somewhat out of the reach of the normal
democratic grasp. That might be an ill-founded belief, but I think that
national parks are a law unto themselves and there is no way for people

Opperman</B> (Hexham) (Con):</Member> I congratulate my hon. Friend on
securing this debate. I disagree with him on one point. Northumberland
national park is equally as good as, if not better than, Yellowstone or
anything else the Americans have to offer, and it is consulting on the
£10 million Sill project. Northumberland proposes to create the
project with a number of local partners, and it is specifically
considering the economic benefits, which surely makes the point that
some national parks are considering the wider impact of what they are
trying to

point. My hon. Friend is
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:05:27"></hs_TimeCode>, but the
1995 Act, which I will quote in a minute, prescribes in law the
requirement that where there is conflict between economic and
ecological factors, a national park planning authority has to give
precedence to the ecological consideration. Whether Northumberland
national park is keeping to the letter of the law is a matter for it,

the beauties of this debate is that the solution is simple to deliver.
The Minister does not have 
<?notus-xml column=299?>to have an argument with the Treasury; it can be done. There is an Act
of Parliament that needs a simple, one-line amendment to free up the
expertise to which my hon. Friend refers and to reassure businesses and

of factors than is sometimes the

the Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) said, although
national parks might argue that they are democratic bodies because of
the presence of elected councillors, there is a feeling that the
planning system is impenetrable and at one remove from the reach that a
local authority planning department may provide. The FSB report
reflects the absolute conviction that the planning system is slow,

my hon. Friend on securing this debate. I draw his attention to the
circumstances in New Forest national park, which crosses counties and
several local authority boundaries. Particularly on the periphery of
the park, there is exactly the confusion that he identifies. Local
businesses and residents are not quite sure whether they should apply
to the local authority or to the national park for planning permission.

there is a simple solution to that, too. I suspect the solution might
be indigestible for the Minister, because I can see no real
justification for two planning authorities operating in the same area.
It is perfectly possible for one planning authority to operate a
standard system and an enhanced system for an area that happens to fall

alone to meet an affordable housing target. The subsidy is stalling
development and putting developers off undertaking valuable work, which
is having an impact on jobs in the building trade in the areas
affected. Worst of all, the subsidy is causing the affordable housing

conflict—there will, almost inevitably, with every application
anybody makes, be an environmental and economic
conflict—national park officers are bound by the 1995 Act to err
in favour of the conservation element. Even if the conservation
downside is tiny, and the economic upside is huge, officers are bound
by the letter of the Act to take decisions that could, in some cases,
be bad for the economic and social well-being of the communities they
are there to serve, although I do not, by the way, blame officers for
interpreting this part of the Act in the way they do. However, economic
considerations are crucial; they are definitely crucial in my national
park and, I suspect, in everybody else’s too. At the moment,
however, they are not getting the proper airing they deserve.</hs_Para>

leaves the Minister with three solutions to chew over. First, he could
scrap the affordable housing subsidy altogether—I think he will
probably just let that go through to the wicketkeeper—or he
could at least make a distinction between rural and urban developments.
The affordable housing policy tends to favour urban developments and to
put rural ones at risk, and he could explore that.</hs_Para>

the Minister should merge the national park and local authority
planning functions, thereby saving a vast amount of public money and
applying greater consistency to the planning process, which ratepayers
will appreciate. If that is not possible, he should make provision for
national park decisions, taken by an unelected body, to be called in
and reviewed by the local authority planning body, which is, of course,
democratically electable. That should be a free service. If somebody
puts in an application that gets a perverse response, there should be a
localised system of appeal to support the area’s ratepayers. I
can see no obstacle to that suggestion.</hs_Para>

the Minister could amend the 1995 Act  to give economic and
social criteria the same weight  as it currently gives
environmental criteria. That recommendation is simple, cheap,
deliverable, practical and logical, so it will probably never happen,
but, none the less, I put it to the Minister that he could consider and
perhaps discuss it, although I realise he cannot make up policy in
Westminster Hall.</hs_Para>

hope my comments have been fair to national park planning officers, who
have a devil of a task in trying to satisfy their various customers.
However, I also hope I have alerted the House to the fact that all is
not well in the national park planning system, and there are great
frustrations. People are trying to do their best as part of our
economic regeneration and recovery, but, sadly, they see national parks
as an obstacle to that progress, rather than an asset. I hope the
Minister can give us some encouragement in that
regard.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/C262F2AEEB317E8366180E2E6C5A6F08AA609F74" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="11 September 2013">Wednesday

you nor I, Mr Walker, are fortunate enough to have national parks in
our constituencies—we would be blessed if we did. It is
important to say that national parks are true jewels in the crown of
the English and Welsh landscapes, as all hon. Members will agree. They
are some of the most beautiful parts of the country, and it is right
that we accord them a different status from other beautiful landscapes
and approach development issues slightly differently.</hs_Para>

is why the national planning policy framework, which made substantial
changes to many planning policies and reduced the amount of planning
policy dramatically, nevertheless includes strong protections for
national parks. The framework stresses that valued landscapes should be
protected and enhanced and that great weight should be given to
conserving landscape and scenic beauty in national parks. It also says
that planning permission should be refused for major developments in
these designated areas, except in exceptional circumstances and where
it can be demonstrated that the proposals are in the public
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091136000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091136000061">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:19:10"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to start by saying that everyone who is here for the
debate considers national parks something to be tremendously proud of,
which we all want to protect. We all understand that what makes
national parks work as economic and social communities is often their
beauty. The beauty of the national park is the business of the national
park and of the communities within it. Even the people who want to
develop activity within national parks recognise that the chief source
of their livelihood is the parks themselves and the beauty of their
landscapes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091136000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091136000062"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:20:25"></hs_TimeCode>It
is important, therefore, to protect national parks; but that does not
mean, nor does anything in the national planning policy framework
imply, that there should not be economic and social development, and
growth, in national parks. Some hon. Members may have heard or read
that I got into a little hot water at the annual general meeting of my
old friends at the Campaign to Protect Rural England, when I talked
about the danger of making rural communities into museum pieces, not so
much protected as embalmed. That applies to many communities within
national parks; they will retain their life and appeal only if they are
allowed to change and develop, and if people can get jobs and set up
businesses. That is a necessary underpinning to national parks not just
as wildernesses, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:18:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire pointed
out—not like Yosemite—but  as living, breathing
sets of communities. There are 300,000 people living in our national
parks, and the combined turnover of all those parks combined is more
than £10 billion. They are hives of activity, industry and
economic creativity, which we must
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091136000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091136000063">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend has therefore made some observations and suggestions about
how better to reconcile the goal of protecting the landscape of
national parks with that of supporting sensible, sustainable
development within them. His fundamental complaint, perhaps, is that
because national park planning authorities are not democratically
accountable to local people—because they are not elected—

<?notus-xml column=303?>they are somehow less able to achieve the balance that local people
want. Often those local people have moved to the park because they love
the landscapes, so they are not indifferent to them, but nevertheless
they want balance between sensible development and protection of the
landscape.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091136000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091136000064">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>
is some good news. Things may not be as bleak as my hon. Friend
suggests. First, as he will be aware, local authorities and parish
councils can nominate people to the boards of national parks, so there
is a link with the local democratically elected authorities. Secondly,
and probably more importantly—I respect the view that
nominations are a pretty shoddy form of
representation— 41 communities within national parks are
currently working on neighbourhood plans, the new possibility that we
created in the Localism Act 2011 to enable a community to draw up a
plan for its own development. That is a profoundly democratic,
grass-roots, accountable initiative, and it is great news that so many
communities in national parks have embraced it. Perhaps, however, it
reveals the very frustration that my hon. Friend talked
about—the fact that people do not currently feel able to express
themselves through national park planning policy and the decisions that
are made.</hs_Para>

have heard my hon. Friend’s point that localism, which the
Government passionately believe in, and which after a long gestation
and difficult birth is now taking root in communities throughout the
country, may not be as fully expressed in national parks as it might
be, and that we should perhaps consider ways to help national parks to
reflect that policy more fully.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also talked about the affordable housing subsidy, which I
know relates to his national park. I remind the House that, sadly,
although I of course have imperial ambitions, I am not the Planning
Minister for Wales. I am but the Planning Minister for England, and
would be very nervous—especially when
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:25:09"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

my letter to my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:25:31"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Carmarthen West and South Pembrokeshire. I
myself often find such letters quite hard to understand, and perhaps
that is the point—perhaps that is sometimes intended. However,
in layman’s language the paragraph that he read out means that
if the cost of the subsidy that developers are being asked to provide
towards 
<?notus-xml column=304?>affordable housing makes the development unaffordable—if it is
something that will never make them any money—that is a reason
to challenge the subsidy. Putting too great a burden on a development
in the form of the various contributions that are asked for, with the
result that no one will go ahead with it, is shooting oneself in the
foot and means there is a need to look at the issue again, and that is
a basis on which to challenge such subsidies. That is what viability
means; it is a term designed to obfuscate, but it really means that if
the requirements mean the development will not happen, those involved
should look at the matter again. There is much in law, in the national
planning policy framework and in more recent measures to give a basis
for challenging any such arrangements that will drive development
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:26:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091136000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091136000068">Perhaps

issues? One of those issues would be the balance between growth,
economic and social development and the protection of the landscape,
and whether current legislation properly captures what we are trying to
achieve and what communities in national parks want. Another would be
whether the current arrangements for national parks planning policy
fully reflect the desire for a more localist planning policy. Also,
perhaps we might explore whether, through some of the methods suggested
by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T11:26:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

I want to talk about Sri Lanka. The horrific civil war that waged for
26 years in Sri Lanka ended in 2009. There were concerns about human
rights abuses and war crimes, committed by both the Sri Lankan
Government and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. International
attention was captured by allegations of the systematic targeting of
civilian hospitals within a designated no-missile zone. Video evidence
exists of extreme cruelty, including beheadings and rape. Such images
shocked the international community and left a permanent scar on Sri
Lanka’s human rights record. It was absolutely correct that the
allegations were investigated and that due redress followed those
investigations. To examine events during the period from 2002 to May
2009, President Mahinda Rajapaksa established the Lessons Learnt and
Reconciliation Commission, which was welcomed by many civilians.
Implementing the commission’s recommendations, however, has been
both slow and selective. Post-2009, grave concerns still exist about
military engagement in civilian activities in the north, including
sexual abuse, the situation of detainees from the war, the impact of
forcible disappearances, impunity, hatred and violence against

President Mahinda Rajapaksa to force him to show that there is a

the hon. Member for Rotherham (Sarah Champion)—I want to say
“my hon. Friend”—for her speech. It is a pleasure

Members for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) and
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:49:12"></hs_TimeCode>for City of
Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods), I was at the Commonwealth
Parliamentary Association conference last week and found it a

to take part or speak as much as I did, which is probably the case for
many of us, but some of what we heard at the conference could not go
unanswered.</hs_Para>

the Commonwealth, such as the CPA conference, are great moments.
Bringing parliamentarians across the Commonwealth together is
completely appropriate, to remind us of the shared values and history
that we enjoy. We found a lot of consensus among Commonwealth
parliamentarians on a range of issues. I attended a number of sessions,
including one on the empowerment of women, although that went a little
bit agley, with a contribution on the legalisation of drugs, which did
not seem appropriate to a debate on female empowerment in business,
unless there was a niche interest. We also had an interesting session
on caring for our elderly population, which was a bit more orderly. The
female parliamentarians also had many enjoyable hours in the
Commonwealth women’s conference, from which of course we men
were barred. That aside, it was an interesting
gathering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:50:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000041">In
the plenary sessions, bearing in mind the Commonwealth charter and the
provisions on democracy, we had some interesting discussions about
self-determination and the democratic rights of the citizens of
Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. There was strong support for the

we quickly agreed on the Falklands. The British delegation was united
in support of the rights of people in the Falkland Islands and
Gibraltar to determine their own destiny and

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:51:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

do not speak regularly on LGBT issues in this country because,
fortunately, we operate a “live and let live” policy.
Rights have advanced greatly in the past few years, certainly under the
previous Government and hopefully under this Government with regards to
equal marriage, so the issue is not one on which I would usually
engage, although I am supportive of those rights. We almost take them
for granted in this country, people of my generation in particular but,
given some of the contributions at the conference after the speech by
the hon. Member for Bristol East, I could not help but participate in
the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:53:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000045">We
heard some quite frightening speeches, in particular from Cameroon and,
to an extent, from Ugandan representatives. It reminded me that,
although we have much in common throughout the Commonwealth, with many
shared values, there is a great deal that divides us, and we should not
pretend that those divisions do not exist. Furthermore, it is incumbent
on all parliamentarians from this country and from other parts of the
Commonwealth to make it clear when we disagree. In response to comments
from a Cameroonian delegate regarding homosexuality, in which she
stated that it went against the laws of nature, there was a sharp
intake of breath from our delegation and many others in the room,
particularly the Canadians, who also spoke on the issue. I therefore
felt the need to speak in that
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000046">Appropriately
enough, we were in South Africa, a country that knows all too well the
history of dividing one group from another to the disadvantage of all.
When we attack one individual’s rights, ultimately we have an
impact on everyone else’s rights. I felt the need to intervene
in that debate, and to point out things with which I am sure everyone
in the Chamber would agree. We do not want to preach to those
countries, and we have a stain on our own history in terms of what
people have thought—not so long ago in this country we thought
that a role for women in politics was inappropriate and that people in
Africa were incapable of governing themselves. We know about such
stains on our history, which I made mention of and about which we are
embarrassed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:54:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000047">Similarly,
as I said in Johannesburg last week, even today in our own country,
which is a modern, liberal-looking democracy, as parliamentarians we
come across people who still hold quite frightening views. Our
responsibility is to challenge such views. I do not pretend that our
country does not have people who think some of those 

<?notus-xml column=312?>things, but we have a level of protection for rights, which have
expanded in recent years, of which we should be proud. I therefore felt
that it was important to speak up on the issue and to make it clear
that, while we have stains on our own history, we have learned the
lessons. It is not about preaching, but about simply standing up for
the rights of minorities
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:55:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000048">If
there was one glimmer of hope on the LGBT issue, it came in the
contribution of one of the Ugandan parliamentarians. He seemed to be
saying, “Well, we know that our views on this issue are not as
developed as yours. Maybe, in a couple of decades’ time, this
won’t be an issue for us.” That seemed a strange
admission, almost as if he was saying, “We know we are wrong,
and in 30 years’ time we won’t be wrong.” It was
an odd contribution. I spoke to that parliamentarian afterwards,
however, and he was at pains to assure me that the particular piece of
legislation before the Ugandan Parliament, of which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:56:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

debate divided the Commonwealth—sadly, as older Commonwealth
against new Commonwealth—and comments that were supportive of
what the hon. Member for Bristol East had said tended to come from our
delegation. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T14:56:38"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Friend the Member for South East Cambridgeshire (Sir James
Paice) made an excellent contribution, and there were contributions
from Canada and of New Zealand. Samantha Sacramento, the Minister for
Equality from Gibraltar, made a fine contribution as well, but for me
the best speech came from the podium, from the Deputy Speaker of the
South African Parliament. Deputy Speaker Mfeketo made a brilliant
speech in which she spoke passionately about how the experience of
South Africa was relevant to LGBT rights; in that country, they know
about the impact of one community being divided off and having special
laws passed against
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000050">Such
comments were more powerful coming from another African politician,
rather than, sad to say, from a white parliamentarian. Many
contributions, such as that of a parliamentarian from Mauritius, were
in essence, “Well, you gave us these views. You came here in
colonial times with those views. You came with your Bible and told us
that this was wrong, and yet now you are preaching to us.” All
the contributions from Canada, New Zealand and the UK were of limited
impact compared with the fine speech of Deputy Speaker

want to comment briefly on Sri Lanka. I heard the hon. Lady’s
call for a boycott. I have engaged in issues arising from the
Israel-Palestine conflict, but I have always been against boycotts as a
way of trying to solve such issues. The Commonwealth Parliamentary
Association’s conference next year will be in Cameroon. Given
some of its views on the rights of LGBT people and women, it could be
said that we should not attend it, but boycotts are not necessarily the
solution. What Prime Minister Harper has done in Ottawa was bold, but I
am not sure that a boycott would be in our interest. I sometimes think
it is better to attend such meetings and to make the case on the ground
in the country concerned. We must be careful about boycotts, although I
entirely concur with the hon. Lady’s comments on human rights in
Sri Lanka. Indeed,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:00:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

hon. Members may be unaware of Khuram Shaikh’s case. At
Christmas 2011, he went on holiday with his partner, Victoria, to
Tangalle in Sri Lanka. At a Christmas day party at their hotel, a
number of what the Sri Lankans would call political goons entered the
hotel and started to cause trouble. My constituent was stabbed and shot
dead. Victoria was taken to a basement room and gang-raped. I know that
because I visited the crime scene in Sri Lanka and have spoken to
witnesses. 
<?notus-xml column=314?>People in my office have met Victoria, I have read witness statements,
and the Sri Lankan police have shown me medical reports that prove
those points. Obviously, Khuram’s family are extremely
distressed. We are approaching two years since the murder but no one
has been charged. Khuram’s father, who is also my constituent,
visits his grave every day and his brother, Naser, campaigns hard for

turn to the human rights aspect of the case. We are all well aware of
the Commonwealth charter, which refers, among other things, to the rule
of law, a key principle that Commonwealth countries are expected to
abide by. We all know of glaring examples of Sri Lanka not following
that principle: the recent impeachment of its chief justice;
journalists being murdered or kidnapped, as my hon. Friend pointed out;
the disappearance of people who do not agree with the Government; and
systematic political interference with cases in the justice
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000060">The
lack of justice for the murder of Khuram Shaikh is an example that
encapsulates Sri Lanka’s refusal to follow the rule of law. It
is a matter of public record that one of Khuram’s alleged
murderers is a local politician who is close to President Rajapaksa and
his son. Indeed, such political goons operate and deliver on behalf of
the President’s political party in Sri
Lanka.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000061">The
allegation in Sri Lanka is that the case will not come to trial. We are
approaching the second anniversary of the murder, but the suspects have
not been charged. The rule of law is not being applied, because those
people are being protected by the Sri Lankan President. Khuram’s
case has taken on significance in Sri Lanka because it encapsulates the
problems that many Sri Lankans face at the hands of their own
Government. There is no doubt in my mind that the Sri Lankan Government
do not respect human rights, and there is no doubt that the rule of law
is not being applied. Khuram’s case exemplifies
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000062">I
turn to what the British Government can or should do about these
issues. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has been very helpful in
pursuing the case, and I am pleased that our Queen has decided not to
attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government summit in November. There
is a political dimension to the matter. All the indications are that
the Prime Minister will attend the summit in Sri Lanka, and I believe
that to be a grave mistake. The Government put strong emphasis on
exports and believe that developing trade is important. I welcome
Rolls-Royce’s major deal with SriLankan Airlines, but that
should not wipe out our concerns about how the Sri Lankan Government
treat their own people and foreign nationals. The Prime
Minister’s attendance will be seen as endorsing the Sri Lankan
Government’s disregard for human rights and the rule of
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0001.htm#13091140000063">The
spectre of Khuram’s death and the failure to get justice will
haunt the British Prime Minister as long as he is on Sri Lankan soil.
It will be literally horrifying to see a British Prime Minister shaking
hands with a Sri Lankan President who is so intimately

reason alone, I urge the Government and the Minister to think twice
about who attends the
summit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

reported a series of complaints about missing relatives, military land

the Member for Mitcham and Morden alluded to, Amnesty International
continues to highlight the lack of genuine, substantial measures on the
part of the Government of Sri Lanka to meet their human rights
obligations. There remains a significant body of evidence pointing to
serious human rights violations, some of which amount to war crimes or
crimes against humanity, including extra-judicial executions, enforced
disappearances and the intentional shelling of citizens.
Critics<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> of the

Commonwealth Heads of State still planning to meet in Sri Lanka for
their annual summit, thereby validating the regime? As the House is

series of other eminent Commonwealth advocates have highlighted Sri
Lanka’s unsuitability to host CHOGM. Their concerns are thrown
into sharp relief by the new Commonwealth charter, which was agreed in
March by Her Majesty the Queen, following the agreement of the rest of
the Commonwealth states. The charter was one of the key recommendations
made by the eminent persons group to reform the Commonwealth that was
accepted at the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting in October
2011, and the Prime Minister committed to it. Perhaps the most crucial
passage in the charter

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:22:13"></hs_TimeCode> therefore
continue to be surprised at how little effort Ministers have put into
using the CHOGM as leverage to achieve reform in Sri Lanka. Why, for
example, have the Prime Minister and the Foreign Office not sought to
build a coalition to have Sri Lanka formally put on the agenda of the
Commonwealth ministerial action group? There may be meetings of
Commonwealth Ministers where the subject of Sri Lanka comes up; but
that is not the same as a decision to put it on the agenda of the
ministerial action group.</hs_Para>

the past, countries such as Zimbabwe, Pakistan, Nigeria and Fiji have
all been—indeed, Fiji still is—formal items on the
ministerial action group agenda. An implicit rebuke is thereby sent
from the whole Commonwealth, 
<?notus-xml column=319?>and it is forced to set up a series of actions to be taken to bring a
country back in line with Commonwealth
values<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:21:45"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
Minister and his colleagues are serious about wanting to apply pressure
to the Rajapaksa Government, perhaps he will commit today to building a
coalition of Commonwealth countries to put Sri Lanka on the
Commonwealth ministerial action group agenda. Given the importance of
Canada’s views within the Commonwealth, Britain would surely
have a crucial ally in beginning to apply the pressure necessary to
achieve that end.</hs_Para>

observer mission to follow the provincial elections in the north of
Sri Lanka, but in the context of widespread human rights
abuses, that invitation appears to be another example of the observance
of the forms of democracy, rather than its substance. If I am right to
think that Mr Sharma has not spoken out, it is surprising that a
secretary-general who presided over a recommitment to the

the Member for Bristol East (Kerry McCarthy) for giving an informed
speech in South Africa about human rights and the charter. It was not
only an informed speech but an extremely brave one, which directly
confronted prejudice in all its forms across the Commonwealth. The

I pay tribute also to
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:24:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy), who among other things kept us
amused during long hours at the conference. I thought in some of his

meetings. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:25:07"></hs_TimeCode>It is
worth pointing out in passing what a strong UK delegation we sent to

further progress on gender equality. I shall do that through two

Commonwealth’s current plan for action for gender equality runs
from 2005 to 2015; it has found that across the Commonwealth
Parliaments continue to be male-dominated, and that the goal of
increasing female participation in political bodies and
representational politics is far from being achieved. Some of the major
challenges identified by the Commonwealth secretariat included the
persistence of traditional gender stereotypes, conflict for women
between family and work demands, the masculine culture of politics and
inadequate funding to support female candidates. Going by the many
discussions in the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians sessions last
week and the week before, those things continue to be barriers to
women’s representation in politics and wider public life for
many of our colleagues across the Commonwealth.</hs_Para>

we in Britain should recognise that we also have some way to go. I paid
tribute several times last week to our African sisters who have made
more progress than we have. For example, the Rwandan Parliament has
made great strides in the advancement of women. I think that
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:28:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Rotherham said that they currently hold 56% of the
parliamentary seats there. They are also well represented among
Ministers and are creating strong role models for women and girls.
Aspects of the Rwandan experience are being transferred to other
Governments. The Seychelles, South Africa and Mozambique are making
significant progress in increasing the number of female representatives
in their
Parliaments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:29:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000104">We
all acknowledged last week that much more needs to be done. The
Commonwealth Parliamentary Association has a great role to play in
continuing to support women and getting more of them into politics. We
had the first gender conference here last November, supported by the
CPA UK branch and the British group of the Inter-Parliamentary Union.
It identified the need for ongoing training, ongoing support, mentoring
schemes and the need to talk to women about how they raise money
locally to support candidatures in local and national elections. I hope
that we as a Parliament can continue to support that work.</hs_Para>

we will not get more women into public life unless we address the issue
of girls’ access to education, which, again, we discussed in
detail last week. We know that we will fail to meet millennium
development goals 2 and 3 on getting universal access to primary
education and getting more girls into school, but those matters are so
important. The World Bank has made it really clear that economies in
developing countries will not progress unless more girls are educated.
Across the Commonwealth, we have to press for millennium development
goals 2 and 3 to be met, and I hope that we can use CHOGM for that. I
have heard what my hon. Friends have said 
<?notus-xml column=321?>today—that the meeting should not happen. However, it is likely
to take place in Sri Lanka, and I hope that we can use it to lobby our
Commonwealth Heads of Government to make better progress on getting
girls into education and to tackle the issues of child marriage and
female genital mutilation, which we did not manage to raise as much as
we could have done last week. We must have that on CHOGM’s
agenda.</hs_Para>

when I was in Lesotho a couple of weeks ago, I saw that its Government
were trying to get more girls into school. They have major challenges
ahead of them. A number of UK charities, including the Durham-Lesotho
Link in my constituency, are doing all that they can to help improve
access to education. Sentebale is doing important work there. We have
to reach out beyond Parliament to voluntary sector organisations, so
that we are not only pressing Commonwealth Governments to make progress
but assisting them practically in doing so.</hs_Para>

their faith. I am aware, Mr Gray—you will keep me right on this

Commonwealth and its countries. There certainly continues to be a
denial of the right to religious freedom, and subsequent persecution of

I look at Commonwealth countries and understand that they make up

am reminded of my history lessons. History was one of the subjects at
school that I liked—it was probably the only one that I excelled
at, to be honest. I am interested in history, and particularly the
history of the Victorian era. Under Queen Victoria, Britain ruled a
third of the world. It was said that the sun never set on the British
empire, because of the vastness of what Britain controlled. Although I
am fully aware that membership of the Commonwealth does not equate to
that in any way, it does equate to some form of influence. I believe
that we must step up and use our influence to ensure that there are
human rights and religious freedom for all, in every area of the
Commonwealth.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:38:41"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Strangford (Jim Shannon) said, which was that the charter means
nothing if it is just words on paper. It is very easy for people to
sign up and say, “We all share these values”, and
“We are one big happy family—aren’t we lovely
people?”, and so on. What the Government do on the ground is
what matters. It is about how they implement the charter and how they
continue to review and monitor it, and make it stronger. The most
important thing is that the charter must not be used as a fig leaf for
human rights violations.</hs_Para>

for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy) said. When I spoke in Johannesburg
last week, I was very conscious that we should not, as the UK, be going

our history as the colonial power in many of the countries that we are

said, it is ironic that, going back many years, we took Christianity to
some of these countries and told them that things such as homosexuality
were wrong, but now we are coming back and saying, “Hang on, we

thing that came out of the response to my speech in Johannesburg was
this. We were told by a few of the delegates, “You have to give
us time, because we’re new democracies. You’ve been
established a lot longer. It will take us longer to win hearts and
minds and to progress these ideas of equality.” What concerns me
about some of the countries is not that they are taking longer to reach
the position that we are at with things such as same-sex marriage and
allowing gay couples to adopt, but that they are moving
backwards—in the wrong direction. I am thinking of things such
as the Bill that Uganda has been debating for the past few years about
bringing in the death penalty for homosexuality. The issue there is not
people struggling to keep up with us and moving more slowly than us;
that Bill is actually a step in the wrong direction. We also see that
with other countries outside the Commonwealth, such as Russia, which is
now moving in a very worrying direction on LGBT
rights<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:40:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000124">As

point about LGBT rights being covered, we think, under the broad
description of “other grounds”. I suspect that the
intention was that because it would be impossible to get every
Commonwealth country to sign up to a specific reference to
discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation, “other
grounds” would be included so that countries that want to
interpret that as meaning that we are against discrimination on those
grounds can believe that, and those that are more reluctant to do so
can pretend that it is not really in there. That lets some of the
countries off the hook. I am referring to the 41 countries that will
claim adherence to the charter, but will continue with their policies

into horrific attacks on people in the streets. We see this even in
countries such as South Africa. I echo what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:42:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brigg and Goole said. The Deputy Speaker of the South African
Parliament made an amazing speech, declaring her support for equality
and saying that that was a country that had fought discrimination, and
had fought apartheid. Thirty or 40 years ago, at that
Commonwealth meeting, there would have been people arguing that
apartheid was perfectly legitimate on human rights grounds, that
different people had to respect different cultures and so on. However,
even though that country has enshrined anti-discrimination measures in
law, there is still that battle for hearts and minds that needs to be
won at grass-roots level. The stories that we heard about corrective
rape of lesbian women and the fact that the police were not really
prepared to take those allegations seriously were very worrying
indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:43:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000129">I

the Member for Rotherham was very comprehensive in her coverage. I am
pleased that the UN Human Rights Council is looking at, in particular,
the issue of the death penalty for under-16s, for pregnant women and
for people with 
<?notus-xml column=325?>mental and intellectual disabilities, and the impact on the children of
those who are executed. That has not been on the agenda before, so I
welcome that, but would the Minister update us on the impact in the
Commonwealth of the Government’s “Strategy for Abolition
of the Death Penalty” and what attempts the Foreign Office is
making to promote the second optional protocol to the international
covenant on civil and political rights? That protocol specifically
signs people up to opposing the death penalty. Does the Minister share
my assessment that the death penalty—the use of capital
punishment—does not comply with the spirit of the charter, and
is that an argument that we will be advancing with other Commonwealth
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T15:45:02"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000133">Let
me briefly mention something else that I talked about in South Africa.
We had just had news of the resolution of a particularly horrific case
in the Maldives. It involved a 15-year-old girl who had been sexually
abused by her stepfather for many years and ended up giving birth to
his child. When she tried to report that to the authorities, she
confessed to having some sort of sexual relations with another adult
man and she was sentenced to a flogging—100 lashes—which
could have been postponed until her 18th birthday. When I went to meet
the relevant Minister in the Maldives, I was told that that should not
have happened; she was a vulnerable child and should have been a ward
of court. The people there were at great pains to assure me that it was
a mistake. As it happened, the Government could not direct the court to
drop the sentence, but that did eventually
occur.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000134">Yes,
that is a particularly extreme example of someone who should not have
been subjected to such an ordeal, but many other women still find that
although they are the victim of a crime, they are treated as criminals.
They are charged with adultery and receive the punishments that flow
from that because they have been raped. Sometimes they are forced to
marry their attacker. There is just the fact that flogging is used. I
was told in the Maldives that they tend to turn a blind eye to adultery
unless a pregnancy results, because that is concrete evidence that
something has been going on. As a result, 95% of convictions and
punishments for adultery are given to women, because it is obviously
much easier to show that a woman has become pregnant than it is to show
which man was
involved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000135">The

last thing that I will mention is CHOGM, which many other hon. Members

We will continue to strengthen protection for those facing forced
marriage. We provide training for professionals to help them to
identify potential victims and improve awareness of the issues, so that
those at risk, including children and young people, know where to go
for support. I am sure that there is more that we can and should do,
but we are entirely at one on how morally repugnant such marriages are
and on female genital mutilation, about which I feel strongly. People
in this country, where alas is it all too pervasive, are finally taking
it seriously.</hs_Para>

consider the executions to be a serious setback for human rights there.

and decided that Australia should host CHOGM in Perth in 2011. They
decided that Sri Lanka should host in 2013, and that decision was

of will be the northern provincial council elections on 21 September,
which we are pleased the Commonwealth and the South Asian Association

pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Gray. I thank
you, and the Speaker, for allowing me to call this debate on an issue
which, although having been mentioned in the House before, has never
been the subject of a debate. Recent events, however, mean that it
deserves to be aired, and I look forward to the Minister’s reply

speak as a friend of India and, indeed, of sport. I want to see India
assume its rightful place at the high table of international sport. I
sought this debate as much out of concern for India’s reputation
as for the future of Satellite Information
Services—SIS—important though that
is.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000165">As
the Minister knows, in October 2010, under notoriously difficult
conditions, SIS successfully delivered widely praised world-class
broadcast coverage of the Delhi Commonwealth games for the global
television market, on behalf of the Indian public service broadcaster,
Prasar Bharati. The decision to host the games in India was made when I
was Minister for Sport, and that is where my involvement comes from. I
was involved in ensuring that we did our best to help the Indian
Government to have a successful games. I believe that India was very
successful, but the events that unfolded were perhaps a bit
disappointing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000166">The
SIS unit that was responsible for negotiating and delivering the
contract was, in effect, the former BBC outside broadcasts, which SIS
had acquired in 2008. However, regrettably, it seems that from almost
the very day on which SIS was awarded the contract the company was the
subject of sustained hostility from a wide range of interests. Before
and during the games, it was the target of unwarranted accusations and
serious, misleading media smears, compounded by what appeared to be at
best obstruction, and at worst harassment, from official sources,
including, oddly, a tax office inspection of the company’s
accounts in the middle of the games. That should all be seen in the
context of the maelstrom of rumours, accusations and charges of
maladministration that followed the
games.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000167">One
result of the situation has been that although SIS received partial
advance payment, not a single payment has been made since the games
concluded, and the company is still seeking in excess of £28
million in unpaid charges, costs and liquidated damages. This is a
sorry story, which has overshadowed the games, sadly damaged
India’s global reputation and seriously affected a company that
has done nothing wrong, and everything
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000168">From
the earliest stages of the contract, it was apparent that SIS and the
ex-BBC colleagues had been caught in the crossfire between different
political and commercial interests, and it also became clear that there
were other interests that wished to see those involved in the
Commonwealth games, and in the broadcast contract in particular,
discredited. It also appears that, at some level, there is a marked
reluctance to settle any debts 
<?notus-xml column=331?>associated with the games, employing every means—legitimate and
otherwise—to avoid paying the bills. Indeed, almost every
foreign contractor involved in the Delhi games has faced similar
difficulties in obtaining payment. For SIS, however, the situation has
been even more damaging than the failure to collect a commercial debt
because the reputation of the company has been seriously and unfairly
attacked, possibly resulting in a loss of future earnings and
threatening the very viability of the
company.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000169">In
an attempt to get to the bottom of the problems surrounding the games,
the Indian Prime Minister commissioned a report from an independent
committee, headed by Mr V. K. Shunglu, to investigate all the
allegations of wrongdoing and to make recommendations. Let me be clear:
I think that that was the right thing to do. The Prime Minister was
absolutely reasonable and proper in holding such an investigation into
the serious allegations. Sadly, the quality of the committee’s
work fell a long way short of what the Prime Minister had every right
to expect. That failure was a betrayal of the Indian Government, who
were clearly determined to do the right thing, and of the Commonwealth
games
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000170">The
first report produced by Shunglu concerned the broadcast contract, but
the manner in which it was prepared almost guaranteed that it would be
flawed and inaccurate. It was notable that much of the false
information published in the report echoed, almost verbatim, the false
allegations that had been planted in the Indian media, yet the
investigating committee made no attempt to approach SIS to verify the
information before publishing it, apparently choosing instead to rely
for its facts on the very same sources that had been feeding the media.
Not only were the “facts” false, but they could easily

Olympics and the Paralympics and what they mean to our great nation.
The Government, through the Minister and his colleagues in the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, need to help the
company. SIS has been caught up in a situation that I found
embarrassing.

31 July 2012, the CBI investigation filed its report in court. Although
the report is not yet public, it is known that the CBI has
comprehensively dismissed all the allegations made against SIS by
Shunglu. The Shunglu committee is now widely discredited. Most
encouraging in that respect is a recent statement from the Indian
Government that describes the central allegations in the Shunglu report
as being based on the wrong premise and the wrong facts. However, under
the Indian legal system, a criminal investigation is not formally
closed until the CBI court makes its ruling following receipt of a CBI
report and, unfortunately, although a date for considering the report
has been set on no fewer than 15 occasions, each time there
has been an adjournment to a later date. That is obviously a matter of
great frustration for SIS, and it represents a continuing and unfair
slur on what, as the hon. Member for South Derbyshire (Heather Wheeler)
said, is a fine and highly respected British company. I do not think
that any of us in the House would want external involvement in the
Indian legal system, but the number of delays must surely create
credibility issues for the
company.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000175">I
think that the real reason SIS has remained unpaid is not the existence
of the criminal investigation but because Prasar Bharati has refused
settlement, and is locked in dispute with SIS over a range of
contractual matters. As with any project of this scale, understandably
there are areas of disagreement and dispute, but the contractual
matters were not central to the delivery of the contract. Those
peripheral issues are now subject to arbitration, and would have no
obvious bearing on the payment of the greater part of the outstanding
debt. Sadly, there seem to be few signs of any wish to expedite or
facilitate fair payment. Indeed, since the games, SIS has continued to
be the subject of a range of hostile initiatives from various agencies
and, in the arbitration process, of a highly aggressive approach by
lawyers acting on behalf of Prasar
Bharati.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000176">Although
few<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:09:28"></hs_TimeCode> would argue
that the core contract was performed in anything other than
spectacularly successful fashion, Prasar Bharati has seized a
£3 million performance guarantee provided by SIS
before the games and, arguing that the entire contract should be
considered voidable, has even demanded the refund of the partial
payments paid to SIS. As I have said,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:10:07"></hs_TimeCode> court case
is a fig leaf of justification. The real area in which the
Government might offer assistance is in encouraging Prasar Bharati to
engage constructively in the arbitration process and to settle the
issue amicably, fairly and

only have Prasar Bharati lawyers had SIS in their sights; at times, it
has almost seemed as though one Indian Government agency after another
has been lining up to take shots at the firm. I will give one example.
In a sensible move to enable the necessary participation by foreign
contractors in the Commonwealth games, the Indian Government passed a
regulation to allow duty-free temporary imports of equipment for the
games, but the Indian customs authorities have sought to exploit every
possible loophole to seek payment of duty. One claim against SIS, which
was thrown out, suggested that because SIS might have used some of the
equipment, it was  
<?notus-xml column=333?>technically second-hand equipment and therefore subject to duty, as
second-hand goods were not specifically mentioned in the
Government’s duty
waiver.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000178">SIS’s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>
achievement in delivering a quality product for global audiences under

I met Commonwealth games officials who were concerned that, three

positive in his speech, including if there need to be meetings with SIS

was undertaken by the Central Bureau of Investigation. Although the
report has not yet been published, it is pretty clear what the findings

towns of Brierfield and Nelson contain some of the most deprived wards

is ranked the 41st most deprived local authority in England out of 326,
and both Brierfield and Nelson have wards that rank in the top 200 most
deprived wards in the country. The percentage of people in Pendle who
have never worked stands at 8.33%, which is above the nationwide
average of 5.61%. However, the percentage in Brierfield is
significantly above the percentage in Pendle—with nearly 15% of
people in Brierfield having never worked—and in some wards in
Nelson, such as Bradley, the percentage is 17%, and the percentage in
Whitefield is 25%. That translates into very high numbers of people
claiming out-of-work benefits and low educational attainment and

situation contrasts sharply with the growth opportunities in the
borough. Pendle as a whole has one of the highest proportions of people
engaged in manufacturing of any part of the country. About 27% of
Pendle jobs are still in manufacturing, compared with a national rate
of just 10%. Pendle employers include companies in a dynamic aerospace
sector, such as Rolls-Royce, as well as companies in the nuclear supply
chain, such as Graham Engineering. Pendle has a large number of the
fastest growing companies in Lancashire and the wider north-west, and
they are powering growth opportunities in the area. The Prime Minister
visited one such company, Hope Technology, earlier this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:32:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

companies received a significant boost in July, when the Government
agreed with the arguments that I and others were making and approved
£5 million in additional business support, via the regional

area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:32:40"></hs_TimeCode>. 
<?notus-xml column=339?>Since 2010, we have also seen the number of apprenticeships in Pendle
double, while unemployment has fallen significantly. The latest

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:32:57"></hs_TimeCode>significant
investment has been made and programmes undertaken by the council and
central Government that has helped to boost the area. The reopening of
Manchester road to traffic through Nelson town centre in 2011, along
with associated street scene improvements, has given the town a genuine
boost, as has the Government’s decision to designate Nelson in
May 2012 as one of the first 12 Portas pilot towns in the country. That
saw Nelson receive £100,000 to try new schemes to attempt to
bring people back into the town centre, and even led to a visit from
the retail guru Mary Portas herself. Crucially, that cash was in

council has invested £1.2 million in two new sports pavilions in
the area: one at Bullholme in Barrowford and one at Edge End in Nelson.
In August, the area secured £150,000 of funding from Sport
England for the new Steven Burke Sports Hub, named after the gold
medal-winning cyclist from the town of Colne. Added to contributions
from other sources, £308,000 will now be invested in the area
around Swinden playing fields in Nelson, to create a cycle track and to
improve sporting facilities. Plans to expand the role of Pendle
community hospital—investment for which was secured by the last
Conservative MP for Pendle, for facilities that ideally would be
located in Nelson town centre—are also progressing well. Nelson
has benefited from Heritage Lottery Fund money to restore the old
library on Booth street and to improve Marsden
park<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:34:44"></hs_TimeCode>. Also, the
long-standing problem of a lack of primary school places has finally
been addressed by the decision to build two brand new

£14.1

big investments can be seen in the smaller town of Brierfield, with the

Brierfield is also home to Pendle’s first primary academy.

huge amount of investment and positive change is clearly being made
under the current Government, but I will now turn to some of the
challenges that we still face in the
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:36:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Empty
homes remain a real problem in 
<?notus-xml column=340?>Pendle. The Minister will recall the Westminster Hall debate that he
responded to in July, which I also attended, when
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:36:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hyndburn (Graham Jones) set out some of the challenges that he
faced in his constituency. Many of the root causes of the problems in
Brierfield and Nelson are very similar to those in Hyndburn and other
parts of east Lancashire. However, in Pendle a combination of factors
and the hard work of Pendle borough council, which is jointly run by
the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, have led to some genuine
progress during the past three years. The number of empty homes in the
borough has fallen from 1,847 in 2010 to 1,414 in July this
year—a reduction of almost a quarter, and I expect the number to
be even lower by the end of this year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091140000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000215"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>We
now have the lowest number of empty homes in the area for some time,
and that significant reduction—made under this
Government—is very welcome. However, things are in danger of
stalling. The largest provider of social housing in Pendle is the
Together Housing Group, which is spending more than £10 million
to bring 300 empty homes across Pennine Lancashire back into
use, by offering a purchase and repair option and a lease and repair
option. More than £3 million of that investment has come from
the Government, via the Homes and Communities Agency, and it could have
huge benefits for the towns of Brierfield and
Nelson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:37:26"></hs_TimeCode>. To
comply with the HCA’s funding guidelines, the Together Housing
Group is required to register a lease with the Land Registry. However,
where a property has a mortgage against it, a housing association
requires the consent of the lender to register the title. This is a big
stumbling block, as lenders are refusing to do that simply because the
scheme does not comply with the standard buy-to-let terms and
conditions. Despite attempts to open dialogue with lenders, the
Together Housing Group is still being refused by them
repeatedly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000216">I
wrote to my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing about this issue
recently, and I would appreciate it if my right hon. Friend the
Minister could address this challenge in his response to the debate.
Sadly, without a resolution, much of the money will remain unspent and
many of the 300 empty homes that I have mentioned will remain boarded

will now turn to Brierfield mill. The Government gave Pendle council a
£1.5 million grant, via the HCA, to buy Brierfield mill in March
2012. Formerly, it was the home of a major local employer, Smith and
Nephew. Under the previous Government, this building complex was bought
by a Birmingham-based Islamic charity, which had planned to convert the
site into a 5,000-place girls boarding school. The scale of that
project would have been disproportionate to the rest of the local area;
there would have been more people in the school than in the town of
Brierfield itself. Now in public ownership, this employment site, which
covers 400,000 square feet and is located next to the M65 motorway and
Brierfield railway station, has the potential to be a key driver of
jobs and growth. The project offers the opportunity to provide more
than 500 jobs in a mixed-use development, comprising work spaces and
enterprise areas in leisure, a possible hotel development and
residential uses. However, bringing this major grade II listed building
back into use in such a deprived part of the borough will require some
public funding, in addition to private sector
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:39:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Minister for Housing kindly accepted my invitation to
visit Brierfield mill. I have also met another DCLG Minister, Baroness
Hanham, to discuss the council’s European regional development
fund bid. Pendle council submitted an ERDF funding bid to the DCLG for
a managed workspace scheme with a total cost of some £3 million.
The bid was for approximately £1.5 million of ERDF to be matched
by £1.5 million from the council’s joint venture company
with the private sector, which is called Pearl2. However, when
assessing the bid the Department raised concerns about procurement and
state aid rules, and there have been long negotiations over the past
few months. Although officials have been helpful, it looks as though
the bid will need to be scaled back to meet those requirements, so much
so that continuing with the bid appears not to be viable. I would
appreciate the Minister committing to look into the council’s
ERDF bid and providing any assistance that he can.</hs_Para>

equally tricky issue relating to Brierfield mill is securing funding to
acquire and improve land at either side of the site to make it more
attractive to private sector investors. A key part of that would be a
new access road into the site from the M65, which the architects and
council believe to be critical to the project’s success.
Although that would probably cost in the region of £1.5 million,
it would help unlock the site’s potential and draw interest from
private sector investors and be a sensible use of taxpayers’
money. Sadly, in his response to Pendle council on 20 August, the
Minister for Housing said that all the funding streams that could help
to pay for it are fully committed. Again, I would appreciate any
thoughts the Minister has on how we could progress the issue. There are
barriers in freeing up these grant opportunities for Brierfield mill,
and I simply ask the Minister to assist where he
can.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091140000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091140000220">Pendle
council’s submission to the current consultation put forward
four wards to be granted assisted area status: Brierfield ward, the
Bradley ward of Nelson and the neighbouring wards of Old Laund Booth

proposed wards are all within the M65 corridor, which is highlighted in
the Pennine Lancashire investment plan as a key economic growth
corridor. The corridor has the potential to generate around 15,000 new
jobs and 2,300 new houses. Concentrating assisted area status along
that growth corridor, which runs through Brierfield and Nelson, will
help to boost regeneration and

council believes that assisted area status will provide significant
opportunities for business growth and development, which will act as a
catalyst in bringing high-quality jobs to the deprived areas within the
wards and the wider deprived areas of Pendle. There are further
eligible wards in Pendle, but the council consider that those four have
the greatest potential to utilise the benefits of assisted area status,
which will have a positive impact on the local economy and assist with
regeneration. I appreciate that assisted area status and the
consultation is a matter for Business, Innovation and Skills Ministers,
but I urge the Minister to join me in lobbying them on Pendle’s

conclusion, I am greatly encouraged by much of what has been achieved
by the coalition Government over recent years, particularly at a time
of very tight  
<?notus-xml column=342?>public finances. In Brierfield and Nelson, most of the credit for that
lies with the current leader of Pendle borough council, Councillor Joe
Cooney, his predecessor Councillor Mike Blomeley and the excellent
officers at the council. Rather than simply throwing money at problems,
the local authorities and other bodies have had to work innovatively to
deliver positive outcomes. However, there is clearly still significant
potential for growth in Pendle, and I hope that the Minister can
support our area’s
ambitions.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/1DD4F39C8191896EABE76E9D5DB9C7F2D671E558" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="11 September 2013">Wednesday

great pleasure to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Gray. I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Pendle (Andrew Stephenson)

Government’s attention to the concerns in his area and on his
success in his lobbying endeavours to date. I understand the challenges
that he has raised and I will address them as best I can.</hs_Para>

that, however, I thought it would be helpful to put into context the
Government’s work to help areas such as Pendle drive forward
better growth and regeneration. We are firmly of the view that local
leaders are best placed to understand their local economies and the
needs of their areas, and that is why, as we have developed our
policies, we have done all we can to reform the system, putting the
levers and incentives in the hands of local leaders and local
communities. It is also why we have established local enterprise
partnerships, bringing business and local authority leaders together.
We have also established enterprise zones, worked with the major
conurbations through the city deal programme and introduced a
£750 million Growing Places fund at the local enterprise
partnership level.</hs_Para>

have supported small businesses through the small business rate relief
scheme and decentralised control over resources, for example by
removing many of the ring fences on local authority budgets. We have
rewarded places that deliver growth through, for example, the new homes
bonus and the business rate retention scheme. We recognise in doing
that how important regeneration sites such as Brierfield mill and
Nelson are to Pendle’s local
economy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091151000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091151000004">I
am delighted that I will be added to my hon. Friend’s long list
of Ministers within the Department for Communities and Local Government
whom he has lobbied on these issues. He referred to his lobbying of the
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis); the visit that he
had from the Minister for Housing, my hon. Friend the Member for
Hertford and Stortford (Mr Prisk); and the conversations that he has
had with my noble Friend Baroness Hanham. As a result of that lobbying,
and that of the excellent local council of my hon. Friend the Member
for Pendle, we have already seen some real successes, which bear
repetition. As he rightly said, he has secured £100,000 for the
development of Nelson high street as part of the Portas pilots, and he
described to us the excellent use to which those funds are being put. A
further £100,000 has come from the high street innovation fund
to provide yet more help in areas with the highest empty property
rates.</hs_Para>

also received two thirds of a million pounds of new homes bonus money,
which has already been put to excellent use in helping first-time
buyers obtain mortgages by providing guarantees. Pendle has received
£2.3 million of direct funding to bring 227 empty
homes back into use by March 2015, as my hon. Friend said. Perhaps most
significantly in the context of this debate, Pendle has already
received £1.58 million of funding from the Government through
the Homes and Communities Agency to buy Brierfield mill, securing the
site for development when it might otherwise have been sold off for
piecemeal developments. I must also refer to his successful lobbying of
the Government that led to the announcement of £5 million of
business support through the regional growth
fund.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091151000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091151000006">As
my hon. Friend rightly said, there are still a number of challenges,
with much to do and problems to be overcome. I must point out that
there is no hidden pot of cash that I can dip into to help solve some
of those problems. As he has already been told by my hon. Friends in
the Department, the funding streams are already fully committed, but
that does not mean that we cannot provide further assistance in some
form. I particularly encourage him to ensure that his local council is
working as closely as it can with the Lancashire local enterprise
partnership.</hs_Para>

Friend referred to the bid for assisted area status. He has rightly
said that if that is granted, it will make the area eligible to receive
regional aid, typically in the form of capital investment in business.
I am pleased to hear that the council is working actively to take up
the opportunity of applying for assisted area status for four wards in
his area. He is well aware that we are at an early stage of the
process. Stage 1 of the consultation phase closes on 30 September.
Returns from that first phase will inform the development of a draft
assisted areas map, which will be drawn up by the Department for
Business, Innovation and Skills for stage 2 of the consultation in the
winter. Following ministerial agreement, the map will then be submitted
to the European Commission for clearance before coming into effect on 1

there is still a way to go, I seriously urge the council to work
closely with the local enterprise partnership, because the LEPs, with
their clear strategic overview of their area’s economic
priorities, will influence decisions on assisted area status
significantly. It is crucial that Pendle influences the LEP’s
thinking. By raising the issue so publicly today, my hon. Friend has
already helped the cause, for which I congratulate
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:50:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091151000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091151000009">I
am particularly concerned to hear about some of the problems being
faced in relation to the empty homes programme, which my hon. Friend
has rightly highlighted. We have provided £235 million of direct
funding to help local authorities, housing associations and community
groups address the most problematic empty homes, which would not
otherwise be brought back into use. As he rightly says, Pendle has
received £2.3 million of that funding to bring 227 empty homes
back into use by March 2015. The council and registered providers are
working incredibly hard to address those empty homes, as the reduction
in the number of empty homes in Pendle is already proving. They have
already had great success, but as he has pointed out, there is a
complication 
<?notus-xml column=344?>in the case he describes: many successful empty homes schemes are
predicated on councils and other providers leasing the empty homes from
their owners, which has increased the number of private sector leasing
schemes such as the LinkedUp empty homes scheme operated by Together
Housing
Group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:51:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

solution. Our attention has also been drawn to that challenge by the
Empty Homes
Network<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:52:04"></hs_TimeCode>. It
transpires that some mortgage lenders are not agreeing to their
borrowers entering into the lease arrangements on which the empty homes
programme is based, which I find incredibly surprising because such
private sector leasing schemes will not only provide a regular rental
income for the owners to help them repay their mortgage but improve the
value and condition of the asset. Derelict properties sitting on the
asset books of mortgage companies are a problem not only for the
mortgage company but for the local community. Such properties become a
magnet for rats and squatters, driving other local residents
away.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091151000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130911/halltext/130911h0002.htm#13091151000011">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:55:55"></hs_TimeCode>
hope mortgage lenders will look at the scheme rather more favourably
that they have to
date<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>. To try to
achieve that, my officials have been working closely with the Empty
Homes Network and the Council of Mortgage Lenders to highlight to
lenders the real benefits of entering the scheme. I am pleased to tell
my hon. Friend that the Council of Mortgage Lenders is now engaging
directly and closely with us on that issue, and we hope to persuade it
to support the programme and persuade its members to engage much more
actively in it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-11T16:53:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
Those discussions are ongoing, and I cannot say that there has been a

Additionally, the Empty Homes Network is now going to produce a guide
designed to help lenders and providers find suitable solutions to the

to do all we can while bearing in mind that there is no hidden pot of

European regional development fund bid related to the mill, on which
there have been difficult procurement and state aid issues. Following
those discussions, we have ring-fenced the ERDF funds for the project,
and we are now awaiting a further application from the council.

on how to rebalance the Army reserve structure have been based on
military judgment taking account of the capabilities required of the

counterparts. The Army will also consolidate some small sub-units, most
of which are poorly recruited, to enable better Regular-Reserve unit
pairing. This will improve access to training facilities and equipment;
make better use of full-time manpower and optimise opportunities for
recruitment. These changes, which will impact on the current basing

investment decisions are made when programmes are sufficiently mature

expect this point, the Main Gate decision point, to be in 2016. Making
investment decisions and placing contracts when projects are not
sufficiently mature is likely to lead to cost growth and time delays.
However, it is not possible, for any individual project, to estimate
with any degree of accuracy what those costs and delays might be,
precisely because the programme is not yet sufficiently

prioritise resources relative to the needs of their communities. Owners
should consider whether they can take on the responsibility of keeping
an animal before acquiring it. If there are circumstances that arise
which mean they can no longer look after their pet, they should
approach a re-homing centre. Abandonment of an animal in circumstances
that are likely to compromise its welfare is an offence under the

to a range of international partners, including Pakistan. We do so to
tackle the international drugs trade and minimise the threat it poses
to the UK. It is important to protect activities which form part of the
UK's contribution to the international counter-narcotics effort and to
respect the principle that international partners are able to operate
in secrecy on matters of national security against organised crime. As
such, it is our policy not to disclose details of our counter narcotics
work, as to do so risks reducing its effectiveness and damaging
international

recent years, some commissioned by BIS and its predecessors, some
commissioned by other organisations. Whilst they differ in terms of
methodology, time periods covered and some of the underlying
assumptions, they all use a broadly similar approach, and taken
together they point to there being a substantial lifetime earnings
premium for graduates due to having their degree. Looking across the
studies our conclusion is that over the course of a working life the
average graduate earns comfortably over £100,000 more in today's
valuation, net of tax, than someone with two or more A-levels who does
not go to

the post nor the location in which individuals are serving are taken

of an individual for redundancy cannot be assumed to imply that the

the post nor the location in which individuals are serving are taken
into account by armed forces redundancy selection boards. The selection
of an individual for redundancy cannot be assumed to imply that the
post they occupy on the date of notification is no longer required. In
addition, service personnel move between posts and locations regularly,
and the location at which they will be serving on their exit date may
be different from that at which they were notified. For these reasons,
neither the geographical distribution nor the units within which
individuals were serving when notified for redundancy are a valid basis
for assumptions about the longer term disposition of future military
posts.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2013-09-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_11_PT_1/Index/9C6E6ADCC71868B840B7C872E25481F7F3706968" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="18" cday="Wednesday" cmonth="September" cyear="2013" date="11" day="Wednesday" issue="48" maxparts="1" month="September" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="567" year="2013"><title col="959">Oral
