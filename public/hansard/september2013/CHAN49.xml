The spending round of 2013 set a long-term budget for the delivery of

for phase 1 and £21.2 billion for phase 2. The budget includes
significant contingency provision of £14.4 billion. That budget

the railway will be delivered for less than that figure. I have set HS2

Committee embarks on an important point. One key problem that any
future Government will face is that of capacity on the network, as well
as speed, and this line is also very much about capacity. If we made
the improvement that some people suggest on the present line, it would
lead to capacity increases of about 53% between London and Birmingham.
HS2 will lead to a capacity increase of 143%. That is why it is so
important to meet the objectives that we both
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T09:39:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

not just about speed and that capacity is one of the main reasons for
it. Although the reduction in 
<?notus-xml column=1139?>journey time between London and Birmingham is not huge—it will be
in the region of 30 minutes—for great cities in the north such
as Manchester and Leeds the reduction will be very beneficial. There is
not just one reason; there are many reasons for doing this project.
Even if we took the line down to a lower speed limit, it would not
reduce the cost by much—we would be talking about 90% of the

the serious and growing capacity constraints on our existing rail

own Department’s figures reveal that he could have ended
above-inflation fare rises next year for a similar sum, is it not a
disgrace that passengers face fare rises of up to 9%, adding to the
cost of living crisis, as a direct result of his decision to pursue
this costly and unnecessary

account the economic situation and economic mess that we inherited from
her Government, we have provided help to fare payers by reducing the
average formula from RPI plus 3% to RPI plus 1%. She selectively
chooses the figure of a 9% increase—an extreme
increase—but that will arise in a very small number of
instances, because the formula calculates an average increase. She also
forgets to mention those fares that have gone down rather than
up.</hs_Para>

Thurso</B> (Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross):</Member> Following
consideration of the study report on the condition of the fabric of the
Palace, the House of Commons Commission and the House of Lords House
Committee agreed, in October last year, to commission a comprehensive
independent cost appraisal of a range of 
<?notus-xml column=1156?>options for the restoration and renewal of the Palace of Westminster.
The opportunity to prepare the independent options appraisal has been
advertised, and six interested bidders who met the brief qualification
requirements have been invited to submit a proposal. The deadline for
submissions is 11 October. It is anticipated that the successful
tenderer will begin work in January
2014<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T10:28:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091224000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0001.htm#13091224000188"><B><Member ContinuationText="Pauline Latham" PimsId="5673" UID="13091224000641" xid="1113" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0001.htm#13091224000641">Pauline

Thurso:</Member></B> I understand that there is precedent for that. The
purpose of the independent options appraisal is to consider all those
points. The critical point is that no decision will be possible until
the next Parliament, so no decision will be taken on whatever option
may be thought be best until sometime in the next Parliament. It will
be the Parliament after that before the decision is implemented. The
key factor is that all Members of both Houses want to achieve the best
value for money for the taxpayer, who will ultimately be paying for
this. That should be the guiding principle, provided we can work
appropriately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T10:29:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091224000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0001.htm#13091224000190"><Member ContinuationText="Mr David Winnick" PimsId="4647" UID="13091224000643" xid="643" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0001.htm#13091224000643"><B>Mr

point—one that has been considered in the essential maintenance
work that is going on. Clearly, the mechanical and electrical services
in particular have to be brought up to a safe and workable standard so
that we can occupy the building. I believe that time and money spent
now in getting a really thorough appraisal will produce the best value
result overall, but we have to keep spending money to ensure that the

young people should have education, training and employment and that
they do not fail to acquire the habit of employment. The fact that the

that the Prince’s Trust has given hope, opportunity and support
to young people whom the rest of the system would probably not have
thought had potential. They do have potential, however, which is
realised through the offices of the Prince’s Trust. The
Government want to ensure that we do our bit, and today the Prime
Minister will announce a further extension to the new enterprise
allowance, which has already supported the establishment of 26,000 new

determined to encourage and lead international efforts to alleviate
human suffering in Syria and the region. The United Kingdom is the
second largest bilateral donor to the humanitarian relief effort after
the United States. The Prime Minister’s announcement at the G20

brings our total support to £400 million so far, and we are
encouraging other countries to do much more. As a result of the meeting
convened by the Prime Minister during the G20, Canada, Italy and Qatar

remain committed to helping bring about a political settlement. The
basis for a political solution was agreed in Geneva last year, namely
the formation of a transitional Government, with full executive powers,
drawn from the regime and the opposition, by mutual consent. We are in
close touch with our partners about convening a second Geneva
conference to make that a reality. It is absolutely clear that no
lasting or meaningful political solution can occur without the moderate
Syrian opposition. The Syrian National Coalition has committed itself
to a secular, democratic and pluralist Syria that ensures equal rights
for all Syrians. That is a vision that the whole House and our country
can support.</hs_Para>

evidence is there, so yes, it is compelling. We now await the report of
the UN inspectors. As I have explained before in the House, they do not
have a mandate to attribute blame, but of course we hope that their

think it is best at this stage for us to be clear about what a

every direction. The test, as I have set out before, should be a
binding commitment for the Syrian regime to give up its chemical
weapons within a specific time frame, and an agreement that is credible
and reliable and that promptly places these chemical weapon stocks
under international control. The main thing is to have a resolution and

I did in my statement, to the immense practical difficulties involved.
Much of Syria is a contested battlefield and chemical weapons are held
in numerous locations. Those sites are, of course, all in areas
controlled by the regime, not the opposition, so this requires the full
co-operation of the regime, and that, in turn, requires the full
diplomatic involvement and pressure of Russia. The coming days will

of which is safe access and egress, not only for the inspectors, but
for the weapons themselves. Will the British Government argue very

proposals on Monday were a very important change of approach. That is
particularly apparent to me, given that I have on several occasions
over the past couple of years discussed with Russian representatives
whether there is a way of working together on the chemical weapons in
Syria. It has always been the Russian position hitherto that the Assad
regime would not use its chemical weapons—it did not expect it
to use them. I think that the mounting evidence that the regime has
used those weapons and the discussions, particularly those in the
United States, about whether to take military action have produced a
change in the Russian position. Whatever the motives and reasons for
that, we should nevertheless welcome it and work with it, which is what

the creation of a transitional Government. In our view, it should not
refer to who comes to a second Geneva conference. It will be up to the
regime and the opposition—the national coalition—to
nominate their representatives for the conference. They will need a
significant degree of freedom in doing that, but they will have to bear
it in mind, when nominating their

clear that they are predominantly committed by regime forces, and we

strikes, a no-fly zone and sending missiles to various sites in Syria
will not, on their own, secure or remove chemical weapons? They could,
in fact, give an advantage to the opposition and subsequently fall into
the hands of extremists. Is it not the case that to secure the chemical

at any stage. I think it is possible to deter the use of chemical
weapons without the deployment of ground forces, but the House made its
decision and we respect that decision. The shadow Foreign Secretary
asked about the Prime Minister’s statement in response to that.
I can assure him that it was agreed collectively by the Government,

two years ago. The overall objective of our reform is to continue to
secure the universal postal service—the six-days-a-week,
same-price-goes-anywhere service—which is vital to our economy.
We have already put in place a proper regulatory framework and given
Ofcom stronger powers to take the action necessary to protect the
universal service. We have taken on Royal Mail’s historical

under the restrictions of public ownership, its core mail business has

case for the privatisation of Royal Mail has not been made. Its recent

politically motivated fire sale to fill the hole in the Treasury

decision will have significant impacts on consumers, businesses and
communities up and down the country. The Government are pressing ahead
with the fire sale of Royal Mail despite having failed to answer
critical questions on the six-days-a-week, one-price-goes-anywhere
universal service obligation. The Minister has failed to ensure the
long-term maintenance of the USO. He claims that it is written in
legislation, but I am sure that he can envisage a scenario in which a
privatised Royal Mail comes to the Government and asks for alterations
to that legislation.

is that a realistic scenario? It is because the regulatory environment
does not prevent the cherry-picking of the most profitable parts of
Royal Mail by rival companies that operate under much lower service
standards than Royal Mail. If the USO becomes unsustainable, the
Government will have no choice but to alter it. Royal Mail will still
have to deliver daily to Shetland while its rivals enjoy providing
services in London, Manchester, Liverpool, Edinburgh and other
profitable centres. Pressure will be put on the Government to respond
to such requests to alter the USO; otherwise, what is there to prevent
the privatised Royal Mail from handing back the USO keys, just as we
have witnessed with the east coast main line? The result will be that
the taxpayer will, ultimately, pick up the
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T12:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091224000394" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0002.htm#13091224000394">Concerns
have been expressed about higher prices. Other privatised companies
have already set precedents in that area. One of the questions posed in
the Government’s documents today is whether the Post Office will
be affected. The Minister says no, but the 10-year inter-business
agreement can be reviewed in four years, and it can be altered if there
are material adverse effects on either of the two companies. How can
the Minister say that this privatisation does not affect the post
office network? A privatised Royal Mail will want to look closely at
costs, and that £380 million annual contract could be a good
place to start.</hs_Para>

National Federation of SubPostmasters tells us that the privatisation
of Royal mail threatens the future of the post office network and, as a
result, it now opposes the privatisation. It has called it a
“reckless gamble”, and we should listen to what it says.
It is not only the NFSP that is against the move. Despite the
£2,000 shares bribe to the staff of Royal Mail, a massive 96% of
them voted against the privatisation, on a turnout of over 75%.
Moreover, they already own the company. A poll in <I>The
</I><I>Sunday Times</I> last week showed 70% of the public to be
against it, and former 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>Prime Minister Baroness Thatcher, the architect of
privatisation, said that it was a step too
far<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T12:15:39"></hs_TimeCode>. The Bow
Group, a right-wing Tory think-tank, said that it would be deeply
unpopular and should not be considered. A vast coalition of groups and
organisations echo the concerns about prices, the maintenance of the
USO and the impact on the Post Office. And the Minister himself said in
a letter in 2009 that he was against the privatisation of Royal Mail.

modernise its network, invest in its infrastructure and automate more
of its parcels business. It can no longer compete for scarce public

extraordinary turn of events started to unravel almost a year ago when
the media heralded a modest but game-changing ITV
documentary—produced by Mark Williams-Thomas, to whom I pay
tribute for what he has set in motion as a result—which first
tentatively suggested that Jimmy Savile had abused teenage girls as
young as 13. It seemed incredible that the semi-beatified, spangly
shell-suited former Bevin boy, “Top of the Pops” doyen,
children’s TV icon and multi-charity philanthropist had so
successfully hidden his alter ego as a serious sexual predator, and a
pretty prolific and grubby one at that. The rest, of course, is
history. The initial <I>Guardian </I>headline about some 10
female victims having come forward was one of its more glaring
underestimates. The number of victims was then upgraded to some 300,
some of them possibly as young as nine years old, and the figure is now
in excess of 600. The ramifications for the BBC, for the rest of the
establishment and for the public profile of child abuse, however, have
been huge. It is worth briefly reviewing what has come to light over
the past year.</hs_Para>

been Operation Yewtree, which concentrated on the Savile
case—600 people have come forward as having been abused by Jimmy
Savile over a 60-year period. There are records of people who said that
they were turned away when they reported abuse suffered at his hands.
Six former police officers admitted that they were aware of
Savile’s behaviour, with extensive evidence of cover-ups and
withholding of information leading to abuse continuing over such a long
period, including against children, teenage fans and kids in hospitals
and care homes. We have seen the recent conviction of Stuart Hall for
assaults spanning some 18 years on at least 13 girls, and a panoply of
assorted comedians, publicists, entertainers, soap stars and childhood
icons at various stages of arrest, investigation or facing court.
Senior heads have rolled at the BBC, and its inquiry  is said
to have cost the licence fee payer in excess of £10
million already.</hs_Para>

Operation Flamborough is investigating alleged assaults on girls with

itself. There have been abuse allegations in relation to Kesgrave Hall
school, near Ipswich. At Chetham’s music school in Manchester, a
former director of music and his wife were found guilty of indecently
assaulting Frances Andrade, who, tragically, was driven to take her own
life after being subjected to harsh cross-examination during the trial,
having been labelled a fantasist and attention seeker and advised not
to seek counselling during the trial. There have been allegations of

Loughton:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is absolutely right, and we
could have taken up this entire debate with the history of some of
these cases. And these are only the high-profile cases that we know
about and read about. They are only a small sample of what has actually
been going on; many more have not reached the headlines or even the

high-profile stories that make the media headlines, the wider figures
show that our various child protection agencies have never been busier.
The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children reports
that referrals to ChildLine about sexual abuse were nearly twice as
high in June and July of this year as in the same period last year,
pre-Savile. There have been 2.4 million visits to the ChildLine website
in the last year—an increase of some 28% on the previous year.
The NSPCC estimates that more than 50,000 children in the UK are known
to be at risk of abuse. It calculates that last year, a total of 2,900
rapes or attempted rapes of children under the age of 13 were recorded;
that is eight per day. Indeed, 32%—almost a third—of all
sexual crimes in this country are against children under the age of
16.</hs_Para>

Munn</B> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I know that the hon.
Gentleman feels very deeply about this issue. Do these figures not show
that we have to be more aware of the fact that paedophiles will target
professions in which they can get access to children, and that the
Government therefore need to do more? Instead of relaxing regulations
relating to children and Ofsted child protection inspections, the
Government need to be much more cognisant of the issue, target areas
where such things are likely to happen, and make people aware that
paedophiles will be in these professions. Action must be taken to stop
them.</hs_Para>

Loughton:</Member></B> I agree with the hon. Lady, who knows a great
deal about this issue, having been a practitioner in the field; indeed,
she and I have worked together through the all-party group on child
protection. We need to be wiser to the professions in which paedophiles
and potential paedophiles will inveigle themselves. At the same time,
however, training and awareness in some of these professions—an
issue I shall return to—have improved enormously, although not
enough, yet, and the inspection regime has improved. In too many cases,
we were inspecting the wrong thing. I hope that joint agency
inspections, which we were promised but which have been put on hold,
will still happen, so that we have that cross-disciplinary eye: police
looking at children’s services, children’s services
looking at education, education looking at health services.</hs_Para>

there was a silo approach to inspection, which took up a great deal of
the time of professionals who would rather spend it looking after the
families, and not enough dissemination of information. The best way to
bring that about is better multi-agency training, which we have not
been good at. That is beginning to happen, however. For example, we
have multi-agency safeguarding hubs, through which different agencies
are co-located—sitting next to each other in the same room,
looking at the same intelligence, discussing cases and coming up with a
much better informed and sharper action plan. All those things are
improvements, but the point the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley
(Meg Munn) makes is a valid one.</hs_Para>

many Members want to contribute to the debate, but there is a bit more
I want to say. With the list I have given goes a looming public
apprehension about whether we really have cracked child protection,
buffeted by almost weekly revelations of the latest scandal involving
abuse at the hands of a bishop, a music teacher, a taxi driver or a
soap star. To some extent, it matters not whether the perpetrator is
dead or alive, or how long ago his alleged misdemeanours took place.
The higher profile given by the media to cases linked to celebrities
has, however, been deeply unhelpful, as it detracts from the reality
that the main perpetrators are common criminals in ordinary
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0002.htm#13091227000022">Of
course, the fact that so many cases are now coming to court, however
belatedly, is a sign of some success, in that offenders are now being
pursued better by police. Victims are being heeded more loudly and

being made to
pay.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0002.htm#13091227000023">However,
are our children safer now than they were 50 years ago, when Savile and
others started to ply their trade? Have we just replaced celebrity
abuse of star-struck teenagers while the establishment turned a blind
eye with systematic abuse to order by organised gangs, be they
Pakistani-British—high-profile cases of which we have
seen—or of whatever culture? Are internet groomers and the
recent Oxford and Rochdale abusers just a modern-day version of Savile,
armed with mobile phone technology but without shell suits and the lure
of the “green room”? In that sense, given the reach of
technology as a key tool of the abusers, do they not pose a much more

those of us in the know here today can say that children are safer now
than back in the 1960s, but that is a tough sell to the public at
large. But if that is the case, when did things actually get better?
When did child protection come of age and society at large recognise
its significance? When did we equip our agencies sufficiently to
question the “It’s just Jimmy” mentality and start
turning over some rather grubby stones? Was the landmark Children Act
1989 the turning point? Was it the shocking revelations concerning the
north Wales care homes, which have of course come full circle, as we
now know that the whole story was not properly revealed? It is to
answer these questions that I and others have been calling for some
time for an overarching inquiry into the whole sordid history of child
abuse in this country, going back to the 1960s and traversing the
Children Act, into what I call the legitimate legislation tsunami
post-Victoria Climbié. Such an inquiry must 
<?notus-xml column=1204?>involve a commission, led by respected figures from the law, lawmakers,
social services and children’s charities. It must set out to
provide the holistic assurance that has been so sapped by the plethora

the BBC, the Department of Health and numerous others, and it must go

inquiry must address four main issues. What exactly happened, and why,
over all those years? When did things start getting better, and how?
Have all practical steps been taken to give victims the confidence to
come forward, and for the police to pursue vigorously any remaining
offenders? Perhaps most important of all, have all our major
institutions that have significant dealings with children and young
people instituted child protection policies and practices that are fit
for purpose in 2013 to deal with modern-day technology and savvy
perpetrators?</hs_Para>

referred to what happened with celebrities, which was a sort of feeding
frenzy and succeeded in masking the multitude of real crimes—not
that the former were not real crimes—that were going on amongst
ordinary people. That is why we need an overarching inquiry to look
holistically at what went wrong, what appeared to go wrong, what was a
symptom of media frenzy, and who the victims were and are. Most
important, we need to give some satisfaction and confidence to the
public at large that somebody is looking at this issue properly, and
that there is evidence that their children are safer now—despite
everything that has come out—than 10, 20 or 30 years ago. I do
not think that an unreasonable ask. The former Prime Minister of
Australia established a similar royal commission into historic child
abuse in November 2012, to look into institutional responses to
allegations of sexual abuse in Australia, particularly linked with the
Catholic Church. IT has been done it there, and there is a good case

However, to take on the point made by the hon. Member for Wigan, I am
concerned about the move to the Home Office, because child abuse is not
just about detection and prosecution. It is first and foremost about
education, awareness, early intervention and prevention, and I think
that that is best co-ordinated in the Department for Education, which
retains the lead for children’s social care and for Ofsted
inspection, I think. It is particularly concerning, therefore, that, at
a time when child abuse has never been more in our consciousness, the

do not understand why, because we have much to be proud of. The Munro
reforms provided a fundamental overhaul of child protection and the way
in which that is done in this country. They are widely respected and
starting to be instituted. Hopefully, the appointment of the chief
social worker is raising the profession’s morale and the launch
of the Frontline scheme is raising its confidence. The full publication
of serious case reviews has cast light on the problems that are going
on. There has been a proliferation of multi-agency safeguarding hubs,
progress on child sexual exploitation and the action plan. The
Children’s Society toolkit was launched just this week and it
has also launched its “Say something if you see
something” campaign. The Lord Chancellor’s Department has
made important announcements about the way in which we treat the 23,000
child witnesses in

the past 20 years, we have had numerous high-profile inquiries and
serious case reviews after children have been harmed, abused and
killed. Almost without exception, those inquiries and reviews have come
to the same conclusions—poor inter-agency working, sharing of
information and communication were significant factors in failures to
prevent the child’s injury or death. There is a public
frustration that time and again recommendations point to the same
failings in the system.</hs_Para>

seems that a lot of reviews and inquiries look  at the failures
of the organisations around the child rather than putting the
child’s voice and experience  at the centre of the
review. I
recently<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:17:15"></hs_TimeCode> looked
at a  systems review of CSE practice by Stockport’s
children’s safeguarding board through the eyes of a victim. I
was struck that on a number of occasions her case was closed because
she withdrew her co-operation. She would not communicate. Surely a
better way would have been to find someone capable of talking to her
and winning her trust, which could then have prevented the harm that
subsequently happened to her.</hs_Para>

to the children who gave evidence to our inquiry, it was clear that
children felt that they had not been, and were not being, listened to.
One of the key challenges facing agencies charged with safeguarding
children is being able to communicate properly with children, so that
they feel able to talk about what is happening to them. I agree with
the Children’s Commissioner, Maggie Atkinson, that staff who
work with children and young people, from whichever discipline or
profession, should experience a common set of training that crosses all
boundaries. Unless we can communicate with children, we will not know
what is going on in their lives and therefore we will not be able to
prevent them from coming to harm.</hs_Para>

There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:18:35"></hs_TimeCode> is
widespread concern about the treatment of child witnesses in the court

many leading academics, including Spencer and Plotnikoff, have said,
30-plus years of empirical research in this and similar adversarial
jurisdictions has shown again and again that conventional
cross-examination is more likely to confuse and mislead children than
to draw out accurate and reliable evidence. Indeed, research by the
NSPCC showed that more than 90% of children under 10 do not understand
the questions they are asked in court. The commission that I am
proposing could also consider what further measures might be undertaken
to improve the safety and reliability of processes for the taking and
investigation of children’s evidence by the criminal courts. In
addition, it could examine extending the role of registered
intermediaries to allow them to cross-examine vulnerable witnesses
under the direction of counsel. This idea was first raised more than 20
years ago in the 1989 Pigot committee report, which recommended that
advocates’ questions should be relayed through a specialist
child examiner, such as a paediatrician, child psychiatrist, social
worker or other person who enjoys the child’s
confidence.</hs_Para>

several judgments designed to clean up poor cross-examination

language appropriate to the developmental stage of the witness.
However, despite these encouraging comments from the Court of Appeal,
how we treat children in court is still a massive problem. In the last
couple of weeks, we had the judge who described a 13-year-old victim of

We agreed that we should focus our attention on three separate but

can be difficult to pin down what is meant by the term
“neglect”. It can mean different things for different age

were classified as neglect in different local authorities in different
ways. We concluded from the evidence that the needs of children and the
importance of acting quickly to secure early intervention for children
experiencing neglect are all too often not given sufficient priority. I

examined—namely, the support given to older children. Ofsted

bottom of how children in care were left so vulnerable and what can be
done to take good care of those at risk in future. The police and crime

third key point is the question of whether, in social care practice and
law, the balance is right between the rights of the child and the
duties of parents or those with responsibility for care to safeguard

the issues of public concern material to the Operation Bullfinch cases
is how on earth children can go missing time after time from what
supposedly is a place of care, 
<?notus-xml column=1214?>even when staff suspect those children are victims of grooming. The

Friend is saying, because this situation is familiar to me from my time
working in social services. At that time, secure places were available,
which meant that once a child was identified as being at risk, they
could be put in secure premises where they were offered support. I am

the Government are making is to reduce the use of independent social

are. Civil servants make the error of assuming that an assessment is

16—only guests over the age of 16. All they have to do is ask
for their name and nationality, so it is hard to track who is using
them and when. They do not require a licence to operate unless they
sell alcohol, and are under no specific obligation to report child

that day to this, while neuroscience shows us that all of our later

period—from the moment we are conceived until we are two years
old—80% of our brain development takes place. Our infant brain

is incredibly important about a baby’s brain development is that
when it is born, it does not have a prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal
cortex is the bit that looks like the cauliflower or the shrivelled
prune, but it is not there when babies are born. There is a huge growth
spurt between six months and 18 months, which is stimulated by the
loving care giver saying, “Aren’t you gorgeous;
you’re so beautiful; I really love you”—I do not
mean you, Mr Deputy Speaker, but please do not take this as a personal
rejection; I am merely trying to give you an illustration. That
stimulation—saying “peek-a-boo,” singing songs,
talking to and mimicking the baby, looking into its eyes—sparks
the growth of the baby’s prefrontal cortex. The baby learns that
the world is a good place and that things are fine generally. The baby

for South Northamptonshire (Andrea Leadsom). She is extremely
knowledgeable about these matters, as are other hon. Members, perhaps
much more than I am. I am brought here as a result of a terrible and
harrowing case, which has recently shocked the whole nation—the
death in Coventry of Daniel Pelka. His parents, now both serving life

me make it clear to all my hon. Friends, two of whom I know are
qualified social workers<I>—[Interruption.] </I>Three; I am
grateful for the correction. I was impressed by that fact, and I know
that these colleagues have been at the sharp end, where things seem to
go wrong. What I shall convey today are just my impressions—they
are not informed by a depth of study—but I shudder to think what
the frontal cortex of Daniel Pelka must have looked like after he was
killed by a hammer blow to the head at the age of four and a half. I
know that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:14:47"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for South Northamptonshire is involved with early
intervention—a crucial area—and I think she and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:14:49"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Birkenhead (Mr Field) held a press
conference about it this morning. We cannot leave matters at that,
however, or think that things do not happen thereafter. In this
particular case of Daniel Pelka, the young boy was going to school in
Coventry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:15:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000152">My
first impression, then, is that somebody needs to get a real grip on
the serious case review. I looked closely at the baby P case, when the
then Secretary of State with responsibility for children and education
was presented with what he thought was a very poor serious case review
from Haringey council. I feared that the same would apply in Coventry,
so I pleaded with the council for some element of public
accountability. This is a public issue, and I have been astonished by
the wide geographical spread of the letters of support I have received
since Daniel’s case became public. I have been sent letters from
right across the kingdom on a scale that compares with almost any other
topic during my long period in this House. This was a public case; I
made the case, and then one saw the resistance building up among
officials and politicians about having the issue opened in that
way.</hs_Para>

was reassured because the new leader of council, a long-standing friend
of mine, issued a very good statement following this case, making her
position clear. She

am sure she means that and that she will do that. The problem is,
though, how good will the report be? Can it 
<?notus-xml column=1224?>really be brutally honest and transparent about what happened in this
case? At the crucial period—aged between three and a half and
four and a half years old—a young boy was going to school while
his parents were inflicting cruel physical abuse on him. It is
difficult to come to terms with the sheer evil involved in starving
this poor child and then literally hammering him to death. There was
not even a motive for it, unlike in some cases where psychological
factors might be at play or previous unfortunate personal experiences
might be responsible. The motive in this case seems to be sheer evil;
that is what appears to have driven these parents.</hs_Para>

circumstances such as this, it is natural for those responsible to
recoil and not to want an outside independent view on their performance
in the case. The council did not accept the case for that; it went for
a standard SCR. I do not know how Amy Weir will perform as the chair of
the Coventry local safeguarding children board. Let us wait for the
review; I do not want to prejudge it. I am pleased to tell hon. Members
that we will have it. It has not taken long; it has not been one of the
those protracted reviews that lose all topicality by the time they are
published. Unfortunately, public interest issues tend to go in waves.
That said, we should get the result on Tuesday next week. I might then
have further occasion to comment on it here.</hs_Para>

do not expect answers today, but I would like the Minister to say
whether he is entirely satisfied with the present system of serious
case reviews. Is there not a need for a more independent element to be
built into the process right from the beginning? The importance of
independence inevitably arises when one sees the nervous, cautionary
reaction—aimed at self-preservation—of those involved in
such cases. I know that a teacher of Daniel who reported aspects of
this case subsequently had a nervous breakdown. The issues and effects
are not purely one-sided.</hs_Para>

second thought for the Minister is that although co-ordination between
the different departments is obviously necessary—all the
departments have to be educated—if we adopt the principle that
everybody is responsible, what happens in reality is that nobody takes
responsibility. This is where things became unstuck in Coventry. Nobody
seems to have felt, “Gosh, this is my case. I have got to look
after this. I am responsible.”</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091227000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000158"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>We
heard the Chairman of the Education Select Committee say that the lead
organisation was the Department for Education, which I understand still
includes responsibility for children, but that was not clear in
Coventry. The first thing several councillors said was that they needed
to find out who was responsible—social services or education? In
the end, it seems to have been education. I understand that the report
has already been sent to London education departments. I hope that it
was not for vetting, but as a courtesy—we shall see. It seems
odd that those most involved do not see the report, but that the
Department for Education sees it in its finished state before it is
made public or before it is even shown on a confidential basis to MPs
and others in the area.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091227000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000159"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:19:53"></hs_TimeCode>My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:20:03"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford East (Mr Smith) said that
Members of Parliament should take an interest. We should and we do, but
although we can take initiatives, it is no good expecting us to be
effective. I raised the issue of Daniel Pelka with the department, and
was assured that it was in hand. The 
<?notus-xml column=1225?>next thing we knew, the boy was dead. MPs do not have a locus. We can
highlight, push and prod, but we must recognise the limitations of our
own abilities and
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:20:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
So the second thought that I want to leave with the Minister is whether
we can ensure that the lead responsibility is much more clearly
established where it matters, which is within local authorities. We
must of course co-ordinate the police, social services departments and
education departments, and all other interested departments, but unless
the lead department is clearly identified, we shall not secure the
positive reaction and the intensity of interest that such cases clearly
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000160"><Member ContinuationText="Claire Perry" PimsId="5520" UID="13091227000587" xid="1064" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000587"><B>Claire

I leave the Minister with one last thought? Since I have become
involved, through the Daniel Pelka case, in an issue on which I must
confess that I had not been active in the House before, I have been
lobbied—I do not know whether we are still allowed to use that
word, but I have certainly been contacted and briefed very
heavily—about mandatory reporting by various good organisations,
including the National Association for People Abused in Childhood,
which I believe is well respected. I do not know whether the Department
has considered the issue, but, because time is short, I will send the
Minister a fuller brief on it, along with some background notes which I
hope his officials will look at and at least reply to.</hs_Para>

realise that this is replete with all sorts of dangers, particularly on
the legislative front—unintended consequences and all
that—but those organisations deserve at least an answer. They
have been campaigning long and hard, and I should be grateful if the
Department would examine the issue and think about whether anything can
be done. I presume that some sort of amendment to the Childcare Act
2006 would be required, although I am not sure what it would
involve.</hs_Para>

Munn</B> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I am grateful to the
Backbench Business Committee for granting a debate on this important
issue. In my speech, I shall concentrate on the issue of sexual abuse
of children in religious institutions. I have met survivors of abuse
and their advocates on a number of occasions. They endured terrible
suffering, and they seek justice. They have called for an independent
commission of inquiry into the sexual abuse of children by clergy in
religious institutions, not just in schools.</hs_Para>

public inquiry or similar process would undoubtedly bring the
systematic abuse of children into the open, and would outline the
lessons of their experiences. An inquiry would highlight the betrayal
and abuse of trust by religious institutions—institutions that
are meant to look after the spiritual and moral welfare of children. 
<?notus-xml column=1226?>Time and again, children and vulnerable adults were betrayed by those
whom they trusted. Even today, victims struggle to be heard. Known
abusers are defended by senior clergy. Some parents prefer to believe
the priest rather than their own child. There are cover-ups, witnesses

to go to the authorities because they do not belong to the same
faith<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:23:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000167">I
have looked into the issue in my capacity as chair of the all-party
parliamentary group on child protection, and have concluded that, while
it is essential for us to find some way of ensuring that victims are
heard and believed, a public inquiry may not be the best way of
ensuring that we do what we need to do to protect children today. I
support other Members’ call for an overall inquiry, and indeed I
have written to Ministers about the issue, but now we can do better.

for sexual abuse are found not in the teachings of any faith or
religion, but in individuals who take advantage of the power, position,
trust and authority vested in them by an institution. There is evidence
that faith leaders are taking some steps to ensure that cases are not
covered up, and that they are establishing robust safeguarding policies
that includes support for victims. There have been changes in the way
in which the Catholic Church and the Church of England deal with sex
abuse cases, especially following the Nolan report and the more recent
Butler-Sloss review. The Bradford Council for Mosques and the Bradford
safeguarding children board have worked together to produce a paper
entitled “Children do matter”. The Methodist Church has a
safeguarding policy, and has issued a joint statement with the Church
of England on guiding principles. The Methodists are undertaking a
systematic review of sexual abuse cases dating back to 1950, in order
to establish exactly what happened and what the response was. That is
an excellent move, which I would like other faiths to emulate. Lessons
can be learnt, and our children can be better

there is also evidence of continuing denial. Recent reports have
suggested that a year ago, Cardinal Keith O’Brien blocked a
similar review of abuse in the Catholic Church in Scotland. We need to
look at the behaviour of faith institutions, and to ask whether the
proposals for change are sufficient and the pace of change fast and
widespread enough. We need to understand that part of the abuse by
people who represent faiths stems from the fact that we expect more of
them when they are looking after our children. This is not just the
abuse of trust that we see elsewhere; it is a fundamental betrayal of
the beliefs held by members of those
faiths<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:25:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000170">Organisations,
including religious organisations, can and must do all that they can to
protect children, deter paedophiles, and ensure that perpetrators are
stopped and face justice. They must change a culture that minimises
both the prevalence of abuse of children and its effects. I was
disturbed to discover from the internet that an organisation called
Catholic Voices, which seeks to portray the Catholic Church positively
in the media, is minimising the issue of abuse by Catholic priests. Its
argument is that it is much more prevalent in society in general than
it is in the Church. Does it not understand that organisations which
are in regular contact with children must ensure that those who work
with children in their name are 
<?notus-xml column=1227?>their responsibility? Those are astonishing statements from a religious
organisation that should be doing all it can to prevent abuse.

is not just the Catholic Church that needs to do more. The Church of
England has only just apologised for the scandal of the abuse that took
place in Chichester, and there are worrying reports from other faiths.
A new book by a Muslim woman describes abuse that she suffered at the
hands of her imam, and there has been a Channel 4 documentary about
alleged cover-ups by rabbis in some Jewish communities. However, this
is not just the responsibility of religious organisations. We must ask
whether the law and the guidance are sufficient to protect children in

procedures in place. The re-launched guidance entitled “Working

everyone’s responsibility, which is welcome. Safeguarding is
clearly the responsibility of everyone, particularly those who work

only mention of faith organisations appears at the end of chapter 2,

expect our faith organisations to say, “Not in my Church, not by
my priests,” and to do everything they can to ensure that,
rather than saying, “Well, it’s not as bad as it is
elsewhere.” That is not an acceptable attitude and speaks of
denial and deflection. That is what I am

horror stories in the NSPCC report, which stated that more than half a
million children and young people are estimated to have been a victim
of maltreatment by a parent or guardian last year and, indeed, every
year. All of a sudden the magnitude of the problem becomes very real.
There is still a part of me that thinks that that figure cannot be
right. How could it be? How could half a million children and young
people be maltreated every year? We are a civilised country. We have a
high moral code. Can that happen? The problem is that the figure is all

want to describe what we are doing in Northern Ireland, because it is
important that a marker is put down. Churches have introduced a code of
conduct and are specifically addressing the issues. I give the example
of my own Church, where we took a stand on the need to do those things.
In my Church anyone who works with children in any shape or form must
attend a yearly child protection seminar and be police- checked every
few years, but is that enough? Is there enough understanding? When I
listen to some of the women who have worked with children voluntarily
for years, they say they are saddened that they can no longer pick up a
crying child and put them on their knee to comfort 
<?notus-xml column=1230?>them. They must get down to the child’s level, pat their arm and
speak soothingly. The bus driver must be very aware of these issues and
cannot be alone with a child. If he is hugged, he must step away
quickly, ensuring that someone else has noted his physical reaction.
These rules may seem extreme to some people, but they are what the
Churches and other bodies that work with children feel they must do to
ensure protection from those who in the past have abused their
positions or abused

Although steps have been taken to address child protection, I believe
that a lot more can and should be done. People should be aware of the
signs, know when to flag something up and, more importantly, know who
to flag it up to. We need the involvement of the community groups, the
youth clubs, the homework clubs, and the Church organisations such as
the Boys Brigade and the Campaigners, which are run by unpaid
volunteers who have a love for their 
<?notus-xml column=1231?>children. We cannot afford to have voluntary sector organisations become
so frightened about what they can and cannot do and so unsure about how
to raise suspicions that they pack it all in. A little bit of knowledge
can made a difference to the life of a child. Rather than merely saying
that each organisation should have a child protection officer in place,
we should be making available the training to ensure that all those who
work with children know the signs and the next steps to take.</hs_Para>

child sexual exploitation happens too and can take various forms. For
example, young people are sometimes used to “recruit”
others by inviting them to parties where they will then be introduced
to adults or forced to perform sexual acts on adults. Technology can
also play a significant role, with young people being cajoled into
using mobile technology as a way of distributing images of

is vital to understand that both perpetrators and victims can come from
a variety of ethnic and cultural backgrounds. Child sexual exploitation
is not a crime restricted to British Pakistani males or white British
girls, despite the media coverage of high-profile cases. Indeed, recent
findings have highlighted the fact that girls of Asian origin are
frequently the subjects of this heinous crime themselves.</hs_Para>

is also a perception that child sexual exploitation only affects

disproportionate number of the victims of sexual exploitation and can
be particularly vulnerable. An estimated 20% to 25% of victims are
looked-after children, with only 1% of the child population being in
care. However, the majority of children who are exploited are still

false perception is that it only affects young women. In truth, boys
and young men are also targeted. The full extent is not known as boys,
in particular, are highly reluctant to come forward. Nevertheless, one
in 10 of the young people receiving support from Barnardo’s for
this crime are boys, and in some services the proportion is

higher.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000202">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:44:27"></hs_TimeCode>
is also important to acknowledge that women can be perpetrators of this
crime. For example, in a case currently being tried in Sheffield the
alleged gang leader is a woman. Although such examples are rare, it is
more common that female involvement is in facilitating the abuse. The
inquiry led by the Office of the Children’s Commissioner found
that when women and girls were identified as perpetrators, their role
was primarily, although not exclusively, to procure victims. The sad
and hidden truth behind such activity is that there is often a cycle of
abuse at work, with many of those women and girls having been sexually
exploited
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000203">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:45:01"></hs_TimeCode>

something on which the Home Affairs Committee has made several
recommendations. However, child sexual exploitation is being unearthed
wherever it is being investigated. Further work by the Government is
required to determine the full extent of the problem. In addition, the
importance of all agencies sharing information in the interests of

is important that services are open to external scrutiny and are
accountable to the people they serve. From my research, it seems clear
that the only way to tackle child sexual exploitation is by services
working collaborative. The key focus must be on preventing, protecting
and pursuing: preventing young people from becoming a victim;
protecting those who show signs of being at risk of becoming a victim;
and pursuing those who commit such horrific crimes. Realistically,
local authorities, the police, the voluntary sector and health and
education services all need to share their experience, data and
resources if they are effectively to tackle and prevent this
crime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000208">Rotherham<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:47:42"></hs_TimeCode>

victim had been on the stand for seven weeks during the court process.
That is unimaginable to me, and it should never be allowed to happen.
The victims should automatically be given counselling and as much
support as they require. Indeed, I would extend that to ensure that the
whole family received support, as the damage caused by this crime can

a personal level, I am interested in determining whether existing
legislation is appropriate for tackling the crime, and I will be
working with Barnardo’s on this topic in the coming months. I am
also supporting the campaign led by Paula Barrow and assisted by the
@Mandatenow coalition calling for a “Daniel’s
law”, which would make it mandatory for professionals working 
<?notus-xml column=1234?>with children to report signs of possible abuse.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:50:49"></hs_TimeCode> my colleagues
have mentioned, four-year-old Daniel Pelka was starved and beaten over
a period of months before his death. Staff, teaching assistants and
others at his school observed his desperate attempts to forage for
food, his severe weight loss and the numerous bruises and injuries he
suffered. There is currently no legal requirement for anyone working
with children in the UK to report suspected or known abuse either to
the appropriate local authority officer or to the police. Without such
a law in place to support staff and protect children, effective
safeguarding will never be
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:50:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, this is not only the responsibility of professionals. Local
communities play an essential part in identifying not only those at
risk but those who have the potential to commit these crimes. We all
have a duty of care to be diligent and to report suspicious behaviour
to the police. Unless we do so, this vile crime will continue

am aware that much of today’s debate has focused on the
protection of children from sexual abuse, but I would like to highlight
some of the generic failures in our child protection system, as it is
those failures that often lead to the poor detection of such abuse. The
question of how to protect our children from significant harm has
troubled successive Governments since the abhorrent murder of Maria
Colwell. Sadly, the fact that her murder was followed by that of
Victoria Climbié, Peter Connelly and more recently Daniel Pelka
indicates that, despite the best intentions, the system can never be
infallible; nor can it account for the horrors of human
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:51:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000214">Children
have a wealth of professionals involved in their lives, and child
protection is very much in the public psyche, yet opportunities for
intervention  and successful safeguarding are often missed.
Those opportunities are missed because social workers, police, teachers
and health professionals are operating in highly bureaucratic,
constantly restructured and underfunded services to such a degree that
they inherently retreat into their own cultures and service demands,
instead of fostering good, robust multi-agency
practices<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

constant scapegoating and poor image of the social work profession has
also permeated the minds of the public and the wider agencies to such a
degree that social work knowledge and expertise are often undermined.
Each decision a social worker takes as a lead professional has to be
ratified and agreed by a number of other professionals, some of whom
have not even met the child
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:52:37"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
easy to see how children go unnoticed in such an adult-led
agenda<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:52:44"></hs_TimeCode>. All too
often, the result is that social workers have to placate courts and
other professionals, and meet management targets, to such a degree that
children are not seen as frequently as they should be, and as a result
are hurt, injured or, in extreme cases,
murdered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:52:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The
lack of communication between agencies was cited as a contributory
factor to the deaths of Maria Colwell, Victoria Climbié, Peter
Connelly and Daniel Pelka. Maria was murdered in  
<?notus-xml column=1235?>1973, and Daniel in 2013. The tragedy is that, despite 40
years having passed, the reasons cited for their untimely deaths are
still the same.</hs_Para>

a time of unprecedented local authority cuts, the reality is that of

worries me further is the uncertainty over probation services.
Multi-agency public protection arrangements are forums that manage
high-level offenders, including child-sex offenders and those who pose
a risk to our children. The Government’s plans for probation are
unclear. Concern has been expressed to me that, among other changes,
multi-agency public protection arrangements might be outsourced to
different areas of the country. That would mean a child-sex offender,
perhaps in my constituency, being monitored from Leeds. That would be
unacceptable and would place children at high risk of
harm.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000221">Child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:55:54"></hs_TimeCode>
protection is about early intervention. The first three years of any
child’s life are the most vital to cognitive and motor
development, yet Sure Starts that specialise in that area are being
closed across the country. Studies completed by Professor Harriet Ward
of Loughborough university highlighted the incongruence between the
rights of the child and those of their parents and carers, and the
lengthy court processes that can delay pertinent decisions regarding a

resulted in chronic and long-term neglect being overlooked. I have
witnessed first hand the devastating effects of children being
maintained at 
<?notus-xml column=1236?>home for too long, being in limbo in foster care and awaiting adoption.
Sadly, at times, the window for adoption, if that is deemed the best
outcome for a child, has closed while their case has been locked in
care proceedings for too long. I therefore welcome the news of proposed
changes to the public law outline, which will ensure swifter conclusion

making has worsened the situation of the children in those authorities

2001 census suggested there were 587,000 Africans living in the UK.
That was surely an underestimate, and the number has definitely
increased in size, due partly to birth rate. However, among Africans of
all nations, who contribute so much to our country and particularly my
constituency, we have also seen a belief in witches come with that
migration. Whether it is “ndoki” in Congolese,
“jinn” in Tanzania, or the “aje” or
“awozi” of Nigeria, the concept of witchcraft has taken

time to go into all the details of this horrific crime, but once a
child has been identified as a witch, they may be subject to
psychological and emotional abuse, physical abuse to
“beat” the devil out physically, and in some cases
families send their children back home to be dealt with—teachers
sometimes discover that through bruises on the body. There is often
neglect and isolation from others, sexual abuse as a result of that
neglect, and lack of protection. Often, violent exorcism is carried out
by a faith leader. Some of the bogus pastors identified by AFRUCA
charge families money to exorcise, and sometimes use violence to do
that. There can be real shame, which often leads to domestic abuse. For
example, a father might be told that his child is possessed and that

of witchcraft is not exclusive to African communities, but it has come
to my notice partly through my African constituents. Traditional
beliefs and some Christian beliefs often include belief in a spirit
possession, and factors that can increase suspicion, such as poverty
due to a lack of jobs and success, lead to increased accusations of
children being involved in witchcraft. The main issues identified by
AFRUCA involve the far-reaching devastation caused by accusations of
witchcraft, some of which I have touched on. They include the
vulnerability of communities to rogue pastors—I mentioned
charging for exorcism—and the belief that the issue can be dealt
with within the community is powerful and difficult for the Government,
or anyone, to penetrate. I will ask the Minister some questions on that
in my concluding remarks. There is also a lack of protection for
vulnerable families.</hs_Para>

been trying to work out the extent of the problem, and estimates there
are about a dozen serious cases a year. From January 2011 to February
2012, 11 cases were identified, including one of a child with cri du
chat syndrome who was accused of possession and physically abused. I
know that in Nigeria there is a book that explains to pastors and
others how to identify children who are possessed, including children
over six months who are crying too much. The book would be illegal in
the UK, but it exists and, given travel backwards and forwards, it
clearly influences some people.</hs_Para>

that the report by the Education Committee report of late 2012 touches
on witchcraft, but it is only one small section of the report. I do not
criticise the Committee for that, but it is perhaps a reflection of how
the issue is still not widely understood or reflected in society. Too
often, perhaps, it is seen as an issue affecting one or two small
communities, when its effect is wider than that. I also welcome the
fact that the Government have a national plan to tackle abuse linked to
faith or belief, although I hope that the Minister would acknowledge
there is still a long way to go and that we cannot solve this from
Whitehall. However many edicts come from Whitehall or changes are made
to the law, they will not solve the problem in those communities where
the shame of admitting the problem is very
great.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000236">The
Government’s plans do not penetrate into the Churches in my
constituency where such abuse might be occurring, and it is also
difficult for me to do so as the Member of Parliament. I have talked a
lot to religious leaders and intend to do so more, especially with some
of the smaller, individual Churches set up by individuals, without a
hierarchy. I have also talked to the religious leaders of hierarchical
Churches in my constituency, including the Church of England, because
they are often the first to meet and talk to victims after their own
pastor has suggested a price for exorcism or diagnosed possession. The
Church of England’s own diocesan exorcist is based in Hackney
and she will carry out an official exorcism if other priests in the
area have not had success through conversation and prayer with the
people who have come to them for help. I stress to the Minister that it
is at this very local level that these issues come out and, in all the
work that he and his colleague with responsibility in this area do,
they will not have direct links to this activity—how could
they?</hs_Para>

important that in any action we find ways to get down to the most local

support made available, whether that is a small amount of finance,
access to expertise or knowing when to refer, so that it is not put in
a box marked too difficult to deal with or—worse

all have a role to play in that as elected Members. The previous Home
Office Minister with responsibility for child protection issues did not
believe that faith leaders should be vetted or, if necessary, barred. I
would like the Minister to clarify today whether that is still the view
of the Home Office, or whether faith leaders should be vetted like
others who work regularly with
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000239">In
July I visited Nigeria—I chair the all-party group on
Nigeria—and met the federal human trafficking agency. Nigeria is
the largest source country of trafficked people and many of these
children, but it is often difficult to prove a case because of the
witchcraft issue. People are frightened of reporting things. The issues
of witchcraft extend beyond our borders, but because children and women
are trafficked into this country we need to make sure that we have
robust strategies for dealing with that, as well as for working with
the Nigerian Government. I shall say no more about trafficking because
today’s debate is about the more specific issue 
<?notus-xml column=1239?>of child abuse, but I have some questions for the Minister. He may not
be able to answer all of them today, but I hope that he will write to
me and other hon. Members with the answers.</hs_Para>

individuals on the boards of our various child protection
bodies—I do not need to spell out which they are—have
direct experience and understanding of ritual abuse, witchcraft and
such matters? In my experience as a Minister, those individuals were
very inexperienced in those issues. What is the Government’s
position on the vetting and barring of ministers? Will he update the
House on the workings of Operation Paladin and whether he has any plans
to extend it? Who on the national body that he chairs on the sexual
abuse of children has a real understanding of witchcraft? If this is to
make any difference to many of my constituents, we need some
understanding built into the system. What work are the Government doing
with churches, both mainstream and smaller—and especially those
run by individuals—to promote best practice and collaboration,
and to offer help if a church comes to a council or another body for
support? That is key to getting to the nub of the issue. When people
want help they should get it, and if they are doing the wrong thing
they need to be challenged by law and prosecuted if
necessary.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_12_PT_1/730B7FC6C6E3B62040A13D86EBB91D33D4B4665E" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 September 2013">Thursday

Government, the Department for Children, Schools and Families took the
role of co-ordinating a cross-Government approach to children and

concerned that if the Home Office is the lead Department, it is falling
a little short in providing the necessary co-ordination between
Departments at national level and between different organisations at
local level. For example, the Department for Education has only just
appointed a chief social worker, has disbanded its expert working group
on sexual exploitation, and no longer has a lead person on violence
against women and girls. The Department for Communities and Local
Government is failing to provide the support or resources needed for
effective operation of local safeguarding boards. The Department of
Health is failing to intervene to stop the confusion about where child
protection responsibilities lie in the reformed NHS

through a few of the other issues that are pertinent to this debate,
and to start with the question of an overarching inquiry, which the
hon. Member for East Worthing and Shoreham raised at the beginning of
the debate. There are the investigations into Jimmy Savile’s
conduct and why no action was taken by various institutions. There has
been an inquiry into the Waterhouse abuse scandal; the deputy
Children’s Commissioner is conducting an inquiry into the
culture of grooming; the NSPCC, Barnardo’s and the
Children’s Society have all produced important reports. There
have been a number of serious case reviews, and the Munro and Kennedy
reviews. The House has benefited from the excellent reports compiled by
Members. The Home Affairs Committee has produced a report on localised
grooming, and the Education Committee has completed an inquiry into
child protection. In addition, there have been excellent reports from a

reports have given rise to many recommendations, and each makes
recommendations to different bodies and at different levels. We all
want to see these recommendations translated into action. Like many
other Members, I think it would be ideal if one report was
complied—similar to a serious case review—that brings
together the various inquiries mentioned in the debate and makes clear
recommendations, to be implemented at a local and national level, with
clear lines of accountability.</hs_Para>

of the Disclosure and Barring Service, whose job it is to prevent
people who pose a danger to children from getting work with children,
has been dramatically changed by the Protection of Freedoms Act 2012.
The changes mean that the DBS seems to be barring fewer people. More
than 17,000 people were placed on the barred list in 2009, but so far
this year, the figure is 1,400. Perhaps most importantly, the Act
dramatically reduced the number of agencies that the DBS can share
information with. Indeed, in many cases sharing intelligence with a

Friend and the House that a lot is changing and in particular a lot has
changed as a result of the setting up of the national group, which is
made up not just of various Government Departments but the delivery
agencies, the inspectorates, the police and the voluntary and community
sectors, which are particularly valuable. It has a core focus on
reducing the vulnerability of victims, reducing the risks from abuse of
authority and power and improving our systems in dealing with these
crimes, as well as strengthening local accountability. Helped by
members of the group such as the NSPCC, Barnardo’s and Rape
Crisis, the group is taking the lessons learnt from recent inquiries
and police investigations. It has identified nine areas for action,
four of which I have said should receive particularly urgent attention.
Since the group was established last April, we have already made
progress in these priority areas.</hs_Para>

the Government have plans for a further range of attacks on employment

unfair dismissal is to be limited. Even though there has been
widespread opposition, and only lukewarm support even from business,
the Government have still pushed ahead with introducing a new
employment status of employee shareholder so that employers can buy out
the rights to unfair dismissal, statutory redundancy pay, time to
train, and the right to request to work flexibly. The Government want
to reduce the protection that TUPE offers to workers who have their job

operating in the 1920s and ’30s when employers flaunted 
<?notus-xml column=1247?>overwhelming market power. The attack on the Agricultural Wages Board

this is a big part of the motive of current Tory
Euroscepticism—the Government will make it easier for bad

£60,000 a week, while the national minimum wage is just

agency work, which was used to increase the casualisation of labour and
to undermine security, may have largely been quelled as the result of a
lot of pressure, particularly from the unions, but we now have a
situation in which rogue employers—there are many good

me describe the situation for Members, because we in this House do not

It means that people run out of money during the month and that
borrowing from payday lenders is routine. It means that people have to
look for additional employment, if that is allowed by their first
employer. It means high levels of anxiety. People have no savings or
contingency money and no access to credit. There are penalties for
workers who try to rent accommodation, sanctions if a worker tries to
speak out and contracts that imprison workers on zero hours with the
same employer, often for more than three
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000300">Zero<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:40:52"></hs_TimeCode>-hours

the charitable sector and elsewhere. When profits have never been so
high and when the ultra-rich and corporate elite in this country have
never had it so good, this is a despicable demeaning of the working
conditions of a large section of the work force, which some

alarming and dangerous aspect of weakened employment conditions that is
becoming more widespread is the impact on health and safety. In the
building industry, false self-employment through the device of payroll
companies not only costs taxpayers £1.9 billion a year in lost
revenue, of which £1.2 billion comes from employers avoiding
national insurance contributions, but has serious implications for site
safety. Sites that use false self-employment often have a higher
accident rate because they usually do not have independent safety
representatives. They also have a higher turnover of staff, meaning
that safety measures are often lost, are not heard or are fragmented.
The fact that falsely self-employed workers can be fired without
warning means that they are far less likely to raise safety concerns.
That explains why, over the past eight years, more than 55 construction
workers a year on average have been killed just doing their ordinary
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000302">Similar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:42:58"></hs_TimeCode>

strictly regulated, if not eliminated, to ensure that important and
necessary working rights are not sacrificed; all workers who have been
blacklisted—a practice which recently came to light—are
fully compensated and a public inquiry held to ensure that it never
happens again; wages councils are reintroduced because, as Winston
Churchill understood, they are the only effective way to protect the
very poorest; and, finally—because I do not just want to
eliminate the negatives—a positive platform is established for
employment rights through a partnership between management and the
unions in the running of companies. That concept, which this House

revolution and beyond—I include his point about the
1920s—there was large-scale exploitation of workers by organised
capital and its management. I know that that sounds a bit Marxist for
Conservative Member, but I accept that that happened. Today, however,
thanks very much to trade unions and, I might say, the endeavours of
the Labour party in the past, there is now a situation where the rights
of organised labour, and

rights of capital and management. I accept that right hon. and hon.

attempt to take them away. However, it is my contention that while low
pay is a significant problem and I would never make light of it, and
while poverty is a significant problem and I would never make light of

argument that private sector employment spends its time trying to get
around the labour laws by coming up with devices, such as zero-hours
contracts and casual labour, is not only misleading but insulting to
the many businesses, small and large, in my constituency that are
expanding. They are taking on labour and apprentices—whoever
they can—because they have confidence in the economy and in
their employees. Employees are a very expensive commodity for
employers, because of training and the time it takes for recruitment,
and employing people is not done lightly. It is not something that
employers do just because they think, “Well, I’ll try it
for a few weeks and then if it doesn’t work I’ll fire
them and make them get on with something else.” Life today is
not like that. I can say that, having been an employer most of my life.

proposal is that many companies in all types of industry use zero-hours
contracts responsibly. They provide work, for example, to parents who
have different needs for child care and to students, and they provide
opportunities for people to join the work force in a flexible manner,
perhaps while they study or carry out other commitments. Companies that
use these contracts responsibly offer full training, paid holiday and
all the other things that people in normal employment
receive—and so they should, both legally and morally. They do
not ask people simply to be on call at all times or prevent them from
knowing how much they are going to earn.</hs_Para>

they call it “McD work” and there are many other
clichés that go with it. McDonald’s, however, takes a
pride in the employment it offers and in the training it gives people.
During the application procedure, it asks how many hours people want to
work, and it organises its shift systems accordingly. I ask all hon.

conclude, the future for labour and recruitment will, in my opinion,
come about by making labour as flexible as possible. Employers do not
want to hire and fire people; they want to invest in people and train
them. I commend the Government for putting in resources to help them do
that. This old idea of a perpetual battle between labour and capital,
and between management and working people, makes me wonder which
century some people are living in. It is not like that in the 
real world. The last thing that the 1,400 businesses that

to address in the House. The Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union is
currently involved in a dispute at the Hovis company in Wigan. Hovis
has been taken over by Premier Foods, and there have been a great many
layoffs. The union has negotiated as best it can in order to secure the
long-term future of the company, as well as what is best for its
members who are being laid off, but there have been abuses, one of
which seems to be occurring in other parts of industry as

in Wigan started to take on workers who were paid less and had less
favourable conditions than the existing workers, and also to use
zero-hours contracts. That led to a strike. A negotiation took place
and the union thought that the dispute had been resolved, but the
company then started to employ agency workers. It used what is referred
to as the “Swedish derogation”, which means that an
agency can employ staff directly, and those staff can then work
alongside others while being paid less and experiencing less favourable
conditions. Members may recall that

Maritime and Transport Workers, which represents the majority of

wage applies to all seafarers working on ships operating out of UK
ports. What has been happening is that the minimum wage has not been
applied to those who are not European economic area nationals. On some
ships, people working alongside British seafarers and doing the same

right hon. Friend the Member for Oldham West and Royton mentioned
railway track workers. Network Rail is now using hundreds of
sub-contractors. Members may recall that track maintenance was brought
in-house because of health and safety problems that resulted in some
tragic accidents, including two near my constituency, one at Paddington
and one at Southall. I attended the funeral of a driver who died in one
of those accidents. We discovered that track workers were being
employed by contractors and sub-contractors, and there was no
supervision of safety whatsoever. That is the case again now, because,
as my right hon. Friend pointed out, fewer than 10% of track workers

Track workers are urged—almost browbeaten—to sign on to
payroll companies, which the sub-contractors then use. Workers have to
pay the payroll companies just to be paid themselves, but it is a
device used by those companies to avoid tax. We need to examine the
practice, both as a tax avoidance issue, which is a scandal, and
because some track workers are contracted at the same time by up to 20
different contractors. They are given bits of work by each of those
employers, and they are sometimes pressurised into zero-hours contracts
as well. I believe that Network Rail’s overall supervision from
the contractor to the sub-contractor to the worker is breaking down,
posing a real risk to health and
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000332" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000332">We

a campaign which resulted in mass demonstrations, with hundreds of

the most important thing that the coalition Government have achieved in

only to look across the sea to see what has been happening in Europe,

point is that this has been an appalling recession. I know so many
business owners and staff who have worked so hard over the past few
years to keep jobs and get through the recession. I know employers who
have said to their staff that no one would get a pay rise for the next
12 months, or 24 months, including directors,

compare that with previous recessions, when unemployment shot up and
there was tremendous animosity between employers and employees. This
time, despite what some Opposition Members say, that has not been the
case. There has been an understanding, particularly in the private
sector, that, “My God, if we are going to get through this we
have to roll up our sleeves.” It has really worked, because we
have 1.4 million new employees after such a shocking recession, and we

sides. My personal view is that we need much more robust research to
identify the scale of the problem. I can see how unscrupulous employers
are abusing zero-hours contracts, but I know from my own experience of
talking to people who work in the university sector and the NHS that
some of them like those contracts.</hs_Para>

jobs. The Government have been proven right that consideration of

it easier for new, smaller, principally technical companies to take

do not agree that unions cannot be helpful in relationships between
employers and employees, and I think they play an important role,
particularly in bigger companies. I believe, however, that the current
tactic of the unions on the relationship between employee and employer
is barking mad, and I will give two examples of that. First, a
gentleman in a village in my constituency runs a big company. He
outsourced some of his work, and that outsource company laid off some
staff. That gentleman and his family have been harassed by a particular
union for months, with people coming on coaches to invade the village
and demonstrate against a decision for which he was not responsible,
using a tactic that the union has imported from
America.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000373">The
second example is a piece of information sent to, I think, Unite
members over the past few weeks, suggesting that they see the employer
as an opponent and someone with whom they should be deliberately having
a fight. That is what upsets me most about the way that the unions are
looking at the issue. I have attended most debates on employment law
since becoming a Member of Parliament, and the fact that so many Labour
Members take the view of the unions, as in the examples I have given,
means that they are not taking an objective view of the importance of
employment law. The shadow Minister has employed people and knows full
well that these reforms are the right way forward, but for whatever
reason, he is blinkered by other
constraints.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0003.htm#13091227000374">In
conclusion, the employment law world is changing, and changing fast.
This debate on zero-hours contracts will be writ large in years to
come, and there will be more part-time working, more multiple
employment and working from home, and probably much more
self-employment and entrepreneurship. It will be a wholly different
way, and if Labour Members do not look at that trend and look five or
10 years ahead, they will fail to represent workers and those people
they have often represented so well through the unions, as in the cases
we heard earlier. I urge them to consider the Government’s
reforms, support them and see them in the light of incremental change,
rather than as a radical return to a past that possibly never
existed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:23:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

standards crisis that people are facing is not only an issue of pay and

already has the third most liberal labour market in the OECD, but since
taking office the coalition has shown real determination to undermine
people’s protections at work, making it easier to fire people
but not easier to hire people. In effect, they have heaped further
insecurity on working people. I shall speak today about two aspects of

employment is now widespread in many sectors of the economy, and it is
especially prevalent in areas of higher unemployment, where the
lowest-paid and most vulnerable workers in Britain exist without
knowing when the next payday might come. That is certainly the case in
my constituency. People on zero-hours contracts tell me about waiting
for a call or turning up to the workplace day after day, only to find
there is no work, but their contracts make it difficult to find
alternative employment or to claim jobseeker’s allowance. I have

Iain McKenzie</B> (Inverclyde) (Lab):</Member> I congratulate the
Backbench Business Committee and my right hon. Friend the Member for
Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) on securing the debate.
I want to concentrate on two examples of employment contracts that
challenge employment rights. Many people who are desperate for work
sign such contracts, only to find later that they have signed a
document that allows the employer to opt out of the natural progression
to equal employment conditions. I have been told of employment agencies
using and developing ways to absorb into their contracts the list of
“reset to zero” the qualifying period for equal pay and
conditions. I speak, of course, of zero-hours and pay between
assignments contracts.</hs_Para>

been the spur that some unscrupulous employers have used to introduce
erosion of employment rights, as evidenced by the increasing frequency
of zero-hours contracts. The zero-hours contract offers no guaranteed
work. As part of the general erosion of terms and conditions of
employees, employers have increasingly been turning to the likes of
zero-hours contracts. Under such contracts, an individual typically
undertakes to be available for work, but the employer does not
undertake to provide any work, and only pays for the hours worked. The
zero-hours contract is now widely used, and a survey by the industrial
relations service indicates that 23% of employers now include
zero-hours contracts as one of their employment options. The Office for
National Statistics also found a major surge in zero-hours contracts
during 2012.</hs_Para>

contracts quite simply undermine employment rights. The variability of
earnings throws into doubt an individual’s eligibility to claim
various forms of benefit. The employment rights of those employed on
zero-hours contracts pivot on whether the contract imposes
“mutuality of obligation” between employer and employee.
To gain such rights, it is crucial for employees to prove that the
contract constitutes an employment relationship—not as easy as
it sounds, but it has been successful, and it is why we see a move to
find an even more flexible contract option, which offers a loophole
even to avoid the commitments of zero-hours contracts. That is why we
witness the growth in pay between assignments.</hs_Para>

Government for failing to implement the temporary agency workers
directive properly, which has led to tens of thousands of agency

rules saying that they are entitled to equal pay. The Government are

between assignments contracts can often be even worse than the
much-criticised zero hours contracts. The whole point of the 2011
agency regulations was to bring the principle of equal treatment,
including equal pay for agency employees, into UK law. However, the
introduction of these contracts means that many agency workers are
signing away their rights to equal pay, which for most people is the
most important element of the regulations. The madness here is that,
compared with those on pay between assignments contracts, those on zero
hours contracts are actually better off, because they qualify for equal
pay after 12 weeks—although that does not always necessarily
follow.</hs_Para>

Government’s attitude to the workplace is that employers need
more power relative to workers, that the rights of people at work are a
barrier to growth and jobs, and that protection in the workplace holds
back the economy—and all in the name of economic growth. Taking
employee rights and health and safety back to Victorian times will not
create economic growth.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:43:23"></hs_TimeCode> insecurity

£1,500 less a year on average than they were in 2010. The former
Employment Relations Minister, now Minister of State, Department of
Health, the hon. Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), had it exactly
right when he said that there was an inextricable link between job
security and consumer confidence and that policies that would damage
job security would be “crazy”. He was absolutely correct.
Unfortunately, he made those comments before he got the employment

work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000408" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000408">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:43:59"></hs_TimeCode>

Actually, the statistics and analysis do not reflect that. It is worth

Government’s vision for the UK’s labour market is for it
to be flexible, effective and fair. We want people to be able to access
the type of work that they want and  
<?notus-xml column=1268?>employers to be able to create jobs and manage their work forces
effectively. We can help to do this by minimising the burden of
regulation so that employers are free to create jobs and hire new
staff. At the heart of our approach is a belief that employers and
individuals are in the best position to decide what works for them. The
role of Government is to provide the right framework to facilitate
that, not to dictate outcomes through heavy regulatory approaches.
Crucially<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:50:54"></hs_TimeCode>, we
need to ensure that people are treated fairly at work and that
employers can compete on a level playing field without being undercut
by unscrupulous employers who break the law and exploit their staff. We
therefore launched a comprehensive, Parliament-long employment law
review to tackle the perceptions and the reality of employment law
burdens and to implement our strategy in practice.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Skipton and Ripon (Julian Smith) mentioned
the proposals on shared parental leave. That is a radical reform to
employment law allowing mums and dads to choose how they share the time
off after their baby is born. That is good for children, particularly
because the involvement of dads early on in the process can help child
development. It is good for parents, making it easier for them to
balance their responsibilities with their work. It is also good for
employers, who can benefit from a more motivated, productive work
force, with a more flexible system that enables working mums who want
to return to work to do so earlier.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13091227000428" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000428"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:52:01"></hs_TimeCode>We
are also extending the right to request flexible working that will come
in from next April. It has already been available to parents, having
been introduced by the previous Government, and it has been a great
success, with four in five of the requests made being granted. There
are all sorts of reasons why people might want to work flexibly, not
just because they are parents. Perhaps they have other caring
responsibilities. Perhaps they volunteer in their community. Perhaps
they are older workers nearing the end of their working life who,
rather than working full time one day and not at all the next, would
like to taper their working as they ease into retirement.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:52:47"></hs_TimeCode> need to move
towards this situation being much more the norm than an anomaly. We
have no need to keep our workplaces stuck in the 1950s with a culture
of presenteeism. Modern technology has revolutionised the way that we

directors’ pay differentials. There is great agreement in all

been great success with a company growing, employing more people and
bringing more wealth to the country, I do not think people mind 
<?notus-xml column=1269?>payment being made accordingly, but where there has not been that
success, there should not be unearned large packages. That is why the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:54:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

They can be applied in an fair and appropriate way, and people
generally have no problem when there is flexibility on both sides and
no imbalance of power in the relationship. Equally, many employers
recognise that it would be counterproductive for them, as a matter of
course, to put all their employers on to zero-hours contracts, because
where the employee is, in effect, taking the place of a permanent
full-time worker, or even a permanent part-time worker working 20 or so
hours a week, that does not necessarily create the most positive and
productive relationship between the employer and the
employee.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T16:52:41"></hs_TimeCode> Of

his country and move his nation forward. I welcome and wholeheartedly
support the peace talks. However, I am disappointed to see that in
recent months, President Santos and his Ministers have reverted to the
tactics used under former President Uribe’s Government of
accusing any opposition groups of being linked to terrorism and
brutally repressing social protest. Following the public relations

me that things are getting better in Colombia: that one fewer death
means progress and that one fewer disappearance is a good thing.
Despite the positive rhetoric, more than 250 civil society activists
have been murdered since President Santos came to power and countless
people have been imprisoned by the Colombian authorities on the weakest
or indeed non-existent evidence. Questions were raised about the
Colombian Government’s commitment to justice for victims when we
saw the recent military justice reforms, which led to further impunity
for military crimes and about which the United Nations, Amnesty
International and Human Rights Watch have raised
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000450" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000450">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:02:21"></hs_TimeCode>
believe President Santos when he says that he wants to succeed in the
peace talks. However, there is a contradiction in negotiating with the
FARC, which is on the point of political participation, while at the
same time denouncing trade unionists and civil rights activists as
terrorists. That does not create a political climate that is conducive
to democracy and peace. I know that there are serious opponents to the

the perverse and sickening incentive scheme that was designed to reward
military personnel for the guerrilla body count. My scepticism was
reinforced when President Santos responded to the so-called
“false positives” scandal by changing the law to give
immunity to military personnel.

will turn my attention to the events of recent weeks. As a result of
the west’s unending drive towards profit without conscience, the
US-Colombia and EU-Colombia trade agreements have been put in place
with very weak labour and human rights conditions. Trade agreements
already disadvantage poor peasant farmers in Colombia, so it is not

been arrested, including 45 children. A curfew was imposed and 50,000
troops were put on to the streets of the country to crack down on
strike action. The social movements have said that this amounts to an
undeclared state of siege, with demobilised right-wing paramilitaries
used to attack demonstrators. However, the peasant farmers have been
joined in their protests by health workers and students. Video evidence
shows horrific beatings, torture, systematic vandalism and theft of the

accusations! In a way, I am grateful that Huber has not met the same
fate as Henry Diaz, the

Putumayo district, whose clothes were found, symbolically, between two

am glad to see the Minister in his place, but I  have been
repeatedly disappointed that successive UK Governments have seized upon
the slightest crumb—real or illusory—that Colombia has
turned its back on state-backed murder and oppression. Parliamentary
answers show Ministers heralding the peace talks, the national
protection unit, land restitution and so on as being signs of a better
Colombia. We should, of course, congratulate any effort to improve the
situation, but Ministers should and must dig a little deeper and judge
the Government of Colombia on results, not intent—on concrete
actions, not words on paper. Protecting trade unionists because the
Inter-American court has ordered it, while at the same time accusing
the same people of being terrorists is not coherent. Neither is
returning land to peasants, while murdering protesting peasants.
Engaging in peace talks while intimidating peace activists is, once
again, not a coherent approach. We need to see civil society more
included in the peace process, and victims from all sides given a
voice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000467">It
saddens me to say that our Government have for too long too
naïvely accepted the word of the Colombian Government as fact.
That can be seen in their welcoming the announcement that there will be
no more impunity for military personnel at exactly the time as the
Colombian law granting such impunity was changed. No wonder our
reputation as a bastion of human rights in the world is so poor in
Colombia, particularly among those at the front line of defending human
rights. It is shameful to think that the average Colombian views the
British as supporters of the oppressor, not the
oppressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000468">Instead
of accepting the sweet words of President Santos, I hope our Ministers
will now take a tougher public line, call for civil society’s
involvement in the peace talks, publicly reject accusations that the
trade unions and the opposition are linked to the guerrillas, get our
ambassador to visit Huber in his prison cell in Colombia and speak out
about the oppression being doled out with
impunity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000469" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000469">If
President Santos is genuine about wanting to bring Colombia to peace,
he should free Huber Ballesteros. I have received letters from the
ambassador, saying that everything is being done through proper process
and that the Executive cannot intervene. Well, I am afraid that history
has shown otherwise—that all too often the Executive intervenes,
and not in a positive way. Now we have an opportunity to intervene
positively. If President Santos is genuine, he should stop denouncing
anyone he 
<?notus-xml column=1275?>disagrees with as a “terrorist”, and he should call off
his slavering, rabid riot police and their accomplices in the military

events of recent weeks have highlighted both the progress that has been
made in Colombia and the challenges which—as we have
heard—most certainly remain. The Colombian Government’s
announcement of their readiness to begin peace talks with the
country’s second largest group, the National Liberation Army, or
ELN, alongside the ongoing talks with FARC, brings closer the hope of a
sustainable peace for all Colombians after decades of conflict. That is
something that I believe all of us in the House would wish to
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000474" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000474">At
the same time, however, there has been a series of social
protests throughout Colombia, highlighting the divisions between rural
and urban areas. The farmers are demanding structural
reforms that address their needs, promote their competitiveness and
secure investment in much-needed infrastructure. The
Colombian Government have recognised the existence of genuine grievance
in the country, and have pledged to address its underlying
causes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000475" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000475">While
it is right for us to acknowledge the strides that Colombia has made
towards reform since President Santos took office in 2010, it is also
right for us to continue to express concerns when we have them, and, as
all true friends should, advise when things could be improved. The
ongoing protests throughout Colombia remain a particular cause of
concern. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s permanent
under-secretary raised specific concerns about the violent incidents
taking place during protests in the Catatumbo region with the Colombian
Defence Minister during his visit to the United Kingdom in June. Also
in June, our ambassador to Colombia met representatives of the peasant
association who were protesting in Catatumbo, as well as senior
Government figures in
Bogota<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>. We also
remain concerned 
<?notus-xml column=1276?>by allegations of police violence against protesters—of which we
have heard from the hon. Gentleman—and also of violence by
protesters against the police, which have so far cost the lives of
eight civilians and one police
officer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:16:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000476" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000476">We
are aware of the recent detention of trade union leader Huber
Ballesteros. Our ambassador to Colombia has written to the Colombian
prosecutor general to highlight our interest in the case, and to
request information on the charges. Staff at our embassy in Bogota are

we recognise that the protests have helped to raise the profile of
dissatisfaction in the countryside and the need for reform, we should
not forget the impact that the strikes have had on others in Colombia.
We are concerned by reports of food shortages and dwindling medical
supplies, which usually affect the most vulnerable. The loss of income
for low-paid workers who are unable to get to work through the
blockades will be difficult for them and their families to manage. The
impact of the protests on British companies operating in Colombia is
also of concern. We are working with the Colombian authorities to
ensure that the situation is resolved in the most appropriate and
timely
manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T17:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091227000478" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/debtext/130912-0004.htm#13091227000478">For
the reasons that I have given, we welcome the efforts to find a

broadly, human rights remain an integral part of our relationship with
Colombia. We support the efforts of the Colombian Government to address
human rights challenges, which we raise regularly with senior
Government representatives. When, along with my right hon. Friends the
Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary, I met President Santos during
his visit to the UK in June, human rights formed an important part of
the agenda. We have a strong and valuable bilateral dialogue on the

2012 Foreign and Commonwealth Office report on human rights provides a
detailed assessment of the key areas in which the Colombian Government
have made progress, and those about which concerns remain. Progress
that is highlighted includes the peace talks, the creation of the
national human rights system and the work of the national protection
unit, which now protects more than 10,000 Colombians. However, the
report also expresses concern about human rights violations, primarily
by illegal armed groups, and about high levels of

Colombia’s United Nations universal periodic review in April, we
recommended that the Colombian Government increase their efforts to
investigate and prosecute those responsible for threats or violence
against human rights defenders, trade unionists, community leaders and
journalists. We also recommended that Colombia ensure that its reformed
military justice system is fully compliant with international human
rights law, and that all allegations of human rights abuses by military
personnel are investigated promptly and effectively. The Colombian
Government have assured us that this reform will not result in impunity
for servicemen. We will press the Government to publish information and

believe that President Santos is doing an incredibly difficult job. The

more to do; how could there not be, given what the country has suffered
over the years? In order to achieve greater progress, Colombia must
continue to address the legacy of an incredibly difficult and tragic
past and tackle the myriad and difficult challenges it still
faces.</hs_Para>

Kawczynski</B> (Shrewsbury and Atcham) (Con):</Member> Thank you, Mr
Betts, for calling me in this important debate on UK Trade &amp;
Investment and British exports. We spend a great deal of time in
Parliament debating and having robust political exchanges about how to
spend taxpayers’ money, yet we seem to spend very little time
considering how to create greater wealth for this country. It is a
great sadness to me that we have had only about four debates about
British exports during this whole Parliament, and three out of four of
them have been initiated by me. This debate will be the longest of all
of them. Very few Members of Parliament have come to take part in this
important debate, scrutinise UKTI and work on a cross-party basis to
discuss how that body can become ever more productive in using
taxpayers’ money well to ensure value for money and make Britain
one of the world’s top
exporters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000009">I
have spent the past 12 months writing a report on UKTI, which I have
sent electronically to all Members of Parliament. If anybody would like
a hard copy, I would be grateful if they got in touch with my office.
My office and I have spent the past 12 months writing the report and
interviewing more than 220 British companies, which sent
representatives to our office in Parliament from all over the United
Kingdom to give us their analysis and feedback on UKTI, highlight their
recommendations and sometimes frustrations with UKTI and advise how the
service could be
improved.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000010">One
of the first things that we say in the report is that the United
Kingdom is the fifth largest economy in the world, yet only the 12th
largest exporter. That is an important figure, and I would like the
Minister and everybody to remember it in the back of their minds. This
small country of ours has managed to become the fifth largest economy
in the world. Sometimes we forget what an extraordinary achievement
that is. However, we must ask ourselves why and how we have become
the fifth largest economy in the world but only the 12th
largest exporter. Why are we not the fifth largest exporter,
commensurate with our international standing as a global
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:33:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

have shrunk the manufacturing base to the point where only 9.5% of

report makes three or four specific recommendations, which I will
highlight to the Minister. One of the most critical is extra
parliamentary scrutiny. In the process of writing this report, we went
to see the Select Committee on Business, Innovation and Skills and
interviewed its esteemed Chairman. The Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills is a large Department, and the Committee is
focused on domestic business and skills matters. During this
Parliament—I may be corrected if I am wrong—I understand
that the Committee has not undertaken any reports specifically
scrutinising UKTI.</hs_Para>

and the Department are so large that we need a subsection of the
Committee or even, dare I say it, a separate Select Committee. The
Minister and others might say that that is unrealistic, but
I am putting the suggestion out for deliberation and consideration.
Some form of body or mechanism is needed to perform ongoing scrutiny of
the work and performance of UKTI. Let us not forget that UKTI receives
hundreds of millions of pounds in taxpayers’ money. It is vital
that all of us in the House play our role in scrutinising how that
money is spent.</hs_Para>

additional scrutiny in the House, we can be confident in going to the
Exchequer and others when things need additional funding and saying,
“This is the work that the House of Commons has performed in
scrutinising UKTI, and these are the deficiencies and shortfalls that
UKTI faces. We need to secure additional money for it.” One
mistake that the Government made at the outset, although I completely
understand that budgets had to be cut across the board, was cutting the
communication and advertising budgets for UKTI and 
<?notus-xml column=349?>others a little too much. I am certainly making representations to the
Prime Minister to ensure that additional funding is given to UKTI so
that it can advertise itself in providing service delivery and market
itself to SMEs.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman) rightly referred to SMEs.
About 47% of British SMEs have never heard of UKTI. They do not know
anything about it; they do not understand what services it can provide.
How can we expect cutting-edge SMEs, some of which have the most
extraordinary innovation and ability to export, to use UKTI if they
simply do not know what resources exist? I want UKTI to have product
placements, even in soap operas. There could be a storyline where a
local UKTI chap comes to see a company to help it export. I want
advertising in national newspapers and on the radio and television, so
that everybody starts to talk about export and understand that we can
use our experiences in other markets to help SMEs export. We all

but whether or not we agreed with privatisation, we all remember the

proceed with, so that everybody understands and is cognisant of UKTI,

export, it is given that

report also suggests that UKTI should be a single entity. Ideally, I
would like it to be an Executive agency. At the moment, it is split

body reports to two Departments, there may be a degree of overlap or

all the research that I had done, I wanted to utilise all the passion

moved on to

companies to export, it is also responsible for attracting direct
inward investment into our constituencies. We all know that the vast
majority—a massively disproportionate amount—of direct
foreign inward investment into the United Kingdom goes to London. I
want to ensure that UKTI on the ground in Shropshire is working in
conjunction with my local council, the local enterprise partnership and
the chambers of commerce directly to identify the top 10 inward
investment opportunities for Shropshire. I have therefore tasked the
UKTI team in the west midlands—Mr Paul Noon is the director of
UKTI in the west midlands, and his staff includes Nicky Griffiths and
others—with getting round the table with Shropshire council, the
chambers of commerce and the LEP. I have brought them all into the same

costed or not properly tabulated in a business format. They must be
agreed with UKTI staff in such a way that those staff are happy and
confident to sell them overseas, and that is precisely the work that is
being carried out

To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:45:22"></hs_TimeCode> ensure that
we get extra resources for that project, I have invited Mr Nick Baird
to come to Shrewsbury on 5 November. The chief executive is
coming to spend a full day in Shrewsbury, so I hope—I am sure
this will be the case—that everybody completes the work on those
top 10 inward investment opportunities before his visit. Once they have
been identified, I will play my part, as someone who is passionate
about exports to the middle east and who knows the area. All other
Shropshire MPs and everybody else who has a passion for Shrewsbury will
also have to play their part in selling the top 10 inward investment
opportunities to foreign sovereign wealth funds and countries
abroad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:46:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000030">I
would like the Minister to follow very closely what is happening in the

want UKTI to leave no stone unturned when it comes to scrutinising
every market in the world as a potential market for British exports. Of
course UKTI is 
<?notus-xml column=351?>focused on the large emerging markets of Brazil, India, Indonesia and
others, but we must never forget the very small markets. I came back
yesterday evening from Gibraltar, where I had the great honour of
addressing thousands of Gibraltarians. Most of Gibraltar came to the
square to celebrate national Gibraltar day. I have to say that seeing
20,000 people singing “God Save The Queen” and
“Rule, Britannia!” and flying the flag meant that it was
a very emotional day for me. I pay tribute to the Gibraltarian spirit.
However, because of my passion for exports, I started to ask a few
questions about what is happening with Gibraltar. Of course it is a
tiny market; of course it has a population of only 30,000
people, but my goodness me, it is more British than we are in many
aspects and if we cannot sell to the Gibraltarians, who can we sell
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:47:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000032">I
spoke to the deputy to the Governor and was told, “Oh no,
it’s not my job to relay any opportunities to UKTI.” Then
when I asked the question of the Governor, he looked at me with
incredulity: “Oh no, of course it’s not my job.”
By the time I had got through everybody, I had found that nobody was
relaying business opportunities in Gibraltar to UKTI. Luckily, I have
spoken to the Chief Minister, Mr Fabian Picardo, and put him directly
in touch with Mr Nick Baird, and they are having a telephone
conversation this afternoon to see how UKTI can interact directly with
the Government of Gibraltar to ensure that the United Kingdom is aware
of every opportunity, whether in construction, tourism or anything
else, that exists in
Gibraltar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000033">However,
the thing that really upset me was that I found out that exports to
Gibraltar are run out of offices in Madrid. I hope that I am not the
only one who finds that rather ironic, given everything that Spain is
doing to try to strangle Gibraltar at this time. I said to the chief
executive, Mr Nick Baird, that it is completely unacceptable. The
Foreign Office and UKTI seem to have these hubs. They do not have
officials on the ground in certain countries, but commercial activity
in smaller areas is directed from a bigger hub somewhere else. I
understand that in certain cases, but it is completely unacceptable in
the case of Gibraltar. The gentleman in Madrid who is dealing with
Gibraltar obviously is very focused on the Spanish market, which
probably accounts for 99.9% of this trade. He does not want to upset
his Spanish partners. We much have direct contact with the Government
of Gibraltar at the highest levels, and I will be monitoring that very
closely.</hs_Para>

Friend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T13:51:52"></hs_TimeCode> on
obtaining this important debate. Does he think that a reason why
countries such as France and Germany do much better in those markets is
that their export guarantee schemes—what we now call UK Export
Finance—are far more substantial than ours? For example, the
German Hermes scheme protected or guaranteed €29.1 billion
exports last year, while our equivalent in the UK gave out insurance
for something like £4.3 billion. Germany provided
more than five times the amount of protection through the Hermes scheme
than we provided in the UK. The Hermes scheme is profit
making—people pay premiums—so it is not a direct pull on
the state

I studied French at university; I can speak French. We seem to avoid
non-English speaking countries when trading. We are brilliant at
exporting to countries where people speak English, but anywhere where
French is a first language is a vortex for us: “No, no, no.
That’s the French-speaking part of north Africa.” That is
of great concern to me, because we must penetrate those traditional
French markets. What unites them all—whether Tunisia, Algeria or
Mauritania—is that they are fed up of the German export monopoly
and of France repeatedly using them as dumping grounds for cheap
exports, rather than engaging in bilateral economic co-operation and
technology transfer. They are desperate to pull themselves away from
their over-dependency on France and want greater economic exchange with

Frankly, we will never get into the French markets unless we have
French understanding, in both language and how French-speaking
countries operate. We are not normally prone to saying wonderful things
about France; but to start pinching their contracts, we need to
understand how to do it. I want the Minister to take that point
seriously, and if not, at least explain to me what his Department is
doing to ensure increasing competence in the French language and the
ability to understand how French contractual operations function in

ambassador. This is his name. This is how you get in contact with

rigorous export licensing procedures in the world. It considers each
application on a case-by-case basis, taking into account, among other
factors, the precise nature of the equipment and the identity and track
record of the recipient. Her Majesty’s Government do
not—and will not—issue licences if they judge that the
proposed export would provoke or prolong internal conflicts, or if
there is a clear risk that it might be used aggressively against
another country or to facilitate internal repression. When

wish to talk very briefly about the European Union. The Prime Minister
hopes to renegotiate various aspects of our position with the European
Union, and I hope that one of those aspects will be how we go about
international trading agreements with other countries. The first thing
that happened to me when I was elected in 2005 was that I was sent to
the World Trade Organisation talks in Hong Kong. The other two Members
of Parliament with me were the hon. Gentleman who is now the Speaker
and Lord Mandelson who, as trade commissioner, was representing the
whole European Union. I found that very frustrating, because the United
Kingdom did not have a voice. The UK was represented by Lord Mandelson,
who was representing all 27 nations, but different countries mean
different things to other countries—for example, Gibraltar and
New Zealand are far more important to us than to Poland. I very much
hope that there can be some movement on individual countries being able
somehow to negotiate with countries of long standing, so that there is

of the House for suggesting that at 47%—I may be wrong in that
figure—the proportion of our exports that currently goes to the
European Union is too high. I indicated that I wanted more of our trade
to be with the outside world, particularly with the emerging countries.
He took that almost as though I was somehow being disrespectful or did
not understand the importance of the European Union to us, which, quite
frankly, is a very outdated
perspective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000057">The
European Union will of course diminish in importance during our

doing to work with DFID to ensure that more British products are sent
overseas as part of the aid package? I will never forget that, when I
served on it, the International Development Committee visited a village
on the Ethiopian-Kenyan border and saw a water irrigation project. I
met all the village elders, who told me through a translator,
“Mr Kawczynski, we would like to thank you and the people of
France for everything you are doing for us.” I said,
“France! We’re British. What do you mean, France?”
Of course, the non-governmental organisation hired by DIFD was French,
all the equipment was French, Japanese or Chinese, and the people on
the ground had no idea that the aid was British. Clare Short had
stripped the British branding from the goods, but I am glad that there
is now a British flag on our aid
products.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000059">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>

more expensive than its Chinese or French equivalent, let us do a
cost-benefit analysis to understand the ramifications on the economy

DFID does everything possible to help British

first point is that the hon. Gentleman’s comments about language
and the British approach to the rest of the world are absolutely right.
It is depressing to find that the number of students entering
university this year to study foreign languages has gone down, as it
did last year, and that the quality and quantity of language training
in many secondary schools is wholly inadequate. We need to start
language teaching much earlier, in primary schools as well as in
secondary schools, and to give greater emphasis to the learning of all
foreign languages at university—not just the obvious European
ones, such as Spanish, French, German and Italian, but the Chinese and
Arabic languages, as well as Hindi, Bengali and others. We are a
country that has to trade and export, and if German and French
companies can send people around the world who are competent in all the
local languages, we should be able to do the same. It is
extraordinarily arrogant for us to turn up in a country and assume
that, because we are British, everybody will want to speak to us in
English, so we just have to be prepared to make those
changes.</hs_Para>

point on which I am sure the hon. Gentleman will agree relates to the
engineering base of much of British trade with the world. It is
obviously essential to have a high degree of understanding of
engineering and science teaching both in schools and universities, and
to recognise the status of engineering, which has done so much in this
country; I am thinking of the railways, shipbuilding, motors and all
the other aspects of engineering. Engineering is often seen as a
dirty-hands profession, rather than a mainstream one. I can say that
because I come from a family of engineers who closely followed that
whole narrative. The basis of an awful lot of our past trade was the
export of high-quality, high-tech engineering
products<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:13:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000065"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jeremy Lefroy" PimsId="5679" UID="13091235000264" xid="1196" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000264">Jeremy
Lefroy:</Member></B> I entirely endorse what the hon. Gentleman said
about languages. The issue is about improving not only exports
overseas, but employment opportunities locally. A company in my
constituency cannot recruit staff from Britain, but has to look
overseas to recruit its foreign-language speaking staff. There are job
opportunities right here in the UK for people who speak the foreign
languages he
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:13:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000066"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jeremy Corbyn" PimsId="2717" UID="13091235000265" xid="133" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000265">Jeremy

Gentleman, but I also recognise that many families in Britain who are
bilingual in a variety of languages—I cannot put an exact figure
on it, but I would think that about 70 different languages are spoken
in my constituency—and many brilliant young bilingual people do
not seem to get job opportunities in companies that are often trading

I said in my intervention, I want to raise some arms trade issues,
which are highly appropriate because the biennial arms fair, the
Defence and Security Equipment International exhibition, is taking
place in the London docklands. I think I am right in saying that more
than 1,000 exhibitors—1,400, I believe—are now plying
their
wares.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000068">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:17:01"></hs_TimeCode>

involved in that arms fair in the London docklands with the Foreign
Office’s report on human rights problems and abuses, we find an
unfortunate coincidence between, on the one hand, the countries
exhibiting at that international arms fair, countries that British
companies that are exhibiting wish to sell to, or countries invited to
send delegates, and, on the other hand, serious human rights concerns
that the Foreign Office has drawn attention to, and countries with
human rights records that it thinks we should be concerned about.
Algeria, Bahrain, Iraq, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia

Only<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:19:38"></hs_TimeCode> half an

as a place of safety and security, because of how brutally he was
treated in prison in Bahrain. He showed me the shot marks on his
body—from birdshot—inflicted on him by the police because
he was taking part in a demonstration for democracy in Bahrain. His
view is that the Bahrain regime is propped up by Saudi Arabia, Britain
and the United States, that it is an enormous purchaser of arms from
this country and that it provides military facilities for both Britain
and the USA, but it has an appalling human rights
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000073">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:19:38"></hs_TimeCode>
non-governmental organisations in Saudi Arabia are doing their best, we
must ask serious questions about the human rights record of Saudi
Arabia; there is the use of the death penalty, the suppression of
opposition groups, the denial of women’s rights and a whole lot
of other issues. Even
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:19:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Shrewsbury and Atcham could not claim to concur with the Saudi
Government’s approach to human rights, or indeed support it in
any way. We are the biggest arms exporter to Saudi Arabia, and the
influence that Saudi Arabia has is absolutely enormous. We should think
carefully on this matter, because if we export CS gas and crowd-control
and anti-personnel equipment, as we do to nearly every one of the
countries in the middle eastern region, they will be used against the
legitimate democratic process that wishes to bring about the kind of
society that we enjoy, with our freedom of speech and elected
Parliament. If those people are shot by the equipment that we have
supplied, are we not part of the problem? Are we not partly responsible
for that oppression of human rights?</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman tells us that the UKTI Defence &amp; Security
Organisation works very hard and does very well. I am not surprised
that he mentions that it is heavily populated by people who were
formerly in the armed services. Let me ask him this. The end-user
certificate system and the monitoring of arms exports have been around
for a long time, but there seems to be an incredible degree of leakage.
As soon as one raises the issue, and says, “We shouldn’t
be exporting arms to that country”, we are told that someone
else will do it. They say that the French, Germans, Chinese or
Russians 
<?notus-xml column=359?>will. Perhaps that is so; they probably will try, but we have to start
somewhere and influence others. If we are exporting equipment that is
used—it is often quite low-technology equipment—to
oppress human rights protesters, we should ask ourselves some serious
questions about it. Who are we to table motions complaining about the
oppression of democracy in Saudi Arabia if we have supplied the
equipment that oppresses the democratic wishes of people in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>? I say
that as an example; there are many others that can be
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000075">We
can learn lessons from the Iran-Iraq war, which took place some years
ago. At the time, as now, the west was fairly obsessed with supporting
Iraq against Iran because of the presence of the ayatollah in Iran. I
am not in any way defending the human rights record of the Iranian
Government, any more than I would defend the human rights record of the
Iraqi Government of that time, or indeed Iraqi Governments since.
Britain quite happily provided equipment, support and political cover
for Saddam Hussein in Iraq because it was opposed to Iran. The west did
that, as did the US and lots of other people. In 1988, when the gas
attack took place on the Kurdish people in Halabja, I raised the issue
here in Parliament and was told that the situation was serious, bad and
quite appalling. I then asked why we were involved in the Baghdad arms
fair only eight months later. The Minister at the time told me that it
was good business. We went ahead with that arms fair, and only two
years later we were at war with Iraq. No doubt some of the equipment
that was being fired back at British troops had been sold to Iraq by
Britain. What goes around comes around.</hs_Para>

is a disproportion in many of the issues. Arms exports contributed, I
think, 1.5% of the total exports of this country, yet they have a
wholly disproportionate level of support from the Department of Trade
and Industry and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,
and there is a substantial degree of subsidy for the research done
through the domestic purchase of the products. I do not wish to go on
for too long, but I want to register the point that there are many
people in this country who are deeply uneasy about our arms export
policy, and about the export of surveillance equipment, high-tech
planes and everything else that can be used to bomb and strafe people
in civil wars in any part of the world, much as we deplore those civil
wars and are concerned about what is happening about them.</hs_Para>

employment issue, but I also fully understand the enormous, brilliant
skills that we have that produce these weapons and the equipment that
backs them up. None the less, many of the workers and I would rather
the brilliance and skills were put towards exporting peaceful products,
useful goods, energy-efficient goods and transport products, such as
trains, planes, cars and ships, instead of getting us so deeply

Friend the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham said, working with that
enthusiasm in many countries to ensure a greater British presence
should be absolutely at the heart of our trade and foreign policy. I am
delighted by the extent to which the Government have been doing just

I also saw, as a visiting Minister and subsequently, is that
historically we have gone about this trade in a different way from the
French, Germans and Italians. Part of that was because we did not
separate out trade and politics. Too often, difficult political issues
were allowed to become a real barrier to trade. My view, and that of
the Germans, the French and others, is that trade is one of the best
ways of creating more openness, greater transparency and a better
trading relationship. The more that we can get British companies,
accountants, solicitors and others in there, the better our prospects
of leading those countries in the direction in which we want them to
go.</hs_Para>

is a great deal that needs to be done. Our trade needs to be broadened
to more countries. Our focus as trade envoys in the fast-growing
emerging markets is an important part of that process. Through UKTI, we
can help take businesses beyond the normal markets. For example, we can
take them beyond Moscow and St Petersburg and get them into Tatarstan
and some of the other Russian republics, which have been pretty closed
to many British companies.</hs_Para>

ensure that we take the focus beyond the most expected industries. In
the three countries in which I am trade envoy, the focus, inevitably,
is on oil, gas and minerals. Let us look at the opportunities in
design. Astana is holding Expo 2017, and we want British companies to
build the infrastructure and the low-carbon transport system.
Turkmenistan is spending half the budget of the London Olympics on the
Asian indoor and martial arts games. Let us ensure that we capitalise
on this extraordinary moment in our history when we are seen to have
run one of the best games ever. I welcome such moves as part of the
drive we are seeing through
UKTI<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:29:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

of UKTI is of a lean, thinly spread organisation. I marvel at how much
it is able to do, and at how every request that goes through is dealt
with speedily. It is enthusiastic and shows real expertise in the
countries in which we work. I link that with Scottish Development
International. Clearly, UKTI does not cover Scotland in the same way
that we are talking about, but around the world, the work of SDI should
also be recognised.</hs_Para>

those organisations can only do their work because of the way in which
they work with other groups, including business groups and
organisations such as the Kazakh-British Trade and Industry Council,
the Turkmenistan UK Trade and Industry Council and similar groups that
focus on bringing businesses together. Those groups are run by people
with a detailed understanding and depth of knowledge of other
countries, to try to advocate and advance the role of British
companies. That must be seen as an integral part of this process, as is
working with organisations such as British Expertise, which does a
tremendous amount to lead trade missions and give people the chance to
visit other countries for the first time. It recognises that for many
people doing so, there is a nervousness, because there is a different
language, culture and way of life. People going abroad do not want to
do something that inadvertently offends their host, so going through an
organisation such as British Expertise can be important.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:30:31"></hs_TimeCode>Of course, the

into people from UKTI in the corridors of Nos. 1 to 19 Victoria street;
to know that they are people who work directly for him; and to know
that he does not have to go through the formalities of working with an
agency and going through its chief executive or directors simply
because he wants to say, “Remind me what is going on in
Ukraine,” or “Tell me more about Algeria.” I want
him to be able to call those people into his office at short notice and
get updates, and to be able to capitalise and move quickly when an
opportunity
arises.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:31:33"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

Also, UKTI’s dual reporting structure—it reports to both
the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office—is very valuable, because it engages more
Ministers in its work. It ensures that more Ministers, when they are
thinking of going abroad, are also thinking, “Which companies

higher education in Britain? From my experience of local universities

the heart of my hon. Friend’s argument was whether it is

That is an interesting conundrum for the Minister—the
Under-Secretary of State for Skills—who, of course, straddles
two Departments himself, although they are not the same two Departments
that UKTI straddles. Personally, I am all in favour of activities that
straddle different Departments. Cross-departmental activity is a good
thing, because silos do not exist in the real world. The key to it all
is having autonomy for UKTI rather than independence, which I think is
what my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:38:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon.

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:38:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham was really advocating was the
crucial importance of small and medium-sized enterprises, and the
importance of exports to the future growth of SMEs. He knows as I
do—as we all do—how vital that is to the growth of jobs,
in Shrewsbury or in my constituency of Gloucester, where we have a long
tradition of manufacturing and exporting. However, as I have said
before in the main Chamber, in Gloucester we lost 6,000 jobs in
business during the 13 years of my two Labour predecessors as
Gloucester MP, although we have created 1,600 new jobs in business
since 2010.</hs_Para>

is a great deal more to be done, which is precisely where SMEs come in,
including the 500 members of the Gloucester branch of the Federation of
Small Businesses and the members of many other branches all
around the country. So how do we help SMEs to export? That question has
been around for a long time. In fact, I wrote a paper on it as British
trade commissioner for China, which, alarmingly, was 23 years ago. What
has changed since then is the speed of communication and access to
information through technology. We also have the new sectors and
centres of UK expertise and, above all and most interestingly, the much
higher standing of the brand “made in Britain”.</hs_Para>

alive that fact most immediately, at breakfast this morning I was with
the CEO of the west Kowloon cultural district authority, which covers
40 acres of reclaimed land from Hong Kong’s harbour that will be
transmogrified into a fantastic centrepiece for architectural design
and creative arts from around the world, under a masterplan made by
Foster and Partners. It will feature a huge number of UK stars from
different sectors. The CEO of the cultural authority went yesterday to

is worth remembering that the west Kowloon cultural district authority
has been in place for 16 years and has only just put a spade in the
ground. The assumption that many of us had—I spent a large chunk
of my life in that part of the world—that everything is done at
great speed in Hong Kong and that nothing happens very fast in Britain
has been turned around over the last few years by some of the

return to my point on the SME debate, in some ways it has not changed
since I wrote that paper all those years ago. The debate focuses on
what Government should do to best help SMEs export. For example, should
they subsidise many trips abroad for SMEs so that they can get to know
the countries to which they might export? Do the SMEs have the
resources or the sales structure to be able to follow through, or are
the trips an interesting but non-productive form of business tourism?
Should we help only the larger companies, and through them indirectly
boost SME exporters through the supply chains of those large
companies?</hs_Para>

Government offices for everything on export help, or can chambers of
commerce be better partners for certain SME goals? In some cases,
chambers of commerce can be more selective than Government can. If
someone needs a lawyer in Jakarta and they ring up the British embassy,
the embassy will be obliged to provide a list of every lawyer in town.
What that person is really looking for is just one reputable company
that can do the business. Government cannot choose a lawyer for
someone, but a chamber of commerce might say, “Other companies
like yours have effectively used x, y and z.” There are
situations in which a chamber of commerce can be a more effective
partner for SMEs.</hs_Para>

small handful of points. First, it is important that UKTI’s
GREAT campaign is publicised as widely as possibly to all Members of
Parliament. It is a major marketing campaign. It is visually
attractive, powerful and resonates in different countries. I launched
it in Indonesia. I hope that the Minister will confirm that the
regional offices of UKTI have invited every MPs to the GREAT launch in
their area. I am delighted to help the launch in Gloucestershire next
Tuesday. All MPs can and should play a role in encouraging their SMEs
to export by joining the GREAT
campaign.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000117">Secondly,
UKTI is already doing huge good work. My hon. Friend the Member for
Wealden rightly paid tribute to that work, as did my hon. Friend the
Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham, on the back of his powerful paper,
which he spent much time and effort in producing. I am grateful to him
for doing that. They are both right, because some remarkable things are
going on.</hs_Para>

the west Kowloon example I gave earlier, it is most recent in my mind
from breakfast this morning that two small companies that I had never
heard of before—Keepthinking and North, which are both based in
Clerkenwell, in the east of this city—have won significant
contracts with that project. That is a good example of how companies
that may not be known to me or other hon. Members here today are
winning contracts abroad with the help of UKTI. That is important,
because we already know about certain familiar exports, such as the
wings, engines, landing gear and coatings and so on that make up 38% of
every Airbus and are made in Britain. It is important to remember that
those parts are made in Britain, because the export value is always
credited to France, but it is equally important that we understand that
unknown companies in new sectors have real opportunities
overseas.</hs_Para>

opportunity, which I hope the Minister will agree to take up, for UKTI
to hold a seminar, possibly in Parliament—we know that it is
difficult to move MPs out of our comfort zone, and we are required by
the Whips to attend debates and vote and so on—to update MPs on
some of the opportunities in new sectors and some of the new companies
across the country in sectors such as creative media, medical science,

promoting two things in Indonesia with a degree of success. I hope that
there is more to come. The first is a fantastic computer software
tabling programme for universities. There are more than 100

Cambridge-based company, is high-quality and could be exported to other
parts of the world. The second is a quality assurance agency, which is

others as well.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:49:29"></hs_TimeCode>

in countries in which we have both a UKTI and a Department for
International Development presence, I believe we can do more to act as
a united UK plc. The story of the first biodiesel plant in Indonesia,
made by the wonderful Gloucestershire-based manufacturer Green
Fuels—I am taking the Indonesian ambassador to Green Fuels next
week—is a good example of a business contract by a private
business that is totally in line with our DFID objectives for
Indonesia. The contract should 
<?notus-xml column=367?>open further opportunities for the UK in a general sense, and I believe
there are other such examples elsewhere in the world. A more united,
working-together spirit by DFID and UKTI could lead to exciting
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000122">I
finish on a note as positive as those of the Members who spoke earlier.
The help given to me, as one of the Prime Minister’s trade
envoys, by our embassy in Jakarta, which includes both UKTI and the
British Council, has been powerful. We are all working together on
strategic and tactical goals that will benefit both Indonesia and the
UK, which is important. A win-win solution is much more attractive than
simply trying to thrust a product at some hapless overseas

long ago. That is what companies can achieve for UK plc and for their
host country, which shows the value of inward
investment—exported investment from the UK.
Such<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:52:03"></hs_TimeCode> investment
offers great opportunities for British SMEs to service, in this case,
Prudential either in the UK or overseas, and from that base to expand

such as this are a great marketing opportunity for trade envoys, so it
is appropriate for me to finish by saying that if Members here today,
or those who read the debate later, have specialist companies in their
constituencies that believe they have something to offer Indonesia,

with UKTI, to try to help those SMEs export a little bit
more.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_12_PT_1/CADF60C74F3F819FBBC7C4937A90021BC8F73DE9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 September 2013">Thursday

welcome my hon. Friend’s work and the passion with which the
Conservative-led coalition Government, particularly in the Department

economic growth agendas. We all want economic growth, which comes from
two places. It comes internally by reducing taxation, improving

made at that—but it also comes from trade, exports and inward
investment from
abroad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:53:41"></hs_TimeCode>. His

all want Britain to be a great global trading nation, and if that is to
be our position in, say, 10, 15 or 20 years’ time, we must up
our game on exports. At the moment, we still have a negative balance of
payments. That is improving, and the Government have done good work in
that area, but the balance of payments is 
<?notus-xml column=368?>still negative. In a period when we have a weaker currency than

must play its role, and it has a primary function on exports. As
chairman of the all-party group on space, it is clear to me that
Britain has amazing industries in our space, science and engineering
sectors, particularly in robotics. We often talk about the magnificent,
double-digit economic growth in China and some of the emerging
economies, but our own economy has a major area in which economic
growth has outpaced many of those nations. We have seen double-digit
economic growth in the space sector and related industries for the past
10 years, so we do not need to look to China; we can look to
our own nation to work out which elements of what we do here are
exportable. The space sector and the products and services therein, of
course, are eminently
exportable.</hs_Para><hs_76fChair UID="13091235000006" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000006">[<SmallCaps>Sir

also export our education system, our universities and academic
institutions and our research. We punch above our weight on

British export to the rest of the world. Again, both BIS and

also has a major role on inward investment. There has been an
interesting political narrative over the past decade or so. We have
been a little shy and embarrassed about wealth creation. When companies
make massive profits and when wealthy people come to invest in Britain,
we are all a bit concerned and not quite sure whether it is a good
thing or whether we should be nervous or concerned. Unless we love
wealth creation and unless we love and welcome people who have the cash
to invest in our businesses, we will not go very far very fast because,
as we know, the banks here do not yet have money available. Despite the
good work of the funding for lending scheme, there is still not

must ensure that UKTI is working to attract foreign investors to
Britain. Part of what I like about the report, and about a lot of the
background work on it, is that the report recognises that it might be a
good idea at some point for UKTI to have some accountability. For a
region, an area, a country or a district, UKTI should answer the
question, “How much foreign investment have you attracted into
this area over x or y period?” Several Members have asked
questions along those lines to up the ante and to ensure that Ministers
are aware that this would be an important way to focus the minds of
those at UKTI on delivering results. They do some great work in
facilitating meetings at overseas trade shows, working with DFID and
the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and supporting Ministers, but the
spotlight would focus sharply on the outputs for inward investment if
UKTI consistently answered the question of how much direct foreign
investment it has seen or facilitated within a
region<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:58:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

general point is on the balance of trade between the EU and the rest of
the world. In many ways I understand the Foreign Secretary’s
response to the suggestion that we should somehow minimise our trade
with the EU, if that is how he heard the question—I say that to
him in a good mood. I am certain that he, the coalition Government and
all of us would like to see a massive boost in trade with the rest of
the world, and with the EU, too. If there were a massive boost in trade
with the rest of the world—the BRIC countries and
elsewhere—the proportion of our trade with the EU would
naturally reduce. Why is that a good thing? Because the rest of the
world is growing a lot faster than the EU at the moment and because
overall trade would be increased, preferably disproportionately, to the
rest of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000133">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T14:59:19"></hs_TimeCode>

the Member for Windsor (Adam Afriyie). I want to dwell for a moment on
the point that he made so forcefully about the importance of inward
investment and to pay tribute to the work of UKTI, which has seen an
advance in British exports and inward investment over the past few
years. Those two things are intimately connected, as my hon. Friend
says, because a lot of that inward investment results in exports for
the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000140">To
take my constituency and my county, Stafford and Staffordshire, our
major private sector employer is a French inward investor, Alstom,
which is a major exporter from the United Kingdom. Only last year, it
won a large contract to supply the Swedish electricity authority with
transformers.
Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:05:08"></hs_TimeCode> major
employer is Perkins, which is part of the US Caterpillar group. I
believe that at least 90% of its Stafford production of large generator
sets is exported around the world to countries as diverse as
Afghanistan, Nigeria and South Africa.
Evo<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:05:08"></hs_TimeCode>-Stik is a
French direct investment, which is now owned by the Total group. While
it is a consumer product company it, too, has exports. Broadcrown in
Hixon also makes generator sets that are sold all around the world, and
that company employs almost 200 people in my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000141">Jaguar<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:05:08"></hs_TimeCode>
Land Rover, to which reference has already been made, is in the process
of building one of the largest engine factories in the world in South
Staffordshire, on the border with Wolverhampton, with excellent support
from both councils. That plant will be of huge benefit not only to
employment for the people of Staffordshire and Wolverhampton, but to
the United Kingdom, because much of its production will go into cars
that are eventually exported. JLR, under its Tata ownership,
contributes a huge amount to British exports. The link between inward
investment and exports is therefore important, and UKTI absolutely
understands that the two things must not be seen in separate
silos<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000142">We

largest and best known private British companies, employing the best
part of 10,000 people in the UK. It not only exports, but manufactures
overseas, so it benefits workers not only in the United Kingdom, but in
those other parts of the world where it manufactures—India,
China, South Africa and Brazil.  
<?notus-xml column=371?>There are also the pottery companies in my area. People tend to think of
ceramics as a business of the past but, when I last looked, pottery and
ceramics were a net exporter for the UK—we export more than we
import—because we export high-value ware that lasts much longer
than other products and that is appreciated throughout the world by
hotels, catering businesses and
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:06:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000143">That
brings me to our own procurement in this country. Sometimes, those who
procure—in the public sector in particular, but also in the
private sector, such as those companies that have a big responsibility
for our electrical infrastructure—tend to take a short-term view
on value for money. They look at something and say, “This will
wear out in 10 or 15 years, so we need to buy something that is
cost-effective over 10 or 15 years.” In our country’s
transport and electrical infrastructure, some transformers that were
made in Britain—perhaps by English Electric, then General
Electric—have been in place for 40 or 50 years. In effect, they
have been working for free for the past 20 to 30 years. Customers
overseas understand that buying something marked “Made in
Britain” means that they will get a product that will last not
five or 10 years, but 20, 30 or 40 years. They are therefore prepared
to pay a premium for our products, yet our own organisations, which
have a fairly short-term view when procuring for infrastructure, are
not prepared to do so. I ask the Minister to consider how we can
persuade British organisations, such as National Grid, to take a
long-term view of the value of British products and to realise that
they will last for not only 10 or 15 years, but 20, 30 or 40
years, as our overseas customers know that they
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:07:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000144">I
also want us to concentrate on learning from the country with the best
record in the world on exports: Germany. We need to learn from the
Germans, because they do some things that we do not, but that we
need to do. As I said, Germany’s Hermes export finance
scheme covered €29.1 billion of exports last year, whereas UK
Export Finance covered a little more than £4
billion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000145">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:09:01"></hs_TimeCode>
Germans also have a development bank, Kreditanstalt für
Wiederaufbau, which was set up after the second world war and operates
specifically in Germany as well as overseas. In Germany, it often
enables the Mittelstand, or medium-sized companies, to access credit
and equity. We do not have an equivalent here. If we are to build up
our middle-ranking companies—the equivalent of the
Mittelstand—which would probably be the ones to do most
exporting, they need to have access to the kind of finance that their
competitors in Germany can obtain through KfW and the banking
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>. I
therefore urge the Minister to consider whether the UK business bank,
which I welcome, could be developed into the kind of financial
institution that KfW so ably represents in
Germany<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:09:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000146">That
was all I wanted to say. In short, we should concentrate on long-term
thinking in the UK. If UK organisations are not prepared to buy UK
products, because they are only thinking about short-term value for
money, how can we persuade our overseas customers that they should buy
our very good products? Secondly, let us learn from the Germans. They
are the best exporters in the world, so if we want to rival them, we
have to look at why they are so
successful.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-09-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_09_12_PT_1/97E44D46311F204AF4B3056037C431D2443B5061" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 September 2013">Thursday

the outgoing Minister for Trade and Investment, Lord Green. In all his

has been admirably non-partisan in his approach, wanting only what is
best and most advantageous for Britain and its businesses. I have not

mentioned the non-partisan approach being taken to this topic, and
there is not much dissent from the notion that the House—indeed,
the whole country—would like to see an export-led recovery.
There is a huge world of opportunity for British business. The global
economy is expected to double in size within a dozen years. The number
of middle-class people in the world, with higher consumption and higher
disposable incomes, will triple to 5 billion, and they will all be
eager to buy iconic British brands and fantastic British products. As
has rightly been said several times this afternoon, the British brand
is strong and well respected in international markets. Every
constituency has businesses that are dynamic, productive and eager to
sell abroad. Given its mercantile history and current strengths, this
country should be at the forefront of modern exporting nations, but it
often feels as though that is not the case.</hs_Para>

is good for business. Actually, it is beneficial not just for
individual companies’ short-term bottom line, but for the
prosperity of the wider economy and society in general. All the
evidence shows that an exporting business tends to be a successful,
sustainable and socially aware business. An exporting company tends to
employ more workers and offer better wages than an equivalent
non-exporting company. Companies that export have been shown to be more
productive and to invest more in research and development, thinking
more about the long term, and they are anxious to capture and maintain
international competitiveness. I want to concentrate on that point,
because there is a strong link between innovation and
exporting.</hs_Para>

discipline can demonstrate whether a firm or a product can move away
from the often insular domestic market and navigate the harsh seas of
the global marketplace; it will demonstrate how competitive a business
or a product actually is. A business with a desire to export overseas
has the discipline and the ambition to develop new products and
services that will better serve the new export markets. It will be
sensitive and responsive to customer wishes—always the hallmark
of a successful business. We therefore have the possibility of a
virtuous circle for exporting businesses, whereby they are exposed to
new demands, fresh ideas and 
<?notus-xml column=373?>increased competition, which in turn makes them leaner, more productive,
more outward-looking and better disposed to thinking about new product
development and improved profitability. We should all encourage that as

Nigerias, Thailands and Vietnams of this world. Those
countries—in Africa, the middle east, south-east Asia and Latin

export-led recovery, with a greater proportion of our trade coming from
high-growth markets outside the EU, simply has not materialised. Last
week, the Office for National Statistics published data showing that
the UK trade deficit was £3.1 billion in July, compared with
£1.3 billion the previous month. That is the largest trade

on one month’s data, and he would be right. However, the fact is
that, based on longer-term trends, we have not made the substantial
progress everybody wants to see in growing our way towards sustainable
recovery through trade. The value of exports to non-EU countries is
more or less where it was two years ago, when the UKTI strategy was
launched. We have run a substantial trade deficit for many
years—some Governments have fallen as a result of adverse
balance of trade announcements—and the trade gap in the past
four or five years has, more or less consistently, been about £8

practical help with making contacts and mitigating risks. Others will
be well versed in exporting, and they will be familiar with, and
confident about, supplying overseas, but they may need help to identify
potentially lucrative new markets and territories. Identifying what

cycle. Is the Minister therefore confident—this point is raised
in the report—that UKTI is proactive enough and has the right
skill set, processes and individual product lines to achieve the
objectives we all share on boosting
exports?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000160"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:19:33"></hs_TimeCode>I

for Wealden (Charles Hendry), who was a great Energy Minister, knows
that we are a centre of excellence for energy and for oil and gas
companies. If a small company in Hartlepool was thinking about
supplying the Kazakhstan oil business, what on earth would be the right
way to help with that? What on earth should the company do to learn
about exporting—especially if, given that it was a small firm,
it was juggling many other things? Those running the company would
worry about lack of contacts, possible language barriers, regulatory
and taxation problems in a foreign land, and the fear of not being paid
from halfway around the word. How would UKTI identify such a company in
my constituency or any other constituency as a potential exporter? How
would it get the astute understanding to know what the business was
about, and provide, at the time it was needed, a bespoke service to
help it navigate through the challenges of
exporting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000161">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>

only I were that lean and thinly spread. However, I want to ask the
Minister a question on an important aspect of the issue, which we hear
a lot about with respect to more general Government support and advice
for business. What proportion of UKTI staff have practical, tangible
experience of running a business and exporting? Are 
<?notus-xml column=375?>there staff in a position to offer tailored, relevant advice so that
firms will respect their opinion, because they have been there, done it
and, probably, exported the T-shirt to prove
it?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000162"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:21:31"></hs_TimeCode>Communication
and dissemination of information seems to be a particular weakness. The
hon. Gentleman’s report cites another report, from the
Federation of Small Businesses, stating that only one fifth of small
firms export, and that that rate has not changed since 2010. That
statistic causes me concern, because on that basis the penetration of
UKTI’s message to small firms has not materialised.</hs_Para>

a member, that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:22:07"></hs_TimeCode>
knowledge of UKTI in the business community is
“worrying”. Some 68% of small and medium-sized firms
and—this astonished me—81% of large firms are not
familiar with UKTI. What can be done to address that big weakness? Will
the Minister take the opportunity—with what I think would be the
full support of the House—to make sure that the export week
coming up in early November will be strongly communicated in every
constituency and media outlet? That would show that Britain is open for
business and the world wants to trade with us, and it would give
British-based companies the opportunity to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:23:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000164"><B><Member ContinuationText="Daniel Kawczynski" PimsId="4793" UID="13091235000289" xid="888" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000289">Daniel

Labour spokesman make those comments, and I hope I was right in
understanding that he agrees it would be better for UKTI
staff—and would enhance their credibility—if they had
direct previous experience of running companies and exporting. One of
the biggest problems is that historically many people in UKTI have come
from the civil service and have not had experience of running small
businesses or trying to export. Does the hon. Gentleman also agree that
those staff need a salary structure geared around targets, so that
there is an incentive to go the extra mile for additional

Wright:</Member></B> I agree with a lot of what the hon. Gentleman
says. The Hartlepool company wanting to export its products to the oil
sector in Kazakhstan would respect UKTI if the official could say,
“I’ve been there; I know exactly what you are going
through. These are the problems that I had to overcome when I was
running my own businesses, and you may want to consider them.”
When companies feel that there is relevance, there is immediate buy-in.
I shall come on to the question of how UKTI staff are remunerated. It
is an important point that the hon. Gentleman covered in his report,
but at this stage I would say the emphasis on quality as opposed to
quantity in UKTI is vital and needs to be attended
to<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:25:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000166">I
want to return to the question of how UKTI can be more meaningful and
provide a more bespoke and tailored approach, as well as how the
Government can adopt a more co-ordinated approach across Whitehall and
central and local government. I am interested in the Minister’s
thoughts on what happens when a firm must interact with the state on
some formal point such as  
<?notus-xml column=376?>registering for VAT for the first time, filing a tax return or paying
business rates. How can we make sure that the state can recognise that
firm as a potential exporter and be proactive about outlining
UKTI’s offer to it, understanding that the firm has reached a
certain stage in its business life and growth and asking “Have
you thought about overseas markets as the next step?”? Can we
nudge that to happen when businesses must
interact<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:25:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000167">UKTI
has a target to contact 50,000 firms annually by 2015, which seems to
me at once ambitious and far too low. Given current trends, I do not
think it is likely to be achieved. The Minister may correct me on the
precise, up-to-date figures, but I think that we have reached about
32,000 firms, with two years to go. Is the Minister confident that he
will achieve his target, and, if so, on what does he base that
confidence? On the other hand, if British ambition is to increase and
British firms are to export at the EU average rate of one in four, UKTI
needs to make meaningful contact with about 250,000 extra firms, based
on the country’s company base of about 4.8 million enterprises.
I am interested in finding out from the Minister how the figure of
50,000 was arrived at, and whether UKTI should be stretched more with
respect to its active involvement in seeking out
firms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:27:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000168">I
want to interrogate further what a contact is. Is it a passive, single
phone call? Is it saying, “We have a website; please have a look
at it”? Is it a visit to the firm, actively delving, and saying,
“What are your ambitions? What do you want to achieve? How can
we help you do that?”? The report, as I mentioned, says that the
emphasis is on quantity over quality, and I think that is a fair point.
My central question, therefore, is how UKTI provides meaningful
engagement and contact with firms, and how that contact is maintained
and deepened over time. Crucially, instead of contact being reactive
and passive, how are leads and contacts followed up? The report is full
of examples of a lead or inquiry not being followed up. I was
particularly dismayed to read about a national trade association giving
UKTI a list of about 300 members that were export-ready and seeking
help with their first step, so that UKTI would pursue
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:28:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000169"><B><Member ContinuationText="Daniel Kawczynski" PimsId="4793" UID="13091235000291" xid="888" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000291">Daniel

he said in his report, which says that after four months, no contact
had been made by UKTI with any of those companies. If that is what is
going on, this country is undoubtedly missing lucrative commercial

follow-up is being carried

great work from Nissan, which has produced new developments, become

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:37:12"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hartlepool (Mr Wright), who demonstrated passionately the strength
of feeling in favour of bipartisan openness in Great Britain. As a
country, we can be proud that we have a political tradition across all
major parties of openness to trade and the value of trade. The argument
about the benefits of trade—not just financial, but in terms of
innovation and the improvement of business practices—was
powerful, and long may that cross-party openness to trade
continue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000189">I
agree strongly with the hon. Gentleman about my noble Friend Lord
Green, who has worked extremely hard, travelling much of the time, not
only directly to open doors along with the Prime Minister’s
trade ambassadors, two of whom spoke in the debate, but to strengthen
UK Trade and Industry as an institution. Its budget was increased in
the 2011 and 2012 autumn statements, which was partly because of a
recognition that its effectiveness and efficiency were improving. The
private sector experience of many of those in UKTI who are promoting
trade was raised as an important positive point by hon. Members on both
sides of the Chamber. Some 75% of senior management in UKTI have
private sector experience, the majority of whom arrived in the past 18
months under the leadership of Lord Green. The whole House can unite in
commending his work and that of Nick Baird’s day-to-day
leadership of the
organisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091235000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/halltext/130912h0001.htm#13091235000190">I
was delighted to see support in the report for the direction UKTI is
taking. It also contained a recognition of some improvements, although
I have noted the criticisms, which I shall try to deal with as well.
Part of the question is about the need for scrutiny of, and
transparency in, UKTI. I should tell hon. Members that there were
reports from the Business, Innovation and Skills Committee in 2011 and
2012 and a Lords Select Committee report in 2013, while the UKTI chief
executive will appear before the Public Accounts Committee on 6
November. I am sure that he will very much enjoy his trip to Shrewsbury
on 5 November, perhaps spending the time ensuring that he is across all
the questions that he might be asked and listening to the comments of

independent organisation that reviews UKTI’s performance
quarterly, three quarters of the 4,000 UKTI service users who were
surveyed were either satisfied or very satisfied, while fewer than 10%
were dissatisfied. From those who use UKTI, the results are pretty

Hancock:</Member></B> It is indeed important to have a target for
satisfaction, and if three quarters are satisfied or very satisfied,
that shows we are heading in the right direction, but more can always
be done. For instance, since 2011, a realignment of UKTI has taken
place to ensure that it can better serve the needs of UK plc. The
process has included: the introduction of stronger senior management
with private sector experience; new private sector delivery of trade
services in England, with incentivised contracts, which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:42:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shrewsbury and Atcham asked for; improving performance
overseas and strengthening teams in key growth areas, such as China and
India; and reviewing targets to ensure that they incentivise the
behaviour of individuals on the ground. The right balance is having
strong direct accountability to Ministers, which is appropriate,
alongside the right incentives to give individuals on the ground the
autonomy to be able to promote trade.</hs_Para>

hon. Members mentioned—favourably or otherwise—the fact
that UKTI reports to two Departments. I am a Minister in two
Departments, and it is true that it is necessary to have co-ordination
between the two. It would not be right to remove accountability for
UKTI from either the Foreign Office or the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, because UKTI is precisely about the link between
business and our international relations. This is about, on the one
hand, strengthening links between UKTI and domestic business, for which
the Business Department is responsible, and, on the other hand,
strengthening links between UKTI and our diplomatic service, which has
happened a great deal over the past two or three years. Both those are
valuable and necessary if the service is to perform, so it is therefore
right that UKTI reports to a Minister who sits in both Departments but,
of course, it is accountable to one Minister—my noble Friend in
the other place—so there is a clear line of sight for
ministerial accountability.</hs_Para>

with businesses, including SMEs, and it will hold another seminar in

Member for Stafford (Jeremy Lefroy) talked about the importance of
inward investment and the business bank. It is vital to ensure that
finance is available for exports, and funding for lending and
strengthening the domestic private banking system are important parts
of that. We are also seeing the growth of challenger banks, which are
increasingly providing business finance. We will, of course, have the
first ever British business bank, which is being set up precisely to
look at the sorts of investments that he talked about. It is right that
the British business bank does not take 
<?notus-xml column=381?>direct instruction from Ministers for each loan because, quite properly,
they have to be made on a commercial basis.</hs_Para>

Lefroy:</Member></B> Will my hon. Friend examine the relationship
between UK Export Finance and the commercial banks? My constituents
have said that some commercial banks—not all but some, but
including very large ones—do not seem to be interested in
promoting export finance and are unaware of the new products that are
available. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:46:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-09-12T15:46:34"></hs_TimeCode>I can go one
step further because we have already been raising those challenges with
UK banks to ensure that the facilities on offer are better integrated
into their services. My hon. Friend will also know that the GREAT
campaign to which many hon. Members referred, which brings together the
promotion of UK export under one strong brand, is being piloted
domestically in the north-east of England to promote export by UK
companies in addition to Britain overseas, as has been the case
hitherto. The promotion of the different Government schemes available
for British-based businesses will be brought together under that brand
in the pilot, which I hope is successful and can be rolled out further,
to do exactly what he talks about.</hs_Para>

the broad discussion about the recognition of UKTI, I strongly agree
that it is important to ensure that every business, as appropriate,
knows about UKTI and its services. We are doing an awful lot to try to
make that happen, not least through local engagement. More than 100
constituency seminars have been put on by UKTI with local MPs, serving
about 150 constituencies. A seminar in my constituency was very well
attended and has led to increased contacts between UKTI and local
businesses. If any Member wants UKTI to come to their constituency, we
can look at that, because I think that we have been able to meet every
request that has been made. Such events mean that UKTI, with the help
of the local MP, can reach businesses that it has not yet reached. I am

cannot blame the fact that growth has been slower than 
<?notus-xml column=382?>was forecast in 2010 on the Government’s domestic policies and
then complain that growth in exports has not been as strong as we would
have liked. In the past three years, there has been a massive crisis in

Corbyn:</Member></B> The point that I made was that the FCO’s
website expresses serious human rights concerns about regimes to which
a large number of British arms exports are approved by the Department
for Business, Innovation and Skills. I particularly draw attention to
Bahrain, but also to the whole operation of the defence and security
equipment international exhibition, which is on at the moment. A
Russian company there that has been supplying arms to Syria is openly
parading its wares at the exhibition, which is subsidised by the
British Government. We need a lot more transparency about the operation
of the defence services organisation and what eventually happens to
those weapons. When people are assaulted by anti-personnel weapons
supplied by Britain, they do not feel very benign towards this

is considered against the criteria, which have been in place for some
time, in the light of circumstances in that country and depending on
the products’ end use. The system has been supported by
Governments of all three major parties. In the specific case of Syria,
which has been raised as a concern, no chemicals were exported under

discussions with partners in the police, local government and the

all premises—from the riskiest to the quietest—must
comply with the system regardless of whether it is locally appropriate
or not. As a result, the consultation published today proposes enabling
targeted, local alternatives to personal licences through locally
applied conditions to premises licences. We have estimated that this
proposal could save businesses, including small and medium enterprises,
some £10 million a year if taken forward, while keeping a focus
on measures to tackle crime and disorder at licensed

protocol creates a legal regime for the transnational movement of
firearms and contains practical measures designed to assist law
enforcement by enhancing international co-operation and promoting
greater transparency in the legal transfer of firearms. The Commission
was mandated by the EU to negotiate six of the articles in relation to:
record keeping; marking of firearms; deactivation of firearms; general
requirements for export, import and transit licensing or authorisation

Commission signed the protocol on behalf of the community in
2001 with the intention of concluding it once the articles they
negotiated had been enshrined in European law. This has
been primarily achieved through amendments to the
existing weapons directive 91/477 on the acquisition and possession of
weapons and the adoption of regulation 258/2012 to combat illicit arms
trafficking through improved tracing and control of exports of civilian
arms from the EU. These changes have already been transposed into UK

agricultural workers scheme (SAWS) allows fruit and vegetable growers
to employ migrant workers from Bulgaria and Romania as seasonal workers
for up to six months at a time. It will close, as planned, at the end
of 2013. The Government do not intend to open any new SAWS for workers
from outside the European economic area (EEA) as our view is that, at a
time of unemployment in the UK and the European Union there should be
sufficient workers from within those labour markets to meet the needs
of the horticultural industry. The agricultural technologies strategy
will support innovation by agricultural businesses, which will also
help to offset future
impacts.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091223000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/wmstext/130912m0001.htm#13091223000108">Currently,
there is an annual quota of 21,250 SAWS participants. From 1 January
2014, when the transitional labour market controls on Bulgarian and
Romanian (EU2) nationals are lifted, growers will have unrestricted
access to EU2 workers. Since the controls on the EU8 (the member states
that acceded to the European Union in 2004) workers were lifted, those
workers have continued to form the core of the seasonal agricultural
workforce. At present, UK growers recruit about one third of their
seasonal workers from the EU2, and about one half from the EU8.
Seasonal agricultural work can pay good wages and the sector should be
able to attract and retain UK and EEA
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091223000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/wmstext/130912m0001.htm#13091223000109">Our
migration policy is to allow only highly skilled workers from outside
the EEA, with an annual limit of 20,700 workers. Unskilled and
low-skilled labour needs should be satisfied from within the expanded
EEA labour market. The SAWS was previously open to non-EEA nationals
but was restricted in 2007 to EU2 nationals, consistent with an
intention to phase it out as the EEA labour market expanded. That
remains the Government’s position. We do not think that the
characteristics of the horticultural sector, such as its seasonality
and dependence on readily available workers to be deployed at short
notice, are so different from those in other employment sectors as to
merit special treatment from a migration policy
perspective.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091223000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/wmstext/130912m0001.htm#13091223000110">The

the closure of the SAWS on the horticulture sector earlier this year.
They concluded 
<?notus-xml column=61?>that there was unlikely to be an impact on labour supply in the short
term, although this might change in the longer term. They noted,
however, that there is a wide range of uncertainty around the effects
on migration flows to the UK of ending restrictions on labour market
access for EU2 nationals. The MAC was also clear that a replacement
SAWS would amount to preferential treatment for
horticulture.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13091223000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/wmstext/130912m0001.htm#13091223000111">The
Government recognise that the SAWS has for many years provided an
efficient supply of labour for the horticultural sector. The Department
for Work and Pensions has been working with JobCentre Plus, Lantra (the
sector skills council), the National Farmers’ Union and others,
including growers and horticultural recruitment firms, to help
unemployed UK residents into horticultural work through training and
guaranteed interviews. A pilot scheme to encourage unemployed UK
residents to apply for, train and secure jobs on arable farms has shown
encouraging results with a high proportion of participants going on to
secure employment in the sector. We want to build on this and other
innovative approaches. The Government, including the Department for the
Environment Food and Rural Affairs, the Department for Work and

Recruitment and Retention Payment (RRP) (Flying) which are paid
dependent on rank, seniority and specialisation. The criteria applied
have been adapted to meet the specific needs of the Royal Navy, Royal
Marines, Army and the Royal Air Force and therefore vary across the
three services and within certain cadres of service personnel. The
rates of RRP (Flying) are recommended annually by the independent Armed
Forces' Pay Review Body (AFPRB) and the current levels can be found at

Information about the previous occupations of asylum applicants and the
reasons for refusal of their asylum claims, if that is the outcome, can
be provided only by examining individual case records, which would
incur disproportionate cost. All asylum claims made in the UK by those
who have previously served as interpreters for the UK Government and

and protection is offered to those who are found to be at real risk of
serious harm in Afghanistan.</hs_Para>

very seriously and strongly opposes the use of the death penalty in all
circumstances, including for drugs offences. The Government published
Overseas Security and Justice Assistance (OSJA) Guidance in 2011, which
provides clear guidance to officials and law enforcement officers to
help them identify human rights risks. Under OSJA guidance, where human
rights risks are identified, the Government seeks to mitigate risks by

2012 and includes training on the relevant offences and their
identification, as well as covering other issues which may arise in the
prosecution of stalking cases. The course was refreshed in June 2013,

Hoban:</Member></B> The quarter 2 and quarter 3 Quarterly Data Summary
(QDS) returns of all 17 Departments participating in the QDS process
were delayed owing to the development of the Cabinet Office's
Government Interrogating Spending Tool (GIST). The GIST was developed
in response to recommendations made in Dr Martin Read's
independent report entitled ‘Practical Steps to Improve
Management Information in Government'. The GIST is an online tool that
allows the public to access a breakdown of government expenditure
through the Gov.UK website. It makes the process of 
<?notus-xml column=837?>accessing and analysing complex QDS and OSCAR data easier and quicker,

effect on the day-to-day activities of the victim. This recognises the
overall emotional and psychological harm that stalking may cause to
victims, even where there is no explicit fear of violence. The maximum

noted in the impact assessment, under our proposal set out in the

made. This may reduce the number of cases the Legal Aid Agency (LAA)
need to process and reduce the number of hours required in court for
these cases with an associated saving for Her Majesty's Courts and
Tribunal Service (HMCTS). We have also noted in our assessment that
there is the potential for an increase in requests for reconsideration
of the permission application at a hearing, or onward permission
appeals to the Court of Appeal where permission has been refused, which
may result in an impact on HMCTS from reconsidering the
applications.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> At around £2 billion a year we have one of
the most expensive legal aid systems of its type in the world. The
consultation paper ‘Transforming Legal Aid: delivering a more
credible and efficient system’, contained a range of measures
aimed at reducing the cost of and promoting public confidence in the
legal aid scheme, including a proposal that providers would only be
paid for work on an application for permission to proceed with a
judicial review if permission is granted by the
court.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091230000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/corrtext/130912c0001.htm#13091230000019">We
are concerned that legal aid is currently being used to fund
applications for permission for judicial review in weak cases which are
unsuccessful and which have little effect other than to incur
unnecessary costs for the
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091230000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/corrtext/130912c0001.htm#13091230000020">As
part of our consultation we have published an impact assessment which
is available

noted in the impact assessment, under our proposal set out in the
consultation paper the provider would need to make an assessment of
whether the application is arguable and therefore permission should be
applied for. There may therefore be a fall in permission applications
made. This may reduce the number of cases the Legal Aid Agency (LAA)
need to process and reduce the number of hours required in court for
these cases with an associated saving for Her Majesty's Courts and
Tribunal Service (HMCTS). We have also noted in our assessment that
there is the potential for an increase in requests for reconsideration
of the permission application at a hearing, or onward permission
appeals to the Court of Appeal where permission has been refused, which
may result in an impact on HMCTS from reconsidering the
applications.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091230000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/corrtext/130912c0001.htm#13091230000022">In
both circumstances however this is unquantifiable as the behavioural
response of providers and clients is
unknown.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091230000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/corrtext/130912c0001.htm#13091230000023">Regarding
possibility of increased applications for costs from public authority
opponents, it is already the case that providers should generally agree
costs as part of a settlement or seek a costs order form the court, as
they would if acting for a privately paying client. This is set out in
paragraph 6.58 of the 2013 Standard Civil Contract General
Specification.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13091230000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130912/corrtext/130912c0001.htm#13091230000024">The
