right to take up his constituent’s case in this way. He has
written to me about this specific case. My sympathy goes out to the
family and friends of Georgia Williams. As he has asked, I understand
that the Independent Police Complaints Commission is currently
considering its response to a referral from West Mercia police into the
handling of this case and what needs to be published. On the issue of
cautions, we announced last year that we are banning the use of simple
cautions for all of the most serious offences, including manslaughter,
rape and robbery, as well as a range of other offences that devastate
lives and tear apart communities. Clearly, this is a tragic case and we

tribute to all those helping with relief efforts and to the
extraordinary resilience we have seen in the past few weeks of the
people of our country. He will know that people in affected communities
are relieved that help from the armed forces and emergency services has
now arrived, but many feel they were sent in too late. With further

terms of the engagement of the military, I think that this is
important. It has always been possible for gold commanders in these
emergency situations to call on military assets. Indeed, a military
liaison officer is supposed to sit with those gold commanders and
liaise with them. What we have done in recent days is to say very
clearly to all the local authorities concerned, which we have contacted
individually, “If you want military assistance, don’t
think twice about it: think once, then ask, and they’ll be
there.” We have now got thousands of military at a state of
readiness to help out. A huge number have already been deployed; and
yes, as we see the levels potentially rising on the Thames again coming
into this weekend, we should do everything we can now to get extra help
into those communities that could be affected and make sure that they
are helped. All the military assistance that is required is there;
people only have to

£2.2 billion in the previous four-year period. What I can say to
the House—I think that this is important—is that as the

local authorities all to look again at the flood patterns we have seen

flood protection as they repair their properties. That will be up to

announcing a £10 million fund to help farmers who have seen
their land waterlogged day after day, week after week. I can also

misapprehension that HS2 will be built at the expense of the west
country—it will not. In the next Parliament, we will spent three
times more on other road and rail schemes as we will spend on
HS2, and some of those schemes will directly benefit people
in the west country. Secondly, while we are working as fast as we can
to restore the Dawlish link, we need to look at longer-term
alternatives, and I have discussed that with Network Rail and First
Great Western to see what more can be done. Thirdly, in the meantime,
while Dawlish is as it is, we need to go on boosting the air
services to the peninsula. That is why I met Flybe in Newquay. It has
doubled the number of flights and we have taken £5 off the cost
of each of those flights. We also need to make sure that the
replacement bus services are as good as they can be. If we do all those
things, that will lessen the impact of this tragedy for the
west country.</hs_Para>

assurance. He is right to mention the difficulties on the River Severn,
because the River Severn, the River Tame and the River Wye are all
expected to respond to recent rainfall, and levels are likely to go up.
In terms of the Thames, I should tell the House that a second peak in
Thames levels is expected on Sunday and Monday, which could potentially
put 800 properties at risk. We will go on doing whatever we can to help
people—getting people to communities before they are flooded. It
is worth making the point, to be fair to the previous Government as
well as this one, that all the schemes that have been built since the
2007 floods, when 55,000 homes were flooded, are now protecting well
over 1 million properties that would have been flooded this time
around, were it not for the important work that has been
done.</hs_Para>

Friend says. The figures suggest that, in applications to build
properties on flood plains, the official advice, which includes the
advice from the Environment Agency, is followed on 99% of occasions. It
is worth remembering that areas such as London are part of flood
plains, so it is not possible simply to say that no house can ever be
built on a flood plain, but we need to look at the rules, listen to the

addition to the inquests, there is the investigative process, to which

involvement in the aftermath of Hillsborough. It is worth reminding the
House that this includes not just the role and actions of the South
Yorkshire police, the force responsible for policing the match, but the
West Midlands police, who played a significant role in the aftermath,
providing support to Lord Taylor’s inquiry, producing the report
to the Director of Public Prosecutions and assisting the then South
Yorkshire West coroner, Dr Stefan Popper. I can therefore confirm that
the experience of survivors, again brought to public attention in the

second element is a criminal investigation—Operation

Secretary and then other colleagues, it might be helpful if I
emphasised to the House that the special inquest has not yet formally
opened. I think there have been pre-hearings, but the hearing itself
has not opened. Therefore, the matter is not sub judice. However,
colleagues  
<?notus-xml column=854?>might think it wise to exercise a degree of restraint and to weigh their
words carefully if they seek to express opinions on matters that
plainly fall to be determined by the inquest. That is not in any sense
intended to chill; it is simply to make the point to colleagues, who
will exercise their own judgment as to how to proceed in this

what had happened at Hillsborough. However, everybody has been perhaps
not surprised but disappointed that further documents have emerged as a
result of the two investigations, particularly the police pocket
notebooks and other such documents. I have written to both Dame Anne
Owers, as chairman of the IPCC, and Jon Stoddart—they are in
charge of the investigations and it is up to them to amass the
information they need—whether they were having any problems
getting material and whether it would be helpful for me to write to the

for the families and their access to information, there are two ways in
which families can ask questions. First, they can go to Warrington and

Warrington, I was taken through the sort of information that the
investigators could provide to the family of a particular individual.
Families rightly have questions. One benefit for those involved in the
investigations when families go in to talk to them is that they can
identify any questions that the families might ask that might not be
the first to come to mind for the investigators. The forums are also
important, as they provide families with the opportunity to raise
questions face to face. As I have said, they are ably chaired and

Rotheram</B> (Liverpool, Walton) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful to the
Home Secretary for agreeing to update the House today. In her
statement, she said that in 2012 the Prime Minister apologised for a
double injustice, yet now we learn that Hillsborough may have been a
treble injustice. Ever since the disaster, the families of the 96 have
expressed concerns that their phones may have been hacked and
electronic communications monitored. First, families lost loved ones,
then they were criminalised, and now it seems that they may even have
been shadowed by terrorists. I have one simple question, so that the
right hon. Lady can put the families’ minds at rest. Will she
confirm unequivocally that at no stage since the disaster were the
families subjected to surveillance by the police or security services
of this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:00:33"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0001.htm#140212159000242"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs May" PimsId="1758" UID="140212159001037" xid="420" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0001.htm#140212159001037">Mrs
May:</Member></B> I fully appreciate the point that the hon. Gentleman
makes about the families’ concerns, but he will recognise, as I
am sure his right hon. and hon. Friends will too, that we do not
identify those who may or may not have been subject to interception in
any form. I know that this is difficult and I know that some would
prefer a somewhat different answer, but it has always been the case
that the police do not confirm or deny whether an individual has been
subject to interception. There are two avenues that I would refer to in
relation to the hon. Gentleman’s question. The first is that, as
I said in response to the shadow Home Secretary, the IPCC is aware of
these concerns and is considering how best to address them. If it does
find any evidence during its investigation that suggests that
surveillance has taken place, it will pursue it. It is also available
to those who feel that they have been subject to unlawful interception
by the authorities, to refer that to the Investigatory Powers Tribunal,
which provides an independent forum for investigating
complaints<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:02:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0001.htm#140212159000243"><Member ContinuationText="Graham Evans" PimsId="5719" UID="140212159001038" xid="1168" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0001.htm#140212159001038"><B>Graham

that Bishop James Jones’ panel had its own agenda. It did an
extremely good job. It identified a significant number of documents,
and some are still coming forward. It did the first important task,
which was to reveal to all of us the validity of the comments and
claims made by the families over the years, who had not been believed
and had not been listened to. The panel showed that the families were
right and that errors and potential criminal activity needed to be
investigated. The work of the independent panel was crucial. It was
essential in enabling what is now happening in terms of trying to
ensure that we get justice for the families. Had it not been for the
independent panel’s inquiry and the results that it had, we

of the IPCC investigation, 13 of the 242 officers whose

are being regarded as witnesses are not required to be
interviewed at this stage, and there are those who have said that they
do not believe that they have anything to add to the information that
has been available in the past. I would therefore suggest a degree of
caution in respect of how those who are not taking up the request for
an interview are portrayed. As I have said, if the IPCC identifies
someone who is potentially suspected of a criminal offence, that will
not be an impediment, and the IPCC will act
accordingly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0001.htm#140212159000257"><Member ContinuationText="Bob Blackman" PimsId="5580" UID="140212159001050" xid="1094" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0001.htm#140212159001050"><B>Bob

indications of problems relating to the ground, but not all the
necessary lessons had been learnt from previous experience. That is why
it is so important—as one of my hon. Friends said
earlier—that in the event of an incident of any scale, but
particularly an incident of the scale of the Hillsborough tragedy,
lessons are learnt and people look at what went wrong. Part of
the current process involves consideration of whether there
was any neglect in relation to the ground and the operations that took
place there. Sadly, as I have said, it appears that there were
indications of problems, but lessons were not learnt before this

extent to which there was what could almost be described as an
organised stereotyping distortion of what had taken place, and the
extent of the prejudice against those who attended the game at
Hillsborough—both those who lost their lives and those who
survived? Does she agree that one legacy that we should really want is
the knowledge that, in any future situations of this kind, such
prejudices will be continually challenged and

point. As I said earlier, when the Prime Minister made his own

felt that it was not necessary to take the matter further. Like others,
I pay tribute not just to the families who continued the fight, but to
the Members of Parliament and others who consistently challenged that
view and said that it was not right to let the issue lie. The right
hon. Gentleman is absolutely right: while I hope that we never see an
incident of this sort again, it is important for those who try to set a
public perception on such issues to be
challenged.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/4D15F1A4C06F2E2B0757AF0FE52B09CC8EFA6FFF" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2014">Wednesday

the police itself, rather than passing them back to police forces. That

a very real question in people’s minds about police integrity,

that people will feel that they can have full confidence in the police.

of order and for his indication to me a few moments ago of his
intention to raise it. The straightforward position is that once the
inquest has formally opened, the matters of which it treats are then
sub judice. In those circumstances, the Chair does have discretion to
waive the sub judice rule, though it has to be said that no such
judgment would be made lightly, for I have to be conscious of and
respectful towards the resolution relating to sub judice that the House
has itself passed. I am sorry if my reply today is not as informative
as the hon. Gentleman would wish. However, I will keep abreast of
events and I am well aware of the sensitive balance of considerations
here as between the proper concern of Members with freedom of speech,
on the one hand, and the crucial imperative of not prejudicing the
conduct of the inquest, on the other. I hope that the hon. Gentleman
and others will feel that I am very conscious of those balancing
considerations and will attend to them keenly. If, at any stage, an
hon. Member wishes to approach me for guidance as to the

Lobby to support the introduction of the bedroom tax. Perhaps I am

those who supported the introduction of the bedroom tax knew fully of
the dire consequences it would have on those affected—quite
frankly beggars belief. Make no mistake about it, the full and sole
intention of this Bill is to sweep away the dreaded bedroom tax. It
seeks to restore justice for up to 660,000 people—some of our
country’s most vulnerable citizens, two thirds of whom are
disabled. They have been inhumanely let down by the Government's
reforms to housing benefit in the social sector. The tax has caused
heartache and devastation to thousands of residents up and down this
country. It is a tax whose forced implementation has put extreme
pressure on councils, housing associations and social landlords. It is
a tax that has put extreme pressure on the ordinary working people who

the introduction of the tax, Ministers argued that the changes would
encourage people to downsize to smaller properties and, in doing so,
help to cut the £23 billion annual bill for housing
benefit; would free up living space for overcrowded families; and would
encourage people to get jobs. Significantly, it has achieved none of
those objectives. At the same time, the Department for Work and
Pensions has trumpeted the measure as, “returning fairness to
housing benefit.” The words “fairness” and
“bedroom tax” should not be uttered in the same
sentence.</hs_Para>

is that yet another measure introduced by this Government is in total
and utter chaos. It lies in tatters, with the victims left to pick up
the pieces. As thousands suffer, there is a real risk that the bedroom
tax will end up costing more than it saves. The National Housing
Federation has said that the savings claimed by the Government are
“highly questionable”, partly because those who are
forced to move to the private rented sector will end up costing more in
housing benefit.</hs_Para>

politicians and members of the general public, we are entitled to
question the motives behind the introduction of the bedroom tax. The
tax does not deal with the problem of under-occupation. In fact, the
Government’s costings on the yield raised from the bedroom tax
explicitly assume that people will not move into smaller properties.
There are simply not enough smaller properties for people to move
into.</hs_Para>

households were deemed to be under-occupying two-bedroom homes, yet
only 85,000 one-bedroom homes became available during the whole of
2012. The savings projections of the Department for Work and Pensions
assume that not one of the 660,000 households affected would respond to
the policy by moving to a smaller home. Put simply, this is yet another
example of the Government balancing the books on the backs of the
disabled and the vulnerable. The tax must be scrapped now.</hs_Para>

associations say that tens of millions of pounds are likely to be lost
through the build-up of arrears. Reports this morning estimate that
144,000 people have fallen behind with their rents since the
introduction of the bedroom tax and that 14% have received eviction
notices. Was that really meant to happen? Was this eviction of the poor
really the plan of the Government?</hs_Para>

research by the University of York, which was based on data by the
housing associations that have tenants affected by the bedroom tax,
suggested that the policy could save up to 39% less than the DWP had
predicted. In the past week, it has emerged that more than half of the
£500 million that the Government claim will be saved by the
hated tax will be spent on re-housing disabled people. These are
vulnerable people who already live in properties that have been adapted

<?notus-xml column=871?>for their needs and who have built up local support networks with their
friends, family and neighbours. The future for them lies in communities
that are unknown and foreign to them. They have been cast out like the
proverbial dog in the night.</hs_Para>

months, it has emerged that a loophole in policy exempts thousands of
people. Instead of looking at that
loophole—<I>[Interruption.]</I> It is suggested that that
loophole has been closed. As Ministers scramble to mop up the mistakes,
another challenge to the hated tax has arisen. A judge has overturned
the tax in the case of a Rochdale man who argued that one of his
bedrooms was used as a dining room. The appeal was upheld on the basis
that the dictionary definition of a bedroom is a room that contains a
bed that is used for sleeping in. An avalanche of appeals is on its
way.</hs_Para>

to see that, only last week, the Scottish Labour party shamed the
Scottish National party into abolishing the bedroom tax. I must put it
on the record that I am also proud that one of the first acts of a
future Labour Government will be to end this full frontal attack on the
vulnerable. However, we cannot afford to wait until the general
election of 2015. I urge the supporters of this tax to think again. The
question is this: are they happy to see the misery and social
disruption of the vulnerable and disabled?</hs_Para>

do not know whether you noticed, because you are blind in some of these
matters—deliberately so—but the Tory Whips were standing
outside the Chamber during the Division and persuading Conservative
Members not to vote, so we on the Opposition side of the House hope
that that means that they have changed their minds and will get rid of
the bedroom tax as soon as possible. If they will not, we
will.</hs_Para>

point of order relates to the bedroom tax. Mr Speaker, you
will recall that earlier this year, when asked how many people had been
affected by the loophole  
<?notus-xml column=874?>in the bedroom tax legislation, the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, a Member of this House, said that the number was between
3,000 and 5,000. In a written answer,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:01:01"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, the hon. Member for Wirral West (Esther McVey), also a Member of
this House, said that she did not know how many had been affected. Lord
Freud, a Minister in another place, said that it was an insignificant
number. Today, however, he told the Work and Pensions Committee of this
House that the number was 5,000. We have been doing their work for
them, and from freedom of information requests to local authorities in
England, Wales and Scotland, we already know, from just the third that
replied, of 16,000 cases. I know that there is a means whereby a
Minister in this House can correct the record, but how can a Minister
in the other House correct the record in this
House?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000567" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000567"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Speaker" InTheChair="True" PimsId="3965" UID="140212159001324" xid="43" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159001324"><B>Mr

made a mistake—I make no comment on that, because I do not
know—he will have the opportunity to correct it. If the
Committee believes that he has made a mistake and wishes to pursue it
with him, it is open to the Committee to do so. At this stage,
therefore, there is nothing further to add. To the extent that I have
already advised, it is a legitimate matter for the Chair because of the
involvement of a Committee of this House. I hope that that is helpful

I go further in, I hope, enlightening the House about that wider point,
it is important to recognise the achievements of our police officers.
The unacceptable actions of a very small minority of officers have
recently challenged the reputation of the police, but I hope the House
will agree that this is not representative of the outstanding
day-to-day work that the vast majority of our officers carry out in
fighting crime and protecting the public. Indeed, we need look no

Keeley</B> (Worsley and Eccles South) (Lab):</Member> May I take the
Minister back to his point about allocations? Also in December, a
protest started against exploration for shale gas in my constituency,
which is now tying down 150 Greater Manchester police officers, with
the cost being met out of Greater Manchester police budgets. That
amounts to £40,000 a day for the 150 officers who are being
deployed, and the cost could mount to £4 
<?notus-xml column=876?>million, as it did in Balcombe when there was a protest there. Does the
Minister agree that there should be some support for that? Why should
Greater Manchester’s population suffer a much greater thinning
out of our police force, especially given that we have already lost
1,000 officers? There is no consideration of this when a controversial

Minister that the collaboration between the police and local
government, to which my right hon. Friend the Member for Salford and
Eccles (Hazel Blears) referred, is becoming increasingly difficult
because of the financial constraints on local government. To give an
example from my constituency, in 2004, Greater Manchester police and
Tameside metropolitan borough council came together and rehoused Denton
police station in Denton town hall, creating a one-stop shop for those
services. Greater Manchester police has withdrawn  
<?notus-xml column=880?>from that because of the funding constraints on it, which means that
nobody in Tameside’s second largest town has direct,

recently in Northamptonshire. Fairly recently, I also visited a joint
police station and local government office in Chippenham in Wiltshire.
Again, that is very creative. Each of those public bodies has to have
buildings and each faces the same pressures that are faced by the whole
public sector, for the reasons that I have rehearsed. They are using
that as an opportunity. Instead of the police being based in the old
Victorian police station on the edge of town, they are now in a more
modern building that is in the centre of town. That makes the police
more accessible. There are opportunities for the police and local

much lower funding than other authorities, has lost about 20% of its

police, which have seen it paying for police community support officers
itself and having a sharing arrangement on fuel. It is about to go into
a sharing arrangement on buildings. It can do all that at a time of
reducing budgets, as well as reversing many other things, such as cuts
to youth services. Services must work together. In my area, doing that

to identify and disrupt serious and organised crime, and I am glad to
report to the House that it is already achieving successes. In a recent

mentioning partnership, let me move on to collaboration. Police and
crime commissioners and chief constables are working to drive
efficiency and improve policing through greater collaboration. We
know—we have already had an exchange on this—that
collaboration initiatives can be challenging to set up, but there is no
reason why forces should be planning to deliver less than 10% of their
savings from collaboration. If they are doing that, opportunities are
being missed.</hs_Para>

some examples. Recently, the independent inspectorate praised the
Warwickshire and West Mercia strategic alliance as one of the most
ambitious and extensive collaborations in the country. In 2014-15, West
Mercia expects 70% of its total expenditure to be spent
collaboratively, generating 94% of the force’s savings
requirement. Similarly, Warwickshire expects 75% of its total
expenditure to be spent on collaboration, generating 75% of the
force’s whole savings requirement. That shows what can be
achieved.</hs_Para>

important to recognise that collaboration is not just about sharing
with other forces. Mental health, for example, has a big impact on
crime and policing, and nine forces are now participating in street
triage pilots that involve mental health professionals and paramedics
working closely with police officers. They aim to improve the
experience of, and access to, the health service for individuals at the
point of mental health crisis. The initial feedback from those pilots
is very positive, with good partnership working and a reduction in the
number 
<?notus-xml column=884?>of police detentions under the Mental Health Act 2007. That is better
for the police and, even more importantly, better for
patients.</hs_Para>

area where reform can both save money and deliver a better service is
greater collaboration between the blue-light emergency services.

is for policing to be digital by 2016 because technology has the
potential to transform policing the way it has transformed many other
areas of life. Hampshire police already use mobile data on a variety of
devices to give officers a full digital experience through their work,
and it found that it could demonstrate a 26% reduction in the time
spent by officers in stations, and a 20% reduction in
mileage covered by patrol vehicles. Again, we are using the police
innovation fund to support mobile working and invest in mobile devices,
data storage and transmission. Indeed, we found that digital working
can increase efficiency, even in forces that are not geographically
next to each other. For example, Northamptonshire and Cheshire have
united to create a joint shared service, providing 24-hour human
resources advice, uniform ordering, and admin functions. I am delighted
that 32 forces have now agreed to become digital
pathfinders, because the thought that we can transform policing through
the use of technology is spreading throughout the police
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000644" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000644">At
a time when public spending has been under severe pressure, this adds
up to the most significant reform of the police in a generation. It has
already led to more effective and efficient policing, which delivers
value for money for the taxpayer and ensures that significant falls in
overall crime continue year on year.</hs_Para>

the challenge does not end there. We need to make further cuts to
public spending and the police must play their part, despite the
protections that we 
<?notus-xml column=885?>have been able to provide. Importantly, we are taking a long-term view
on police funding. Last year, we announced that the Government would
undertake a fundamental review of the formula used to allocate funding
between police force areas. That complex process will take time, but
the first phase of the work—an internal analytical
review—is already under way, and we will consult a full range of
partners, both inside the police and the PCCs, at the appropriate point
as the work develops.</hs_Para>

that the funding settlement will create further challenges for PCCs and

Dromey</B> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</Member> Let me make two
preliminary points. First, hon. Members were here earlier for a
powerful debate on the Floor of the House about Hillsborough, and it is
absolutely right that where there is wrongdoing, those who are guilty
of such wrongdoing are held fully and properly to account. Secondly, I
agree with the Minister when he says that a progressive reform
agenda—progressive is my word, not his—is a good thing
and should be embraced. That is precisely why we commissioned the
Stevens report and I will say more on that later. I agree with the
Minister on the proposal to professionalise the police service
progressively, with chartered police officers accountable to the
college of policing, a lifelong career and personal
development<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:40:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000648" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000648">Let
me turn to the issue of Hillsborough and how our police service is
sometimes painted. I agree with both the Home Secretary and the Police
Minister when they say that it would be absolutely wrong to paint the
entire police service with the brush of a very small minority guilty of
wrongdoing. I want to start by paying tribute to the brave policemen
and women up and down the country who put their lives on the line day
in, day out to keep our communities safe; police officers like Ian
Dibell who have given their lives for their community and this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:41:06"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
constituency I have seen the outstanding bravery of police
officers—for example, tackling armed robbers—and the very
best of neighbourhood policing. The Stockland Green neighbourhood
police team is an award-winning team. Five years ago, the North
Birmingham academy in Kingstanding was riven with gang violence. The
school has been utterly transformed by the excellent co-operation
between the new leadership of the school and the local police
service.</hs_Para>

first duty of any Government is the safety and security of the
communities we serve. In government, Labour listened to what people

policing: 17,000 additional police officers who know their communities

policing worked: it proved to be deeply popular and crime fell by 43%.
Today, however, as a direct result of the actions of this Government,
there is a real fear that we risk a generation of progress being

remoteness of the police. One 
<?notus-xml column=886?>of the biggest advantages of the introduction of neighbourhood policing
was that people finally started to feel an affinity with their local
bobby and their police community support officers. Is he aware that we

Dromey:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. At the heart
of neighbourhood policing is the notion of local policing: roots in the
local community, the community knowing who their police officers are
and being able to identify with them and develop relationships with
them, both in terms of providing evidence of wrongdoing and diverting
people from crime—preventing crime in the first place. The
intimacy of those local relationships is of the highest importance. At
our peril do we go down the path of moving away from the notion of
neighbourhood policing and towards remote police officers touring areas

local policing in terms of detection of crime and diverting people from
crime. It is also key to the detection of very serious wrongdoing. For
example, in the city I am proud to represent, Birmingham, there has
been a large number of terrorist crime convictions. Some involved
hi-tech monitoring, but in most cases the detection of wrongdoers came
about through good neighbourhood policing and the development of local
relationships; in this case, predominantly with the Muslim community.
As a consequence of that co-operation, those guilty of the threat or
actual commission of terrorist crime were brought to book. Whether it
is a local burglary or a terrorist crime that threatens our community,
there is no substitute for the local policing that the hon. Gentleman

Dromey:</Member></B> Let me answer that straight up front. The Minister
referred earlier to “Labour’s legacy”. If we look
at what we achieved between 1997 and 2007, we reduced the debt to GDP
ratio from 40.9%, which we inherited from the previous Government, to
36.4% and, in addition to all the other achievements that I see in my 
<?notus-xml column=888?>constituency—the health centres, the schools and the children
centres—we put 17,000 police officers on the beat and 16,000
PCSOs with them. Then, after the 2007 crash, we faced up to the
difficult circumstances confronting the country, and that is why the
right hon. Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson), when he was Police Minister,
said that economies were necessary. He embraced the proposal that a 12%
cut could be achieved without affecting the frontline. Instead, the
Government went too far, too fast, driving through a 20% cut with all
the consequences that have flowed for the frontline.</hs_Para>

Dromey:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. After the 2007 crash, all
parties faced the question of how to make reasonable economies. The 12%
proposal, which was carefully thought through and which we embraced,
would not have put the front line at risk. A 20% cut has put the front
line at risk. In addition, the fabric of partnership working is being
stretched ever further and our communities are increasingly feeling the
consequences.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000673" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000673">The
Government’s delay in announcing the threshold was unacceptable
and has meant that police and crime commissioners were left in the
ludicrous situation of having to propose their police precepts, under a
statutory duty created by this Government, without knowing whether they
would have the power to implement them. We have heard a lot about
localism from the Government, but calls from police and crime
commissioners for clarity about funding were repeatedly ignored in
Whitehall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000674" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000674">Now
that we have seen the settlement, I cannot say that it makes up for the
hold-up by the Government. The Conservative party and their coalition
partners, the Liberal Democrats, are cutting police funding by
20%. In the last three years, that has already resulted in
the loss of more than 15,000 police officers. I have seen firsthand in
Birmingham and the west midlands some of the finest police officers one
would ever want to meet or work with forced out under the A19
rule.</hs_Para>

15,000 officers was more than the experts predicted and a higher number
than HMIC said would be safe. But the Government plough on regardless
with this settlement. It is not only wrong in itself: it is
increasingly damaging police morale. The pressure being put on our
police by these unsafe cuts is starting to take its toll. Just last
weekend, we learned that 800 police officers are off work on full pay
as a result of stress-related sickness, costing the taxpayer millions
of pounds every year. Just last year, police officers took 250,000 days
off because of stress-related illnesses, a 15% increase over the three
years up to 2013. Chief constables are blaming staff cuts for the
staggering rise in sick days for depression and other mental
issues.</hs_Para>

As we said at the time—it is important to remember this—a
reduction of 12% over a Parliament, and of around £1 billion a
year by the end of the Parliament, would have involved making tough
choices if we were to succeed in protecting police numbers. 
<?notus-xml column=890?>Such tough choices included cuts in overtime, reform of procurement,
collaboration, and altering shift patterns, but we believed then and

Dromey:</Member></B> I will come straight to that point. Precisely as a
consequence of what has happened, there are worrying signs that crime,
and especially violent crime, is starting to rise for the first time in
nearly two decades. The latest crime figures show disturbing signs that
a generation of progress in some areas is being reversed. For example,
there is a worrying increase in muggings. Violence against the person
has increased in 16 police force areas and violence without injury has
increased in 19 police force areas. According to the British Retail
Consortium, shoplifting, which is often associated with assaults on
shop staff, is at a nine-year
high.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000683">Increasingly,
the victims of crime are being let down as criminals get off
scot-free—7,000 fewer crimes of violence have been solved under
this Government. Despite a sharp increase in sexual crime, there has
been a significant fall in the referral of cases to the Crown
Prosecution Service for prosecution. Victims of the most heinous crimes
are being let
down.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000684">On
top of that, police forces are stretched to breaking point. They are
taking up to 30% longer to respond to 999 calls and there was a
reduction in overall crimes solved in 22 forces—nearly 14,000
more crimes were unsolved last year than when the Government came to 
<?notus-xml column=891?>power. In addition, crime is changing. Fraud has increased by 34%, but

those worrying indications that a generation of progress is being
reversed, all we have heard from the Government is the constant
assertion that crime is falling. However, the Government’s
independent statistics watchdog has said that the statistics can no
longer be relied on, and has downgraded its precious gold standard. The
UK Statistics Authority chair, the eminent Sir Andrew
Dilnot, has said that the more accurate the statistics become, the more
likely it is that they will show that crime is rising. That is the

royal commission, and the police service required serious examination
for the future in the 21st century. We were right to commission those
eminent and responsible individuals, who produced a report independent
of the Labour party. It challenges all political parties, but focuses

cleared away hundreds upon hundreds of Labour targets—key

the shadow police reform Minister in the last Parliament, I had
occasion to study the history of police reform. What strikes me about
the current plans is how coherent and effective Ministers have made
their proposals. First, we have introduced locally elected police and
crime commissioners, the idea of which was criticised even before it
had begun. There was sniping about the low turnout at elections, but
let us remember that 5 million people voted in those elections—5
million more than ever voted for local police authorities—and a
single focal point of accountability for local people is now a
reality.</hs_Para>

own PCC, Tim Passmore, in Suffolk, has frozen the police precept two
years running, is driving collaboration with Norfolk constabulary and
believes that we should, as other Members have said, look at forcing
new savings from police service budgets by amalgamating and
collaborating with other blue-light services. We have heard that fire
services should be part of the PCC’s remit, and Mr Passmore is
arguing hard for that. Also, we need to think much more imaginatively
about the sharing of overheads, not just with the fire service, but
with county councils. In my own area, it is shocking that the East of
England ambulance service trust has four control rooms and
mini-headquarters. Those should be sold off and joined up with the
other blue-light headquarters of the police constabulary in Suffolk and
the fire service.</hs_Para>

Criminal Justice and Victims, we have a new focus on increasing
productivity among police officers. The numbers game that the Labour
party wants to play simply will not wash. It talks about the loss of up
to 15,000 uniformed officers since 2010, but it has not pledged to find
the money to reinstate those officers, and there is a reason it
probably should not bother: it is not just the number of officers that

productivity among existing uniformed officers we can deliver the falls
in crime further into the future that we have seen in the last three
years. How might we do that? The Minister for Policing, Criminal
Justice and Victims has talked about the new generation of productivity
tools: electronic tablets, computerised forms and body-worn video
cameras that will reduce the amount of form-filling back at the
station. My right hon. Friend came to Ipswich a few months ago to see a
pilot that Suffolk constabulary is running on body-worn video cameras
so that police officers can spend less time behind a desk back at the
station computing and filling in forms and can instead get on with
visible policing on the front
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000710" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000710">In

higher productivity, but at standards in policing. In that, the Home
Secretary has been no slouch either. She has instituted the new College

police service at all levels, with better training and an insistence on
higher ethical standards. She is talking about direct entry so that
very able men and women from other disciplines—whether the armed

Normington proposals, announced a few days ago, will radically reform
the Police Federation and will also engender a higher sense of ethical

of which are controversial as they make changes to overtime, salary
levels and entitlements. But Winsor modernises the work force of the
police service so that it conforms to the norms of every other part of
the British economy, all other public services and the private sector.
Winsor says simply that we should not just pay police officers
according to time served, pretty much regardless of their performance.
Instead, we should reward specialisms and capabilities so that younger
officers who are going out and improving their skills, getting better
training and producing higher performance, have that reflected in their
remuneration. We are doing that in the teaching profession; it would be
inexcusable to make the police an exception. Police exceptionalism in

idea that a very tight, and necessarily tight, spending settlement will
result in the ceiling falling in, in neighbourhood policing collapsing

one looks at the Home Office core grant—not the overall

I would not think that that is the kind of reduction in core grant that
will lead to a diminution in the efficiency of the police. If anything,
it should drive up efficiency and productivity. I repeat; Labour, in
this debate and before it, has so far as I am aware—I am sure
the hon. Member for Birmingham, Erdington will correct me after the

hon. Member for Bury St Edmunds was absolutely right about the
revolution in policing and police management that we have seen under
this Home Secretary—but no matter what we say about that, I do
not feel that ordinary bobbies on the beat feel that they have been
consulted enough about the massive changes that have occurred.
Alongside that is the reduction in their pay and pensions. Hon. Members
only have to walk around the Westminster estate and talk to any police
officer about how they feel about the present state of the police
service and most of them will say, sadly, that they cannot wait to be
out of the service because it has changed so much. We as politicians
need to recognise that the people who count—the people who
deliver, in our neighbourhoods and our towns and cities—feel
that they have not been

it the Ghosh list, but she left shortly after, so we decided to name it
the Sedwill list, after the current permanent secretary. There are no
plans for him to leave. It is important that the Home Office looks at
procurement issues. Only this week, the Select Committee visited the
Metropolitan police firearms unit. We were all encouraged to take up
firearms and shoot at targets to see how difficult it was for officers.

forced my own group to make our annual proposals go through the same

had this debate—at least in the current
Parliament—Opposition Members have made similar comments. They
have said that too little money is being spent, and that we are about
to see a huge increase in crime as a result. Every year, when crime has
not increased, it has been suggested that it is about to increase, and
that we simply need to wait a little

Cambridgeshire for the fact that we have been recruiting those extra
police, and have been able to protect the front line in the county. The
hon. Gentleman is welcome to intervene again to give a clearer view of

me begin by paying a tribute, which I think all Members would echo, to
the work done by the vast majority of the police. They do a fantastic
job day in, day out. Some times are easier than others, but most times
are quite tough for police officers. It is a very hard job and it makes
a big difference to people’s lives, whether it involves directly
combating crime and catching criminals, or the much broader role that
police officers play. I have always welcomed community policing,
although I must say that I was slightly concerned when, back in the
days when I was a councillor, one of the best community beat officers
in my constituency, who had managed to halve the crime level in a
single year, was given a reprimand for not arresting enough people. I

said, the police in general do a fantastic job, and they feel let down
by the few officers who behave badly. A number of officers have spoken
to me directly about some of the issues that we explored in the Select
Committee, such as Plebgate, and have told me that they are
ashamed to wear the same uniform as some of those involved. Those
officers deserve better. According to recent reports, in the
last few years there have been more than 2,000 cases of officers and
staff breaching data protection rules, in some instances by looking at
the police national computer. Those officers constitute only a small
fraction of the total force, and like most police officers, I wish that
they would behave much
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000767" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000767">We

core of policing by consent. I hope that that continues, because I am
not at all keen on the idea of increasing militarisation in the police.
For that reason I am concerned about Tasers, although they are a
subject for another debate. Policing by consent—the sort of
policing that we have here—is not just about throwing money at
problems, and it is not just about passing more and more laws to make
more and more actions criminal offences; it is about giving communities

things we did in order to

any form of quasi-militaristic role, and that the role that we were
playing was much more relaxed. I worry about the message that is sent
to people who see something that looks like a firearm and is used like
a firearm. I agree that there is a place for Tasers as a less lethal
option, but I do not think that they should be rolled out for basic
use. That is a subject for another debate,

police work very well. The establishment of the College of Policing is
one of the best things that the Government have done in this area. It
will make it much easier for policing to become a more established
profession and for the police to work with a proper evidence base and a
more effective way of sharing and developing information. That will
follow on from the work that is already being done to reduce crime
despite tight budgets.</hs_Para>

times are tough, it is even more important to do things that actually
work to reduce crime and the fear of crime, rather than things that
merely work anecdotally. A huge amount of research has been done in
this area, and I pay tribute to the work of Professor Larry Sherman at
the institute of criminology at Cambridge university. He is a member of
the board of the College of Policing, and he has done a great deal of
work on what actually makes a difference in reducing crime. How we
place police officers and how we move them around a city can make a
difference, for example. He has also produced proposals relating to
crime harm indices. Where his proposals have been tried, they have been
very effective in reducing crime. That is the sort of lesson that the
college should be developing and that we should all be trying to
follow.</hs_Para>

should also look at other ways of reducing crime. Providing more
support to people serving very short sentences is a really good thing,
for example. We know that some people reoffend repeatedly, and it is
more efficient to invest in reducing their reoffending than to invest
in catching them and dealing with them afterwards. I am also pleased to
see a drive towards the use of more technology. It is far more helpful
to get police officers to go out and do their job, as they want to do,
rather than fighting technological problems. The police are far happier
when that happens.

days to buy lights to avoid paying a fine. That has led to a huge

can also ensure that money is spent more usefully by focusing on the
more serious crimes. I will not go into detail, but the Deputy Prime
Minister has suggested certain reforms of our drugs policy. The Home
Affairs Select Committee has also found that we could do as Portugal
has done, in transferring effort and money from the police and criminal
justice system to the health service to help to reduce addiction.
Similarly, we could 
<?notus-xml column=904?>reduce the stop and search that does not lead to arrests. That would
save police time and free up the police to get on with other
things.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T15:57:50"></hs_TimeCode>Such reforms are
important because they relate to trust in the police. Certain
communities start to lose trust in the police because of stop and
search and, in my view, because of increasing Taser use. That lack of
community interaction is a problem. It leads to distrust and makes it
harder for the police to find out what is happening. It makes people
work against the police rather than with them.</hs_Para>

could also do much more to help the police by sharing information,
although that must obviously be done carefully. The Select Committee
has recommended asking hospitals to share non-confidential
information—about numbers of incidents, for example—with
the police more often. There have been some good pilot models of that,
but they do not happen often enough. The public could also have more
information. The data available from police.uk is helpful, but we could
go further in that regard. Indeed, Professor Sherman has some ideas on
how to engage communities and give them real information about what is
going on. Such data also need to include hate crime, which should not
be considered separately from the main national crime
statistics.</hs_Para>

I note that some of the figures in the report on the police grant have

rarely speak in the House at length on policing issues, partly because
I spent three years as police Minister and I do not think that
reprising my experience is terribly helpful for Members in that same
role. Today, however, I have made an exception, because I am becoming 
<?notus-xml column=905?>increasingly worried about the direction of travel of our police
service. Part of my concern is about finance, but many of my concerns
are about the stresses and strains on neighbourhood policing. This is
not particularly about my introducing neighbourhood policing; this is
about neighbourhood policing being such a fundamental change to the way
in which we did policing in this country. I say to
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:01:08"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), the Chairman of the
Home Affairs Committee that there was reform during our period of
government, and neighbourhood policing was the biggest bit of reform
that we introduced. It is now established not only in this
country—for all time, I hope—but increasingly in other
European countries and countries across the world, where it is
recognised that sustainable policing must be done with people, not to
them. It must be done with consent, gathering the community around who
then become the eyes and ears of the police. Much more intelligence is
obtained that way, and the police become far more effective in fighting
crime.</hs_Para>

the police service that neighbourhood policing was not a fuzzy, warm
community development project but a hard-headed reform to make the
police service more effective was quite a job in changing culture. I
well remember that when I started talking to chief constables about
neighbourhood policing and how we needed to build
relationships—to get to know the head teacher, the shopkeepers,
the children and the people in the community—some of them looked
at me as though I was from Relate marriage guidance, talking to them
about relationships. When I hear our shadow Minister talking in the
House today about the need to have relationships, it shows how far we
have moved on police culture—recognising that relationships are
often far more useful than the traditional tools of
policing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:02:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

speaking in this debate because I am very concerned about what is
happening to our police service. Greater Manchester’s force has
had a fantastic record over the past 10 to 15 years, but we are now
seeing cuts totalling about £135 million over the five-year
period between 2011 to 2015, and already 1,000 police officers have had
to go. Sir Peter Fahy, who is a very respected chief constable, just as

is fair to say that crime, antisocial behaviour, drugs and family
breakdown were the scourge of our community of Salford and Eccles 15
years ago. It was incredibly difficult to attract business and
investment to the city because of the huge amount of crime that was
going on. People did not feel that the police were in control of the
neighbourhoods; they felt that the criminal gangs were in control of
the neighbourhoods in my city. That caused massive unemployment and a
huge amount of family disintegration. Some 15 years ago my city was in
a terrible state, but the fact that we have a grip of crime is the most
fundamental reason why it has become a much better place to live. It is
why we have been able to attract investment, such as the
MediaCityUK—home 
<?notus-xml column=906?>to the BBC and ITV—and the regeneration programmes we have seen
happen. It is one of the reasons why we had, until recently, the
fastest falling level of youth unemployment in the whole north-west and
why we get £200 million from visitors to Salford—who
would ever have thought that it would be a tourist destination, with
people wanting to come to our city? It is also why we have more people
employed in the MediaCityUK area than we had when it was at its height
as a docks.</hs_Para>

are amazing transformations. Probably the single biggest issue was
getting a grip of crime, making people feel safe in their homes, and
tackling drugs and some of the serious and organised crime gangs that
we had in Salford. We have been incredibly successful. Yes, the figures
over the past three years have continued to be good on some of those
crimes, but they are not as good as they were on burglary—we saw

saw a worrying statistic from Greater Manchester police this week which
showed that antisocial behaviour has started to creep back up.
Antisocial behaviour, before it was even defined by the previous Labour
Government, was sometimes dismissed as petty or low-level
crime—the sort of crime that we almost have to accept if we live
in an inner-city environment. We had a massive drive to tackle
antisocial behaviour, with a whole new set of powers and the Respect
campaign. We said that we wanted to be on the side of decent people in
communities and to drive out the antisocial behaviour that made
people’s lives such a misery. There was long-term harassment and
really serious crime, which could not be dismissed as low-level
incidents.</hs_Para>

warning bells ring for me when I see a statistic that shows that that
sort of crime is now beginning to break through again. I look at some
of the evidence around the statistics, the veracity of which people are
beginning to question. Lord Stevens has said that we could be on a
tipping point for another rise in crime. If we start to see crime rise
again in places such as Salford and Eccles, all of that good work over
the past 10 to 15 years will be at risk. The business

is tight, and that means that hard decisions must be made. I would have
supported a 12% cut, not a 20% cut, but we could argue that for the
whole afternoon. There were things we could have done through
collaboration and better procurement. Those were all on our agenda for
making those cuts. In hard times, we have to use creativity, innovation
and imagination. I am afraid that I am not seeing enough of that in the

and had a system whereby all that public money, whether it was for
policing, regeneration or whatever, was in the same pot. We thought
that that was the way to survive these years of austerity without

Minister will know about Operation Gulf in Salford, which has been
going on for three years. It tackles the serious crime
gangs—there are at least 32 of them—and it has had
amazing success. It has won the Home Office national award for an
operation over the past two years. Much to my delight it has put some
serious criminals behind bars for a good number of years, and it has
done that because it has used smart policing, imagination and
creativity. It has taken the Al Capone approach: if we cannot get the
criminals on the particular crime we want them for, we can get them on
money laundering, employing illegal immigrants and not having tax on
their cars. The police can be in their face every single day of the
week, and that is the way we get results. They have been able to do
that because they have had co-operation from Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs, the local authority, the Department for Work and
Pensions, the mental health services and every other bit of the system.
That is the kind of creativity that is required now and over the next

earlier. When we introduced neighbourhood policing, there was extra

Yes, we need response policing, because we need to have someone in a
vehicle who can go and sort out a particular incident, but the way that
they hand over the incident to the neighbourhood team is a misuse of
resources. Getting the response police officers to own the

State for Communities and Local Government, is that five years ago I
said to the then Cabinet Secretary, Gus O’Donnell, that I was
amazed that the success of a Cabinet Minister is judged by how big
their budget is, how big their legislation is, and how big a beast they
are in the Cabinet jungle. The new world requires people to be
collaborative. Why do not several Cabinet Ministers have jointly shared
budgets? Why are they not incentivised to collaborate? Why are they not
judged on their success in terms of their ability to do teamwork? Why
do we still have so many silos in central Government? When we said to
local government, “You’ve got to break down your
silos”, people there stepped up to the plate. It is about time
that we changed 
<?notus-xml column=909?>the way in which national Government works so that my success as, say,
Education Secretary is dependent on another Minister’s success
as Justice Secretary or Home Secretary.</hs_Para>

the end of the day, the people who use the public services the most are
all from the same families. We know this from the troubled families
project, which is making a difference but is still primarily run by one
Department. Why do we not have joint commissioning of the services we
need to be able to deal with all those families? I could tell Members
here and now the top 20 or 30 families in Salford and Eccles
who use public services disproportionately, whether it be the police,
education or the national health service. That is why we need joint
commissioning systems, incentives to collaborate, and, I hope, an end
to the days of stand-off bilaterals between Cabinet Ministers who
simply seek to protect their own empire and their own Department rather
than being prepared to collaborate for the greater
good<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:16:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000801" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0002.htm#140212159000801">My
final point is about reform. I am never short of ideas about reform and
I like to talk about it. I remember that somebody once said that we are
at our best when we are at our boldest, and I have never forgotten
that. I make this plea to the Minister and to all Ministers involved in
public services. If they want to get the best out of people and to get
innovation and change, and if they want to get more for less, they have
to be prepared to empower the people at the front line—the
people in the service—to be able to make that change. There is a
culture in Government—I do not make any allegation in respect of
any individual Minister—of keeping power at the centre despite
fine words about localism. It is about time that central Government
acted in a way where they modelled good behaviour, as any good leader
is required to do. If we want to survive these next few years, the
funds are inevitably going to be less, whichever Government are in
power, and therefore central Government must take a lead in being
innovative, creative, collaborative and independent, just as on the
board of any company where the directors would be collaborating
together for the greater good. I urge the Minister to take that message
back to the Home Secretary, and perhaps he could be the champion of
innovation and change at the
centre<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:17:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/6324333830F3B721E2910AF134D6B48763DCA119" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2014">Wednesday

because my job is to stand up for my constituents and for my police

another outstanding chief constable, Debbie Simpson. They have both
galvanised Dorset police. They have collaborated and they have saved:
they have done everything they could in the years before this spending

am grateful to our new police and crime commissioner, Martyn Underhill,

fair that I praise the brave men and women of Dorset police; everyone
who has spoken has done likewise. We cannot overestimate the courage
that these men and women continually show to keep us safe on the
streets and at home. While we are all tucked up in bed, many of them
are out patrolling the streets at night and tackling some pretty
ferocious people while armed with not much more than a protective
jacket and occasionally with a Taser if
needed.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:19:31"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000805" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000805">The
comprehensive spending review indicated or demanded savings of 20%. As
we have heard, savings across all forces in 2014-15 will be 3.3%. For
Dorset, that means a loss of £3.1 million. As has also been
mentioned, taking into account the top-slicing in such areas as the
police innovation fund and the Independent Police Complaints
Commission, Dorset must make savings of 4.8%, which equates to well
over £4 million. The point for the Minister is that that will
once again place Dorset at the bottom of the pile. I simply cannot
repeat it enough. I shall say it again—at the bottom of the
pile<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:20:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000806" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000806">Last
year, the formula funding per head in Dorset was the lowest in the
land. The needs-based funding formula for policing, which is supposed
to determine how much each area receives, has never been properly
implemented. Since 2010, Dorset police has been short-changed to the
tune of £11 million. In real terms, the figure is a lot more.
Last year, Dorset lost more officers and staff in proportion to other
forces across the country—a full 6%. During the entire period of
the CSR, Dorset will have lost 400

I mention or hear the dreadful word “damping”, I cannot
help thinking of that awful thing that creeps up from the floor, ruins
the walls and costs people a fortune in redecorating their house, but
that is the technical jargon. Under damping, each force faces the same
reduction in core Government funding in 2014-15, which will exacerbate
the inequities that already exist in
Dorset.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000808" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000808">Let<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:22:20"></hs_TimeCode>
me say to the Minister—if he will stop talking to his
Whips—that this situation in Dorset simply cannot go on for
ever. Because of its size, topography and population centres, Dorset
faces unique police challenges. The county is almost evenly split, with
one half living in a large conurbation, and the other half scattered
across rural communities. The two halves require substantially
different forms of policing. In addition, we have tourism and the
night-time economy. I know that many other constituencies have them
too, but I am proud to say that Dorset is one of the most beautiful
counties in the country. We attract 14 million tourists every year. The
thriving night-time economy has grown, as it has in so many other parts
of the country, and it requires a significant police presence all year
round. One would have thought that those two aspects would be included
in a common-sense funding formula, but they are

I have spoken—often off the record—to the police wearing

down, which I of course welcome, the reality away from this
place—we are sitting very comfortably on green Benches—is
that brave men and women are out there at 3 o’clock in the
morning facing the thousands of people, who are often out of control

would require two or three officers to go back to the cells, and they
simply cannot afford to reduce their numbers on the ground. The logical
conclusion is that a situation must get very bad before the police will
physically intervene, because they do not have the numbers to deal with
it. That is not their fault; in such situations, they simply do not

tax can no longer be increased to pay for grant shortfalls. The recent
changes by the Department for Communities and Local Government capped
increases at 2%. Due to the shortfall in moneys from central
Government, Dorset police has set its precept at 1.96% for 2014-15.
Surveys of the public show that they generally support that. Mr
Underhill and the chief constable are trying to maintain a balance
between sustaining a viable police force and not overburdening the
taxpayer. The rise will cover essential expenditure, including on
16 extra police officers, seven rural community vehicles,
300 body-worn cameras and a campaign to make people more aware of

everyone in this House recognises the value of technology, I have some
advice for the Minister. I have many friends in the armed services who
went to Iraq. There was a huge reliance on the technology that we and
the Americans had, but there was no intelligence from people on the
ground or “human 
<?notus-xml column=912?>int.”, as it is called. The result is there for all to see. The

consequences of invading a country such as
Iraq.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000817" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000817">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:27:17"></hs_TimeCode>
am sure that there is no intention to invade Dorset, but I draw the
comparison because human int. is the key to a successful police force
and, more importantly, to tackling crime. Nothing beats seeing police
officers on the ground in our constituencies. It happens too rarely,
but through no fault of the officers. In the Army, we patrolled around
Northern Ireland in groups of 12, day and night. Like police officers,
my soldiers brought back valuable information about what they had seen
or heard and about what the local hoods were doing, who they were with,
what pubs they were visiting and whether they were happy or sad. Such
information is crucial in everyday
policing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000818" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000818">Unlike<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T16:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>

police have a provisional finance settlement only for 2014-15. We
thought that that would be the last year of savings. I am concerned
that they are now likely to continue until 2017-18. It is estimated
that Dorset will have to make savings of 3.7% in 2015-16 and 3.5% in
each of the following two years, so annual funding will fall from

has been expected to do more with less. Dorset residents pay the same

with the phrase “value for money”, but if that comes at
the cost of losing what I and my constituents want, which is to see
police officers on the beat doing the job we want them to do, perhaps
value for money should be looked at in a different way. Finally, I ask

bring key issues of national significance to the attention of the
Minister. The National Crime Agency, under the management of Keith
Bristow, is a very important development that we support, and I am glad
that the House supports it too. What concerns me gravely is that it is
being prevented from having operational power in Northern Ireland,
because insufficient pressure has been applied by the Minister, or by
his team, on the Northern Ireland Executive to sort this matter out.
While there is a significant willingness by Unionist parties and the
Alliance party to sort it out, they are being checkmated by the
nationalist and republican agenda—indeed, it is those people who
benefit from the fact that the NCA is not operational in Northern
Ireland. They benefit because some of the people they previously ran
with—serious and organised criminals—have a free run as
the NCA has not been extended to Northern Ireland. Smuggling,
prostitution, cross-border crime are not being ignored, but they are
not being given the complete, full and proper attention that the NCA
could give.</hs_Para>

our policing budget is being stretched, because our own police officers

Northern Ireland has met him. He has indicated his 
<?notus-xml column=914?>willingness to be held to account by the current policing infrastructure
in Northern Ireland, so that he can give certainty and transparency to
the concerns—some legitimate, many fictitious—that some
nationalists have raised. It is important that we put that willingness
to be held to account on the record. If the NCA continues to be blocked
from operating in Northern Ireland, I echo the words of the Northern
Ireland First Minister when he spoke to the Select Committee on
Northern Ireland Affairs when it met in Northern Ireland. He said that
this House should take the matter by the throat and insist that the NCA
is put in place, over the head of the Assembly if necessary. Everyone

Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy) might have a bit of a giggle
at that, but it is an important issue that affects criminality and how
criminals operate in this country. He should know better. A so-called

National Crime Agency is a national issue, and the big issues of
criminality that affect Northern Ireland have implications here. Of the
drugs that circulate around Manchester and Liverpool, most of the
cannabis is grown in Northern Ireland. Last year, 42 cannabis farms
were discovered in Northern Ireland. Most of the trade was not in
cannabis dealing or for smoking the drug in Northern Ireland: cannabis
was brought to Liverpool on ferries and boats to be used in this part
of the country. Hon. Members should wake up to that reality. The
National Crime Agency is not operating as effectively as it should be
operating in my part of the kingdom, so the hon. Gentleman and his
constituents will face problems. He should recognise that. I am angry
about that point, and it probably shows. It is just as well that I am

I can tell the hon. Gentleman
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000837" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000837">Fuel
smuggling is another important issue that is cross-border and
cross-jurisdictional. Because of fuel smuggling in Northern Ireland,
Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the Exchequer here lose
£600 million a year. That is not a paltry sum. It is enough to
run most of the hospitals in Northern Ireland. That is another national
issue that is dealt with by HMRC and should also be dealt with by the
National Crime Agency.</hs_Para>

on how we pay to deal with national crime. There are 43 police services
operational in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Only the
Police Service of Northern Ireland picks up the tab for national
security policing in its jurisdiction. That is wrong. That tab should
be picked up nationally, in the same way that it is picked up for
Manchester and Liverpool, here in London and in Scotland. The fact that
it is not is putting policing in Northern Ireland at a significant
disadvantage. This year, we are running a deficit of
£30 million in policing, and next year that will
increase to £57 million. In the next spending round, the figure
will rise to about £200
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000839" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000839">I
urge the Minister, when he goes back and speaks to his
Cabinet colleagues—the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
the Home Secretary and the Prime Minister—to make the case that
this issue should be brought into the centre. Expenditure on dealing
with national crime issues and terrorism should be paid for centrally,
not locally. If we could get that budget paid for centrally, the
current budget for Northern Ireland would allow us to employ the
additional police officers that we
need.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212159000840" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212159000840">The
Police Federation in Northern Ireland says that we are short of 1,000
officers. The Chief Constable says that he would like to run a
competition to get another 300 to 500 officers, so we need to recruit a
number of officers that is somewhere in the middle of the two 
<?notus-xml column=916?>figures. The only way we can achieve that is by addressing the deficit
in our budget. None of the other 42 police services operational here is
asked to pay for national security. Why are the police in Northern
Ireland asked to pay for national security? We are not only dealing
with Irish-based terrorism but with national criminality—and
with Islamic terrorist activity as well. We pick that tab up too, and
that is wrong.</hs_Para>

heard Labour’s commitment to neighbourhood policing, but we
tried it in Humberside, and we have now moved to area-based policing,
which has been very effective. It contains elements of neighbourhood

issue of great concern—there were issues with street corners and
public places—but in my experience it has 
<?notus-xml column=918?>now abated. Nevertheless, I do not believe the crime figures as they are
presented, not least because a lot of crime still goes unreported. In
addition, there are many crimes that years ago would have been
reported, but are not now. I had my car broken into five times in
18 months, but I did not report each crime, as would have
happened perhaps 10 or 15 years ago.

authorities can have an impact on local policing. We have seen an
excellent example of that in north Lincolnshire under the leadership of
Liz Redfern, who took over the council from Labour in 2011.
[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “Hear, hear!”]
Absolutely. She pledged to use local council funding to provide
additional police community support officers in rural areas so that
Humberside police could get on with policing in the urban areas, where
the crime statistics showed such policing was necessary. We provided
those additional PCSOs through local grants to the police, and only a
few weeks ago, I welcomed the new PCSOs, Michelle Thorley and Dan
Dreggs, who work out of Epworth and cover the whole of the isle of
Axholme. They are doing a great job, funded by the local
council.</hs_Para>

the massive cuts to local authorities we have heard about, the local
council has also provided CCTV funding, and a new CCTV system is now
coming into place in Epworth. Moreover, they, along with East Riding of
Yorkshire council, have a sharing arrangement with Humberside police
for fuel and vehicles, which is to be welcomed, while our police and
crime commissioner, Matthew Grove, and his deputy, Paul Robinson, are
working on a strategy for sharing buildings, which sometimes involves
moving police stations into shared buildings. We must be careful to
ensure a continuous presence—we do not want the services
diminished—but in fact there is an increasing police presence,
and in a couple of weeks a new station will open in my
constituency.</hs_Para>

pressure on budgets has led to those developments, which we need to see
more of, so I ask the Minister to ensure that funding for local
authorities takes account of such innovative practices and working. In
my area, Humberside police have received £1 million from the
innovation fund to give police officers and PCSOs tablet devices so
that they can get out on the front line and be more visible and do
their work there, which is to be welcomed. We need funding to support
those kinds of measures.</hs_Para>

for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson), my near neighbour,
completed a few years ago. I have found that incredibly useful. The
weekend before last, I did two night shifts with an instant response
team based in Clough road police station in Hull, which covers the
eastern part of the city. It was an interesting experience. I have done
a number of nights in Grimsby, which was also very interesting, as well
as joining public order and traffic patrols in my area. I have been
struck by how dedicated staff are, but I have also been struck by how
under attack some of them feel. They feel the pressure of reduced
resources, as well as changes to terms and conditions and to pensions.
I have been very defensive on those, particularly on pensions, on which
I have had some robust discussions with police officers.</hs_Para>

be careful. We have protection for NHS and school funding. I
hope that, in further reductions, we will look closely at
policing. In the latest round there has been protection, but we need to
move on that. I get a sense from local officers that they are at a
point where they can hold the line at the moment,

have also been struck by how much of the police work is not actually
police work, as has been mentioned. They seem to be massively involved
in social work, and in dealing with family disorder and breakdown,
alcohol misuse, drug misuse and serious mental health issues. A lot of
police officers said to me that they would love to be able to spend
their time fighting crime, but they are spending far too much time
picking up failings in other services. That must be factored in when we
look at the

police service does a fantastic job but I think reform was needed. In
my 10 years as a local councillor in Hull, I remember that lots of
money was showered on policing locally. Our police precept went up by
500 per cent in the 13 years of the last Government,
and a lot of buildings were built that were not open to the
public. A lot of money was thrown at initiatives that were not
necessarily well thought through or assessed for their effectiveness.
It was a question of “There is a problem. Let us throw some
money at it and hope it works.” In lots of cases, it did not
work. There was a huge waste of money and we are still dealing with the
legacy of some of those issues, including the buildings that were built
as part of Humberside police authority’s massive expansion

I will try to respond to some, although inevitably not all, of the
points made in what has been a very lively and positive debate. I
understand that there are concerns about reductions in funding but we
are confident that they are challenging but manageable. What we see
around the country in the constituencies of many hon. Members is that
the police are not just making the necessary savings, but are
transforming the way in which they provide the service to the public.
In doing so, the measure is whether crime continues to fall—and
crime does continue to fall.</hs_Para>

for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) who speaks for the Labour
party. Although he spoke for more than 30 minutes, essentially to
attack Government cuts, he could not answer whether a Labour Government
would reverse any of those cuts. Let me clarify for him that what the
Home Secretary and I have said, along with everybody else, is that our
only target for the police is to cut crime. We have removed the
plethora of detailed targets that the previous Government set the
police, which got in the way of cutting crime, and said that cutting
crime is the only thing the police need to do.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman tried to separate that from crime prevention. Preventing
crime contributes to cutting crime and of course that is the most

which he and the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T17:00:15"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears) emphasised. One
of the things about effective neighbourhood policing—to which I
am as committed as anyone—is that it leads to a cut in crime.
Effective policing on the ground means that things are spotted earlier.
The net effect is that the crime figures continue to come down, so we
urge all police forces to do that.</hs_Para>

number of hon. Members talked about technology. I am glad that the
House has welcomed our emphasis on innovation and technology. The whole
point about technology is to release police officers to be on the beat
and on the streets more often than they are now. That feeds into crime
prevention, neighbourhood policing and all the other desirable things
we want in policing. If we use modern, digital technology better, we
will have more effective and visible police officers. That is at the

first round of the police innovation fund was hugely successful and the
second round will be two and a half times the size of the first. Police
forces up and down the country, along with their police and crime
commissioners, are using the fund to drive the use of technology, which
will make policing even more effective in the future. I am confident
that both the PCCs and the forces will be able to continue to deliver
those efficiencies while providing the excellent service that the
public deserve. I commend the motion to the House.</hs_Para>

coalition Government have been working determinedly to restore the
public finances, which were left in such disarray by the last Labour
Government. It has been complicated and difficult work, and difficult
decisions have had to be made. It is in the context of our responsible,
long-term economic plan that we have been consulting on the local
government finance settlement for 2014-15. Our proposals are fair and
balanced, and provide an effective basis for all local authorities to
transform local services and promote efficiency. Following a wide range
of representations and meetings, we confirmed last week that the
settlement would remain almost entirely as announced in December. This
is effectively the second year of a two-year settlement, which gives
councils a new level of self-determination so that they can take

years of doffing their caps to central Government and talking down

the challenge of delivering more for less, but local government

current year, it will spend £117 billion, which is £3
billion more than last year. That makes the local government bill
bigger than that of the NHS and double the defence budget. It is

has been lowered so that more councils can apply, which will be of
particular benefit to the unitary and county authorities. We estimate
that that could be worth an extra £15 million to those councils,
and we will be paying 100% above the threshold as opposed to the
previous 85%. For the longer term, I am committed, along with my
colleagues across Whitehall, to undertake a review of the Bellwin

already heard examples of councils that are doing really good work in
transforming the way in which they deliver services and work together.

councils facing the largest spending reductions, many of which were in
that position because they were abandoned by Labour’s reduction

transitional grant. I must declare my interest, as Great Yarmouth is
one of the authorities that Labour left stranded. Authorities receiving
the grant are protected by our safety net, which is bigger and stronger
than last year. Despite some areas choosing to play politics with
this—I am disappointed that Labour-run Great Yarmouth borough
council refuses to follow the lead of other councils, sometimes even
cross-party—councils such as Hastings and Pendle are doing some
really good work on transforming things. Areas such as High Peak and
Staffordshire Moorlands are working cross-party to share management and
show the way to savings of about 18%. They are showing the way forward,
and I hope that others will follow. Those in receipt of funding are
making progress with their efficiencies, with many going a long way
towards that, including many Labour-led areas. There is, however, more

fallen by an average of 10% in real terms. The total freeze funding up

Minister is like an abstract artist—the picture that he has
painted today is clearly a departure from reality. Nobody believes his
figures. He has claimed that the cuts are modest. He says that they can
all be dealt with through efficiencies and that there will be no impact
on front-line services. He should tell that to the elderly people who
have had their home care withdrawn. He should tell it to the parents of
children with special needs who cannot get the help that they need. He
should tell it to the shift workers in my constituency who have to walk
home at night in darkness because the streetlights are not on. He
should tell it to the young people whose bus to school, college or work
no longer runs. He should tell it to the Tory council leaders who were
so appalled at the lack of understanding of the impact of the cuts
among Ministers in his Department that they wrote to the Prime Minister
to complain about the posturing. He should tell it to the council
leaders in the poorest areas of our country who face the cruellest,
deepest cuts of

real picture is stark. The LGA says that over this Parliament, local
government core funding will fall by 40% and councils will have to make
£20 billion of savings. As hon. Members have pointed out, all
councils face challenges, but the fundamentally unfair distribution of
the cuts is particularly damaging to many communities. Even under the
Government’s spending power measure, which is deliberately
designed to mask the real impact, the 10 most deprived areas have had a
cumulative cut that is 10 times more than the 10 least deprived

Minister says that the change to spending power is a shift in
Government policy to reduce dependence. He uses that term about the
begging bowl that, frankly, I find offensive. He says that this is
about reducing dependence on central Government and freeing councils to
encourage local growth. If that is true, we have to ask why it has
taken so long for this Government to make a U-turn on business rates,
which have risen by £2,000 since May 2010. Why will
they not join this side of the House and go further by cutting rates
for 1.5 million small and medium businesses? We agree, of course, that
councils should not simply be a post-box for the Treasury, and schemes
such as the local authority business growth incentive were introduced
by the last Labour Government. We will look to reform any so-called
incentivisation so that the system works fairly for all areas of the

shadow Minister could have come to the House, in a statesmanlike way,
and acknowledged that there was a serious crisis in the public finances
that the previous Government made a considerable contribution to
creating; that the Government faced a difficult task; that the
four-block formula was widely discredited; that for 13 years under
Labour council tax spiralled in areas such as mine, more than doubling
and creating hardship for those on low wages and the elderly; and that
for 13 years MPs for rural areas tried to persuade Ministers
that the four-block formula did not capture need properly. Like most
people, he knows it does not capture need or deal with the
heterogeneous nature of rural deprivation, but rather discriminates
against rural poverty and is fundamentally flawed. Instead, all we
heard was that the system he would employ would be fairer—well,
without the detail, nobody will believe that.</hs_Para>

in Devon, the lowest output per capita in the south-west and
the highest unemployment in the south-west. There are really deprived
areas in these rural areas. For 13 years, Members on this

certain difficulties that he acknowledged—although he did not

spiralled in rural areas: it is £86 per head higher than the
average, yet they get £145 per head less in grant funding. Those
of us who represent these areas, including, I believe, those on the
Opposition Benches, feel that that is an inequity. What would he do

Government are not doing enough about it. It is not enough to say that
£11 million, with the extra £2 million that he has found
today down the back of the sofa, corrects the anomaly that small rural

urge my hon. Friend the Minister to look again at the issue of rural
sparsity and fairness to rural areas. The issue seems to be widely
acknowledged and what has been done so far is not sufficient. One of
the most frustrating factors that those of us on the Government Benches
have experienced in meeting the Secretary of State—he has been
very good with his time, as has my hon. Friend the Minister—is
that every time we present a case, we are told that the figures are not
what we say they are. Yet there seems to be no agreed common ground as
to what those figures are so that we can both talk on the same level
and on the same playing field. I urge my hon. Friend to sit down with
the campaign that is growing in momentum and force on this side of the
House—I hope that he acknowledges that—and see whether we
can agree common terminology and common ground as to what these figures
mean, so that we can achieve fairness in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T18:21:38"></hs_TimeCode>. I
respectfully suggest to the Government that that is something to which

Friend the Minister will consider that. The changes that have been
announced recently are very welcome but they do not go far enough,
particularly for large counties, such as Devon and Cornwall, that have
huge road networks, many of which have a backlog of repairs that is
being made massively worse by the current spate of bad weather. We are
facing huge backlogs of repair and maintenance. The current formula
does not go far enough to address those problems. The Prime Minister

conclusion, I urge my hon. Friend the Minister to heed this point; the
problem relating to the anomaly of small rural councils and county
councils—shire councils—will not go away. Torridge and
West Devon are facing an existential threat from the cuts that they
have faced. In West Devon and in Torridge they have cut, cut and cut
again. The have gone far beyond the 40 ways that were announced some

Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> I want to
address three fundamental unfairnesses in the settlement. The first is
the lateness with which the Government made their decisions. Reference
has already been made to the threshold for council tax increases. It is
simply not fair for local councils to find that out when many of them
had already come to their budgetary decisions. The <I>Local Government
Chronicle</I> has just done a survey of 160 local council finance
officers, 14% of whom admitted that they were basically scrambling
around making changes to their budgets at the last minute in an attempt
to anticipate what the threshold would be. Local authorities have a
difficult job anyway, without the Government making it unnecessarily
more difficult in that way.</hs_Para>

let us look at the cuts that local government is once again facing
compared with the rest of government. Around 20% of the grant to local
authorities will be cut in this settlement and next year’s. That
is far bigger than the cut to other Departments. Even by the
Government’s own figures for spending power, the cut over those
two years, excluding the ring-fenced grants for public health and the
better care fund, is around 10%. Again, that is much bigger than for
other Departments. The Local Government Association has calculated the
real-terms cuts in Government support to local authorities over the
course of this Parliament at 40%—more than twice that for other
Departments. Are the services that people receive from their
councils—road sweeping, refuse collection, public health,
checking food hygiene, local leisure centres and parks—really
less important than the services provided by all other Departments? I
do not believe they are, but if they are in the Government’s
mind, they have to justify that as the basis for extra cuts for local
authorities.</hs_Para>

us look at the distribution of unfairness among local councils. We
heard an interesting analysis earlier from a number of my hon. Friends
who asked the Minister questions. Essentially it boiled down to this.
Councils with the highest grant have had the highest cuts; those
councils had a higher grant because they had higher needs; therefore,
councils with the highest needs have had the highest cuts. That is the

the Minister appeared before the Select Committee on Communities and
Local Government, he admitted a fundamental change of Government
policy, away from a needs-based system. The only needs taken into
account are those reflected in the baseline of business rates, which
started with the new arrangement in 2013-14. The new
term—the settlement funding agreement—is really composed
of two parts: the business rate base and the revenue support grant. As
the business rate base is held constant or increases with inflation
each year, the totality of cuts that the Government make falls on the
revenue support grant element of the settlement funding agreement.
Within the revenue support grant is something called the council tax
resource equalisation adjustment. That has been cut by 25% this year,
yet it is the mechanism by which extra resources are given to the
poorest areas with the most deprivation. Those areas have had the
biggest cuts, with resources transferred away from them. That is how
the mechanism works in practice.</hs_Para>

funding—on the basis, therefore, of the grant that authorities
already have—and then 
<?notus-xml column=948?>transferred to authorities according to the homes they are building. The
Minister might say that that is an incentive to build homes—that
is not what the Housing Minister said last time he was asked—but
in the end, that money comes from a top-slice of grant, which means
that those authorities with the greatest need and the greatest amount

2015-16, if we exclude the ring-fenced public health and better care
fund grants that can be spent only on what they are allocated for, the
spending power of Sheffield will be the same as that of Wokingham. That
is impossible to justify according to anybody’s definition of

Newcastle will have less in two years. That is simply

plan ahead and let us consider involving the LGA in the process of
distributing grant. I want to go further than that. I want a
fundamental review of local government finance based on three
principles. First, we should give more powers and responsibilities to
local authorities, building on community budgets and city deals and
going further than they do. Secondly, let us consider giving councils
more fiscal autonomy, as the Select Committee is in the context of
fiscal devolution to cities. We can then see whether we can reach some
agreement to enable councils to raise more of their own resources.
Finally and fundamentally, when the Government distribute money to
councils they must do it in a fair way that reflects needs and
deprivation. That is the element that the Government have forgotten in
this

Nick Harvey</B> (North Devon) (LD):</Member> Last November, I joined 30
colleagues on the Floor of this House to present petitions calling on
the Government to close the gap in local government funding between
rural and urban areas by a mere 10% by 2020. The petitions 
<?notus-xml column=949?>included 1,700 signatures from my constituency. In my view, that was a
modest ask and I believe that we should look to the Government to do at
least that and more in brisk order.</hs_Para>

recognise the problems faced by the Department for Communities and
Local Government in the era of austerity, the need to eliminate the
deficit and, of course, the debt repayments that will follow even when
the deficit has been eliminated, but I believe that local government is
taking too much of the burden—more than other
Departments—and that, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T18:33:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
learned Member for Torridge and West Devon (Mr Cox) said a
few moments ago, some local authorities are now facing such
difficulties that their viability is in

is vital that the Government should face up to the crisis towards which
we are heading at great speed. Fundamentally, my complaint is as
follows: why should some of the poorest people in the country, on the
lowest wages, pay far more in council tax and receive far less grant
from central Government while at the same time local services erode
around them? That is what is happening in Devon and it is certainly
what is happening in my constituency. The district council grant has
been halved since 2010 and the total budget has been cut by a third
over that time. This year alone, the Government have sliced the grant
to the district council by 13.4%.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T18:34:30"></hs_TimeCode>wider picture,
the situation is frankly no better for Devon county council. By next
year, it will have seen a 60% cut in Government grant during the
lifetime of this Parliament. Our schools and our health system are
underfunded and, as other Members have said, the current system is
quite simply
broken<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T18:34:47"></hs_TimeCode>. Rural
residents pay council tax that is on average £86 a head higher
than urban residents. They receive £145 less in Government grant
than their urban counterparts, and this is a funding gap as wide as
50%.</hs_Para>

is welcome that the Government recognise the principle of there being a
problem, and that they have put in place this emergency grant for a
second year running, but I am sorry to say that even at the enhanced
level that has been announced for the grant today, it closes that gap
by only £1.04 a head, and at this rate it will take us 86 years
to put right the gap in council tax payments, and 145 years to put
right the gap in Government grant. This is simply not an adequate
response to the scale of the problem that is faced in many rural
communities throughout the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T18:35:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212173000714" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0003.htm#140212173000714">The
Government make much of the spending power measure and bandy that
about. That is a flawed measure. It looks at the current council tax
revenues and believes that it is acceptable for some areas to pay much
higher council tax and sees no reason why that should not continue in
perpetuity. It also obscures the scale and impact of reductions in
funding and the challenges that councils now face. For example, under
the spending power measure, Devon county council has lost only 1.5% as
against a national average of 2.9% in the latest settlement. But that
obscures the fact that it has lost 9% in revenue support
grant and, as I said, the district in my area has lost 13.4% in
Government grant. Similar figures can be seen throughout the

most directly will miraculously be focused solely upon the local

roads, but Devon county council is now consulting about a programme of
cuts that will end all its non-statutory obligations: ending the
subsidy on meals on wheels; closing its day centres; getting rid of all
its residential care homes; axing mobile libraries and the smaller
local libraries; and doing away with the youth service, except for
young offenders. This will cause absolute fury on the part of voters. I
do not think that it is acceptable. We have people moving into our area
who are aghast at the low level of public services that they find in
comparison with other parts of the country that they have come from.

by the abolition of the area-based grants in the first emergency
budget. The present process takes very little account of the special
circumstances of towns such as Blackpool, which are experiencing
pressures from incomers on services such as housing and social care. We
have also been hit extremely hard by the demographic double whammy of
the bedroom tax and cuts in council tax benefit, which others have

been six separate announcements from the Treasury and the Department

adversely on Blackpool’s central Government funding allocations

of equalisation in any formula—everyone does—but I say
seriously to the hon. Gentleman that he misses out the importance of
recognising that efficiency should be written into the formula. We are
in a binary resource-versus-needs equation at the moment in

the severest financial cuts are made on the poorest, that is grossly

is completely unacceptable that Liverpool, which on the

suffer drastic cuts in spending power this year and it will suffer them

5.4%—£32 million—which is the
equivalent of £148 a household. By contrast, Surrey Heath is
facing cuts of £73,000—a mere 0.1% cut. That is an
indication of where the Government’s priorities lie. In real
terms, Liverpool’s funding has been cut by 52% since 2010, and
the figure is likely to reach 58% by 2016-17. As 76% of
Liverpool’s finance for local services comes from central

devastating.</hs_Para>

nurseries, care for the under-fives, social care for the vulnerable,

Nothing that the Minister has said tonight can deviate from the reality
that the Government are hitting hardest the poorest areas of the
country. They describe the funding that they give as a handout, and
they are shameless in their intention to continue hammering the poorest
areas of the country. It is absolutely outrageous and absolutely
unacceptable. Of course, the cuts in local government support to
Liverpool are not the only blows being dealt to the city. For example,
the hated bedroom tax is already affecting more than 11,000 Liverpool
households, which are losing an average of £14 a week. That
combined with the additional council tax charges that the poorest
people are being required to pay means that a large number of people
are now being asked to pay £16 a week more. That might not sound
much to a millionaire or to people who are extremely
wealthy, but for a poor person in work struggling to survive on a low
wage and to maintain their family, this is an additional hammer blow,
which is unacceptable and disgraceful. One consequence is increasing
debt for vulnerable people, and that is something about
which the Government should be concerned. Instead, they seem
to have washed their hands of it and simply do not
care<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T18:58:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212173000744" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0004.htm#140212173000744">I
have described the current situation in Liverpool in relation to
previous revenue support grant settlements and to what is going to
happen in the coming two years. It is all credit to the city of
Liverpool, its elected council and elected mayor, that the city is
resilient. It is fighting hard to support jobs, back enterprise and
bring investment to the city. For example, the mayor has
already restored the cruise liner terminal. The council promotes
investment worth millions of pounds. It is about to host the
international festival for business on behalf of the United
Kingdom. It is delivering apprenticeships and it has protected people
from the impact of Government cuts. However, this settlement makes that
task harder; indeed it might even make it impossible. The people of
Liverpool know what is happening and who is to blame. Even at this late
hour, I ask the Government to think again about the unfair cuts they
are inflicting on the people of Liverpool and treat Liverpool citizens

spending power of both types of local authority in Devon is determined
by four key factors: the level of the revenue support grant; special
support, particularly efficiency support for sparse areas; business
rates; and council tax. The challenge with the revenue support grant,
as we have heard, is that it has been massively squeezed—by some
8.5%. Why are the Government doing that? I entirely understand that
they want to incentivise good behaviour, but Devon has been good. It
has collected 98% of its council tax and cut its reserves to the bone.

education funding table. It gets £480 per pupil less
than the average. I do not believe that is acceptable. To say that we
can clearly do with less because we get good results is simply not
true. It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T19:01:12"></hs_TimeCode> also

Government, and indeed previous Governments, have recognised that
unfairness. They said in 2012 that it is not right, but so far nothing

£8.5 million we had last year, because of damping it will give
us less than 90p a head. We need three times more than that.

funding will my local district council get? Last year it got

£86 more per head in council tax. That came about

crocodile tears. They put in place a system in which poorer people pay
higher levels of council tax, while their councils receive £145
less per head in central Government grant than those in urban areas,

sparsity. That was unjustifiable, but, sadly, it continues to be a

would like to make two important points about the settlement and
localism. First and foremost, as the Chair of the Communities and Local
Government Committee pointed out, the timing of the settlement has
presented serious challenges for many local authorities, including
Rochdale borough council. There has been considerable uncertainty and
there are also issues with the information that is coming from the
Treasury. There 
<?notus-xml column=961?>is no doubt that the Government need to inform local authorities earlier
about their financial prospects. I understand that there was confusion
because the Government left out vital information about small business
rate relief and education services grants, and that caused problems for
local authorities. It was not acceptable to spring the settlement them
for consultation 17 working days before Christmas. Local authorities
cannot be expected to cope with those sorts of messages from the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212173000773" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0004.htm#140212173000773">My
second point is about crisis loans and the social fund that used to be
administered by the Department for Work and Pensions. We now know that
the Government decided to devolve that responsibility—we could
call this localism—to local authorities so that they could
administer crisis loans, community care grants and support to
exceptionally vulnerable people. No one will be surprised to hear that
when the Government devolved that funding to local governments, they
cut it quite dramatically, and they now propose to cut it for the year
ahead. We know from the settlement in December that the Government are
cutting that funding to zero in 2015. It is good that the Government
are localising that responsibility because local authorities can better
understand people’s needs, but is appalling that they have
decided to cut to zero the funding for a safety net for the most
vulnerable people in our society. That is not the sort of localism that
the country wants or that people would expect.</hs_Para>

conclude with a few comments about the situation in Rochdale. It is
right to say that when compared with more affluent councils, Rochdale
has a relatively small council tax base and an equally small business
rate base. Rochdale council does excellent work and has big ambitions,
but the fact remains that Rochdale is reliant on the grant funding
provided by Government. Because of that, the council is
disproportionately affected by funding cuts of any size. The cumulative
cuts in funding of nearly 23% to Rochdale council since the election
put at risk all the work that the council is doing to help one of the
most deprived communities in the country. Where cuts are made, they
need to be fair. Those who can least afford to pay more, such as
Rochdale council, should not be targeted for the deepest cuts, as they
have been by this Government.</hs_Para>

rural areas, despite the fact that in rural areas such as Cornwall
people on average pay higher council tax, earn lower wages and have
higher housing costs as a proportion of their income. Local
authorities, whether in Cornwall, Torridge and West Devon or North
Devon, face difficulties in delivering services across rural and
sparsely populated areas.</hs_Para>

Government have recognised this. In the spending settlement for

available to increase the ability of rural authorities to meet those
challenging circumstances. What happened, however, was that three
quarters of that gain was damped so that the authorities losing
out—the urban authorities, pretty much—did not suffer a
sudden fall in funding. What we did not expect, and what nobody
expected at that point, was that the Government would suspend moving
the remaining three quarters of that gain until at least 2020, kicking
the argument into the long grass and further delaying a fair settlement

budget. Of course, Hull has traditionally relied on central Government
grants because our low property values mean we have a low council tax
base and we have high levels of need. I fundamentally object to what

From this unfair local authority funding cut, we have already seen
nearly 2,600 real jobs go in our local authority. I stress that those
are real jobs—care assistants, and early years workers and
support workers for troubled teenagers so that we do not end up having
to spend a lot more money down the road when those children grow up and

services. Lib Dems support the unfairness of the cuts to areas in the

the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) mentioned the discussions that have
taken place with the Local Government Association, but we should not
throw the baby out with the bathwater. The Government will be putting
authorities such as mine under the most intense pressure and, quite
frankly, the wheels will come off. They will not be able to deliver
services. This will result in children and older people in deprived
areas such as mine suffering worse services than their counterparts in
more affluent parts of the country. That seems to me to be a

grants are cut—even in the same proportion as in affluent

rebalancing of the economy that the Government are trumpeting, they are
ignoring the reality of people’s needs. It is Robin Hood in

asking for another £20 million a year for five years to reduce
the anomaly. What is £20 million out of £22 billion? By
my arithmetic, it is less than 10% of 1%, or 0.01%. That is all we need
to recognise and address the fact that local authorities in rural areas
are not treated fairly. We pay some £85 more in

Devon and the concessionary scheme cost the county council some

goalposts do get moved when we sit down and talk about local government
finance. I think Ministers accept that, which is why we put in place a

up to this Government to sort out the anomaly. I look forward to

remind Members again about the context, this Government have decided to
protect the national health service budget in real terms. This
Government have protected the schools budget in cash terms. This
Government have put huge amounts of money behind children who, like me,
were on free school meals. All of that money will benefit Salford,
Liverpool, Sheffield and other places. We have also taken the poorest
in society who are working out of the income tax threshold. We have
raised the national minimum wage. We have raised the apprentice wage.
We have raised the state pension. We have built more social houses than
the last Government, and this Government will be the first in
30 years to leave office with more affordable and social
housing in the housing stock. Together, we are building a stronger
economy and a fairer society, in which everyone can get on in

Williams:</Member></B> Many Members have contrasted the spending power
of cities with that of southern authorities. However, it is absolutely
clear that the spending power of authorities such as
Newcastle is far in excess of that of many other authorities with
similar responsibilities but entirely different demographics. It is
completely wrong to say that unfairness is built into the system, given
that the top 10% of the most deprived authorities in the country are
the authorities with the most power to spend on their
citizens<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212192000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0004.htm#140212192000053">As
has been acknowledged during the debate, we are moving to an entirely
new system of local government finance. I accept that there is more to
be done and that there is a need for reform in the system, but I am
sure that that reform will come when the economy has fully
recovered.</hs_Para>

has been made to the amounts that are raised through council tax, and
the Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my
hon. Friend the Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis), was
criticised for his “language of begging bowl”. As someone
who, when I was a council opposition leader in Bristol, went on
deputations to local government Ministers in both the other parties,
let me put it this way: local government had a supplicant relationship
with central Government, and that is what this Government are trying to
change. We are putting more incentives in the system for local
authorities to build more houses. The business rates retention will
encourage local economic growth: for the first time, local authorities
will retain more of the benefit from economic growth in their own 
<?notus-xml column=973?>areas rather than handing 100% of it to the people in the Treasury, so
that they can decide how much should be distributed around the country
according to their own formulas and principles.</hs_Para>

of the new incentives is the new homes bonus. I am sure that the
Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, my hon.
Friend the Member for Keighley (Kris Hopkins), will be pleased that his
authority in Bradford is to receive £2 million in new homes
bonus. Leeds will receive £3 million in new homes bonus, and my
city of Bristol will receive £2.2 million.</hs_Para>

other major criticism that we have heard today is that some parts of
the country have lost out at the expense of others, either as a result
of this settlement or over a long period. However, the settlement
represents a fair deal for every part of the country—north and
south, district and county, city and shire. As I said a few moments ago
to the Chairman of the Select Committee, councils have an average
spending power of £2,089 per household, and the average spending
power reduction will be just 2.9% in the forthcoming year. Moreover,
protection is built into the system for the most deprived areas of the
country, which are the most dependent on
grant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:08:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212192000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0004.htm#140212192000057">We
have also recognised that services are sometimes more difficult and
expensive to deliver in rural areas. Many Members, particularly those
on the Government Benches, recognised the real difficulty that rural
authorities experience in delivering services to their constituents. I
certainly recognise that poverty is found in all parts of the country.
It is not necessarily concentrated only in city-centre constituencies
such as mine; it is found in Barnstaple, in St Austell, and in many
other rural and sparsely populated parts of the country. That is why we
have already set aside £9.5 million—£1 million
more than last year—to help the authorities in the most sparsely
populated rural areas.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey)—there were
many Devonian speakers in the debate—for saying that we ought to
go a little further. In fact, today we have announced a significant
amount of extra money: £2 million. That means an extra
£44,000 for North Devon district council.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:09:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for St Austell and Newquay (Stephen Gilbert) said that the
average per authority was £30,000, but Cornwall’s unitary
authority will have just over half a million pounds extra.</hs_Para>

authorities need to protect taxpayers by keeping their council tax
down. For many of our constituents, the council tax bill represents a
huge part of their monthly outgoings. In many cases, it is much more
significant than other utility bills, so to denigrate the
Government’s policy of encouraging local authorities to freeze
council tax is to miss a major point of what the Opposition call the
cost of living crisis. If they do not recognise that council tax is
part of the cost of living pressure that all our constituents face,
they are living in another world.</hs_Para>

is no surprise to find that Labour Members live in another world. Under
the previous Government, council tax more than doubled, pushing a
typical bill up to £120 a month for hard-working
people and pensioners. This Government, however, have done everything
possible to protect families from further increases. Over the past
three years, council tax bills have been cut by 10% in real terms
across England, and we are encouraging 
<?notus-xml column=974?>local authorities to continue to freeze their council tax. We will
further incentivise them to do that not only by offering them a grant
but by putting that grant into the baseline so that can have certainty
for future years.</hs_Para>

the Member for Mid Dorset and North Poole (Annette Brooke) pointed
out—almost all the Liberal Democrat local authorities. They

referendum principle has been mentioned by many speakers today.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:11:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sheffield South East criticised the Government for taking time to
announce what the referendum threshold should be. We confirmed on 5
February that it will remain at 2%, which was the assumption
that the local authorities were working on when planning their budgets.
The hon. Gentleman was around during the last Parliament, and I must
gently remind him that the previous Government frequently capped local
authority council tax increases without announcing the cap until March,
after the local authorities had set their budgets and started to
prepare the bills to pop through people’s letter boxes. We have
certainly improved on that
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:12:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212192000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0004.htm#140212192000063">There
are many things that local authorities can do to balance their books in
an efficient way. The Government are encouraging such efficiencies, and
there is still plenty of scope. For instance, the Liberal Democrat
council in Kingston-upon-Thames is investing in a combined heat and
power system that will benefit its council buildings and private sector
buildings, saving money and carbon at the same time. Cambridge council
is protecting and enhancing local shops, which is good for local
residents, good for tourists and good for local economic growth. The
process is now being incentivised by the retention of business
rates<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:13:01"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:33:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Williams:</Member></B> I am not privy to every conversation that takes
place, as my hon. Friend knows. I can assure him, however, that
possibly the most powerful person in the Government with his hands on
the purse strings from our side of the coalition, the Chief Secretary
to the Treasury, is most certainly a friend of rural areas. He has
pushed for the freeze in fuel duty, which is another example of the
Government listening to the cries for help from rural communities.
There is a danger, in these debates, that we see matters purely in the
context of the silo of our own Department. I agree entirely with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:13:54"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Salford and Eccles (Hazel Blears)—the former
Secretary of State for this Department—that it is a mistake for
Governments to do that, and we have not done it. Across the piece, we
are doing our bit to help rural areas, including through freezing fuel
duty. Had Labour’s plans been put into effect, rural motoring
would have cost much more.</hs_Para>

is more that local government can do to hold down costs. An example can
be seen in the tri-borough 
<?notus-xml column=975?>initiative in west London, involving Hammersmith and Fulham, Kensington

Chelsea council told me recently that the initiative was on track to

conclusion, this coalition Government are all about building a stronger
economy and a fairer society in order to help people to get on in life
by giving them more power to decide what happens in their community and
supporting their local area in ways that will allow their community to
thrive and prosper. There is no doubt that some difficult decisions
have had to be made about public finances, and councils cannot be
exempted from that process. But councils have taken important steps
towards modernising and transforming their services, and I certainly
pay tribute, on behalf of all of my colleagues, to the efforts that
many councils have made to live within their difficult budgets. I also
think we must all acknowledge that more could be done to reduce the
costs of delivering their services while keeping council tax down, and
I have every confidence that they will rise to the
challenge.</hs_Para>

on repairs and maintenance four years ago; how travelling several miles
to work, worship and back can be considered sustainable; and how a

Bill’s supporters have repeatedly labelled homosexuality as
alien to Africa, and as yet another element of western cultural
imperialism, along with global brand fast-food restaurants, capitalism
and secularism. That is a wishful fantasy for the African homophobe.
Far from being esoteric or non-existent, the history of African
homosexuality is increasingly well documented. In pre-colonial Uganda
alone, same-sex relationships existed among the Bahima,
Banyoro and Baganda tribes. The Iteso and the Lango tribes sanctioned
men of alternative gender status, and the Lango even allowed mukodo

homophobia that is rife in Uganda—a hateful strand of

represent the worst of the repressive colonial inheritance,

with many of our posts across the world, our high commission in Kampala
works tirelessly to promote the universal values that are central to
British foreign policy: tolerance, respect, equality, fairness and
human rights. We believe that the case for tolerance and equality is
best made by local voices. Since the Bill was passed by the Ugandan
Parliament, we have worked with civil society to raise awareness of the
impact the Bill will have on human rights.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T20:54:36"></hs_TimeCode> high
commissioner in Kampala is supporting these groups to promote
inclusivity, diversity and tolerance, working in co-ordination with
international partners. We have provided support for training, advocacy
and legal cases relating to the protection of LGBT rights. The high
commission also supports the Kaleidoscope Trust, which my hon. Friend
rightly mentioned, and its specific project in Uganda to promote
strategic communications. My officials have also engaged extensively
with UK and Ugandan NGOs, including Stonewall, the Kaleidoscope Trust
and the Human Dignity Trust, to explain our
approach.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212192000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/debtext/140212-0004.htm#140212192000594">I
have listened carefully to calls in the debate to consider sanctions
against those promoting the Bill, but I cannot give the commitment that
my hon. Friend seeks to impose travel restrictions on those promoting
this legislation. I do not believe that imposing travel bans on

Uganda or indeed those rightly working to defend their rights. The

development programme to Uganda goes through a variety of channels,
including private sector organisations, NGOs and multilateral agencies.
My hon. Friend may not be aware but budget support to the Government of
Uganda was indefinitely suspended back in 2013, following allegations
of corruption in the Ugandan Government. A tiny proportion of the
UK’s development assistance is provided through financial aid to
the Government of Uganda—only 1.1% of the total DFID allocation.
That financial aid is specifically used to support public financial
management, to strengthen the Government’s systems for managing
fiduciary risk and for tackling corruption. There are very rigorous
mechanisms in place to ensure that British taxpayers’ money is
spent properly and for the purposes for which it was intended. I am
happy to write to my hon. Friend to provide more details and to put a

is the case for all the countries we work in, financial aid to the
Government of Uganda is predicated on fundamental commitments and

domestic accountability. Although the focus of this debate has been on

gently say to him that the sanctions sought in my speech were extremely
limited and focused on travel bans as the only active deterrent for
people supporting the Bill. He has not told us why he feels these bans
would cause the effect he alleges. It has only taken me this
afternoon to get more than 100 parliamentarians to agree to
support a letter to President Museveni along the lines of my speech. If
this matter were pressed, my hon. Friend might be in a significant

conclusion and the negative impact his request would have on those who
are LGBT in Uganda and those promoting their rights. Travel bans, if
they were to be part of an EU-wide sanctions package, would have to be
agreed at European Union level, and are normally done as part of a
wider sanctions package. He will also be aware that the Home Secretary
has the power to exclude an individual if she considers that his or her

your chairmanship, Sir Roger. Such is the strength of feeling about
rail services in the south-east of England that quite a number of
people have contacted me in advance of the debate. I have had
assistance from Passenger Focus and from a community magazine in my
constituency called <I>Dartford Living</I>, which has passed on the
concerns and frustrations of my constituents about train services in
the south-east. Good train services are not only desirable but vital to
keep the economy improving and ensure that commuters in the south-east
can access employment in London and the surrounding commutable areas. I
hope that colleagues will forgive me if I concentrate on rail issues
that affect Kent and my constituency. Of course, the debate covers the
entire south-east and many of the issues that I raise will apply
equally to the whole region.</hs_Para>

experience, people use trains not for the fun of it but because they
have to earn money to feed their families, pay their bills and keep the
country going. We are talking, therefore, about an essential service
that must work well. Good rail services are vital for the economic
strength of the nation. I am a commuter and I experience the challenges
and difficulties that my constituents face, which gives me some
understanding of the frustrations that people experience travelling
into and out of London.</hs_Para>

inevitable that in a debate about rail services in the south-east, I
will speak about Southeastern, the company that holds the franchise for
the services on which my constituents and I commute. I have some
observations and criticisms about the company, and I am frustrated by
its lack of innovation. Several train companies—including
Chiltern Railways, East Midlands Trains, Greater Anglia and at least
six others—provide wi-fi on their trains to enable commuters to
use portable internet devices, but Southeastern does not. I hope that
the company is considering changing that in the near future.</hs_Para>

of commuter routes, we usually think of peak services during rush hour,
but off-peak services are just as vital. When Southeastern proposed to
reduce the number of off-peak services that stopped at Longfield in my
constituency, local commuters rightly objected. I pay tribute to my
hon. Friend the Member for Gravesham (Mr Holloway), who worked hard to
persuade Southeastern not to cut off-peak services to Meopham and
Longfield stations.</hs_Para>

most frequent complaint that I hear from constituents about
Southeastern is that they want better communication from the company.
Good communication is vital to ensure that commuters are aware of
the options 
<?notus-xml column=264?>open to them when things go wrong on the railway. We all accept that
things can go wrong with any form of transport, and some of the
problems that my constituents face are the fault not of Southeastern
but of Network Rail, but it is incumbent on Southeastern and other rail
providers to communicate those problems to their passengers. We have
had numerous delays and cancellations as a result of poor weather, but
Southeastern’s website has claimed that services are running on
time. People have arrived at the station only to find that services
were disrupted. That practice needs to
stop.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000011">After
I secured the debate, I received a letter from Mike Gibson, the public
affairs manager of Southeastern. He is a good man, who came down to
Longfield to meet my constituents and hear their concerns about the
rail service. In his letter, he made the point that several incidents
that caused difficulties for commuters, such as a fire in October last
year at London Bridge station and problems at New Cross and Hither
Green, were completely out of Southeastern’s hands. I do not
dispute the fact that problems have been caused to rather than by
Southeastern, but that underlines the necessity for it to communicate
well with its customers, which all too often it fails to do.</hs_Para>

Southeastern will improve on its lack of smart card technology. The
Treasury has provided extra money for such technology, but no smart
card system has been forthcoming, despite many requests. Oyster cards
work well across London. Has Southeastern asked Transport for London to
extend their use into Kent? I doubt it. Even if not, we could have our
own system in Kent, preferably one that works with the Oyster card
system; we do not need TfL to take over Kent’s train stations in
order to have smart card technology. Despite the fact that the money
and the technology are available, that has not happened yet.</hs_Para>

company must meet the punctuality targets set out in its franchise, and
Southeastern is no exception. However, the company combines its
mainline punctuality figures with those for high-speed services, which
produces a distorted figure for people who travel only on mainline
services. We need complete transparency on punctuality figures, because
a perception exists that in the past, trains were sometimes cancelled
or stations were missed simply to ensure that those targets were met. I
have not been able to establish whether that is the case, but commuters
in my constituency generally hold that view. If that is true, it must
never happen again.</hs_Para>

Southeastern, it has worked hard to tackle some of the problems that we
have witnessed on our railway systems, such as crime. Its safer
stations scheme has been a success, and crime on the railway has
dropped. Southeastern staff are often very capable, but they have to
deal with flawed communication systems and challenges that are beyond
their control. Many other issues frustrate me about services into and
out of my constituency, including the lack of a fast service from
Dartford, the cost of parking at Ebbsfleet high-speed rail station and
the increase in fares on busier routes, and I hope that Southeastern
will listen to its customers and act on those issues.</hs_Para>

to the Government for their assistance in improving the commuting
experience for many of my constituents, and for the £45 million
investment made available by the Treasury for smart card technology. I
pay tribute to the innovation behind the search for a 
<?notus-xml column=265?>flexible approach to ticket pricing, which I hope will result in
products such as flexible season tickets that can be used by off-peak
travellers as well as those who travel at peak times. That is very much
to be welcomed and I hope that it will help off-peak commuters in
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000016">Ensuring
that we have good-quality rail services in the south-east will always
be a challenge. It is not an easy task for any train operator, yet many
improvements are required before commuters in my constituency and
around the south-east feel that they have been given value for money. I
ask the Minister to consider the concerns that I have raised today when
he deals with Southeastern, and when he is looking to award any new
franchises.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/131ECDE16ED9AB65ECE74E2F5B4887F35CBABDC0" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2014">Wednesday

John Denham</B> (Southampton, Itchen) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Sir Roger, and I congratulate the
hon. Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson) on securing such an important
debate. I want to look at some of the fundamental issues relating to
the financing of rail and commuter services. Governments of any party
face major challenges in trying to bring a fair and just approach to
rail fare financing in the south-east. As I am sure the shadow
Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian
Greenwood), will set out, until the Chancellor was forced to act last
summer, commuters faced a series of above-inflation fare
increases.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000018">It
is worth looking at some of the figures. I have looked at the increases
in train fares—season ticket prices—highlighted by
Passenger Focus on a number of south-eastern routes. Sadly, my
constituency is not included, but a number of others are. The increases
in fares are compared with the increase in wages of the people living
in the relevant areas. For example, in Gillingham in Kent—not
too far from the hon. Member for Dartford—in the year from
January 2010 to January 2011, the cost of a season ticket rose by 8.3%
and wages by 2.1%. The following year, season tickets rose by 6% and
wages by just 1.2%. In the next year, season tickets went up by 4.2%
and wages by just 0.2%. In the year up to January 2014, season tickets
went up by 3.1% while wages went up by just
0.7%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000019">A
similar pattern is repeated across the south-east. In Portsmouth, from
January 2010 to January 2011, fares went up by 7.2% and wages by just
2.1%. Fares went up the following year by 6.1%, but wages by just 1.2%.
In 2012-13, season tickets went up by 4.2% and wages by 0.2%. In the
past year, fares have gone up by 2.7% and wages by just 0.7%. Right
across the south-east, year after year, we have had increases in season
ticket prices that massively outstrip the real increases in wages
earned by our constituents and many others in the
region.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000020">The
annual season ticket from my constituency in Southampton is now more
than £5,200, and commuters have faced many additional costs. I
have not checked it on any websites, but I use the station and, as I
recall, the parking charge at Southampton airport parkway has gone up
from £10 to £14 a day in just the past three years. That
is, of course, outside the regulated system; costs are being piled on
to commuters wherever we choose to look.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=266?><hs_Para UID="14021293000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000021">It is easy
just to list statistics and say that there is a problem, but we must
look at some of the railway financing fundamentals that are driving the
increases. We have a good opportunity to do that this morning. I take
an unashamedly south and south-eastern view of the problem. The system
operates in ways that are particularly unfair for our constituents in
the south-east, and we must be prepared to face up to and challenge
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000022">What
are the essential financing issues? We must look at two flows of money.
The first is the money paid by the train operating
companies—that is, the passengers who travel on their
trains—to the Treasury. Some companies, almost all clustered in
the south-east, are paying substantial amounts of money out of their
fares in payment to the Government. In other parts of the country, it
is the other way around: a subsidy goes from the Government to the
train operating companies and their passengers. The second flow of
money is the grant that train operating companies receive from Network
Rail to train
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000023">We
must look at each flow in turn, and when we do we see an extraordinary
situation. As I said, my constituents in Southampton pay £5,200
a year for a season ticket. For every mile they travel—every
single mile from Southampton to London and from London back to
Southampton—they are paying 8.7p to the Treasury. That is the
highest rate in the country, but they are by no means the only set of
passengers paying substantial amounts to the Treasury—not
towards the cost of their rail service—for every mile that they
travel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000024">These
figures are from 2012-13, because this debate came up suddenly and I
did not have a chance to see whether Passenger Focus has updated its
analysis. The following figures were accurate in December. Passengers
on Southern were paying 7.9p per mile to the Treasury; First Capital
Connect passengers, 8.2p per mile; c2c passengers, 2.7p per mile; and
for Greater Anglia, feeding into London from the other side, passengers
were paying 5.5p per mile to the Treasury. Those train operating
companies, clustered around the south-eastern commuter services, are
between them paying more than £1 billion to the Treasury through
such contributions. South West Trains paid £314 million,
Southern paid £215 million, First Capital Connect paid
£187 million, c2c paid £176 million, and
Greater Anglia paid £139 million, all in the last year for which
figures were
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000025">By
contrast, in other parts of the country the payments went in the other
direction—I will come on to the extent to which such payments
are justified or not. Northern Rail received a subsidy from the
Treasury of £152 million, Arriva Trains Wales
received £140 million, First Trans- Pennine Express received
£41 million and CrossCountry received £21 million. The
only London commuter services that attracted a significant subsidy were
Southeastern, which received £82 million, and Chiltern, which
received £21
million.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000026">I
am probably the only person who has done so, but I have dubbed these
payments a “commuter train tax” that our
constituents—including yours, Sir Roger—pay to get to
work in London. Of course, people say, “That is not the full
picture,” because train operating companies receive a payment
from the Government through Network Rail that must also be taken into
account. However, if we do that, we discover an interesting pattern.
The lowest subsidy per mile through Network Rail is for 
<?notus-xml column=267?>First Capital Connect, at just 5.3p per mile. Southern gets 7.3p per
mile, c2c gets 7.1p, and South West Trains gets
7.6p.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000027">If
we look at other parts of the country, the Network Rail grant is worth
29.1p per mile to Northern Rail, 13.9p for East Midlands Trains, and
12.3p for First TransPennine Express. In other words, the same broad
pattern is shown: not only are our constituents paying more per mile to
the Treasury in one direction, but they are receiving less back per
mile through the Network Rail grant. That is a major
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000028">I
must acknowledge that the architecture of the current system was
introduced by the previous Labour Government. We are looking,
therefore, not at some fundamental change that has been introduced in
the past three years, but at the implications of simply rolling forward
an approach that was put in place a number of years ago. I would argue
that for my constituents the system is getting completely out of hand
and completely
unfair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000029">In
the last year for which figures are available, the south-east commuter
train companies were collectively paying more than £1 billion to
the Treasury—or rather, their passengers were. That has
quadrupled under the current Government—it was just £230
million in 2009. One might argue that, as part of a general shift
towards putting greater pressure on passengers to pay for the rail
services—my party, Labour, did that in Government, and it has
continued—some move in that direction was fair. However, we must
now ask whether putting such a big weight on the pockets of commuters
in the south-east is really
fair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000030">There
are a number of reasons for saying that we are producing real
injustice, as regards the extent of the burden that passengers are
expected to bear. We can look at two measures. The first is season
ticket price as a percentage of salary. A season ticket on a
medium-length journey is about 20% of the income of an operative who
commutes to London, according to the Hay Group. For a professional, it
is about 12%. That is twice the proportion of income paid by people
commuting to Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Manchester, Leeds, Glasgow
or Edinburgh. In other words, commuters from our constituencies are
paying a much higher proportion of their incomes to get to work than
commuters do in comparable cities around the country. There is a
similar pattern—not quite as marked—for people making
long journeys to London from our constituencies, compared with those in
other parts of the country. That is one indication of
unfairness.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000031"><Member ContinuationText="Heidi Alexander" PimsId="5563" UID="14021293000128" xid="1126" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000128"><B>Heidi

Denham:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right to raise that point; there
is a cumulative impact. Another recent study, published a couple of
weeks ago—I forget what it was called—showed that the
increase in rail fares in various towns and cities in the south-east
has now offset the apparent benefits of living outside London,
where  
<?notus-xml column=268?>there are lower house prices. Fares have risen so much that, despite the
disparity between London prices and those in other places, the costs
are extremely
high.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000033">The
other indicator of unfairness in the system is the fact that customer
satisfaction with value for money, as measured by Passenger Focus, is
lowest on the London commuter services. The hon. Member for Dartford
talked about Southeastern, where only 31% of customers believe that
they get value for money. On First Capital Connect, it is 32%; on South
West Trains, 33%; on Southern, 36%. Perhaps we are not surprised that
the more highly subsidised services, like Northern Rail, get a customer
satisfaction rating of 54% on value for money, and Arriva Trains Wales
54%.</hs_Para>

Hall debates are meant to raise issues, rather than to say there are
simple answers to problems. The architecture of the subsidy and
cross-subsidy system has been in place for some time, but it is now
getting out of hand. It is perhaps comparable in some ways to measures
such as the fuel duty escalator, which was originally introduced with
cross-party support. It is sometimes amusingly referred to as
Labour’s fuel duty escalator, even though it was introduced by a
Conservative Government. Although there was cross-party support when it
was introduced, the point came, as has been recognised by all parties,
where simply rolling ahead with it became politically and financially
untenable for many of our constituents. Those of us who are speaking up
for the south-east must say that we cannot simply roll forward the
current way of doing things without questioning
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000035">The
Campaign for Better Transport recently published a consultant’s
report, which said that even with fares capped, as the Chancellor has
just done, by 2018 the Government will be making a profit out of
running a rail system. In other words, passenger revenues paid to the
Treasury will exceed the money paid out. That means that our
constituents—commuters in the south-east whom we
represent—will be paying the entire cost of subsidising railways
in other parts of the country, and making a profit for the Government
to boot. That is not tenable; we have to do
something.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000036">There
are no easy answers. There is clearly no pot of public money sitting
there that can be sloshed into a greater subsidy. I am not familiar
with all the railways serving London, but there are lines where the
quality of the rolling stock and track in the south-east is
significantly better than in other parts of the country. A backlog of
investment needs to be addressed in some areas, so it is not a matter
of simply saying, “Let us tilt the balance in another
direction”. However, looking forward, we have to try to set out
a long-term strategy—hopefully one that can be agreed by all
parties—for getting some basic fairness and justice back into
the system, and for putting a cap on what our constituents are expected
to pay, not only for their journeys to work, but for the cost of

follow my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr
Denham), who has put  some very thoughtful points forward, and
I congratulate the hon. Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson) on
securing the debate. I should say at the outset that I

people think that people who live in London travel by tube or bus to
work. That is not strictly the case. In south-east London, we have
swathes of the capital where people rely wholly on the rail network to
get to work. The tube map barely reaches the boroughs of Lewisham,
Bromley, Bexley and Greenwich, so the overland rail services, provided
predominantly by Southeastern, and also by Southern in some areas, are
essential for people’s daily lives. In Lewisham,
38,000 people travel to work by train—nearly a third
of all the people who work. The figures are comparable for the other
London boroughs that I have just
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000039">If
anyone had stood at any station in my constituency this morning, they
would have seen thousands and thousands of people trying to cram
themselves into horrendously overcrowded trains operated by
Southeastern. One of the problems for my constituents living in
Lewisham is that when the trains arrive at our
stations—Blackheath, Grove Park or Lee Green—they are
already packed full of people travelling to central London. For that
pleasure, my constituents are asked to pay astronomical amounts of
money. For a journey that should be about 10 minutes, from Hither Green
to London Bridge, a zone 1 to 3 annual season ticket now costs
£976. It has gone up by £216 since 2010. That is a 28%
increase in four years. As my right hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Itchen said, wages have simply not kept up with that
increase. Ministers might want to tell themselves that they are being
tough on rail fare increases, but it certainly does not feel that way
to many people in Lewisham.</hs_Para>

sentiments expressed in those letters and e-mails to me are borne out
by industry surveys. I think that my right hon. Friend the Member for
Southampton, Itchen, referred to the national rail passenger survey.
When it asked people last autumn about satisfaction levels, 42% of
those asked thought that Southeastern services offered poor value for
money. If we expect people to pay huge sums to travel, surely they
should be able to expect a basic standard of service.</hs_Para>

problems and what needs to be done? The first main problem on
Southeastern relates to overcrowding. I know that significant work has
been done at stations in south-east London to lengthen platforms, so
that they can take 12-car trains. As I understand it, at the moment,
none of the rush hour trains are 12-car trains; they may be 8-car or
10-car trains. Can the Minister tell me today when my constituents can
expect to see 12-car services on all rush-hour trains stopping in my
constituency? I am conscious that discussions are taking place between
Southeastern and the Department for Transport, but I want to know by
which date my constituents can expect to see longer trains on the
services they use.</hs_Para>

Minister also say what action he is taking to ensure that Network Rail
properly manages engineering works and has robust plans in place to
deal with episodes of signal failure? In December last year, there was
an almost farcical situation whereby no trains were running out of any
of the mainline stations that serve south-east London when there was a
fire at a signal box at London Bridge. It created absolute chaos on the
travel network. Many of my constituents contacted me at that time to
ask what the problems are in getting Network Rail to address such
one-off incidents speedily. However, we experience such problems time
and again when engineering works overrun, meaning that on a Monday
morning there are delays on the network. That just adds to the sense of
frustration that people feel when they are being asked to pay
exorbitant amounts of money for the service.</hs_Para>

point made by the hon. Member for Dartford about the need for better
communication in, and better contingency planning for, times of bad
weather. I understand that the challenges of providing a rail service,
especially when the weather is as it is at the moment, must be huge; it
is very difficult to run a rail service at such times. However, when a
company’s website is not updated in real time, we can understand
why people just feel so frustrated that they are not receiving timely
and adequate information about the services that will be available to
them. Also, can the Minister say whether he believes there is an
adequate compensation regime in place for the occasions on which people
cannot access the services that they have paid
for?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000047">I
will conclude by saying that London is a fantastic city to live and
work in, but we have to get to grips with rail services that are
failing, and failing badly. With the franchising chaos that the
Government have managed to create, it seems that Southeastern will
continue to limp on and deliver services for a number of years to come,
before a new franchise is let. There is merit in exploring whether
Transport for London should become the franchising authority for rail
services in London. I know that there is some pushback against that
idea from some local authorities in Kent. However, TfL has been the
franchising authority for the East London line on the London
overground, and there we have seen services of a high quality, with
high standards and good reliability. My constituents, who live in
London, would like the same standards applied to their
services.</hs_Para>

management of Southeastern and Network Rail, he will raise the matters
that I have brought to his attention; that he will do all he can to
ensure that our rush-hour trains in south-east London are lengthened

if Southeastern rail is incapable of running an acceptable service over

anyway—isn’t it time to set up a commission of enquiry as
to why, and try to find lasting solutions beyond the DIY approach that
appears to prevail?...At present, and against a background of rising
fares across the board, I have the feeling there is a complete lack of
accountability and an inability to take action at a political level,

severe weather encountered in recent weeks has exposed the fragility of
some of that infrastructure. Much attention nationally has focused on
the enormous disruption in the south-west, but passengers are also

Woldingham in Surrey is due to close for up to a week, and the line
between Eastleigh and Fareham is not expected to reopen until the end
of February. Landslips are causing misery for commuters in Hastings, as
there have also been closures on the line to Tonbridge. The Minister

problems are not limited to one particular line or operator. During

Milton Keynes is a rapidly growing town that relies on its strong rail
links to London. The hon. Member for Milton Keynes South (Iain Stewart)
is in the Chamber. The collapse of the west coast main line franchise
competition, which, of course, has cost the taxpayer at least
£55 million, has led to uncertainty about future services. The
franchising debacle has put orders on hold, hurting the supply chain
and threatening jobs and skills, including at the Railcare maintenance
company in Wolverton. Commuters from Milton Keynes Central to London
have seen the cost of their season tickets increase by £940 and
are now paying 25% more than they did four years ago, well above the
average increase of 20% in season ticket prices. They are paying the
cost for the Government’s failure to impose a strict cap on rail
fare rises, which Labour has called for. As my right hon. Friend the
Member for Southampton, Itchen and my hon. Friend the Member for

quality of services that they are able to attract. Two main operators
serve the station in Milton Keynes—Virgin west coast and London

the middle of 2017, as a direct result of the fiasco on the west coast
main line. Is the Minister able to offer local commuters reassurance
that the Department is planning at least to maintain current service
frequencies when it re-lets that franchise, and will train operators be
able to vary the current definition of peak time, under which some
commuters could be paying even more? The Minister needs to answer such
questions about problems directly caused as a result of extensions to
timetables.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000062">The

issues facing the railways: the lack of available track capacity. We
have debated this issue many times in this Chamber and I do not intend
to revisit those arguments in depth now, but it is a
fact that passenger numbers have doubled over the past 20 years. Some
lines that 50 years ago were deemed incapable of paying their way now
form vital commuter arteries. For example, the link between Cambridge
and Marks Tey in Suffolk was condemned in the Beeching report, although
a short stub was eventually saved. The surviving route, which is
sometimes known as the Lovejoy line, after the TV series, now supports
bustling services during the morning peak. How many former routes might
be similarly used today—reflecting some issues that hon. Members

service?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000065">As
the capacity constraints on our existing network become increasingly
apparent, it is right that we have to look at ways of enhancing the
capacity of our existing lines, as well as exploring the opportunity
for reopening old lines where there is a compelling case for doing so.
This is particularly important in light of the severe disruption caused
in the south-west by the storm damage at Dawlish. That is why Labour
supported High Speed 1, which has enabled greatly enhanced
commuter services from many communities in Kent, including those on the
line itself, and those which benefit from Javelin services, which
transfer to and from the conventional rail network. These trains have
created commuter routes that previously would not have been feasible
for many travellers, including the high-speed services from Deal. I pay
tribute to the local campaigners, including Labour’s
parliamentary candidate Clair Hawkins, who have put real pressure on
the operator and the Department for Transport to secure those services,

Labour’s candidates are taking the lead when it comes to

Dartford (Gareth Johnson) on securing this debate on Southeastern

affect his constituents. Indeed, yesterday, we had a meeting about the
introduction of free-flow on the Dartford crossing, which will deliver
better reliability there. He is a champion for his constituents.
Indeed, one of his constituents sent me a text while he was speaking to

locked on the service from Lewisham. I am sure that that is another

is clear that if we are to continue the strong growth in rail travel
over recent years, passengers must be confident that the service that
they receive is reliable, quick and comfortable. That is why the
Government have invested billions of pounds in railway infrastructure
improvements over this Parliament, and we have set out our plans to
continue doing so. The Thameslink programme is one of those key
investments, and we are committed to funding and delivering it in its

just developed in the past four years; there has been a backlog in
investment in our rail, particularly in rolling stock. Northern Rail
has some very old rolling stock. Indeed, a couple of weeks ago, we had
a debate in which my hon. Friend the Member for Stevenage (Stephen
McPartland) suggested that the rolling stock on his line is older than
he is. There is a lot to be done, but that is no reason for not
continuing with the investment that we have announced and with the

Denham:</Member></B> I am familiar with that north-south argument that
suggests that all the investment is going to the south-east. Does the
Minister accept my concern that my constituents, who are paying so much
over the odds for their rail journeys, are no keener than constituents
in the north of England to subsidise a railway in another part of the

that by saying that the east coast main line is the line that

franchise operation or its current nationalised express, as I think
someone called it the other day. A lot of investment is going into
London and the south-east because that is where we see the most
congestion and overcrowding. The £6.5 billion investment in
Thameslink will link Kent, Sussex and Surrey, through central London,
with Hertfordshire, Bedfordshire and Cambridgeshire. The Thameslink
programme will deliver up to 1,140 carriages of high-capacity,
next-generation rolling stock, in addition to some 600 new carriages
that are being provided as part of the Crossrail project, which is a
significant enhancement of the rail network’s capacity. I do not

head, but I will drop the hon. Lady a line to give it to her. She is
right that if a train is shorter than expected, it will result in
either more people standing or, in some cases, many people not being
able to get on the train and having to wait for the next service. In
fact, the person who texted me recently has always made the point that
living in Dartford is good because the trains are usually fairly empty
when they get there. As people get closer to London and go through
places such as Lewisham, the trains get fuller and fuller and it
becomes more difficult either to get a seat or, in some cases, to get
on the
train.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000086">Of
the total delay minutes for the Southeastern network, around one third
are attributable to Southeastern. That is within Southeastern’s
contractual benchmarks and 1.6 percentage points outside its
improvement target set with Network Rail. The most significant amount,
almost two thirds of all delay minutes, are attributable to Network
Rail. Network Rail remains cumulatively 37.9% adrift of its targets,

attributable to Network Rail, however, include significant and, to a
large extent, unavoidable delays. The St Jude’s day storm, for
example, caused widespread disruption, as has the sustained severe
weather we have been experiencing since just before Christmas. It is
inevitable that some disruption will occur in such extreme weather. On
a number of occasions Network Rail has been forced to order the
suspension of rail services until a full route inspection has taken
place, which has caused major disruption on many routes. I gave
evidence to that effect to the Select Committee on Transport before
Christmas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000088">Safety
must remain the highest priority, and it is in no small part due to
Network Rail’s performance on safety that the UK now has one of
the safest, if not the safest, railways in Europe. However, adverse
weather should not be allowed to overshadow risk factors that can be
controlled. Indeed, it is noteworthy that the High Speed 1 line did not
experience any problems due to the recent bad weather. Lines built to
that standard, such as the new High Speed 2, should also not encounter
such
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000089"><B><Member ContinuationText="Gareth Johnson" PimsId="5597" UID="14021293000141" xid="1060" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000141">Gareth
Johnson:</Member></B> The Minister mentions the High Speed 1
statistics, which are relevant to the punctuality targets that
Southeastern has to meet. Southeastern amalgamates its main line
statistics with the High Speed 1 statistics to create the overall
figure. To my knowledge, Southeastern is the only company in the
country that does that, so it gives a distorted impression of
punctuality to the communities that use its
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000090"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Goodwill" PimsId="3497" UID="14021293000142" xid="884" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000142">Mr

access London, so it would probably be unfair to exclude the line from
the figures. I merely note that the figures are skewed because of the
excellent performance of High Speed 1, which is built to a much higher
standard. The angles of embankments, the engineering and the standard
of the overhead lines are of a higher standard than the third-rail
service used by many other trains, which can be disrupted by bad
weather.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000091">Southeastern

and it recently requested a formal review with the Office of Rail
Regulation, given several periods of missed delay minute targets. There
are particular concerns about trees on the track, which can be
mitigated through good vegetation management. There is also concern
about landslips, which are controllable through targeted drainage
management. Network Rail has its own views on the reasons for the
disappointing drop in its performance, which it primarily puts down to
extreme, unprecedented weather. Network Rail does, however, accept that
performance must improve significantly, and it is engaged in open
dialogue with Southeastern. We have told Southeastern that it must
continue to challenge Network Rail to improve its performance on the
Southeastern network. I await with interest the outcome of the formal

record performance achieved off the back of the Olympics success in

the average for London and south-east operators of 82%. That is an

Southeastern remains relatively close to the London and south-east

the Northern Rail franchise does not receive very high customer

point was that I share the pain, given the level of ridership on those
trains. The hon. Member for Lewisham East mentioned the 12-car trains
and called for longer trains through her constituency. She will be
aware that discussions are ongoing on a new Southeastern franchise, and
I will ensure that her views are fed into that discussion, to see what
can be done, although it is a 
<?notus-xml column=280?>busy stretch of railway and there are limits on the amount of rolling
stock available. She also mentioned overrunning engineering works,
which are a perennial problem that affect a number of lines up and down
the country. We are aware of the possession overruns by Network Rail,
but one cannot plan for unexpected situations, such as fires at signal
boxes, suicides and copper theft, which result in disruption on the
railway and Network Rail has little control over
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000104">The
shadow Minister made a number of points and was very good at mentioning
many prospective candidates, and I wish them well. It is true that
Southeastern has cancelled many more trains than usual, particularly in
December 2013. Cancellations for the previous five months were ahead of
plan, and Southeastern has admitted that the problems in December could
have been managed better. The spike in cancellations was due to staff
and drivers not working overtime, as is normal, due to the poor
weather. In addition, many drivers could not get to work due to
disruption to roads and rail infrastructure. Southeastern said that it
has learned lessons from the incident.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford will know, the Department is
planning a four-year direct award contract with Southeastern from
October 2014, in accordance with the refranchising programme borne out
of the Brown and Laidlaw reviews. As he will understand, I cannot go
into the specifics, as we are due to enter negotiations with
Southeastern in the coming months. I can, however, outline some of the
expected service and performance
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000107">The
new Kent franchise has been specifically designed with customer
satisfaction at its heart. For that reason, an innovative performance
regime, which contractually requires operator-funded investments where
national passenger survey targets are not met, has been included. In
addition, a financial incentive regime will be linked to the standard
operator benchmarks of delay minutes, cancellations and train capacity,
which are the contractual measures that I mentioned earlier. Attaching
financial reward to customer satisfaction and operational performance
is an essential element of the new franchise and is designed to drive
passenger benefits and, ultimately, continued strong growth in rail
travel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000108">Making
performance more transparent is another aim of the new franchise.
Southeastern currently reports an average monthly public performance
measure, but in the new franchise, it will be required to publish PPM
performance data by route, which addresses my hon. Friend’s
point, in addition to its overall PPM average. We will discuss with
Southeastern what other information can be published about customer
experience. I expect that increased transparency will help passengers
to make better-informed travel decisions and allow improvement
strategies targeted by the operator on the worst-performing routes.
Greater transparency will also enable my officials more effectively to
challenge the operator’s
delivery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000109">On
timetable enhancements, Southeastern has consulted on a number of
improvements for the new franchise, including extending Victoria to
Dartford services later into the evening and all-day services between
Deal and Sandwich and St Pancras. There is, of course, no guarantee 
<?notus-xml column=281?>that the proposed enhancements will be accepted by Network Rail, but
they are under active consideration and demonstrate that Southeastern
is responding to customer demand. Southeastern is also in discussions
with Transport for London about extending Oyster services to Stratford
International, Dartford and Swanley. Again, I cannot guarantee that the
proposals will be realised in the current franchise or the direct award
period, but they are under real consideration. Indeed, when I last met
the Mayor of London and Sir Peter Hendy, they said that they were keen
to roll out cashless payments for journeys into London, but I note my
hon. Friend’s comment that that need not be facilitated by
extending TfL’s empire into
Kent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021293000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#14021293000110">In
conclusion, we are aware of the issues that my hon. Friend has raised
about this important commuter area. I assure him that we will maintain
pressure on the operator both to exceed performance targets and to work
with Network Rail to facilitate a step change in their performance. I
am currently satisfied that Southeastern is committed to driving
improvements, as evidenced by its efforts to secure an Office of Rail
Regulation formal review with its industry partner, Network Rail. I
hope that by outlining some of the Department for Transport’s
plans for the four-year direct award period, I have shown that the
Department is committed to driving real improvements in transparency,
performance and customer satisfaction. I am grateful to my hon. Friend

constructive debate that was borne out of the contact that I have had
with several constituents. They were critical of the service that they
have experienced and are frustrated at the service on their lines when
trying to go about their work in London and when travelling further
into Kent. The complaints and concerns that have been brought to my
attention—as a commuter, I have experienced similar things
myself—follow a pattern. A lack of communication, innovation,
value for money and reliability are the core concerns of commuters in
the south-east. I ask the Minister to take those comments on board when

am not unique in having concerns about the work of Atos. I am sure that
there is such concern throughout the country. Last year citizens advice
bureaux helped with some 450,000 problems to do with employment and
support allowance, and 58,000 of those related to work capacity
assessments carried out by Atos. Some 94,000 cases related to appeals.
The Department for Work and Pensions is currently retendering for new
contracts, and I hope that as part of the process the Minister and the
Department are examining some of the failures of past contracts. Above
all, I appeal to the Minister—he is a Minister who
listens—to ensure that whatever conclusions are reached, and
whoever gets the contracts, they will be held to account for poor
quality assessments and bad customer service. That is the reason for
the debate, and I shall give examples—I hesitate to use the word
“anecdotes”; many Members of Parliament have constituency
experience of the
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212117000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#140212117000004">I
am concerned that Atos may not be asking the right questions, and I
encourage DWP to introduce regular independent scrutiny of its customer
satisfaction surveys. It has asserted that 85% of clients are satisfied
with the assessment process, but I question that figure. Citizens
Advice has long-standing concerns about the accuracy of work capacity
assessment reports provided to DWP as part of the Department’s
decision-making process. Citizens Advice asserts that two thirds of
reports have a medium level of inaccuracy, and that 40% have had a
serious lack of accuracy, which could lead to the wrong decision being
made. Those concerns are not confined to the issue of ESA; they could
be replicated with respect to personal independence payment
assessments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212162000001" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#140212162000001"><Member ContinuationText="Jessica Morden" PimsId="4824" UID="140212117000065" xid="869" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#140212117000065"><B>Jessica

new systems have teething problems. I should emphasise, however, that
not one of us, of whatever political persuasion, has a monopoly on

argue, the inappropriate system and process, many of our constituents
are told that they do not qualify and are indeed fit for work. The

because that is our duty and our function, and I am supported by
excellent staff here in London and in Aberystwyth, so we will

governing our assessment system. My concern in addition to the delays

the charity Mind informs me that around 40% of people who are found fit
for work appeal against the decision; of those who appeal, almost 40%
win their appeal. As we know, capability to work is about not only
those suffering with physical disabilities—it might be easier
for ATOS assessors to see and report on a tangible factor—but
those suffering with an invisible illness. This is true in particular
of constituents who are suffering with mental health issues, or
conditions relating to autism, which is an especially interesting
example.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212117000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0001.htm#140212117000020">In
my constituency, I was pleased that an excellent charity, Autism Cymru,

understanding of the condition of autism. I used to be a primary school
teacher and we had minimal training on this, but one thing that
impressed itself on me was one particular feature of autism: asking a
direct question gets a negative response. That is the nature of the
condition, and it needs to be borne in mind in the assessments. The
charities Rethink, Mind, the National Autistic Society and Citizens
Advice have all made that point to me. I therefore ask the Minister to
reiterate the Department’s concern and to ensure that, whichever
providers undertake the work, the assessors are appropriately trained
in complex conditions such as autism and mental health, so that the

from colleagues from across the House—it is on its
way—raising that concern. Organisations working on behalf of
people with progressive conditions have found that that 45% of people
with those conditions who put in a new claim for ESA between 2008 and
2011 were placed in a work-related activity group and deemed able
eventually to return to work. The placement of those individuals
represents the Department’s recognition that they were unable to
work at the time of the assessment, yet some were given a
recommendation for a return to work in few months’ time. But
that directly contradicts the definition of a progressive condition,

apathetic to his conditions, and also felt under immense pressure to
complete tasks put before him. He self-harmed considerably following

been put down as “refusals” on his medical report form.
He gets very angry, has suicidal thoughts and is prone to
paranoia—I am not being emotive in presenting such cases, as I
think that they are replicated more generally. Shortly after the
initial assessment, 
<?notus-xml column=287?>he got in touch with me to start the appeals process. Someone from the
DWP phoned him to tell him that his appeal of the Atos
decision had been unsuccessful, but we had not even
started the appeals process at that point. They then called 10 minutes

descriptors as the Atos assessor, the same reports and the same medical
information from the person’s GP, so why is it that judges who
are upholding appeals and the Atos assessors are reaching such wildly
different conclusions? For example, a constituent of mine had her Atos

contract was formulated with Atos as one single provider. That was a
flawed decision. Sadly, under ministerial rules, I am not allowed to
see the evidence that was put before Ministers in the previous
Administration. Due diligence is not possible, as it would be if a
company were taken over. That is rather strange. although I have been
in three Departments, I am not allowed to see that evidence, but I
cannot understand why that decision was made. There was a move from a
predominantly paper-based assessment, in which people were often
written off. When I had my accident in the fire service, my certificate

that are waiting to go to a tribunal are reviewed, and if senior case
workers have got them wrong, we will prevent them from going forward.

between quality of decision and throughput. One reason why so many

got too many wrong. I say “we” because I am the Minster

serve under your chairmanship for the first time, Mrs Riordan, for a
very important debate. Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen a
watershed in the referendum debate in Scotland. The Governor of
the Bank of England’s non-partisan and technical intervention on

the Scottish National party has been peddling about keeping and using
the pound. I will come back to those revelations later and to some of
the latest news on that issue.</hs_Para>

back to the central message of the Governor’s speech. He said
that currency union requires fiscal, economic and political union to
avoid financial crisis. It is precisely that fiscal, economic and
political union that the SNP seeks to dismantle with its obsession with
independence. When the First Minister met the Governor 
<?notus-xml column=293?>of the Bank of England a few weeks ago, there was one person in that
room who would control Scotland’s fiscal, monetary
and spending policies in a currency union after independence, and it
was not the First Minister.</hs_Para>

that the Governor set for any currency union is that a centralised
fiscal authority would need to control about 25% of that fiscal
union’s GDP. That is about 50% of the spending in
Scotland. The SNP immediately responded by saying that they would have
100% control over taxes and spending in an independent Scotland, so by
default, it is the SNP that has ruled out a currency union by
completely ignoring the central warning of the Governor’s full
analysis.</hs_Para>

have to look too far back into history to see that the Governor was

being part of the UK offers us protection from financial shocks. During
the financial crisis, banks based in Scotland took advantage of the
protection offered to UK banks. Since 2007, the UK has committed

think of money today as banknotes and coins, but that the currency used

know what the money will be in their pockets. We cannot run a modern

much Scotland could tax and spend. Scotland would have no control at
all over monetary policy. It would also mean the loss of our UK central

We know that the SNP proposed that we have the currency of a foreign
state and we know that there will be no political and fiscal union, so,
in the event of separation, Scotland then becomes—this is really
important for the man and woman on the streets of Scotland—a
higher risk. As a result, our interest rates will increase, which means
that we will have to spend more money on mortgages, loans, and credit
cards. The cultural nationalists will accept that, because they will
pay any price for separation, but most canny Scots will
not.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140212165000334" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000334">3.

the single most important economic decision a country can take. That is
why Scotland is asking, as we close in on the independence referendum
in September, why the yes campaign does not seem to know what currency
it wants. We hear that the SNP wants and favours a currency union with
the rest of the UK, keeping the pound. However, the other members of

but what if agreement could not be reached on that? What is plan B?
Even if a separate Scotland wanted to continue to use the pound, and

Scottish firms were to buy from or sell to our biggest
customer—the rest of the United Kingdom—would be an
issue. There would be deeper cuts or higher taxes as the Scottish
Government paid more to borrow money, leading to more debt and lower
public spending. There would be risks to benefits and pensions as

Can they deliver a currency union? All the indications are that the

for a new currency, and will that be pegged or floating? The Scottish
nationalists are keen to get closer to the Nordic regions, nations of a
comparable size; they always cite Norway, Finland and Sweden, or
anywhere in that supposed arc of success, as it fluctuates. In the past
10 years, Norway’s currency, which was pegged against the euro,
has fluctuated, and there has been a high degree of movement, and cost
implications, as a result. Alternatively, will the

although many people in Scotland may have an emotional attachment to
the idea of Scotland being an independent country, they none the less

that has existed over the years, and what an important decision this is
for the people of Scotland to make in September. The Scottish National
party would sometimes have us believe that everything will stay the
same and nothing will change, but at the same time it tries to advance
the notion that everything will change. That is not so. Increasingly,
people are beginning to see through that false prospectus. A number of

For them, it is not just about the macro-economics, because some will,
perhaps, not take an interest in that. However, they will take an

their ability to pay their way in the world, and in the impact on their

young people here today in Parliament, including some members of the
Scottish Youth Parliament, who are here to lobby on votes for
16-year-olds. I am struck by the intelligent way that young people have
approached this debate. When it comes to the independence cause, they
have not simply rushed to the barricades, as the SNP may, at one stage,

Perhaps the Minister will shed light on whether there has been any

be that, in an independent Scotland, it will not take any of the
difficult decisions that go along with that. It is not entirely clear
yet what will happen to all the benefits and pensions arrangements, and

Why are the Scottish Government and the Scottish Parliament not
spending more time looking after the issues for which they have
responsibility? Only at the weekend, there were reports about what was
happening in the health service in Scotland; about the justice
system—we have a proud record of a different legal system in
Scotland—being dismantled, bit by bit, by the Scottish

Government have consistently stated throughout the debate that the
current economic arrangement—one currency in one United
Kingdom—is in the best interest of everyone. We have also
consistently stated that it is highly unlikely that a currency union
between an independent Scotland and a continuing UK could be made to
work. I will use the remaining time to remind hon. Members of our
analysis, which explains why that is the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000206" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000206">First,
the lessons of the eurozone crisis are there for us to see. Currency
unions do not work without close political and fiscal integration. As a
result of the crisis, those countries that use the euro are moving
towards ever greater integration to address the challenges that they
face. Scottish independence, though, is all about disintegration and
would inevitably mean that the continuing UK and Scotland move further
apart. The Scottish Government’s proposal for a currency union
without fiscal or political integration lacks any credibility and makes
one wonder whether the Scottish Government actually understand what the
word “independence”
means.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000207">Secondly,
we know that the economies of an independent Scotland and a continuing
UK would be very different and would diverge over time as a result of
different laws, different regulations and different industries. One
industry that we know would be important for Scotland is North sea oil.
A significant portion of an independent Scotland’s economy would
depend on oil revenues. Were a change in oil price to affect the two
countries differently, a one-size monetary policy with one currency for
two separate nations would simply not be
suitable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000208">Thirdly,
despite the Scottish Government’s claim, we do not believe that
a currency union would be in the interest of an independent Scotland.
Such a union would inevitably constrain Scotland’s own economic
policies because the remaining UK, to manage the risks of the union,
would need to set interest rates and maintain oversight of an
independent Scotland’s tax and spending plans. Indeed, a
currency union would also be likely to undermine an independent
Scotland’s economic resilience and credibility. If, for example,
the financial markets sensed that the Bank of England’s monetary
policy did not suit Scottish circumstances, they might doubt
Scotland’s commitment to the currency union, which would, in
turn, lead to financial market speculation. In such circumstances, if
markets were not calmed, there would be a very real possibility that
Scotland would be forced to adopt its own currency in a time of crisis.
One is reminded of the recent situation in Cyprus when there was plenty
of talk of the country potentially leaving the euro. Members will know
that that was prevented only after a huge bail out from other eurozone
members, which came at a significant cost to Cypriots, many of whom
lost up to 40% of their deposits in domestic banks.</hs_Para>

just as a currency union is not in Scotland’s interest, it is
hard to see how it could be in the interest of the remaining United
Kingdom. Such a union would involve the remaining United Kingdom giving
up an element of its economic sovereignty, as we have heard from many
hon. Members today. The public would feel very strongly about that. It
would increase the risk of having to bail out Scottish banks, and the
idea of putting the remaining United Kingdom’s economy at risk
because of another country’s banks just as we are getting our
own banks in order would make no
sense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000210">Before

intelligent person who makes valuable contributions in the House, but

Banking Commission that the total cash cost of the entire financial
bail out of all the systems was £133 billion. Of the other
figures that he talks about, £220 billion was made up of the
asset protection scheme, which was a paid-for insurance guarantee. The
scheme made the taxpayer a profit and was never called upon; it has
since been shut down. Will the Minister confirm that that is
correct?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000213"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sajid Javid" PimsId="5595" UID="140212165000460" xid="1036" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000460">Sajid
Javid:</Member></B> Again, that is a good demonstration of how the hon.
Gentleman would like to twist the facts. Just because a guarantee is
not called upon does not mean that it has not done its job. The
guarantee provided confidence and ensured that the banking system did
not collapse. Our analysis shows that Scottish banks, even when we
focus only on their assets in Scotland, would have assets equal to 10
times the GDP of an independent Scotland. That shows that it would be
difficult for an independent Scotland to give depositors confidence in
its domestic banking
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000214">The
hon. Gentleman also mentioned trade between the UK and Scotland. The UK
accounts for 70% of Scotland’s total trade, whereas Scotland
accounts for 10% of the UK’s trade. Scottish trade is important
to the UK economy, but it is not clear that it is important enough to
risk recreating in the British isles the problems that we have seen in

conclusion, a fiscal and currency union pursued by two diverging
nations would put significant limits on an independent
Scotland’s economic freedom, and it would put an independent
Scotland at severe risk of losing economic resilience and credibility.
Such a union would undermine a continuing UK’s sovereignty and
would increase the risk of bank bail outs. That is why we have
consistently said that it is highly unlikely that a currency union
would be agreed and that it is highly unlikely that a currency union
could be made to
work.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/0E6D0A5CB2B35A17C2ECEB474D9C2377452A0F34" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2014">Wednesday

secured this debate on an important issue that cuts to the heart of
growth and success in our country. Stansted airport began life as a
United States air force base during world war two. More than 600 planes
took off from that air strip on their historic journey to the French
coast in the first hours of D-day in 1944. In the 70 years since then,
the small air base has grown rapidly into a thriving modern airport,
the fourth busiest in the United Kingdom. Last year, it served nearly
18 million passengers and flights to more than 150 destinations. Its
passenger numbers are constantly increasing and are set to rise further
in the coming years. Stansted is one of the infrastructure successes of
our time, and that is the context in which the future of the airport
must be considered. I am pleased to see the right hon.

aviation strategy has been handed to the Davies commission, but it will

second-guessing what it might say. I am sympathetic to what my hon.
Friend said, because I was somewhat surprised that the new runway at
Stansted was not even included in the Davies report’s
preliminary shortlist. Given the scope for development there, the
predicted increases in passenger numbers and the airport’s
ever-evolving success, it is surprising that that runway did not
warrant further consideration as an option. I understand that that was
in part due to Davies not taking into account the full passenger
forecasts or the recent deals that have been signed under the new
ownership at
Stansted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000228">I
am pleased that the commission, in highlighting the possible need for a
new runway at Stansted by 2050, indicates that it at least accepts that
the airport has long-term value. Either way, Davies has concluded that
the choice over a new runway by 2030 is effectively between Heathrow
and Gatwick. My priority for this 
<?notus-xml column=321?>debate is not what happens in 2030 or 2050, but what happens now.
Regardless of what Davies eventually recommends, we have an immediate
problem, which is that London urgently needs more air capacity. The
prospect of any new runway is at best 15 years away, and those are 15
years that we do not have. London cannot afford to wait and should not
sit by as the likes of Frankfurt, Schiphol and Charles de Gaulle

to have increased capacity and better facilities at Stansted airport, I
encourage the right hon. Gentleman to take note of the impact that an
increased number of flights can have on other parts of the United
Kingdom. For example, that can increase the number of flights to
Belfast City airport and Belfast International airport. That increases
competition and drives down prices, and that can encourage more people

is that the West Anglia main line—the main access route to
Stansted—is in a dire state. It has suffered from year after
year of underinvestment, and, as a result, it is slow, unreliable and
inefficient. It takes 53 minutes to get to Stansted from a London rail 
<?notus-xml column=322?>terminal, compared with 37 minutes to Luton, 30
minutes to Gatwick and 21 minutes to Heathrow. Reliability, meanwhile,
is well below the national average. The rail link is a real impediment
to Stansted’s growth and future success. The Davies commission
noted that in its interim report, which stated that there are
substantial arguments in favour of enhancing the link, which merits
urgent consideration. I want to press the Minister on that urgent
consideration. Like Davies, Transport for London, Network Rail, the
Government and London business groups have all voiced their support for
the improvements. There is a consensus that four-tracking the line
between Coppermill junction and Broxbourne is vital. I welcome that
consensus, although it has been long enough in coming. We need urgent
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000236">Timing
remains a real issue, however. It is a growing concern that the work
may be delayed further and further. Network Rail has suggested that the
improvements, despite being described by Davies as urgent and vital,
may be pushed back into control period 6, which does not even begin for
another five years. Similar delays have occurred several times already.
I hope that the Minister’s response will outline concrete steps
that the Government will take to improve the West Anglia main line.
Following Davies stressing the need for urgency, I hope that the
Minister will tell us how the Government will complete the work in the
shortest time possible. If he is unable to give such a response now,
will he assure me that it will be included in the Government’s
response to Davies’ initial report, which is due to be published

published on Monday found £53 million-worth of journey time
savings could be made by improving the quality of the line. A recent
report by Oxford Economics concluded that investing in four-tracking
could unlock economic benefits to the tune of £4.5 billion by
2021 and £10.7 billion by 2031. Development is also
important for jobs in the region. My constituents in Tottenham rely
heavily on the success of the Upper Lee valley corridor and
on jobs at Stansted. West London accounts for 17% of all jobs in
London, for example, and Heathrow supports 230,000
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000239">The
future of Stansted is hugely important to the UK’s whole
economy. It pains me that we are still discussing upgrading the West
Anglia main line. It is 
<?notus-xml column=323?>important that this region of London is put on the
map. I have been opposed to the Mayor’s idea of Boris island,
largely because of where it would leave west London’s economy
and the huge loss of jobs that would be a consequence of
Heathrow’s closure. Stansted is a key component of the
rebalancing of London’s economy to the east and north-east, so I
look forward to what the Minister has to
say.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/DC9A46607E01610ED35A4BACF9C3A43EA5E9BDCC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2014">Wednesday

Alan Haselhurst</B> (Saffron Walden) (Con):</Member> I am grateful to
the right hon. Member for Tottenham (Mr Lammy) and the
Minister for agreeing that I can make a small contribution to this
debate. It is always interesting to hear from other colleagues about
the airport that lies wholly in my constituency. It is a subject about

years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000241">The
title that the right hon. Gentleman gave this debate raised some
eyebrows in my constituency and elsewhere in Essex, almost to the point
where briefing was coming in on the basis that we would this afternoon
be deciding the future of Stansted airport, but that is perhaps a
little optimistic. The reality is accepted by my constituents, who were
opposed to the development of Stansted into a major London airport. It
currently has an agreed capacity of up to 35 million passengers per
annum and it could go further than that on a single runway. It
currently handles 7.8 million passengers per annum, so there is a long
way to go.</hs_Para>

decry the importance of the subject to the right hon.
Gentleman’s constituency, but he must recognise that when he
talks about job creation in my constituency, he is talking about a
constituency with 1.3% unemployment. For all the jobs that will be
created at the airport, even with its existing planning permission, a
great many of those will be taken by people who will then want to
migrate to my constituency, which is essentially a rural area that is
already bearing a great burden of demand for more housing. He must

can
grow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000243"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Lammy" PimsId="1400" UID="140212165000477" xid="346" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000477">Mr

is resistance in my constituency to the development of Stansted beyond
one runway and certainly to its becoming a hub airport, because people
see the down side of what could happen. As they see it, there is little
up side if development on that scale can take place. Had it been
possible to say that there would be a first-class rail line as a result
of the original decision to expand Stansted, that might have been seen
as a benefit, but the service has got worse. I absolutely agree with
the right hon. Gentleman that it is important for us soon to have a
four-track railway on the West Anglia
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000246">The
blame has to be shared. It starts with the Government of Mrs Thatcher,
who agreed the development, but not the infrastructure. It went on
through the years of the Labour Government, who wanted not only to 
<?notus-xml column=324?>expand Stansted, but to put more houses in the M11 corridor, yet they
still did nothing about the infrastructure. Under the present
Government, we are now waiting for a sign that action will be taken. In
that sense, the right hon. Gentleman and I may make common cause, but
please do not go away with the thought that my constituents welcome the
idea that Stansted should be the hub airport with two, three or four
runways. London needs a hub airport, but it does not need it in the
Essex
countryside.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="140212165000341" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000341">4.21

am well aware of the right hon. Gentleman’s ambitions for
improving the economic prosperity of the London-Stansted-Cambridge

Stansted airport is clearly of central importance to those aspirations,

connectivity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000249">In
that light, it is worth while to take a few minutes to consider the
future of Stansted airport in the context of the Government’s
wider aviation policy. The Government are well aware of the important
contribution of aviation to the economy, but we also recognise the need
to take a balanced approach. Last year, therefore, we published our
aviation policy framework—a long-term strategy to enable the UK
aviation sector to flourish and support economic growth, while
addressing issues such as aircraft noise and carbon
emissions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000250">The
Government believe that maintaining the UK’s status as a leading
global aviation hub is fundamental to the country’s long-term
international competitiveness. We appointed Sir Howard Davies to chair
an independent commission to identify and recommend to Government how
best to achieve that. The commission published its interim report on 17
December 2013, concluding that, while the UK remains well connected,
additional capacity will be needed to support competitiveness and
prosperity in the medium and longer term. The commission will undertake
further detailed analysis of proposals for new runways at Gatwick and
Heathrow airports. It will also examine further the Isle of Grain, or
Boris island, option to reach a view before the year’s end on
whether it should be considered alongside the shortlisted
options.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000251">We
welcome the interim report as a major milestone for the commission. It
represents a significant step forward in its work of
assessing the options for meeting the UK’s future aviation
needs. As I am sure Members appreciate, the Government have no
intention of commenting on any of the long-term options that were, or
were not, shortlisted while the Airports Commission
continues its work. The Government, however, intend
to respond to the commission’s short-term recommendations
and will do so as soon as possible. The commission
will provide its final report by the summer of 2015 for consideration
by the Government and Opposition parties—whoever they may

airport is London’s third busiest airport and the UK’s
fourth busiest, but it is still only half full. The airport therefore
has an important role to play in growing connections between the UK and
the rest of the world, now and in the future, as noted by the Airports
Commission in its interim report. Recently, we have seen a number of
developments at Stansted that help the airport to fulfil its potential
and to fill its spare capacity, including its acquisition by Manchester
Airports
Group.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000256" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000256">At
the end of the month, it will be one year since Manchester Airports
Group purchased Stansted airport. I welcome the significant investment
in Stansted by its new owner, which I am familiar with through Industry
and Parliament Trust activity when I was in opposition. In less than 12
months, we have seen huge improvements to the terminal, as part of an
£80 million investment programme. I am pleased that the airport
has already committed to further investment in the infrastructure to
improve all aspects of the customer
journey.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000257">In
the past year, the airport has announced long-term deals with its major
airlines that will see passenger numbers increase substantially over
the next 10 years. This summer alone, the airport will introduce 12 new
routes and a substantial increase in services to key destinations. It
is excellent to see passengers benefitting from the increased
competition between airports around
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000258">The
Government are also playing their part in making the airport more
accessible and attractive to passengers. For example, since 2010, the
Stansted Express has benefitted from a brand new fleet of trains, the
Bombardier class 379 electric multiple units, which were assembled
right here in Britain. Those modern, spacious and comfortable trains
now operate for all Stansted Express services—a change that has
been warmly received by
users.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000259">It
may be helpful if I explain that the West Anglia main line, which
serves the airport, is a busy, two-track railway. It provides
metro-style services for passengers within Greater London; longer
distance and commuter services to towns in Essex and Cambridgeshire;
and the Stansted Express airport services. Network Rail and train
operators must ensure that all users are properly served. Government
investment will support future growth 
<?notus-xml column=326?>on the route and improve reliability. The Government’s 2012 rail
investment strategy confirmed an £80 million scheme to deliver
three and four-tracking of the southern section of the route, including
a contribution from the Mayor and Transport for London. In the longer
term, I am aware of stakeholder aspirations for further capacity
enhancements—an issue to which I will come
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000260">The
Stansted Express service provides a frequent connection between the
airport and London. During the day, services run every 15 minutes to
London Liverpool Street station, thereby providing direct connections
to the City of London and making Stansted an attractive airport for
business travellers from around the world. Liverpool Street of course
benefits from good onward connections, including links to four London
underground lines and, from 2019, connections to
Crossrail.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000261">In
addition, all Stansted Express services stop at Tottenham Hale station,
which is in the constituency of the right hon. Member for Tottenham and
is well served by the Victoria line. That is a convenient route for
many airport travellers who wish to gain access to parts of north and
west London. Looking to the future, east London is experiencing
significant growth and, in addition to having the Olympic park and the
Westfield shopping complex, Stratford is becoming a major transport
interchange with connections to two underground
lines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000262">Stansted
passengers of course do not only want to travel between the airport and
London. West Anglia in particular is a thriving region, and its economy
is supported and enhanced by its proximity to Stansted. At present, an
hourly service runs to Birmingham, providing connections to Leicester,
Peterborough and Cambridge—a market that we see as extremely
important and one that we wish to support. The Government are already
working with Abellio Greater Anglia, Network Rail and the airport to
introduce new early morning trains from Cambridge to cater for the
first wave of outbound
flights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000263">We
recognise that there is a desire for more early morning and late night
trains to and from Stansted. The Government are working with train
operating companies and Network Rail to see whether some rail services
can be made available at night or in the early morning, which is when a
great many flights arrive or depart from Stansted. That of course is
also the time when essential maintenance needs to be undertaken on the
line, but if a solution can be found, that will benefit both the
airport’s passengers and the work
force.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212165000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/halltext/140212h0002.htm#140212165000264">In
the interim report, the Airports Commission proposed improvements to
surface access to airports. The Government set out their initial
response to the recommendations in the national infrastructure plan,
published in December. It included accepting the need to study possible
rail improvements at Stansted airport and their interactions with other
growing areas, as identified by the commission. We have instructed
Network Rail fully to consider the needs of the airport as part of its
Anglia route studies, currently due to report in the summer of 2015. In
conclusion, as I am sure the right hon. Gentleman agrees, taking all
that into account, the future of Stansted airport looks very promising
indeed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/F67D01A2E72C7FA96D92AC124B2DB1C38922138F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="12 February 2014">Wednesday

that will run from north Shropshire to the middle of my constituency. I
assure the Minister that I have no intention of making any reference to

Shropshire. Many people do not understand what the project is. Clearly,
there is the 400 kV line, about 50 km long, from north Shropshire to
the middle of my constituency, travelling up the beautiful, narrow
Vrynwy valley. But because that line is dedicated to onshore wind
farms, it is more than reasonable to conclude—in fact, it is
blatantly obvious to anyone—that that will mean that there will
be about 500 extra turbines in mid-Wales on top of what we have
already; there are about 240 wind turbines now. On top of that, there
will be about 100 miles of 132 kV cable criss-crossing Montgomeryshire
all over the place, from the wind farms themselves to the 20-acre hub
station in the middle of the county.</hs_Para>

been convinced that onshore wind power was the right way to go to solve
the UK’s energy demands, but I have always accepted that it had
a part to play in the mix, which is what Government policy usually
says. The mid-Wales connection project became an obvious likelihood in
2005 when the Assembly adopted a policy the consequences of which very
few people understood. I am deeply grateful to Peter Ogden, the
director of the Campaign for the Protection of Rural Wales, who
explained it to me in 2005. I became the president of that organisation

then, that I have always been against onshore wind power in principle,
but mid-Wales has 240 turbines already. Another 500 on top, with all
the power lines as well, is simply beyond the scale of anything that is
reasonable. I wanted to look at the Government’s policy, so I
asked the Library about the issue. I know that the Government have an
overall target of 15% of energy coming from renewable sources by 2020.
I understand that there is no direct policy for targets within that on
specific types of renewable energy, but the Government have
expectations and aspirations, or whatever word we want to use, and the
sort of total that is being looked at is 10 GW to 15 GW for wind
power—that is the figure the Library told me in November. Now, 7
GW have already been installed, a further 6.63 GW are through the
planning process and another 6.33 GW are already in planning. We have
already reached anything that could reasonably be described as the
Government’s expectation. There is no case for taking it any
further.</hs_Para>

at Governments in Europe—Germany, Spain and the European Union
itself—they are identifying that the cost of the subsidies is
unsustainable. Indeed, those countries are all looking to cut back. We
might find that we are committing ourselves in the United Kingdom to a
massively expensive project in mid-Wales, but in 10 years time the
policy behind it will have been abandoned, and we will have stranded
assets. The cost of the project is huge: 10% of the capital investment
will be added on to the cost of everybody’s electricity for the
next 30 years. That is the scale of what happens with such a hugely
expensive project. The only reason National Grid is going forward with
it is because it has a statutory obligation to do so. It makes no sense

submit proposals for new infrastructure to the regulator, Ofgem, and to
the relevant planning authorities. The proposals must be based on a
well-justified need case, such as new generation connection or
maintenance of a safe and secure network. The companies also propose
routes and types of infrastructure, and in doing so they are required
to make a balanced assessment of the benefits of reducing any adverse
environmental and other impacts of new infrastructure against the costs
and technical challenges of doing so following extensive consultation
with stakeholders. Those requirements are set out in their licence
obligations under the Electricity Act 1989 to develop economic and

to the legal requirement to consider the wider impact of new
infrastructure, Ofgem published in July 2013 information for

is reinforced by the Government’s energy national policy
statements. They set out the framework for factors to be considered
when consenting to an infrastructure project of national significance.
They make it clear that for electricity networks cost should not be the

our constituents’ energy bills. I hope that that balanced

recognise that many people feel very strongly about overhead lines and
other network infrastructure, and about the impacts they can have on
the landscape. Effective consultation with local communities and other
interested parties is a vital part of the planning process. When making
proposals for new infrastructure, network companies have to demonstrate
that alternatives were considered and why the preferred option is
justified. That consideration must show that stakeholders have been
engaged effectively.</hs_Para>

Grid has been undertaking a pre-planning applications consultation
within the framework that I set out earlier. Last year, it sought views
on the preferred route option and substation site, including some
undergrounding of lines. National Grid has received more than 200
replies to its latest consultation, which closed in November, and more
than 500 people attended drop-in events that it hosted. That
demonstrates the very strong local interest in the proposals and in
their potential impacts. It also shows that National Grid is engaging
with local communities as it develops its proposals.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend for raising the subject again. It is important that we
understand that although our challenge is to build a low-carbon
economy, based on an energy mix that meets our environmental targets
and security of supply needs, that, in turn, requires an expansion in
the transmission network to accommodate the required new generation.
However, deciding where and how that infrastructure is delivered
requires informed and balanced consideration of a number of factors,
including not only costs, but the environmental impacts and the needs
of local communities, as well as the needs of the country as a
whole.</hs_Para>

infrastructure require that stakeholders are properly consulted on
those important decisions, and that their views are demonstrably taken
into account when the proposals are finalised for final
consultation. That process is now under way in Montgomeryshire and
Shropshire, where National Grid is consulting stakeholders in
developing its proposals. I strongly encourage those with an interest
to continue to engage with National Grid in that process and to help
ensure that the right decisions are made. I again thank my hon. Friend

further pilot to develop clear information to: inform on the need for
any action against individuals; support the development of a fraud risk

correspondents for linkage to fraud and right to remain in the UK. The

witnessed increasing levels of violence throughout December 2013 and
early January 2014 with reports of up to 1,000 civilian deaths in and
around the capital Bangui. This was largely due to the growth in
reprisal attacks by local self-defence (“anti-Balaka”)
groups and rebels associated with the Seleka coalition who overthrew
President Bozize in 2013. The rapid deployment of African Union (AU)
and French troops has led to some improvements in security, and the
nomination of Catherine Samba-Panza as President is a positive step in
the transition to a stable Government. But there are still disturbing
levels of violence. The UN estimates that 838,000 people remain

first component to any sustained improvement to conditions in CAR. The
UK is providing bilateral support to the AU through the provision of
£2 million to the AU to cover immediate MISCA shortfalls,
including food, fuel and water. We also make a contribution, through EU
funds, to the mission’s logistical support. I have continued to
demonstrate the UK’s political support for MISCA including in

secure environment in the Bangui area. The Government believe that such
an operation could make a real difference to the security situation on

11 February, in their capacity as the leaders of the Greek Cypriot and
Turkish Cypriot communities respectively, President Anastasiades and Dr
Eroglu met under United Nations auspices. The joint declaration they
adopted is an important step forward, and provides a real opportunity
to secure a lasting and comprehensive settlement. That document makes
clear the two leaders’ determination to resume structured
negotiations leading to a united Cyprus, and their intention to reach a
settlement as soon as possible. The declaration includes a range of
agreements both on the conduct of talks and on the shape of the future
federation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="140212170000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/wmstext/140212m0001.htm#140212170000092">The

Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Steve
Webb):</Member></B> Integral to the single-tier reforms is the closure
of the state second pension. Contracting out of the state second
pension for defined benefit schemes—giving up entitlement in
return for a broadly similar occupational pension and payment of lower
national insurance (NI) rate for employer and employee—will
therefore come to an end. All employees will pay the same rate of
national insurance and become entitled to state pension in the same
way. The state pension system will be significantly simpler as a
result.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="140212182000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/wmstext/140212m0001.htm#140212182000344">The
Government’s objectives for managing the end of
contracting out are to minimise the impacts on employers, schemes and
individuals, ensuring that the administrative processes of ending
contracting out are as smooth and as simple as possible; to ensure
amounts built up in schemes to 2016 continue to be paid; and to
ensure that the sustainability of defined benefit pension
schemes is not undermined. The Government are allowing private sector
employers who face paying an increased rate of national insurance to
make limited 
<?notus-xml column=62?>changes to their pension scheme rules to recoup some or all of the
additional costs they face subject to the will of
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="140212182000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/wmstext/140212m0001.htm#140212182000345">There
is a small group of individuals (approximately 60,000) employed in some
formerly nationalised industries (rail including Transport for London,
electricity, coal, nuclear waste and decommissioning), where the
employers and trustees are limited in their ability to change scheme
rules by legislation made during
privatisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="140212182000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/wmstext/140212m0001.htm#140212182000346">On
18 January 2013, the Government published a public consultation
“Abolition of contracting out—consultation on a statutory
override for Protected Persons Regulations”. The consultation
invited views from stakeholders as to whether or not these employers
should be permitted to use the statutory override to change their
pension scheme rules for employees covered by the protected persons
legislation. The consultation ran until 14 March 2013 and attracted 145
responses.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="140212182000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/wmstext/140212m0001.htm#140212182000347">We
had to consider the best and fairest course of action in an area where
the arguments are both finely balanced and highly polarised. The
Government have decided that it should honour the promises that were
made at the time of privatisation and which, in many cases, have been
affirmed by Government Ministers subsequently. The Government think it
is reasonable that issues arising from the end of contracting out for
this small number of workers should be resolved through negotiation.
Therefore the Government propose that employers should not be allowed
to use the statutory override to alter their pension schemes in
relation to members with protected person
status.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="140212182000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/wmstext/140212m0001.htm#140212182000348">We

comment on the merits or otherwise of any application. The

because local authority councillors are elected to represent the views
of local people and, in the main, it is these councillors who are in

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.

offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty
is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>1</Sup>

sought the views of potential providers from across all sectors. We
consulted widely and published our response to the market feedback last

refinements to the payment mechanism. The revised payment mechanism has
now been made available to bidders as part of the competition exercise

prisoners stems from the NOMS review of the women's custodial estate.
Part of the outcome of the review was that all women's prisons should
be designated resettlement prisons in order to ensure that women
prisoners in every establishment have access to resettlement services.
Most resettlement prisons for women prisoners will serve more than one
contract package area (CPA) so that as many providers of probation
services will have access to their area's cohort of prisoners as is
operationally viable.</hs_Para>

required to meet the 104 weeks past presence test. There are exceptions
for people such as those serving as members of the armed forces and
their families, or if European law applies. Ministers have no
discretion to waive conditions of entitlement like the past presence
test, which are laid down in legislation. People who claimed a
disability benefit before 8 April 2013 when the 104 weeks past presence
test was introduced would have been expected to meet a 26 weeks past

Murrison:</Member></B> When an individual joins the armed forces they
are registered with the Defence Medical Services (DMS) and a new DMS
medical record is created. Their NHS medical record from before this
period is 'frozen' and held by the NHS in a central location. The NHS
record is held until the individual registers with an NHS general
practitioner on leaving service. At this point the NHS medical record
is posted to the new GP. The service leaver is provided with a summary
of their DMS medical record (FMed 133) to give to their new NHS GP. The
FMed 133 also includes instructions on how the NHS GP can request their
full DMS medical
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212187001976" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/text/140212w0003.htm#140212187001976">In
some cases, an individual may not hand over their FMed 133 to their new
NHS GP, or make clear that they are a veteran. Since December 2013,
therefore, on registration with an NHS GP, the individual's previous
NHS record is sent to the GP with a letter included in it. This letter
informs the NHS GP that the patient has been under the care of the DMS.
It also gives details of how the GP can obtain the individual's full
DMS medical record from the MOD, if they deem it
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212187001977" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/text/140212w0003.htm#140212187001977">Over
the next 12 months, work will continue to develop the systems further
to allow for a summary of in-service care to be included with the NHS
record when it is sent to the NHS GP. It is anticipated that this will
be (or will be similar to) the FMed 133. This will ensure that the NHS
GP will know that they are dealing with a veteran and will
automatically give them a summary of their military medical record. The
NHS GP will also know how they can get a copy of the full DMS medical
history if they decide that they require
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140212187001978" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140212/text/140212w0003.htm#140212187001978">Review
of the original NHS and DMS medical records to identify the diagnoses
made and treatment regimes recommended are a matter for the new NHS
GP.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/Index/8E39AFEF9AF82595F0AD374B86BD379C378D3F99" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="19" cday="Wednesday" cmonth="February" cyear="2014" date="12" day="Wednesday" issue="122" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="5@010c00" printing="daily" session="201314" type="back" volume="575" year="2014"><title col="829">Oral
