considering the Electoral Commission’s recent report and its
three main recommendations and will respond in the coming months. We
welcome the commission’s finding that electoral fraud is not
widespread and agree that we should continue to consider ways to
safeguard electoral integrity. That is why the Government are
introducing individual electoral registration from June this year,
which will help make registration more
secure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hanham" PimsId="3741" UID="14020661000619" xid="1742" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000619">Baroness
Hanham (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that
reply. I am sure that many Members of this House will welcome the
proposals in the package put forward by the Electoral Commission to be
introduced by 2014. However, it proposes to leave the introduction of
one area until 2020: individual identification at polling stations. In
responding to the report, will the Government consider encouraging the
commission to bring that forward, as it is a very important aspect of
preventing
fraud<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:13:12"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000004"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="14020661000620" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000620">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, the Government are
considering that although I have to say that Ministers are not yet
convinced of its desirability. We all know from the American experience
that demanding qualifications and identification at polling stations
tends to discourage people from going to vote and we do not wish to
discourage people from going to vote. There is less evidence of
personation at polling stations than there is of multiple
registration—ghost voters being put on the register—or of
postal vote fraud, so we are not yet persuaded that the response is
proportionate to the problem we
face<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:13:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Campbell-Savours (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, is it not interesting to
note in the detail of the report that the Electoral Commission is
finally prepared to recognise that there are high-risk areas, which it
identifies and lists, which are identifiable as having ethnic minority
populations, where it believes that there is a particular problem? Is
it not true that if the commission had been prepared to admit that four
years ago, when the legislation was introduced, we could have avoided
spending tens of millions of pounds on an individual registration
scheme, which is a total waste of public money, and could have targeted
that resource on the areas where there is a particular problem? We are
wasting public money on a scheme which is utterly
ridiculous<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:14:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000006"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="14020661000622" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000622">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I entirely disagree with
the noble Lord on that. We are one of the few democracies that clings
to the 19th century approach of household registration. Individual
electoral registration is much more appropriate to the population we

already said that the most prevalent problem in the past has been
fraudulent use of the postal vote system, is he confident that the
returning officers, who will now have to check personal identifiers for
every single postal vote returned, will have the necessary resources
this year to deal with that? Will he assure the House that a proper and
careful review will be carried out in advance of the 2014 elections to
make sure that the system works much better than it has done in the
past in this respect in preparation for a higher turnout, presumably,

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, coming back to the
point raised by my noble friend and the issue of potential
impersonation at polling stations, does the Minister recognise that in
some places, particularly Birmingham, there are instances in which
large crowds of men gather outside schools and intimidate some voters
to prevent their going into vote? Does the noble Lord agree that that
is what attention should be focused on and that the police need to be
advised that they should take action when it

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I do a lot of my politics
in Bradford, as the noble Lord knows, and I am well aware of the
differences between the local problems we have with the voting system.
One of the reasons that the new regulations allow for police community
support officers to be present in polling stations is precisely to deal
with that sort of occasional outbreak of intimidation. There is, as we
all know, a problem of registration fraud—ghost voters being put
on the register—but, again, it is localised. As I am sure all
noble Lords know, this is much more of a problem for local elections
than for parliamentary
elections<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:17:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Indeed, the Electoral Commission looked at the Northern Ireland scheme
in particular and has estimated that if we were to extend it to Great
Britain, with likely take-up, based on the Northern Ireland model, of
10%—mostly young voters—it would cost some £28
million<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:17:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question with the electoral registration officer of Kirklees the summer
before last, including the authority’s co-operation with the
police. We all know that there are pockets of problems within Kirklees.
It is a matter for local co-operation with the police, who are well
aware of this. We are also well aware that there is a certain tendency
in some local elections for candidates to use allegations of electoral
fraud against each other as part of the local campaign. That is one of
the reasons why the police are occasionally a little sceptical about
allegations being thrown around during the

custody aged between 18 and 24 and to identify actions to
prevent further deaths. The review will be led by the noble Lord, Lord
Harris of Haringey, who I see is in his place. He is the chair of the

Ramsbotham (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for that positive response, but I am sorry that the review’s
remit does not include children aged under 18. Since January 2011, 16
young adults aged between 18 and 21 have taken their own lives in
custody and, worryingly, eight of those deaths have occurred in the
last four months. All of them took place in adult prisons, to which it
is currently the policy to send young adults rather than to young
offender
institutions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:21:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<I>Suicide is Everyone’s Concern</I>, in 1999, I made specific
recommendations regarding the safety of young people, yet year after
year the same old failings following young suicides are
recorded in inspection and inquest reports, such as the lack of
institutional understanding of, or attention paid to, the particular
needs of that vulnerable age group. Now the Ministry of Justice plans
to create secure colleges—fortified schools—for under-18s
and, as I have mentioned already, to put all those aged over 18 into
adult prisons, both of which could exacerbate existing flaws and create
significant risk to young lives. Does the Minister accept that a degree
of urgency exists and will he consider advancing the time by
which the noble Lord, Lord Harris, is required to complete his review

attention to the problem of the deaths of young people in custody. I
welcome the Minister’s announcement today, although I continue
to share some of the concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham.
There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:27:46"></hs_TimeCode> is
continuing concern about the incidence of self-harm and suicide among
women prisoners, who form 5% of the prison population but account for
one-third of the incidence of self-harm and four times the number of
suicides as men. They are 36 times more likely to commit suicide or die
of an accidental overdose of drugs in the first two weeks after
release. It is time for a radical change of policy in relation to the
imprisonment of women and especially in the practice of
segregation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:28:20"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:28:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Faulks" PimsId="5823" UID="14020661000644" xid="2086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000644">Lord
Faulks:</Member></B> My Lords, we have been working hard to improve
support for women in prison. We have issued gender-specific standards
in all areas of prison regimes, including training for staff working
with female offenders in prisons, which has now been extended to
service providers in the community. New search arrangements ending
routine full searching for women prisoners have also been introduced.
The House will know that there are six mother and baby units in England

am slightly surprised at the noble Lord’s statistics. He is
right that my research into this matter shows that women are
disproportionately more likely to self-harm than men, relative to their
occupation of prisons. Fortunately, the self-harm, compared with
men’s self-harm, does not tend to be as serious, and does not
usually require hospitalisation, although I do not suggest for a moment
that any self-harm is not a significant factor. The statistics that I
have been given do not indicate that women form a large part of those
who have been responsible for self-inflicted deaths. I will write to
the noble Lord with statistics. I hesitate to bandy them across the
Dispatch Box but I do not think he is quite

expanded following the application of Article 2 of the European

carried out. Although the Government, because of the restricted
financial circumstances, have had to make various cutbacks in legal

Prisoners are screened on arrival in prison by a trained nurse to find
out their health needs, and people with mental health problems who
might be vulnerable to suicide are referred for a mental health
assessment. All prisoners have access to an on-site healthcare team
which deals with most problems. If a prisoner is suffering from a
severe mental health illness, they may be transferred to a
secure hospital. Approximately 1,200 prisoners with a severe mental
illness are transferred to NHS secure services. We recognise that
prison may not be the most appropriate place and we are developing
liaison and diversion services, together with the Department of Health
and the Home Office, to ensure that people who are vulnerable are
identified and can be diverted, if necessary, away from the criminal

the National Asset Register and they are in place to prevent further
increases in levels of flood water. The pumping operation is in fact
one of the largest that the country has seen. My right

its priorities right on the floods? It says that it does not want to do
any dredging. I was told by one of its officers that there is no point
in dredging, because there is a high tide and the water is coming in,
but it must understand that there is also a low tide and it can go out.
I had an e-mail this morning from the Environment Agency about the
Dawlish Warren, and 
<?notus-xml column=265?>as we know the railway will be closed for six weeks. The agency says
that it will study the bird movement on the beach over the next year to

are now liable to flooding at this time. The pledge from the Prime

will be about funding. I am told by colleagues and friends in Somerset
that the people there are collecting money. They are looking
to raise £1.4 million to deal with dredging and whatever is
necessary. While we must of course take responsibility for many things
that happen within our communities, the people of Somerset should not
have to foot any of the bills in relation to flooding, and future
flooding and defences. May I suggest that once the present crisis has
passed, the Minister will give an undertaking that the Government will
look at the funds allocated to Defra and how they
are allocated within it? It seems to me that something is not quite

it would be true to say that Ofwat has interpreted its economic

been interpreted rather weakly. The five-yearly price review looks at
financing long-term infrastructure as well as immediate business and
householder water supply demands. In this Bill, there is yet more
emphasis on social and environmental considerations. As the next but

interest of the consumer—the need for water at affordable

an economic regulator, Ofwat should act not only in the current
interest of consumers, or the next-five-years’ interest, but in
the long-term interest of both current consumers and future consumers.
That duty fits more clearly with resilience and sustainability
considerations or objectives. My amendment would make that clear. It
would make it clear that Ofwat’s responsibility, as laid down
simply in terms of consumers in the 1991 Act and repeated thereafter,
should apply also to future consumers. We made a similar change
regarding Ofgem in the Energy Act passed by the Labour Government in
2008. Ofgem has responsibility for future consumers. Some might argue
that that has not made a dramatic difference to Ofgem’s
deliberations, but at least that responsibility is clearly there. It
has had the effect of holding it responsible for such longer-term

underestimated the effect of the change to the primary duties of Ofgem
in the 2008 Act, which states that the duties for present and future
customers are one of the underlying bases of its commitment to
sustainability. The problem that it faces is that the limitations of
the sustainable action that should be undertaken have not yet been
tested. I had the fun of suggesting to Ofwat that we could take it to
judicial review to suggest that it was not fulfilling this pledge. That
had an enormous effect on Ofgem. Ofgem should be commended for the
strides that have been taken over the past six years to move from an
organisation that saw sustainability as something outside its remit to
seeing it as something that is very much part of its remit. The value
of this—an amendment first moved by the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, to which I added my name—is such that it has changed
the culture of Ofgem. It is rather unfortunate that Ofwat does not have

customers well for decades or even centuries to come, this is why we
have introduced the new duty of resilience, which requires Ofwat to
secure the long-term resilience of systems to the long-term pressures
identified in the water White Paper, such as climate change,
environmental pressures and population growth. It also requires Ofwat

Whitehall that just because there were references to it in other

perhaps go back to his own officials and say, “Well, yes, it may

Bill a duty on Ofwat to further sustainable development. This has not
been a short debate; it started a number of years ago and follows on
from debates that we had in relation to Ofgem, about how you bring the

wording of the previous amendment—I will have to check
this—referred not just to present and future customers but to
acting for the good of present and future customers. This comes to the
heart of the problem that I see in the Bill. We have a greater
understanding of the changes that have taken place in the environment.
I believe that climate change is a fact: anybody standing up to their
waist in water on the Somerset Levels at the moment would believe that
we live in a situation where the climate is changing. Of course, the
problem is that, at a time when there are 
<?notus-xml column=270?>floods, the idea of drought seems somehow very distant. However, it was
not very long ago that we were actively discussing
droughts.</hs_para>

“That’s fine; we have an agreement with Thames Water that
we will get water whatever happens”. I am not sure that the

be dealt with because it just comes out of the tap and you pay for as
much as you want. With a population that is growing so rapidly,
however, and with the constraints we are facing in our urban areas, we
are going to face real issues about the amount of water that we can
actually use. Therefore, putting in the Bill the word
“sustainability” would change the very nature of how
Ofwat would go about its duties. It should look not just at the

issue I would look at most closely is water efficiency. That is a duty
for the water companies but not for Ofwat. Ofwat sets the funding in
five-year cycles. If it does not make it a main priority, the water
companies will not see it as one. It is a bit like with local
authorities: if something is not statutory at the moment, such as local
museums, it gets cut. Without water efficiency being set as a priority,
Ofwat will not make it one. I say this because water efficiency is
actually down to the actions that we take as individuals. Everybody
sitting in this Chamber uses far too much water. We are some of the
most profligate water users in the world. We must change our behaviour
and realise that water is a scarce resource. We probably have to train
people to understand that they must change their businesses. I must
declare an interest as I am the chief executive of the Energy Managers
Association. Most energy managers see water as a major cost to their
business and are doing a lot to reduce that cost. Of course,
there is also a major energy cost. About 1 kilowatt of energy is used
to get water to you and 1 kilowatt to deal with sewage taken from you.
There is a massive carbon and energy cost in
water.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000084">I very
much hope that the Minister will agree to look at water efficiency and
maybe even at adding to resilience the issue of catchment areas. Of
course, that is the issue we are all talking about at the moment. If he
did that, sustainability would not be an issue that I felt needed to be
taken to the next stage. However, if the Minister decides that the
Government have gone far enough and they will not take this issue any
further, at the next stage I will obviously seek support from around
the House to vote on this issue. It is core to the whole Bill. The
White Paper setting out what would be in the Bill had water efficiency
through almost every page, yet it is not mentioned in the Bill. That is
a fundamental flaw of the Bill at the moment. I very much hope that the
Minister will agree to have a discussion on this issue between now and

the fervency with which my noble friend Lord Redesdale promotes the
cause of sustainable development. Who could disagree with him that the
sustainable use of water is clearly desirable? But does the more
specific mention of sustainable development in the Bill help towards
those causes or duplicate what is already there and in previous
legislation? Does it give a much clearer direction to Ofwat? None of us
would dispute that the major issue that must be addressed is long-term
sustainable management of water resources. None of us disputes that the
new resilience duties on Ofwat are extremely helpful. However, my noble
friend Lord Redesdale did not remind us that this issue of whether the
situations of Ofgem and Ofwat are totally parallel was looked at by the
Gray review in 2011, the advice of which was to reject that. I accept
that the Government rejected much other advice—from
the Cave review and others—so that is not a
roadblock. However, it must be recognised that there are already duties
on Ofwat to promote sustainable
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000086">I
am always a little nervous about those who find themselves supporting
sustainable development. The concept has three pillars: the economic
benefits, the societal benefits and the environmental benefits, all of
which must be interconnected. The argument put forward by my noble
friend Lord Redesdale was almost entirely based on the environmental
and water efficiency benefits. Those are very worthy and very
important, but I have also heard sustainable development prayed in aid
of some pretty harsh economic messages. Clearly, that is not an
appropriate way to interpret it. Is the Minister really sure that this
is going to help clarify to Ofwat’s roles? I am not as convinced

was green with envy that the environmental regulators will now have the

the National Rivers Authority when I was in almost continual friendly
conflict—I emphasise the word
“friendly”—with Ian Byatt the economic regulator.
It was so friendly that I have two cartoons at home, which were sent to
me by a notable newspaper, showing both of us in the boxing ring. In
the first, we are engaged in a vigorous fight, and the second shows us
collapsing together exhausted at the end of the exchange. We have made
huge progress since then, and the existing sustainable development
duty, as I understand it, is now being given statutory authority in the
Bill. The clear steer that has been provided by the Government is now
being given statutory effect in the Bill. As I understand it, Ofwat now
has sustainable development as a central objective. It will have to
take account of that. It will have to carry out its functions in

we would gain. If there is nothing to be lost by including it, I would
not be against including it. Against the background of a huge step

Parminter (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Redesdale for raising this issue yet again. He has done so on numerous
occasions, as have many other noble Lords. It is an important debate.
It is quite clear that the Government are committed to sustainable
development, but they believe that they do not need to elevate the
primary duty of sustainable development for the regulator in the water
industry because it has a secondary duty. What they are prepared to
give is the new primary duty for resilience. I think we are going to
carry on arguing about whether resilience delivers the environmental
and social benefits that those of us who are concerned about
sustainable development believe it does. The Government say it does and
I am sure that the Minister will reiterate today that he believes that
resilience will deliver the sustainable benefits that we believe are
crucial for the regulator to deliver. There are others who believe that
the resilience duty does not.</hs_para>

on what my noble friend Lord Redesdale has said. We should try and move
the debate on from arguing about what “sustainable
development” and “resilience” mean to what we
actually want to achieve. It is significant that my noble friend Lord
Redesdale raised the issue of water efficiency. That is, bluntly, what
we want to achieve—a more resilient future for our water
industry which protects the scarce resources that we have, to the
benefit of the environment and communities. I urge the Minister to
reflect again between now and Report on a duty to promote water
efficiency. I think that is a constructive way forward. There will be a
difference between those of us who believe resilience is sufficient and
those of us who would have liked to see a primary duty on the
regulator. I do not think the Government are going to move, but I do
think that a duty to look at the issue of water efficiency is a helpful

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I have tabled an amendment in this group
which attempts to deal in a slightly different way with exactly the
same issue as the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale. Which is
the closest approximation to perfection I am not entirely sure, and
whether either of them is perfectible in the eyes of the Government, I
am not entirely sure.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020661000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000092">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:14:22"></hs_TimeCode>
do have an issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, stated the
current situation correctly. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell,
that, since 2003, Ofwat has had a sustainable development
responsibility but it is a secondary objective. What these amendments
attempt to do is to
put<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:14:28"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:14:28"></hs_TimeCode>
it on a par with the economic objective for consumers. There is an
economic, a social and an environmental dimension of sustainability
which 
<?notus-xml column=274?>goes wider than that responsibility to consumers, now and in the future.
The reason why relations and general coherence are better than the
early days which the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, described, is that
Ofwat has recognised that it is more than an economic regulator, and
the Environment Agency has recognised that it has economic objectives
as well as environmental objectives. Some of those have become a little
controversial in recent days, in that, for example, flood defence
priorities are determined largely in terms of economic effect. Both
agencies now have all three—certainly environmental and economic
objectives—which they routinely integrate within their
operations. For that reason it is slightly odd that there is a
differential between the objectives to consumers on the economic side
and the objectives of sustainability on the other side, in terms of
Ofwat’s requirements. The Government have made two attempts at
convincing those of us who are interested in this subject through some
very well written briefs. There were much more understandable than the
Bill itself, or indeed the Explanatory Notes. By and large, I
understood those briefs; they have nevertheless failed to convince me.
They are arguing in terms that are now obsolete. They argue that
the economic regulator is Ofwat and the environmental
regulator is the EA. They both overlap and they need to operate a
coherent approach to this in relation to
sustainability.</hs_para>

Government have moved significantly, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Parminter, was hinting, in stretching the definition of
“resilience”. Resilience is a jolly good, robust term. We
all approve of resilience, and long-term resilience is clearly a
responsibility of Ofwat and indeed the EA, in relation to water
resources and their delivery. It is not quite the same as
sustainability. It is part of sustainability but it is not the
totality. The noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, have
both pointed to the energy efficiency dimension, which, let us be fair,
has been lacking until at least very recently in some of Ofwat’s
priorities, when it allows expenditure during the price review. It is
that which worries people—that this issue will fall
out.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020661000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000094">The
Minister told me the other day that resilience includes social
resilience; it presumably therefore includes issues of affordability
and access as well as environmental and social issues. That may be so
but the normal meaning of “resilience” is protection and
upgrading of the assets that you have, and which need a long-term
permanence to protect them. The Government are in danger of stretching
the term rather beyond what the <I>Oxford English Dictionary</I> would

now because there are anxieties. I do not agree with what the noble

do agree largely with what the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, said. The

of the suspicion out there, in view of recent months, is that there are
forces within the Government who regard any reference to sustainability

has been mentioned before in this House and if it is out of order, I
will withdraw it. However, it has been widely reported. If the
Government being so illogically resistant to the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Redesdale, is seen to be part of the attack on
green measures, then I regret that. The Government have to reassure the
many people who are interested in the long-term future of water supply
and the ecological and economic sustainability thereof. Given my
support for the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, I hope that the Government
will recognise that they need to do something on this front. I look

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I turn first to Amendments 110 to
112, in the name of my noble friend Lord Redesdale. I thank him for
them, as I thank my noble friends Lord Selborne, Lord Crickhowell and
Lady Parminter and the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for their comments on
these amendments, which would extend the new duty of resilience so that
it became a dual duty of resilience and sustainable development. Of
course, as my noble friend knows well, Ofwat has had a stand-alone
statutory duty to contribute to the achievement of sustainable
development since 2005. The Government have reinforced the importance
of this duty by providing clear statutory guidance that sustainable
development is central to everything that Ofwat does and must be fully
embedded throughout its regulatory decision-making. We also require an
annual report from Ofwat on its contribution to sustainable
development.</hs_para>

friend Lord Redesdale has a long-standing interest in this issue, and I
am particularly grateful to him for his assiduousness in pursuing this.
He wishes, understandably, to see meaningful changes to culture and
practice in economic regulation in water. These changes are already
taking place: by correcting the historic bias towards capital
investment, for example, the current price review looks set to achieve
a much more equitable balance between capital and operational solutions
than has previously been the case. Similarly, Ofwat has been working
with the industry and Infrastructure UK to halt the stop-start pattern
of work, sometimes described as “cyclical investment”,
that has been a cause for concern in this sector for many years. Again,
we are seeing measurable changes in behaviour. Ofwat has recently given
permission to water companies to bring forward £100 million of
investment into 2014 to smooth the investment profile and benefit the
wider water supply chain.</hs_para>

we are not and must not be complacent. That is why we have created a
new duty of resilience, designed to address the specific issues

<?notus-xml column=276?>The resilience duty encompasses all the activities that water companies
can undertake to manage those pressures: from investing in the
additional water storage, to tackling unsustainable abstraction, to

raised by people such as my noble friend, I am delighted that we have
already amended this duty in another place to be absolutely explicit
about the need to manage water resources sustainably and to manage
demand to alleviate pressures on those precious resources. I think that
I can say that our amendments have been welcomed, for example by the
coalition of environmental NGOs with a particular interest in this
area, the Blueprint for Water, with which my noble friend has been
closely involved. I met this coalition recently, and it expressed
itself satisfied with what we had done in this regard. I therefore hope
that I will be able to persuade my noble friend that, given the changes
already made, further amendment of the kind he proposes is not
required.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000102">Turning
to Amendment 113 in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Whitty and Lord
Grantchester, the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has argued that elevating
the existing sustainable development duty to primary status would help
us to achieve a wide range of important objectives. Let me be quite
clear: the Government support those objectives. As I said in the debate
on the previous group, we want to see the regulatory regime for water
recognise more clearly the needs of future, as well as current,
consumers. We recognise the need for a strategic response to climate
change, and we firmly believe that catchment management and demand
management should form a mainstream part of water company
activity.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020661000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000103">The
Government commissioned the Ofwat review to consider the case for
elevating the sustainable development duty as proposed by the noble
Lords. Having looked carefully at the arguments, David Gray concluded
that he simply did not believe that the creation of a primary
sustainable development duty would have the effect that its proponents
were looking for. Despite the scepticism of the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, therefore, while we—and I speak for the entire
Government—remain fully committed to the principles of
sustainable development, we do not believe that the amendment is the
best way to achieve the objectives that the noble Lords wish to see. I
also believe that we should recognise where changes have already begun
to take place. I have already spoken about the way Ofwat’s new
price review methodology, to which the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
referred, has addressed the industry’s perceived preference for
capital investment, resulting in the companies bringing forward
business plans that propose a much more even split between capital and
operational expenditure, such as demand management
activity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000104">During
our particularly constructive Second Reading debate, a number of noble
Lords highlighted the importance of taking a proportionate approach to
changes to Ofwat’s duties. Of course, it must be right 
<?notus-xml column=277?>that we should occasionally amend the duties to ensure that they remain
up to date with the Government’s policy priorities. This is what
we have done in the case of the resilience duty, in order to reflect
the core policy message of the water White Paper on the need to build
the long-term resilience of the sector. We have amended this provision
in another place to emphasise that this must include the sustainable
management of water resources. However, I agree that we must
demonstrate restraint in applying new duties to the regulator; and the
changes that we have already proposed strike the appropriate balance. I
must therefore ask my noble friend to withdraw his
amendment.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/B109B4408445D59E0416E51360CF6B20CAF80B46" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2014">Thursday,

and<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:24:58"></hs_TimeCode> the noble
Lord, Lord Crickhowell, raised very interesting points. I will make two
points. First, the battles that the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell,
undertook, which were incredibly valuable, are not now taking place in
the same way. Most groups agree that there has been a shift from the
regulator against the balanced approach to economic environmental
regulations. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, raised the Gray review. I
met Mr Gray to discuss this; one of his recommendations was that it is
fine, because the Environment Agency leads on policy on this area, and
therefore deals with this issue. Since the review, however, the
Environment Agency has lost that ability, so it is out of kilter.
Things have moved on so that the balance which the regulator has to
take—and I understand the difficulties it faces between price,
social cohesion and environment, which is tricky—has to be dealt
with. However, the problem is that the regulator is seen as not meeting
that
objective<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:26:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000107">The
Minister talked about meeting with the NGOs. I believe he met with the
RSPB and the WWF, but those are not all the NGOs that make up Blueprint
for Water. I have discussed this with Blueprint for Water, and meeting
with one, two or three NGOs out of a group of them is always slightly
difficult. The whole group does not believe that, but those two NGOs
will speak on their behalf. Therefore the Minister’s view that
the Bill does not need amending to expand the role of resilience, even
though it was amended in the other place, was unfortunate. It leaves no
option when we come to the next stage but to try to force through
sustainability as a solution to that problem. That may not be the
simplest way of dealing with this issue, but, as was proved by
Ofgem’s change in attitude, it does have an effect. Therefore it
is rather unfortunate that the Minister has not agreed even to have
discussions on this. Although I shall withdraw the amendment, I hope to
bring it back at the next stage because this is a core
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:27:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000108">This
is not a political matter, which is why I very carefully did not ask
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, or any other noble Lords to put their
names to this amendment. This is about whether we believe that 
<?notus-xml column=278?>water should be a sustainable resource and whether there is somehow a
political lever. Most people in this country do not believe that water
should be dealt with in a political context; it is about whether we
have it or not and whether the regulator makes sure that we judiciously
use this resource. If that means that I am a wishy-washy liberal, I sit
on these Benches so I am quite happy to be described in those
terms—and not as one of abuse. However, the Conservative Party
talked about being the “greenest Government ever” and the
coalition has moved forward on many of these green policies, so I find
it incredible that we are bringing politics into this area.
Therefore I hope that the Government will think again about a water
efficiency duty. On that basis, I beg leave to withdraw the

discuss this topic at this stage as it is not something that you can

found the silence of the Bill on this issue even more surprising when I

have been aware of it—commissioned by Defra and published in
2009, entitled, <I>The Independent Review of Charging for Household
Water and Sew</I><I>er</I><I>age Services</I> by Anna Walker. This
seems to me an exhaustive and thoughtful report which could have formed
the basis for part of the Bill. It includes a very thorough discussion
of the advantages and disadvantages of metering private water supplies
and was the outcome of extensive and wide consultation. It also gives
considerable attention to the concomitant problems of water poverty
that go hand in hand with energy poverty. It seems to me that the only
respect in which the conclusions of the report are marginally less
relevant today than when they were published is that in the intervening
years we have become even more painfully aware of the challenges of
water stress and the rate at which our weather patterns are
changing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:32:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000114">Walker’s
consultations gave a clear message that two views are strongly held by
the public. One is that metering is the fairest way of charging for
water. Another equally strongly held view is that metering should be
voluntary for existing householders. She noted, however, that the
majority of householders found that their water charges fell after
meters were installed. The report makes the point that the overriding
argument for metering water supplies and charging by volume is
fairness. There is no other commodity for which we do not pay according
to use, particularly when that commodity can be in short supply. I am
told that we are the only country in Europe that does not charge for
water by volume. That is not something that I have been able to verify
independently, but it seems plausible. Metering has the benefit of
making people realise that water is not a free good of which there is a
boundless supply. Before and after comparisons suggest that demand
tends to fall by 15% to 20% after meters are installed. This may mean
that expensive improvements to the system that would otherwise have
been necessary are not needed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>The main
disadvantage of metering is that meters can be costly to install, and
inconvenient and costly to read. Typically, they are located at the

metering technology is changing and smart meters can transmit usage
information to water suppliers and alert householders to leaks or other
unintended releases of water on their property. Over the next few
years, costs for meters can be expected to fall and the means of
reading them remotely will improve. I declare an interest as a director
of a company that works in the area of smart meters.</hs_para>

today? I am not going to delve into the plethora of regulations that
cover water metering. We are in a situation in which we may in future
need to be much more nimble in dealing with challenging and novel
weather, and where new technology is becoming available to help deal
with it. One possible way forward is to separate the authority to
install a water meter from the authority to use it for
charging—an important distinction—and to make it easy for
any supplier that wants to install meters throughout a particular area
to do so. The reason for this is that installing meters for a whole
street or area is much less expensive than doing it piecemeal. Water
suppliers could equip a whole area but then use meters to charge only
those who had opted in. However, the presence of a metering capability
in an area would improve resilience and allow a more rapid response to
a change in water stress conditions than is possible at
present.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000117">My
question for the Minister, therefore, is in tune with present
Government initiatives: why not completely or significantly deregulate
the installation of water meters and allow suppliers to install them
when they wish, while continuing to regulate their use for charging?
The need to be more agile in response to changing conditions and the
availability of more effective and cheaper technology means that such
an easing of red tape would have benefits both for suppliers and
consumers. I beg to move.</hs_para>

water efficiency support and tackle leaks. On that point, perhaps I may
say how welcome it is that this Bill transfers the responsibility for
supply pipes from customers to water companies as this should help to
drive down leakages. The case for smart metering, combined with advice
on how to reduce water usage, and social tariffs that minimise
affordability issues for disadvantaged heavy-use households, is strong,

reluctance to expand the use of water meters. I know that there is an
installation cost involved and that it will take time. The potential
costs of installation could be fairly significant, as the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh, pointed out, and of course meters have a limited life and
will need to be replaced over time. However, these costs need to be set
against the fact that metered customers use between 10% and 15% less

Flooding in winter and drought in summer could become much more
frequent occurrences than has been the case historically, and water
stress could become a reality well beyond the south and east of
England. Even using the existing definition, we are likely to see a
requirement for increased water use. Better, I would suggest, that we
should extend the option of charging now in anticipation of the

meter from their water company. The company must then fit a meter,
which it does free of charge. All the companies also allow their
customers a cooling-off period of one year should they wish to revert
to paying according to rateable value. As a result, there is a
permissive position there. On the very rare occasions where fitting a
meter 
<?notus-xml column=284?>would be disproportionately costly, the company offers an assessed

addressing here. There are circumstances, as noble Lords have noted, in
which this restriction does not apply, which are set out in the Water
Industry (Prescribed Conditions) Regulations 1999. For example,
companies whose areas of appointment have been designated by the

meter all their customers, if they considered that this would enable
them to meet their statutory duty to supply water or their statutory
duty to promote the efficient use of water. About 41% of all homes
already have a meter, and we expect this to rise to 50% by 2015.
Anglian Water and South West Water already have 70% metering. A number
of companies in areas of serious water stress are in the process of
rolling out universal metering or have plans to do so. These include
Southern Water, Thames Water, Sutton and East Surrey Water, Affinity
Water and South East Water.
Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T12:52:31"></hs_TimeCode> Lords have

we must recognise that the costs and benefits of metering vary from
region to region. The evidence suggests that benefits on a scale that
outweigh the costs of metering will only be found in areas where
incentivising reduced water usage is of critical importance—that
is to say, water-stressed areas, where universal metering is already a
possibility. As I have noted, we are concerned that there are costs
associated with implementing universal metering, which are funded
through the bills of all customers in the region. We have always been
clear that, with climate change and population growth, the case for
universal metering may change, but it may do so at different times for
different

amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, would ensure that the
Secretary of State has powers to allow metering of water supplies in
areas that are currently or may become water stressed and where
metering may generate other social benefits. I confirm that the
Secretary of State already has these powers. He has the power to issue
the prescribed conditions regulations, as I have already mentioned. For
example, at present under the regulations, water companies in areas
classified as seriously water stressed must evaluate whether compulsory
metering is the most effective way to address their supply-demand

wish to make a Statement on behalf of Her Majesty’s Government
on the action taken in light of the recent floods and extreme weather.
My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs is unable to update the House today, but we wish him
a speedy return to his usual robust

the defining characters of Britain is her weather. However, in recent
months it has been particularly savage. Parts of the country have been
subjected to flooding from the sea, rivers, surface water and
groundwater. In December, we saw the highest surge on the east coast
for 60 years. This January has been the wettest since George III was on
the throne. We will continue to face severe weather well into next
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000154">I want
to put on the record my utmost sympathy for those affected. Flooding
has devastating effects on communities. I know that it has been
especially difficult for those families who have been flooded for many
weeks, and those who have been flooded on more than one occasion in
recent months. I think we have all been struck by the stark images of
the stranded residents of the Somerset Levels, and their brave resolve
to continue their daily lives, be it by boat or
tractor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000155">I
should also like to pay tribute to the hard work of councils, the
Environment Agency’s on-the-ground staff and our emergency
services, who have supported communities 24 hours a day, literally
through hell and high water. Yet Britain’s flood defences have
protected more than 1.2 million properties since 5 December, and the
Thames Barrier has protected £200 billion of
property.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000156">None
the less, it is evident that those defences are taking a pounding.
There is damage to transport infrastructure and sea defences, including
the railway line at Dawlish, as well as to power networks. More than
5,000 properties have been flooded, including at 
<?notus-xml column=287?>least 40 in Somerset. There are currently two severe flood warnings in
the West Country, 61 flood warnings and 223 flood alerts in place.
COBRA has met regularly since 29 January and has responded to every

meeting of COBRA later

the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday, I can now report to
the House the Government’s plans for further funding for flood
and coastal erosion risk management. In the short term, I can announce
that the Government will provide an additional £130 million for
emergency repairs and maintenance: £30 million in the current
year and £100 million next year. This will cover costs incurred
during the current emergency response and recovery, as well as
essential repairs to ensure that defences are maintained.</hs_para>

addition, I am publishing before the House today details of how my
department is enhancing the terms of the Bellwin scheme. This helps
local authorities in England meet the exceptional and unexpected costs
associated with protecting lives and properties. The changes I am
announcing today include: paying the Bellwin grant at 100%
above threshold instead of the normal default 85%; allowing upper-tier
authorities with responsibility for fire to claim on a comparable basis
to stand-alone fire authorities; reducing Bellwin thresholds for all
county councils and unitary authorities; and extending the eligible
spending period until the end of March
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000160">No
council has yet made a formal claim under the Bellwin scheme, so no
council has lost out. Indeed, far more councils will now be eligible to
claim. The enhanced scheme terms reflect the exceptional nature of the
recent weather events and the challenges facing local authorities in
their role as first responders. However, it is clear that the Bellwin
scheme needs further reform—an opportunity that was missed under
the previous Administration. We will be undertaking a full review of
the Bellwin scheme in due course, while ensuring that councils continue
to have the right incentives to stop flooding happening in the first
place. I can also tell the House that immediately after this Statement,
Ministers will be holding a teleconference with council leaders from
across the West Country to discuss further flood recovery
measures.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020661000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000161">Of
course, flood prevention is as important as flood recovery. The
additional funding that we have outlined today will allow the

at least 465,000 households by the end of the decade.</hs_para>

other projects beginning construction in 2014-15, these will

in Clacton, where more than 3,000 homes are currently at risk; and in
Willerby in the East Riding of Yorkshire, where more than 8,000
properties will be better protected. There are also smaller, but no
less important, schemes in Lincoln, Stockton and Todmorden. We will

further forward, we have made an unprecedented long-term six-year
commitment to record levels of capital investment in improving
defences: £370 million in 2015-16, and then the same in real
terms each year, rising to more than £400 million by the end of
this decade. By the Autumn Statement, we will publish a six-year
programme of work running right up to 2021, including a new long-term

and other affected areas—was that the response would have been
quicker than it was. In Questions, the noble Lord, Lord King, said that
the level of pumping is the highest ever. It undoubtedly is. However,
getting the pumps in was quite difficult, as the standing pumps were
overwhelmed by the event. Whoever does it, the response must start a
lot earlier than it did on this
occasion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000173">Obviously
there are issues behind this. The noble Lord has quoted some figures
for expenditure on flood defences. The fact is that when the Government
came in, for the first year they cut expenditure on flood
defences—via the Environment Agency and in total—by
£100 million. They have now restored some of that cut, but it
has led to a hiatus. I would like the Minister to explain whether
concentrating the resources of the Environment
Agency on front-line activity at the moment—rightly
so—has hit its ability to prioritise and to put in place a
strategy for flood defences in the medium term. I think that there are
serious concerns in that respect. Despite the Government’s
claims, the resources available to the Environment Agency have not been
made up by the funding from elsewhere—the £148 million to
which the Government referred—as not all of it has been
delivered, some of it is double-counted, and it is mainly from other
public authorities. Therefore, there is an issue of public expenditure
as well.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020661000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000174">We
need more priority given to flood defences of all sorts. By that I do
not mean just pouring concrete, but catchment management. If anything,
the Somerset Levels show very clearly how important catchment
management is. It is not only a question of dredging; in my view,
dredging will make relatively little impact, as the water must go
somewhere. Dredging may be part of a solution, but it transfers the
water somewhere else that may be more vulnerable, with more businesses
and people involved. The catchment as a whole needs looking at, from
the top of the hills, where there has been deforestation and
inappropriate land use, right down through the streams into the sea. In
an area that is below sea water, with a tidal river, these problems are
particularly difficult. It requires a long-term plan and it is not yet
entirely clear that we have a long-term plan.</hs_para>

scheme and the efforts that are now being made to deal with the
immediate situation. However, the immediate situation includes a lot of
people who are in ancillary distress. It would be helpful if the
Minister could indicate, for example, when he expects the electricity
supply to be restored to all of those who have been hit. When does he
expect the restoration of the rail services west of Exeter beyond
Dawlish? Six weeks sounds a bit optimistic, I must say. We
must recognise that while we are rightly worried about the
hundreds of people affected in the Somerset Levels, some 1.3 million
people are cut off from their main means of communication to Plymouth
and Cornwall—an area that is greatly lacking in communications
in the first place. I hope that we can have some urgency on that. It
may require more drastic changes to the railways in that area. There is
serious damage in Dawlish itself, which is an emergency equal to that
in Somerset.</hs_para>

before. After the 2007 floods, the previous Government commissioned a

to indicate when we will go back to those recommendations or any

hard on that. The noble Lord referred to transport. Immediate work is
already underway, with that urgency that he described as so necessary.

on the significant impact of flooding on businesses, often small
businesses, that make up the backbone of rural economies and the
disproportionate effect of that on rural economies, particularly in
places like Somerset. There is no research that shows how flooding
affects the range of supply and demand chains in an area and identifies
what impact this has on the overall community resilience of an area.
After the devastation of this winter’s flooding and given that

working with Wessex Water to ensure that proper water sampling is
carried out and to co-ordinate any mitigation measures that are needed.
Public Health England has issued clear advice on how to avoid any risk
to health. People in the affected areas are urged to follow that
advice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000201"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:30:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Crickhowell" PimsId="2774" UID="14020661000715" xid="1186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000715">Lord
Crickhowell (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, as the former chairman of the
National Rivers Authority—thankful that I no longer have various
responsibilities in these circumstances—may I join in the
expressions of sympathy for those who have suffered the horrors of
being flooded and in the tributes to the Environment Agency’s
ground staff and the other emergency services who have been doing
sterling work? I welcome the capital commitments that have been made

would like to take up two particular points that have arisen. The first
is on the local accountability question. In my Second Reading speech on
the Water Bill, I said that for the NRA, the cornerstone of our
activities was catchment management and the existence of our regional
advisory boards, chaired by a member of the board and involving all the
locally involved organisations. I have a feeling that that arrangement,
which was so crucial to our successes, was discontinued at some time.
Can the Minister assure me that a similar arrangement will be put in
place? On the subject of dredging, may I suggest that regular dredging
year by year of the lower reaches of rivers is likely to be much more
cost-effective than one-off occasional action to try to relieve pinch
points that should never have been allowed to develop in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000203"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="14020661000716" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000716">Lord
De Mauley:</Member></B> First, I reassure my noble friend that proper,
ongoing local co-ordination is vital and is being, and will continue to
be, undertaken. On his comments on dredging, I hear what he says and am
conscious that he is quite right that it is not good enough to do it
once: you have to do this process continually. I agree with him on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Curry of Kirkharle (CB):</Member></B> I support the comments made by
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and by the noble Baroness earlier on, on
the impact of flooding on the farmers whose land has been submerged
under water for weeks on end. This is the second year in 
<?notus-xml column=295?>succession that many of those farmers have suffered this effect. May I
take the opportunity—I am sure the whole House will support me
in saying this—to thank His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales
for going down on Tuesday? His visit was very well received by the
residents and farmers of the Somerset Levels. I have to declare an
interest: I am a trustee of the Prince’s Countryside Fund and
His Royal Highness announced that £50,000 would be made
available to help the farmers of the Somerset Levels. His Grace the
Duke of Westminster also made a contribution, so we are very grateful
for that financial

funds will be channelled through the agricultural charities for the
immediate costs incurred by farmers as a consequence of flooding,
whether for animal feed or whatever. However, it will not restore the
pastures and crops that have been submerged under water. The
longer-term impact of this is not well understood. My noble friend may
well have views on that. May I ask him to think longer-term about how
those farmers might be assisted in maintaining their livelihoods

De Mauley:</Member></B> First, I echo the noble Lord’s thanks to
the Prince of Wales for his visit and financial contribution, and for
the contribution of the Duke of Westminster, which are extremely
welcome. We want to ensure that farmers are able to deal with
challenges such as bad weather, to grow their businesses, create jobs
and compete effectively in the marketplace. It has been very helpful
that, in response to recent events, our colleagues at the Animal Health
and Veterinary Laboratories Agency have agreed to a derogation to move
cattle in Somerset without a pre-movement test. That may sound like a
small thing, but it is important. I am aware, as the noble Lord said,
that a number of charities are supporting struggling farmers more
generally. I can also say to him that we have not heard from those
charities that they have yet experienced a huge increase in demand, but
I take on board his comments, which were extremely

Skelmersdale (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, earlier today, I appeared to
criticise the Government for making the situation worse when I asked my
supplementary question. I used the word, “exacerbate”
when I should, of course, have said,
“alleviate”—as this Statement shows very clearly.
Whether that counts as a personal apology, I am not entirely sure.
However, much of the Somerset Levels is classified as a site of special
scientific interest. The problem has been made worse not only, as my
noble friend has just said, by not constantly dredging the main rivers,
but by farmers being allowed to change their farming practices by, for
example, not dredging their individual rhynes. Would my noble friend
take this point into the department’s thinking on the long-term
ways of improving the situation, not least with the Environment

<?notus-xml column=296?>the additional resources for emergency repairs. As the Minister has
indicated, the full extent of the damage will not be known until the
water subsides. The announcement on the review of the Bellwin scheme is
encouraging and I look forward to hearing the detail on this. The
Minister has referred to the partnerships working on the ground, and I
am proud of the work and intervention in respect of this of South
Somerset District Council, of which I am a member. It will take a lot
more hard work and co-operation in partnership before we are through
this current process. As with previous speakers, I am concerned for the
future livelihoods of those living on the Somerset Levels, particularly
the farmers. The debate about how to take this forward has to be
started soon. Overall, however, I welcome the steps in the right

Elystan-Morgan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to raise a
constitutional point relating to Wales in the context of these storms.
Some weeks ago, a number of noble Lords, including myself, were told by
the noble Baroness, the Minister, that essentially, responsibility for
these matters had been devolved to the Welsh Assembly. I appreciate
that responsibility for marine structures, coastal defences and so on
has no doubt been transferred. On the other hand, under the
20 headings that I included in the schedules to the
Government of Wales Act 2006, there is great vagueness. There is
nothing at all to say whether responsibility for storm damage or for
substantial havoc caused by nature has ever been transferred. I would
be most grateful if the Government would publish some sort of reasoned
opinion in relation to the
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:37:37"></hs_TimeCode>. With
regard to the Bellwin proposals, I remember 30 years ago, soon after I
came to this House, how sterling they were. Is Wales eligible to profit
from such a fund—and, if so, to what
extent?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000212"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="14020661000724" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000724">Lord

constitutional balls. Of course, coastal regions right across the
United Kingdom, including in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, have
been affected by flooding and severe weather conditions. Responsibility
for flood management is, as he suspects, devolved to the Welsh
Assembly, the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly. It
is for those bodies and their agencies to determine how best to
allocate resources to support affected

nightmare. One has not heard in the considerations of the lessons
learnt whether the Government will try to understand the insurance
implications for farmers, householders and businesses. One would
imagine that, as a result of the now frequent flooding, many of those
properties and businesses will be absolutely uninsurable—or
insurable only at a cost that is entirely prohibitive. I hope that,

Ribeiro:</Member></B> My Lords, in opening this debate I must first
record my interests in the register and my chairmanship of the
Independent Reconfiguration Panel. I support the
introduction of a seven-day service, promoted by Sir Bruce Keogh,
medical director of the NHS, but I believe that it should focus on
emergency and urgent care, which is currently poorly provided at
weekends. The move to a seven-day service has the support of the
Medical Royal Colleges, NHS Confederation, NHS Employers and the BMA,
but why is it
necessary?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000219">When
I was a consultant, I often provided an emergency service at weekends,
initially every four weekends and then every eight as staffing numbers
increased. That was a requirement to go into the hospital to deal with
emergencies when they occurred, rather than a commitment to be there

the increasing number of elderly patients with comorbidities requiring

Royal Society of Medicine</I> in 2012, analysing 14.2 million
admissions in NHS hospitals in England in 2009-10, found that patients
admitted on Sundays were 16% more likely to die than those admitted on
Wednesdays, and 11% more likely to die if admitted on Saturdays. The
<I>Dr Foster Hospital Guide</I> in 2012 reported similar findings,
confirming that a higher level of senior medical staff at the weekend
is associated with lower mortality. The case for change in respect of
emergency admissions has been made and now something must be

a reduction of acute beds by a third in the past 25 years, the number

million admissions a year. Length of stay is also important: for those
under the age of 65, the average length of stay is three days but for
over 65s it rises to nine days and for those over 85 it is 11 days. To
prevent unplanned admissions we need more consultants because
consultants make the decisions. They are able to decide whether
patients can be sent home or need to be admitted. Junior doctors often
lack the confidence to do that. We also need the infrastructure and
systems in general practice and social care to allow those patients to
be treated nearer their home. That must also be available at
weekends.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000222">My
noble friend the Minister will no doubt point out that
“seven-day working”, as this debate is titled, is not the
same as a seven-day service. I agree but the public need to be clear
what sort of service they receive. When we promise them the same
service at weekends as in the week, they will assume that that implies
seven-day working. That means that there will need to be a massive
expansion of consultant numbers. I have recently heard the figure of
1,800 quoted as likely. Do we actually have enough qualified trainees
to fill those posts—and trainees of the right calibre? Over what
timescale do we expect to have this expansion? If the service is to be
both for elective procedures, including routine operations, and
emergencies, then a bigger challenge is funding and the staffing of
theatres, X-ray rooms, and pathology and scientific
laboratories—all of which must be supplied if we are to provide
the same service at weekends as we do during the

should not promise what we cannot deliver. The seven days a week forum
report commissioned by Sir Bruce Keogh, which the Library
kindly sent round as a briefing document for those involved in this
debate, identifies 10 clinical standards that are evidence based. Three
of them incorporate standards developed by the Academy of Medical Royal
Colleges, whose committee on this was chaired by the president of the
Royal College of Surgeons—so I have a slight inside track on
what was developed. The standards cover the patient’s experience
through to the transfer to the community. They focus mainly on the
management of emergency admissions. Of the 10 standards, eight revolve
around hospital care. They recognise that a one-size-fits-all solution
cannot be applied in this situation and that what will work best is
usually based around local solutions. But there is an emphasis on
emergency care that does match the rhetoric of providing care for all
at the weekend.</hs_para>

and NHS Employers recognised that we already work seven days a week,
but it is how we do that work that is in question. Changing to a
seven-day service could be liberating for many staff. I heard one lady
consultant on southern TV last week say how much she enjoyed working at
weekends. I think she worked at Southampton General. One reason she
enjoyed working at weekends was that it provided a better work-life
balance for her family. We should grasp the opportunity that this
offers to use our workforce more flexibly. With the increasing
feminisation of the workforce, remembering that more than 60% of our
medical school intake is female, it is important that we take families,
children and women into account when we design our workforce of the
future. It is also important that many women with children would find
working at weekends helpful because it would mean that their partners
were there to look after the family and home while they were away
working. I am not against that but will put forward some arguments as
to why we should deal with the emergency problems
first.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000225">We also
need to be much more creative about how we utilise some of our older,
senior staff. I say that advisedly as I retired at 64 and was doing
emergency admissions until the age of 60. How I could have done that
between 60 and 64 I do not know; I feel for my colleagues who still do.
Between the ages of 55 and 60, you could take most senior doctors off
the emergency on-call rota and have them there providing mentorship for
more junior consultant colleagues, and perhaps undertaking elective
work at weekends if that could be
managed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000226">Much
could be done to achieve seven-day care but I am daunted by the cost of
implementing both an emergency and elective service at weekends. The
seven-day services improvement programme, which I believe was due to
start in January this year, is focused in its first year on emergency
care and the provision of enhanced recovery pathways and diagnostic and
support services. The programme freely admits that its big challenge is
how to actually develop those diagnostic and support services. I wonder
where it will focus its attention in the next two years of the
three-year programme it has set out. In addition, what are the likely
costs of staffing a seven-day service in both primary and secondary
care? The figures of £3 billion, from the Department of Health,
and £32 billion, from the BMA, have been quoted as the cost of
introducing seven-day care right across the piece in primary, secondary
and social care.</hs_para>

service reconfiguration, the public want high-quality care, but are
wary of change, particularly if it affects their local hospital. We
have seen the benefits of such service change, particularly here in
London. Stroke services, acute heart condition services and trauma care
concentrated in fewer centres have already delivered improved outcomes,
so we have the evidence. A new project in Northumbria to produce a
specialist emergency care hospital, which is due to open in 2015 at a
cost of £200 million, is an example of a local solution to rural
problems. Local solutions driven by clinicians and co-designed with the
public can lead to centres of excellence.</hs_para>

focus our attention on delivering an emergency service. If we base this
on the 22 trauma centre networks that were designed by Profession Keith
Willett and Sir Bruce Keogh, the success of the centres will trickle
down to the spoke hospitals which are linked to them. By aiming for
this low-hanging fruit, we can demonstrate success to the public, and
the effectiveness can be translated to elective care. However, I do not
think we are yet in a position where we can provide care at the weekend
in the way we go shopping at Tesco and Sainsbury’s. Please do
not forget the European working time directive, which applies to junior
doctors and equally to consultants, because the SiMAP and Jaeger

disagree about in principle on the idea of seven-day working in
healthcare with such a large number of emergency admissions to
hospital. The evidence is pretty clear that we need the most senior
doctors working later in the day and at weekends in those places
dealing with emergency conditions. The noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, told
us the scale of those admissions each year. The interesting thing is
that the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges has made clear that patients
with these conditions need on-site consultant inspection at least once
every 24 hours. Those admitted on Friday may not be seen by
a consultant until Monday. That is clearly a dangerous practice. I
would be very interested to know whether the Minister accepts that in
hospitals which have A&amp;E departments they would expect there to be
seven-days-a-week consultant cover to enable a person to be seen by an
on-site consultant at least once every 24 hours. Is that now government
policy or just an aspiration set by the Academy of Medical Royal
Colleges?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000233">We
know all about the difficult practical issues of implementing this kind
of policy. We have also heard from the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, the
different financial estimates for doing this. It is very interesting
that the BMA’s estimate of £32 billion for seven-day
working 
<?notus-xml column=301?>overall is roughly the same size as NHS England’s estimate of a
£30 billion funding gap by the end of this decade on present
plans for the NHS. There is some symmetry and agreement around about
£30 billion; it is just a question of whether it applies to the
gap or the funding increase you would need for this kind of
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000234">I do
not disagree with anything the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, said, but I
want to focus on the point he made about money. Before I do that, I pay
tribute to the work he has been doing in his capacity as chairman of
the Independent Reconfiguration Panel. The trouble with that work is
that he has to wait for what is served up to him. He is not allowed to
take the initiative. We know many of the failing health economies. The
NHS Trust Development Authority was set up to deal with many of these
bodies. We have a situation where we are thinking of dreaming up a
highly desirable change in patients’ access to consultant cover
on urgent admission to hospital when we know full well that we have a
very large number of almost insolvent trusts carrying out A&amp;E
admissions day in, day out. They are propped up by handouts from other
bits of the NHS. This is the reality that the NHS faces daily. I
suggest that we can implement this policy only if we grasp the nettle
of reconfiguring services rapidly and consolidate more of these

Brinton (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Ribeiro, for securing this key debate. It is shocking that your chances
of receiving prompt treatment and, indeed, of surviving are worse if
you are admitted to hospital over a weekend or on a bank holiday. The
2011 Freemantle report provided the evidence that more than 500 deaths
could be prevented in London each year purely by increasing consultant
cover in acute medical and surgical
units.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000236">The
good news is that there are early adopters and pathfinders who are
demonstrating that it can be done. I hope your Lordships’ House
will indulge me with a personal anecdote. I was very unwell over
Christmas and had the good fortune to be admitted to the acute
admissions unit at Watford General Hospital. The unit was set up in
2009 to help reduce pressures on A&amp;E and the main hospital. The
£12 million 120-bed unit shares the building with A&amp;E but
all referrals have to come from a GP and the maximum length of stay is
72 hours, although stays are usually much shorter. Consultants are on
duty 24 hours a day and see patients as they are admitted so care is
tailored very quickly. The AAU and A&amp;E share their own MRI scanner,
X-ray and ultrasound unit, a catheterisation unit for angioplasty,
blood testing facilities and pharmacy. My experience of the care was
outstanding: tests, scans, monitoring and observation and treatment
were all prompt, and I felt that the entire clinical team worked
smoothly as one unit. I know that I am not alone in my praise for the
unit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0001.htm#14020661000237">Seventy-two

forlornly, “There are only one and a half of us”. The

compensation and there is so much heartbreak for the nearest and
dearest—and for the patients, if they live—when something

<?notus-xml column=303?>improvements for what we already have in the NHS. For example, hospital
A&amp;E costs for stand-in doctors have increased by millions over

seven-day working in the NHS seems so overwhelming that I am surprised
that it has taken us so long to raise it. I can think of half a dozen
powerful reasons why seven-day working is an absolute must. As the
noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, has said, it reduces mortality, which can
rise by as much as 16% for patients admitted over the weekend. In
law—although I have not had the time to get this
tested—it would amount to indirect discrimination to suggest
that people who are admitted over the weekend receive less satisfactory
treatment and invite death earlier than in other cases. That would
constitute a case of indirect discrimination.</hs_para>

working, it will amount to better use of diagnostic machines,
laboratory equipment and operating theatres. It will also decrease the
patient’s length of stay in hospital and thereby not only reduce
pressure on hospitals but increase GDP because people will come out of
hospital earlier and be able to work more days. The amount of patient
satisfaction would also be considerable. For all these reasons, a case
for seven-day working seems compelling.</hs_para>

to assist the Minister in his negotiations with doctors who might
resist this, but it is not the comparison with retail traders opening
on a Sunday, as that is not a good analogy. We ask that our hospitals
be open over the weekends, and that consultants and others be
available, because these are issues of human lives. Where human lives
are concerned, you cannot make a distinction between a weekend and a
weekday.</hs_para>

that the case is so overwhelming, what are the objections? I hear three
objections from many doctor friends who I am privileged to know. First,
I am told it will impose extra burdens on consultants and senior
clinical staff. The answer to that is, first, it need not be
so because the workload can be properly distributed.
Secondly, the same doctors who talk about the
extra burden have absolutely no 
<?notus-xml column=304?>difficulty attending private clinics and private hospitals where they
perform operations over the weekend. That is an argument of
self-interest, which does not wash with
me<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:06:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that it will increase the cost. It could, and we have had figures
bandied about. To that, my answer is: first, if you have better rota
and shift planning, you need not employ a large number of extra
consultants or senior clinical staff. You will also reduce the
patient’s length of stay in hospital, which would mean a
considerable saving. Hospitals under the same trust should be able to
share clinical staff, so it does not necessarily mean each hospital
having its own extra consultant. Equipment could be more effectively
shared—that would mean a considerable saving—and, of
course, there will be a reduction in the current payments for unusual
hours that are paid to doctors. For all these reasons, I think that the
objections based on cost can be addressed.</hs_para>

is a third objection that many of my friends have made, which is that
it could be hard on women. The noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, said that many
women consultants and others might welcome working over the weekend;
but there are also many others who would find it difficult to work over
the weekend and might resent being compelled to work in exactly the
same way as their male colleagues would.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:04:06"></hs_TimeCode>There again,
talking to consultant friends, I am told there is an answer: better
rota and shift planning so that women need not necessarily be involved

Barker (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in 2003, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt
of Kings Heath, the Minister and I were deep in the depths of the
delayed discharges Bill. During our discussions, the journal <I>Nursing
Older People</I> published clear evidence that if older people were
discharged on a Friday, they were more likely to be readmitted to an
acute hospital, or to
die<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:09:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000252">Let
us flick forward to July 2013, when Sir Bruce Keogh concluded, in his
review of 14 Trusts for NHS England,
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020661000571" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000571">“performance
… was much worse … for their emergency patients, with
admissions at the weekend and at night particularly problematic.
General medicine, critical care and geriatric medicine were treatment
areas with higher than expected mortality
rates”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14020661000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000253">In
its 2013 report, <I>Dr Foster</I> stated that the mortality rate for
patients who had routine surgery is 24% higher if the
operation is performed just before the weekend and that the number of
patients who return to hospital after being admitted at the weekend is
3.9% higher, so 10 years on it is the same story.</hs_parafo>

that decade. Technology has improved and kit is marvellous these days.
Data have become much more copious and available. Patients have become
better informed and empowered. The pressure on resources was changed
out of all recognition during the Labour Government, when lots more
resources went into the NHS, but the rising tide of demand continued on
ahead. It is the same story over a decade. One thing that we can
conclude is that this is not about resources. That is not the answer to
these issues.</hs_para>

interesting question for the Government to think about now that we are
in a period of austerity. How do we address what we know to be
long-standing and systemic issues? First, in order to have a
seven-day-a-week NHS, we have to have better integrated social care and
improved access to low-level social support. We know that 50% of the
users of the NHS in future will be older people with long-term
comorbidities, particularly dementia. The bulk of their care will not
come from consultants; it will come from their families and friends.
What is important is supporting their families and friends to look
after them in the community.</hs_para>

critical role in determining access to the NHS. I think we can by now
conclude that the GP contract negotiated by the previous Government was
not the roaring success that it was made out to be at the time. GPs
have a critical role in managing care pathways and access and we now
need to go back and say to them, particularly since their response to
Sir Bruce Keogh was simply to talk about resources, that there needs to
be a change in their role in managing that point between all-out
A&amp;E access and long-term
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000257">Finally,
we need to be absolutely clear with the British public that having a
full seven-days-a-week service is not going to be realised in the short
term. The general public will have to understand which parts of the
health service they can expect to be available seven days a
week and which they should not. The British public are very proud of
the NHS and are, by and large, responsible. They want to
make the best and most sparing use of it they
can. Let us not deceive or mislead them into being wasteful and
thinking that they are going to have everything all the time.</hs_para>

Bridgeman (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the whole House will be
grateful to my noble friend Lord Ribeiro for securing this debate. He
produced devastating statistics from Sir Bruce Keogh and NHS London but
this debate surely cannot be complete without revisiting the working
time directive. I have one or two further telling facts from my noble
friend’s own royal college. For example, 86% of surgical
trainees working to a working time directive-compliant rota have seen
their work-life balance deteriorate. A survey published by Pulse of 500
junior doctors on the impact of the working time directive reported
that 65% of respondents felt that it is having a detrimental effect on
their training and 75% felt that there is now insufficient cover on the
wards.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020661000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000259">Further analysis by the
royal college says that the number of hours available to surgical
trainees for training and experience in compliance with the working
time directive has been significantly reduced. Every month, 280,000
surgical training hours are lost to that directive and the doctors
beginning their surgical training today will have 3,000 fewer hours to
learn throughout their training, which is the equivalent of 128 whole
days. This is but a snapshot of the telling statistics showing the
handicap which the working time directive is imposing not only on
patients today but on the precious investment in young medical talent
for the future.</hs_para>

friend the Minister is to ask what pressure can be brought on the
Commission to improve the working of the directive, which, let us not
forget, has at its core wholly admirable aims. The Commission does
listen. The United Kingdom, led by the Department of Health, has over
the past two years taken the lead in inducing the Commission to modify
the free movement directive which has hitherto prohibited the
regulatory bodies in healthcare, such as the GMC and the Nursing and
Midwifery Council, from testing health workers from the EEA for
English-language competence before registration, potentially releasing
healthcare workers on to the market with less than adequate English.
That is a disaster for patient safety waiting to happen. The Commission
has now listened and taken measures to modify the directive to ensure
that language competency is established before a certificate of fitness
to practise can be issued.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020661000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000261">I use that as an
example where the issue was patient safety. Let us be in no doubt that
in the case we are debating it is simply that again, whether it is in
the inadequate training of doctors to which I referred or the lack of
continuity which was provided under the old structure of the firm,
whose demise was one of the principal casualties of the directive. The
introduction of the shift system also plays against continuity. Can my
noble friend give an assurance that his department will build on his
earlier successes with the Commission and give a high priority to
securing a modification to the working time directive?</hs_para>

instance which I assure your Lordships is not simply hearsay. I know of
doctors who need to get work experience in another country within the
European Union. Both the time and money available are limited and, to
get the best value out of their secondments, they have quite simply
chosen to go to member states where the working time directive is
openly disregarded. By the way, these are not newer accession states
but old, western members of the Union with highly sophisticated health
services. This country has a history of abiding by the law and I leave
my noble friend the Minister, and all your Lordships, to draw their own
conclusions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020661000597" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000597">2.17

Manzoor (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord
Ribeiro, for securing this debate. As other noble Lords have stated,
the variation in outcomes and patient experience for patients admitted
as emergencies at the weekend is evidenced in higher readmission rates,
higher mortality rates, poorer patient experience and an increased
length of hospital stays, while the availability of diagnostics such as
imaging can be 40% lower. These facts are, on the whole, not in dispute
so it is not my intention to mention the many excellent surveys and
reports which evidence them. However, it would be remiss of me not to
restate the importance of the report commissioned by NHS London in
2011, which concluded that increasing consultant cover in acute medical
and surgical units at the weekends could prevent more than 500 deaths a
year in London alone. The evidence clearly demonstrates the need for
the NHS to take action.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020661000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000264">Like other noble Lords,
I applaud Sir Bruce Keogh’s report and its conclusions, except
that it is rather 
<?notus-xml column=307?>disappointing that it took nearly a year to produce. I would like to
hear what the Government are doing to ensure that the pace of change is
rapid and that the report’s implementation programme is given
greater priority. Quite rightly, there is much emphasis by the
Government and NHS England on clinical outcomes and reducing
inequalities in care, but NHS England will not deliver on its mandate
should the current status of health services prevail at
weekends.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000265">While
the £3.8 billion Better Care Fund which the Government have made
available, pooled with local government, is also welcome, NHS England
has yet to demonstrate how clinical commissioning groups are addressing
the need for services at weekends and what support CCGs are giving to
local authorities which support patients being discharged from
hospitals and prevent unnecessary admission to hospitals, particularly
as CCGs spend three-quarters of the £98 billion NHS budget.
Indeed, I find it difficult to understand how the regulator, the Care
Quality Commission, could have judged any hospital to be outstanding
when such inequalities in care and service have existed in the NHS and
been evidenced as such for at least the past 12 years. Perhaps the
Minister can reassure the House that regulators will not be awarding
outstanding status until a hospital is deemed to have improved its
record of safety and patient care for patients at the
weekend.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020661000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000266">NHS
England should also demonstrate how, as the commissioner of primary
services, it is ensuring that it addresses and improves the variable
quality offered by general practitioners. Although an optimist, I
remain concerned by the slow pace of change. On the current evidence,
NHS England cannot deliver on its mandate, and Public Health England
will fail to close the inequality gap in social provision for some of
the most vulnerable in our society, such as the elderly and people who
need access to mental health services at the weekend. This is mainly
because there is an absence or limited availability of consistent
support services such as diagnostics, and a lack of community and
primary care services which, if available, could prevent some
unnecessary admissions and support the timely discharge of patients. It
remains, as has been said, difficult to get routine blood tests,
X-rays, MRI scans, pharmacy, physiotherapy and social services at
weekends. Of course, I have already mentioned the variable out-of hours
primary
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000267">Sir
Bruce is quite right when he advocates a whole-system approach to
improve the current, unacceptable standards being offered in the NHS at
the weekends. However, although I do not support yet another
reorganisation of the NHS, with tight finance restraints, the
Government may need to think further about simplifying the current and
complex NHS system. They will also need to consider how budgets are
shared and pooled between organisations, including with local
authorities, and who will lead on this. The NHS is a great institution,
and it is our duty to make it fit for the 21st
century.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/9447DD48213F40CC91F556FFEA459C7538AABDE4" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2014">Thursday,

Hunt of Kings Heath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, am grateful
to the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, for instituting this debate. It is
clear that all noble Lords who have spoken are broadly in favour of
moving to 
<?notus-xml column=308?>what we are calling a seven-day week for the NHS. However, there is a
range of views about whether it is deliverable. I hope that the noble
Earl will be able to address some of the substantive points that have
been put to him.</hs_para>

argument for seven-day working to its full extent is of course
persuasive. Noble Lords have talked about the high mortality rate at
weekends, the variable staffing levels, the absence of senior
decision-makers and a lack of consistent specialist services, such as
diagnostics. It is also clear that capital is not used by the NHS to
the extent that one would desire if very expensive machines are left
idle for quite a part of the
week<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:22:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

three major questions about whether this is workable which I will put
to the noble Earl. First, is the rest of the health and social care
system able to match the seven-day working of the health service? It
seems that the major pressure problem facing the NHS is frail, older
people who probably should not have been admitted, but have been
because either nursing homes or social care provision was not
sufficient. Once they are admitted to hospital, it often becomes
difficult to enable them to be discharged quickly because of
an absence of community infrastructure. If we are going to have full
seven-day working within acute hospitals, it is essential that GPs and
social and community services also embrace seven-day working.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020661000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000271">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:23:43"></hs_TimeCode>
do not know to what extent the Bruce Keogh work has really reflected
that. It will have to be tackled. We cannot carry on any longer with
GPs who are inaccessible and unable to do what is necessary to help
people who have been discharged into the community. The same goes for
social services, which still seem to shut down over bank holidays and
the Christmas period. This simply is not going to work unless the whole
of the system is working to the same
tune<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mixed views on resources. My noble friend Lord Parekh thought that the
cost of this could be contained. I must say that I rather share the
view of my noble friend Lord Warner and the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro,
that this is in fact going to massively expensive. The noble Lord, Lord
Ribeiro, talked about the massive expansion of consultants necessary.
That must be true because we do not want seven-day working that
involves staffing up at the weekends and reducing staffing during the
week. I suspect that mortality rates would go up during the week
because you would not have the necessary cover. I am afraid that some
of the plans of acute hospitals are indeed to squeeze staffing during
the week. That is a crazy way to go about it. I am very concerned that,
in time, we will see a rise in mortality rates during the week. I do
not think that this has been fully considered by those who say that we
can do this simply by a better ordering of the way in which things are
done<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I refer
the noble Earl to the Institute of Fiscal Studies report published

Earl think that, as a result, the noble Lord, Lord Ribeiro, will be
even more engaged in dealing with reconfiguration issues? Does the
noble Earl agree that the implications of this are that we
have to have radical reconfiguration of 
<?notus-xml column=309?>services? Will Ministers support that? Equally, will they tell Monitor

former consultant surgeon and former president of the Royal College of
Surgeons this is a subject in which he takes a great deal of interest.

service model offered in many NHS hospitals no longer meets justifiable
patient and public expectations of a safe, efficient, effective and
responsive service. I very much echo the comments of the noble Lord,
Lord Parekh, in that context. Over the past 10 years, a growing body of
national and international evidence has emerged that links poor
outcomes, including a higher risk of death, to patients admitted to
hospital at the weekend, around the world. It is impractical and
inefficient to continue to operate a five-day approach when our
illnesses and conditions do not limit themselves to office hours.

comprehensive health service in the world, the NHS is well positioned
to solve the issue of poorer outcomes and reduced levels of service
provision at the weekend. That is why NHS England has set out a vision
for the NHS which is of a service more closely organised around the
lives of the public it serves. To develop this vision, NHS England
established the NHS Services Seven Days a Week forum in February last
year to consider how NHS services can be improved to provide a more
responsive and patient-centred service across the seven-day

services, seven days a week. NHS England is also looking to make
similar improvements across primary and community health services and
social care, and the forum will report in autumn this year, setting out
proposals for the creation of a fully integrated service. NHS

recognise that we cannot talk about the idea of seven-day services
without giving full consideration to questions of staffing and finance;
many noble Lords have raised those issues. NHS providers and their
commissioners already face difficult choices when deciding where to
invest their resources in order to maximise the outcomes for patients
and value for taxpayers. Early indications are that seven-day services
have the 
<?notus-xml column=310?>potential to be part of the solution. However, more information is
needed. NHS England is therefore conducting research which will provide
a helpful indication of the likely costs providers and commissioners
face when considering how to redesign their services to provide
comprehensive seven-day care. In addition, to answer my noble friend
Lady Brinton, NHS England intends to commission financial and system
modelling and analysis of the implications of its strategy for
achieving seven-day service provision in the

Education England, NHS Employers and a number of strategic partners, is
considering that very issue. Its analysis is considering issues such as
junior doctors feeling unsupported during weekend working and the
resulting need to ensure that education contracts include appropriate
seven-day senior supervision; and numbers of diagnostic and scientific
staff, with NHS England intending to undertake a thorough assessment of

work at weekends, as the noble Baroness rightly said. We understand
that contractual levers and incentives are required to drive change.
NHS England and a number of key strategic partners are already looking
into this. However, in many cases seven-day services have reportedly
already had a positive impact on individuals’ work-life balance,

of amendments brings us back to the central issue of creating through
this legislation a clear, unequivocal market framework for competition.
The amendments would provide a duty to facilitate competition. All
participants must have access to clear and accessible prices, clearly
defined and common levels of service and standard terms and conditions.
As I have mentioned before to your Lordships, the Bill is based on the
premise that parties within the retail market should conclude bilateral
relationships subject to industry codes that will be developed. This
could require some negotiation between market participants on service
and price. It is this element of negotiation which I believe, if not
addressed by us, will lead to the inefficient operation of the
marketplace with unintended
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000297">The
Bill is about regulated access and should not be blurred by a heavy

access<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Allowing
parties to negotiate could open the door for a current incumbent to
discriminate against new retailers by offering them less preferable
terms or poorer service levels or simply by being slow to respond to
requests. This would limit the effectiveness of the market and increase
costs for new entrants and
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:41:40"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
view, the relatively minor clarifications that I propose could usefully
be made to the Bill. These are designed to ensure that the market can
be opened in a timely way and that, once open, customers will enjoy
benefits that are the same as, or greater than, for example, those
which have been achieved in
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:41:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000298">Amendments
138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143 and 144 would ensure that Ofwat’s
implementation licence modification powers are fit for purpose. In
Scotland, 
<?notus-xml column=314?>the Water Industry Commission had a power of direction to ensure that
activities that needed to be done were completed in time for market
opening. For example, WICS was able to say to Business Stream, Scottish
Water’s retail subsidiary, that the market would open
irrespective of whether it was ready and that its customers would be
reallocated to new entrants. I propose
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:42:28"></hs_TimeCode>
Ofwat’s licence modification powers are made available for at
least three years after Royal Assent to ensure that the entire period

145 would allow Ofwat to make common licence amendments in a single
process. The potential retail market in England is much bigger than in
Scotland. There will be more wholesalers and more incumbent retailers.
The difference principally relates to the handling of the interests of
the incumbent companies. In Scotland, the relevant people now have
significant experience of dealing with a large number of—there
are 12—active retailers. In their view, it would be sensible to
ensure that Ofwat can make licence amendments that cover all companies
if that is, in its judgment, the best approach. That has certainly been
helpful in Scotland. However, there may also be circumstances where a
more targeted approach to an individual company or a small group of
companies would be

115 and 116 would place a clear duty of non-discrimination on the
wholesale businesses of the incumbent water suppliers. Clause 23
obligations to ensure no undue preference or discrimination would be
carefully extended by these amendments. It seems to me that profit
maximisation could be put forward as a reason to discriminate between
suppliers. It may be worth looking at placing duties to help facilitate
competition directly on incumbent businesses, making them also subject
to a duty to ensure no undue preference or discrimination. This would
make it easier to enforce competition law provisions, including the
prohibition on margin squeeze. That would help ensure that new entrants
are generally able to count on there being a level playing

sort of exit strategy for economic

competition will effectively require some changes to the existing
licensing framework for the sector. New licences will need to be
written for potential new entrants and existing incumbent licences will
need to be updated with new conditions required—for example, to
ensure a level playing field in the market for both entrants and
incumbents. Licences will need to be the same as far as possible so
that entrants and incumbents are not facing different obligations, and
therefore costs, and incumbents, who will remain vertically integrated,

once the market is up and running, new issues are likely to emerge.
Will we need new forms of consumer protection from the mis-selling
practices that we have seen in energy markets, for example? Will we
need to introduce new requirements on companies with respect to the
information they provide to customers about switching opportunities and
marketing? Until the market is open, it is difficult to say precisely
what will be required and Ofwat will need flexibility to introduce

this context, the Bill already helpfully includes a provision for Ofwat

clear only once the market is up and running—in real time, as it

demonstrated, to see off new entrants. In a number of cases, a lot of
work has been done to bring broadband to remote communities, but there
has been a lack of transparency from incumbents until the last possible

It already has a duty to look after the interests of consumers, where
appropriate through competition, and we are making sense of that in a

However, we are not in any way legislating in this Bill for residential

supply water and provide sewerage services to their appointed areas.

of the proposed new duty on incumbents would require them to act in a
manner that did not “prevent, restrict or distort”
competition. I think we can all agree that it is essential that
incumbent water companies play by the rules of the market so that
customers benefit from competition. That is why the Competition Act
1998 already prohibits business from making agreements that involve the
prevention, restriction or distortion of competition, or from abusing a
dominant position in the market. Both incumbents and licensees are
subject to an overarching competition law regime that deals with the
concerns that the amendments seek to address. As my noble friend
thought I would say, Ofwat is able to enforce the Competition Act 1998
in the water sector because it has concurrent powers with the
Competition and Markets Authority.</hs_para>

second part of the proposed duty to facilitate competition would
require incumbents not to act in a manner that unduly favours their own
retail or wholesale businesses against licensees. Again, I agree that
it is essential to ensure that licensees are confident that they will
be treated fairly by incumbents in the competitive market. Ofwat
already ensures that incumbents do not set discriminatory or
preferential charges and Clause 23 provides the Secretary of
State with a shared responsibility to ensure that incumbents do not
discriminate in the provision of services. I believe that the regime in
the Bill introduces more flexibility around facilitating competition in
the market than the proposed new 
<?notus-xml column=319?>duty. There is already sufficient regulation and Ofwat has the
appropriate powers to deal with any concerns. A specific duty on
incumbents is therefore unnecessary.</hs_para>

explained,
Amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:01:30"></hs_TimeCode> 138
to 145 would extend Ofwat’s powers under Clause 43 to make
changes to the licences of both incumbent water companies and licensees
to supply water or provide sewerage services. Under Clause 43 as
drafted, licences may be modified where it is necessary and expedient
to do so to deliver the market reforms in the Bill. The amendment would
enable Ofwat to make any changes it likes that relate to market reform.
The amendments would also grant Ofwat this power for three years rather
than two, as provided for in the Bill, and would automatically come
into force at Royal Assent. These amendments are, I think, intended to
increase Ofwat’s discretion to make changes to licences while
limiting the time within which it will be able to deliver such changes.
The Bill enables Ofwat to make changes to licences for two years,
following commencement of the relevant clauses, where these changes are
necessary to deliver the provisions of the Bill. This means that Ofwat
can make changes up to April 2019, following commencement of the retail
provisions in Clause 1 in 2017, for example, and changes relevant to
the upstream market for two years following commencement of the
relevant upstream clauses.</hs_para>

these amendments, the power to make changes will fall away in April
2017. This will mean that Ofwat will have to have all the changes it
wants to make to facilitate upstream at least three years before that
market opens or individually negotiate changes to licences at a later
date. The Bill enables this to happen only where, as my noble friend
Lord Moynihan said, these changes are necessary and expedient to
deliver the provisions of the Bill. It is not carte blanche, as would
be the case if the amendments were agreed. Investors and companies
alike will be nervous about proposals to give Ofwat a free hand to
impose whatever changes it wants ahead of market opening in April 2017.
The amount of discretion given to Ofwat featured heavily in the debate
during pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, and this licence change
provision was one area where we decided to make changes to reflect the
concerns that had been raised. Those changes were welcomed and I would
be concerned about upsetting the balance. Others may be concerned that
Ofwat will have to negotiate individually with all 21 incumbents to
make changes beyond 2017. This will enable reluctant incumbents to

confirmed in a letter to me on 17 January that the Government intend to
continue to provide guidance on social and environmental matters within
that single consolidated policy statement. Given that the Government

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I support these amendments. New Section
2A(3) to be inserted by Clause 24 seems to differentiate between
Ofwat’s duties regarding strategic priorities and social and
environmental matters. We attach “must” to the former and
“may” to the latter, but the Secretary of State ought to
have regard to both. This is not the usual theological argument between
“may” and “must”. Those of us who have been
around the block on this legislation have come across that argument a
number of times and have completely failed to understand parliamentary
counsel’s advice. The provision clearly differentiates the
status of the two duties. It does not differentiate and downgrade the
social and environmental objectives for Ofwat, which some noble Lords
might think would be sensible, as Ofwat is primarily an economic
regulator. This is for the Secretary of State. It is the Secretary of
State’s duty to balance all these issues out. He should
therefore have regard to both duties and if it is “must”
for the former it should be “must” for the latter. The
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:11:15"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:11:11"></hs_TimeCode>
does not say, “give priority to”; nor does it say,
“If you have regard to these duties, you do not necessarily need
to carry out exactly what they prescribe”. However, it is the
duty of the Minister to balance all these things out. If the
legislation gives less status to one than to the other, the outcome of
the balancing seems to be predictive.</hs_para>

think that the new power to set strategic priorities and objectives for

social, environmental and economic policy priorities in the round to
help Ofwat to balance all the relevant considerations appropriately
when making regulatory

Government’s principles of economic regulation require that
Ofwat regulates within a clear framework of policies and duties set by
the Government. Under the new power, Ofwat must carry out its relevant
functions in accordance with the statement. The new powers stipulate
that, in issuing the guidance to Ofwat, the Secretary of State must
have regard to all Ofwat’s duties. These are set out in Section
2 of the Water Industry Act 1991 and include protecting the interests
of consumers, promoting economy and efficiency by companies in their
work and, as we have already discussed, contributing to the achievement
of sustainable development. These duties encompass the
regulator’s essential purposes and it is right that, in giving a
steer on policies and objectives, the Government should be bound by
them. We note that the duties clearly embrace both social and
environmental matters.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:14:16"></hs_TimeCode> addition, the

further check, Clause 24 also requires that we consult widely on the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:16:12"></hs_TimeCode> Lords,
Amendment 118 is a straightforward requirement on companies to meet
what ought to be seen as a basic customer service in the household
sector. The amendment would simply require a company to do three
things: to give consumers information about tariffs, including any
social tariffs; to fit the most appropriate tariff to a household using
the information it holds on households; and to provide information
where there is a broad social support scheme available—currently
Water Sure—clearly setting out the eligibility
criteria<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:16:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

service.

information is useful to everyone but vital to those with affordability
issues. Affordability is clearly a problem for many families. Ofwat
estimates that 11% of households spend more than 5% of their income on
water, which would amount to more than 2 million households in the UK
struggling to pay their bills. As the Prime Minister has been heard to
say, the Government have not done enough and must do
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000340" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000340">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>
Water Sure scheme mentioned in the amendment was set up to help in this
respect. It applies to low-income, metered households with high water
use. Examples include those in receipt of qualifying benefit or tax
credit with three or more children under 18 or those who, due to
medical conditions, have very high water usage. It takes the step of
capping the amount that such a family would have to pay to the average

households have to apply to be on the tariff. Unfortunately, take-up of
this scheme is much lower than it might be. This means that many who
may need help are paying more than they need to pay and perhaps find
themselves in difficulty as a result. Only a third of households that
could benefit are actually using the scheme. In many areas, only a few
hundred homes are receiving Water Sure payments. This
amendment would go a long way towards ensuring that the necessary help
will be more explicitly available. A company will have to put the
details of the Water Sure tariff on customers’ bills. That
company would also need to provide information that would enable the
bill payer to work out whether or not they are eligible and, if they
are, clear instructions about how to
apply<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:18:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000342" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000342">This

Hanworth (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as I had occasion to remark at
Second Reading, some water companies have been making exorbitant
profits on the back of the rather generous tariffs that have been
allowed by Ofwat. Whereas consumers were once able to disregard the
cost of their water usage, it can now be a significant item in their
budgets, to the extent that those in poverty may struggle to pay their
bills. I have also indicated that the revenues of the water companies
have often been used by the owners of those companies for purposes
quite unrelated to those of the industry, when they should be used to
cover operating costs and the costs of investing in capital
infrastructure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000344">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:29:35"></hs_TimeCode>

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord,
Lord Grantchester, for introducing Amendment 118, which, as
he said, would insert a new clause into the Bill to place a legal
requirement on water companies to include information on their bills
about the Water Sure scheme. The scheme provides a mandatory safety net
for low-income customers on a meter who, for reasons of ill health or
because they have a large family, use larger than average amounts of
water. It caps the bills of these households at the average for their
company area.</hs_para>

criteria for Water Sure are twofold: the household must be in receipt
of a relevant low-income benefit and must have three or more dependent
children living at home or someone with an illness that necessitates
high water use. It is unfortunately a feature of all means-tested
benefits of this sort that take-up, as the noble Lord mentioned, can
fail to match eligibility. That is why promotion of the scheme is so
important. I am pleased to be able to tell the noble Lord that all
water companies already voluntarily provide information about Water
Sure on their
bills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000347" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000347">In
addition, Amendment 118 would require all water companies to provide
information about tariff structures and the lowest available tariff.
This is not the energy sector—water companies do not have
complex tariff structures. In fact, the situation is quite the reverse.
The choice for the majority of household customers is between paying
according to volume of water used—a metered tariff—or
according to the rateable value of their home. All water companies
provide information on household customer bills about how to get a
meter fitted free of charge. Companies also provide advice to customers
on whether or not they might benefit financially from the installation
of a meter; a role also performed by the Consumer Council for Water.
The cheapest option for each household will depend on the location of
the property and the amount of water used by the household. Where a
company offers a social tariff, information on whether 
<?notus-xml column=325?>a household may qualify is provided by the company alongside the
customer bill. The Consumer Council for Water works closely with each
water company on the information provided on household bills to ensure
that customer interests are met. Its very practical advice is that
customers are likely to be put off by too much information in their
bills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000348" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000348">For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:23:06"></hs_TimeCode>

placing an increasing number of legal requirements on water companies

current approach of working in partnership with the body responsible
for representing the interests of customers is more likely to be
effective. I therefore hope that I can persuade the noble Lord to

if it was included in people’s bills when they had to pay them.

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 119 deals with the
affordability question. As my noble friend said on the last amendment,
roughly 11% of household consumers of water have problems paying their
water bill, amounting to 2 million households. As the Minister said, at
present there are two fairly crude systems of pricing water for
households. One is based on the seriously outdated—or
putative—rateable value of your house and the other is metered
by volume. The Minister 
<?notus-xml column=326?>drew comfort from the fact that this does not lead to complicated
tariffs, as there are for the energy sector. To some extent I agree
with him—we do not want to overcomplicate this—but in
neither the metered nor the non-metered sector for residential
consumers is any regard paid to the circumstances of the household or
the affordability of the bill. The existing formulae do not allow for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:26:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000352" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000352">Until
very recently, and absolutely until the 2010 Act, Ofwat took
the view that we should not have varied tariffs, social tariffs or any
tariffs that departed from those two basic approaches. It has been very
resistant to introducing social tariffs until recently. The
2010 Act provided the option for companies to make social
tariffs available to consumers. The Water Sure scheme is a more broadly
based scheme, available across companies, for those on benefits with
large families and those who have medical needs. The take-up of the
option to introduce social tariffs has been hitherto pretty
limited—only three companies have so far introduced them. If the
Minister has any more recent figures I would be grateful for them, but
my understanding is that about 70,000 people have taken up Water Sure
and rather fewer have taken up the social tariffs available from
individual companies. That is, at best, fewer than 150,000 out of the 2
million potential beneficiaries of a social tariff approach. The
Government of course have also recognised the very particular situation
with South West Water, but that is based on government expenditure, not
on the structure of
tariffs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:28:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000353">The
industry now tells us that in a couple of years’ time all
companies will have social tariffs and that those social tariffs will
benefit low-income, vulnerable households. I hope that by the date we
stipulate here, 2015, there will be social tariffs right across the
board. However, first Ofwat and then the companies have been very slow
in pushing this option. The take-up indicates that its availability is
not well known and that the ease with which people take up social
tariffs is pretty limited. We need to provide an incentive, or a push,
on this front over the next year or so in order that all companies take
it up and that the take-up among consumers is wide, in order to
provide, if you like, a safety net. We recognise the desirability of
companies taking notice of the configuration of their own consumers and
the particularities of their region, and therefore it is better that
companies are left to decide their own schemes which will suit their
own circumstances. But they must have widespread
eligibility, and be easily taken up and understood. At the
present rate of progress it looks unlikely that anything like the
potential 2 million households that would be helped by social tariffs
will be on them by 2015. We need a national approach to this that will
set minimum
standards.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/89DB0055E29F60389AAB8C2ED870398104BEF173" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2014">Thursday,

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty,
for Amendment 119, which would insert a new clause into the Bill to
place a requirement on the Government to introduce by secondary
legislation what is described as a national affordability scheme, with
eligibility criteria set by
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000358">Keeping
bills affordable while ensuring continued investment in essential water
and sewerage services are the driving principles behind this Bill. I
thank the noble Lord for giving us the opportunity to debate these
important points. However, while I am in full agreement with him that
we must consider the impacts of bills on hard-pressed households, I am
not persuaded by his
proposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000359" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000359">First,
the concept of a scheme with nationally mandated eligibility criteria
simply ignores the reality of the water industry, which is structured
on a regional basis. Different water company regions have different
customer bases. Average incomes and the cost of living vary
substantially from region to region, as do the costs of supplying water
and sewerage services. A top-down, centralist approach could take no
account of these regional variables. A centrally mandated set of
eligibility criteria would have a completely different impact on
households living in otherwise identical circumstances, depending on
which region they happened to be
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000360" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000360">This is
why the Government’s approach is focused on company social
tariffs. We have issued statutory guidance that requires the companies
to work with their customers to develop local solutions. These must be
tailored to local circumstances and acceptable to customers who foot
the bill. Companies have been able to introduce social tariffs since
April 2013—for slightly less than a year. In the past year,
three have done so. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, feels that the pace of
change is too slow, but by 2015-16 the majority of water companies will
have a social tariff in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000361" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000361">Legislating
for this change will not make it happen any faster. Given the
requirements to develop nationally mandated eligibility criteria, it
could actually slow the pace at which social tariffs are rolled out.
That could delay the point at which some hard- pressed households 
<?notus-xml column=328?>receive the help that they need. As the noble Lord said, I have
mentioned before that all incumbent water and sewerage companies have
already developed packages to help customers with affordability
problems. These include customer assistance funds, support tariffs,
debt advice and water efficiency measures. Social tariffs have provided
a valuable additional
tool.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000362" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000362">The
second important point in relation to this proposal is that it remains
far from clear how it is intended to fund this scheme. This is not a
minor point of detail; it is the key point, which needs to be
addressed. In discussions in another place, there were two suggestions
for how such a scheme could be funded. Broadly speaking, these can be
characterised as either some form of cross-subsidy from ineligible
customers, or some form of tax on profits. These are materially
different approaches with very different implications, so it is right
to seek to get to the bottom of what is being
proposed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000363" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000363">A
nationally mandated affordability scheme funded by cross-subsidy would
be a tax on all water customers ineligible for help. This would be a
very blunt instrument. We must not forget that a great many households
that are ineligible for help with their water bills are nevertheless
living on very modest incomes. It would be hard on them to argue that
they should have to foot the bill without being properly engaged in the
development of a locally appropriate
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000364">Alternatively,
some have proposed that a national affordability scheme could be funded
by some form of windfall tax on company profits. In a price-capped
sector such as water, this would be an odd thing to do. The recent
publication of water companies’ business plans has demonstrated
how the price review can work to claw back benefits for customers. By
taking account of lower financing costs, Ofwat estimates that the next
price review could significantly reduce pressure on all
customers’ bills by between £120 million and
£750 million a year. Most water companies are
proposing flat or declining customer bills from 2015 to 2020. This is
in advance of Ofwat’s efficiency challenge. The spectre of a tax
on profits would seriously undermine the regulatory stability on which
this system is founded, unnerving investors and pushing up costs for
all
customers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000365">I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that it is vital that those who

criticisms fall into two categories. The first is that this is a
top-down proposition. It is not: it is a framework for companies to
introduce social tariffs and other measures that help affordability
within their own structures, subject to some minimum standards. It is
not an imposition from the centre of exactly how to do that. It is,
however, a failsafe if they fail to do it. The reality is that both the
regulator and the companies have hitherto been quite resistant to such
propositions. The noble Lord is right to say that, strictly speaking,
2013 was the first point at which they could consider them, but that
was because of the three-year delay since the 2010 Bill and, before the
2010 Bill, deep resistance within the industry to any such concept.
Therefore, we have form here and it is not sensible to be complacent
that in 18 months’ time the companies will have sorted all this
out. I do not believe they will. That is why they need a push and a
framework that sets minimum standards of eligibility and
operation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000370">The
Minister’s second criticism concerns the funding of this
proposition. He said that it could be funded out of a tax on profits. I
have not proposed a tax on profits and I think the noble Lord’s
brief misunderstands what was said in another place about this. It is
fairly evident to me—and my noble friend Lord Hanworth has
pointed this out on many occasions—that actually most water
companies could afford to be a bit more generous to their consumers in
relation to profits, dividends and the tax that they currently pay, but
that is not in any sense an advocacy of a windfall tax, so let us get
that out of the way. The other funding proposal is by cross-subsidy. In
one sense, social tariffs are by definition a cross-subsidy. Therefore,
if the Minister hopes that all companies will come up with social
tariffs or equivalent schemes, the objection is just as valid to his
proposition as it is to mine. Therefore, there is no additional
cross-subsidy compared with the preferred outcome of the Government on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:41:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000371" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000371"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="14020661000765" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000765">Lord

appropriate forms in discussion with the DWP and other government
departments and agencies that work in this field with vulnerable and

that it would be a burden on private landlords. I suspect it would be
slightly less of a burden, as somebody pointed out in one of the

so at this point, but if a company has a debt record that is 100% worse

non-recovery of debt has on their income. This would be a discretionary
power for Ofwat but a useful power and a useful spur to companies to
take debt recovery much more seriously than one or two of them do at
present. At the end of the day, it is the other consumers who pay off
this debt. A national average of £15—some would put a

Whitty, seek to deal with this. I suspect that it would be better to
deal with this in secondary rather than primary legislation, as was
originally intended. Nevertheless, I believe that my noble friend on
the Front Bench should encourage the thrust of these amendments, to
make sure that those who can afford their water perfectly well should
be induced to pay for it, and that the water companies should be
assisted in this, particularly by those with information on who is
responsible for paying the bill. Landlords are often in a position to
provide that information. All assistance should be given in this case.

Amendment 120 would add a new clause to the Bill requiring landlords to
provide contact details for their tenants at the request of the water
company. Section 45 of the Flood and Water Management Act 2010 already
enables Ministers to bring forward secondary legislation that would
require landlords to provide water companies with personal details
about their tenants—or themselves become liable for paying the
bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000392" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000392">Following<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>
extensive consultation in January 2012 with the industry and with
landlords’ organisations, the Government took the decision that
a voluntary approach would be more suitable. During consultation,
landlords argued that the additional regulatory burden on them would be
disproportionate, as they are not the source of the problem that we are

decisions based on the evidence. One purpose of the consultation was to
invite the water industry to provide evidence of the benefits of the
regulatory approach. In particular, neither the companies nor Water UK
were able to provide any facts about the proportion of bad debt in
rented properties that results from a lack of information about the
occupier. This evidence was essential to assessing the benefit of the
measure. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>

evidence shows that good practice in tackling bad debt is not applied
consistently across the water sector—the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, referred to this; that is something that we can agree on. The
significant variation in performance between companies tells me that
the focus should be on driving better standards across the sector
rather than on regulating landlords. I used to run my own business and
I know that debt collection, which is a subject that I know quite a lot
about, is a matter largely of application and hard work. One reason why
we do not propose to bring forward the bad debt regulations on
landlords is that we do not wish to endorse the argument that
performance on bad debt is outwith the control of the water companies.
There is more that the companies can do to collect their debts and we
want them to focus on this rather than looking to government to solve
the problem for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000395" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000395">Of<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:57:44"></hs_TimeCode>
course, the real driver of company performance is the incentives and

that Ofwat has changed the approach that it takes to bad debt in the
methodology 
<?notus-xml column=334?>that it is using for the 2014 price review. The new approach will enable
it more effectively to bear down on the costs of bad debt. It is doing
this by insisting that the companies demonstrate that any increase in
bad debt is genuinely beyond their control and that they have taken all
available steps to control it. Unless they can prove that this is the
case, they will not be allowed to include it in customer

explained, and I think this answers the point made by my noble friend

down on the costs of bad debt. It is requiring companies to demonstrate

Neville-Rolfe (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, as a new peer—like a
new entrant to the water industry—I have been trying to
understand this important industry: 
<?notus-xml column=336?>who does what and where power lies. At Tesco, I was regulated by more
than 30 bodies, so I have some experience, but I have found this sector
very hard to get my head around. My last job in Whitehall, under my
elegant and noble friend Lord Heseltine, was about minimising and
improving regulation, occasionally with
success<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:04:28"></hs_TimeCode>. I also
worked on land drainage and flood protection in what is now Defra when
the Thames Barrier was still being built, so I have great sympathy with
my noble friend the Minister today—and for the victims of the
floods.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000405">When I
look at a regulated area, I always try to think of the impact on
business, consumers and others affected, and take a long-term view.
From all these perspectives, the scale and complexity of this
Bill—all 230 pages of it—worry me. It introduces more
competition, which I very much welcome in principle, but we also have a
new administrative spoke in the wheel of water management—the
market operator, whose role the noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, sought
on Tuesday to bring into the light of day. My amendment would introduce
a new clause giving duties to the Secretary of State and seeks to do
two things. I will address the second part first because I think no one
can object to it. It is about
transparency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000406">I
want an explanation and/or map, not on several websites as exist at
present, but in one special place that would enable a new entrant, an
investor whether in water resources or stocks, to understand the
system. I want everyone’s duties set out clearly and
transparently in one place. How helpful it would be to find in one
place not only the list of bodies that can regulate or affect water and
every kind of regulation but also exactly what their powers are and
where and when they will be exercised. For example, this explanatory
map would explain when the Environment Agency is able to
intervene—a concern my noble friend Lady Parminter expressed on
Tuesday—or when we can expect the delayed reforms on abstraction
to take effect. It would help with the confusion over debt-collection
powers, which we have just discussed. That clarity would also reduce
overlap and waste. I know from working in business that having clear
responsibilities that are well documented and understood cuts waste and
improves implementation and compliance. We should of course put the map
on the web, perhaps in a special internet app that all of us could
download. The web is where enterprising people and new entrants search.
It is cheap and
easy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000407" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000407">The
first part of my amendment is more contentious because it is about
changing the way regulators, public servants and their ministerial
masters behave. It is a requirement to minimise bureaucracy in every
aspect of water, sewerage and abstraction, from negotiating at the
highest level in Brussels to creating the humblest code. If lots of
agencies and departments operate a cornucopia of rules and regulations,
they spend too much time asking undertakers, consumers and each other
for the same information, talking to each other and sometimes rowing,
writing submissions and guidance, correcting errors and even
fighting judicial reviews. Much of that activity is created
by confusion and sometimes by inconsistency, which the proposed process
would help to prevent. The bureaucratic burdens created cost money.
That is not only wasteful 
<?notus-xml column=337?>but has to be paid for. I suspect that in the water system, with its
regulated system of returns through Ofwat, this money often comes from
consumers without benefiting anyone else—or it
consumes taxpayers’ money, which, with the legacy of the
deficit, we cannot afford.</hs_para>

Crickhowell:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend made a formidable
speech at Second Reading in which she launched her assault on
overregulation. Already today, dealing with other amendments, a number
of noble Lords spoke about the difficulty of following the details of
this legislation. I have explained that despite my experience of trying
to regulate part of the water industry, I find the Bill almost totally
incomprehensible. At Second Reading, I said that it is the most
incomprehensible Bill I have come across in 43 years in both Houses.
This is partly because it amends two other major pieces of legislation.
Indeed, when I struggled to draft some amendments and decided the task
was beyond me, I got down from the shelves in the Library one of those
earlier Acts and realised that it was not going to get me much further.
We have also been debating a series of regulations, some of them not
yet known.</hs_para>

subject my noble friend has raised is of great importance. It has
already been suggested that following the completion of the passage of
the Bill the Government must try to bring together in a simple,
co-ordinated way the principal points, clauses and requirements of the
Bill. That argument has been strengthened, reinforced and added to by
my noble friend. Her idea that the principal matters be brought
together on a single website is admirable. I do not know whether
anything quite like that has ever been done in government
before.</hs_para>

trouble with government departments is that they tend to be very
self-contained and self-sufficient. Getting them to work together in a
co-ordinated way is sometimes extremely difficult. That makes the job
even more difficult for the consumer because if you do not know what
the legislation and regulations are and you do not even know the
appropriate department dealing with it, you are likely to be lost.
Following the passage of the Bill, the Government must give some very
careful thought to how the public, small businesses and those who are
being regulated are to be brought to understand exactly what they have
to do, what benefits may accrue if they do it and what penalties may
accrue if they fail to do it.</hs_para>

Earl of Selborne:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to give the Minister a
little encouragement. We all recognise that this is a hopelessly
complicated Bill that has been many years in gestation. On a number of
occasions, we have complimented Defra, rightly so, on its briefing
notes—yet another has come out today. Start putting those on a
website, and you will have a work of reference that will be of enormous
assistance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000413">One
of the things in previous decades that has led to confusion has been
the fact that the three different regulatory authorities—the
Environment Agency, Ofwat and the Drinking Water
Inspectorate—have different agendas and, before these new duties
of resilience came in for Ofwat, there was no reason why Ofwat and the
Environment Agency should ever agree. As I said at Second Reading, I
never really felt that I was going to feel sorry for the water
companies, but on that aspect I did because they were being dragged in
two different directions.</hs_para>

manage water in an appropriate way, you should do it by catchments, but
unfortunately you cannot organise Great Britain, or even England and
Wales, by catchments. That is, alas, not the way that local government,
or any government, works. In the Bill, we are trying to
promote sustainable management of water. That means starting at the
estuary and working uphill, and if that can be done by catchment, so
much the better. You try and get all the different bodies together,
preferably with voluntary agreement—I agree with my noble friend
who moved this amendment that, if you can do that without regulation,
so much the better—but of course there must of course be a
regulatory framework, and no one is disputing that.</hs_para>

some small words of comfort for my noble friend on the Front Bench is
that I think that the Bill, complicated though it is, goes a long way
towards bringing the two main regulatory authorities—the
Environment Agency and Ofwat—to a common agenda. If we asked in
Scotland, where there is yet another regulatory authority, I think they
would say that their relationships with Ofwat—on roughly the
same agenda, but with a completely different competitive background for
the past five years—can now only improve. That is important as
some catchments straddle the Scottish and English border. If ever there
was a case for ensuring that we work to a common agenda, it must be for
those people in the catchment area of the River

Spicer:</Member></B> My Lords, I am inspired by my noble friend Lord
Crickhowell, who said that his worry was that there is a process of
intervention, greater control and centralisation taking place on a
wider scale, of which the water industry may be part. I do not know
much about the water industry, but I do know about the electricity
industry—I declare an interest as chair of the trade association
for the electricity industry—as I was the Minister who took the
electricity privatisation Bill through Parliament some 20 years ago. In
that industry, there is certainly increasing intervention by Government
and by the regulator. There is a definite trend. What happens
eventually we will have to see, but I suspect the same thing is going
on with water.</hs_para>

reservation with my noble friend’s amendment is whether it would
make the process of regulation more efficient, more centralised and
more bureaucratic or whether, in some way, it would do the reverse. I
hope that it would do the reverse, because that is what we want to see.
If she could address that point, it would be very helpful to me in

Moynihan:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I support the amendment
proposed, although again I anticipate that the Minister is not going to
be able to accept it. I would like to echo the comments made by my
noble friend Lord Selborne about the briefing notes, which have been
outstandingly helpful. In a latter edition, there was a very helpful
road map which draws together some of these key issues. In the spirit
of being helpful to my noble friend on the Front Bench, if the Minister
is not in a position to accept the amendment on the face of the Bill, I
hope that he will encourage his officials to give prominence to that
road map on the website, and therefore in part meet the suggestion in
my noble friend’s amendment.</hs_para>

this is a matter of wider significance in Government. I hope that the
Minister agrees that this is a subject that the Cabinet Office should
look at carefully, not just in the context of water but in the wider
context of the utilities. There is a necessity for clarity for those
who do not spend many hours sitting on your Lordships’ Benches

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness on
producing such an important amendment. I suspect that it is beyond the
Minister’s pay grade to agree that, in accepting the amendment,
we would at one and the same time get Parliament to rationalise the way
in which we legislate, get Ministers to ensure regulators co-ordinate
with each other and get departments to make their activities
comprehensible to the public. Nevertheless, these are welcome
ambitions. The noble Earl, Lord Selborne, added some rationalisation of
the quangos as well. I am afraid that all this is indicative of the way
in which we do business. From listening to the noble Lord, Lord
Crickhowell, both at an earlier stage and today, I understand that this
is not a new problem—I have noticed that the Water Industry Act
1991 is seven pages longer than the Bill we are considering.</hs_para>

about this, one of the great failings of Parliament has been the
failure to produce consolidated legislation in any field. After 15 or
16 years in this House, I still fail to understand why Parliament has
not devised a procedure for pulling together consolidation of Acts in
all areas, so the noble Baroness’s amendment has wider
implications. Whether the amendment should sit in the Bill I will leave
to the Minister but, much more narrowly, the proposition that for each
subject matter there should be a single website address which links to
all the different bits of regulation, authorities and other government
interventions, is very good. It is one which 
<?notus-xml column=340?>has been talked about in Whitehall but hardly delivered at all. The one
point where Defra could probably take this amendment on board in the
context of water is regarding that single website. I think
practitioners, companies and consumers would be very pleased to see
such a development. I congratulate the noble Baroness, but we will see

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for her
Amendment 122A, which would introduce a new statutory duty on the
Secretary of State to ensure that the bodies involved in regulation of
the water industry work to minimise bureaucracy. It would also require
a definition of all the statutory bodies concerned with water to be
published on a single website. I strongly support her in her desire to
minimise bureaucracy, duplication of effort and waste. I am quite sure
that I railed against it and for the consolidation of legislation when
I was in opposition, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, is enjoying doing
today. These issues are not exclusive to this sector. Indeed, this
Government have an energetic and far-reaching programme of reform
designed to slash red tape wherever possible. I would argue that we

that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000423">My
department has been one of the trailblazers in Whitehall in
transforming our approach to regulation. For example, through our
Smarter Environmental Regulation Review, in which I have been closely

duplication of environmental regulation. We are also rationalising
environmental guidance and data reporting to make it easier to comply
with legal obligations. My department has also carried out a
comprehensive assessment of the costs and benefits of all the
regulations for which we are responsible. Through the Red Tape
Challenge initiative, we have reviewed more than 1,200
regulations and by the end of this Parliament we expect to be
delivering savings to business of more than £250 million each

the specific changes being made by the Bill, first and foremost I
should emphasise that it does not create any new public bodies. The
existing regulatory landscape remains unchanged in that regard. I am
grateful for this opportunity to clarify the current framework for
regulation in the water sector. In England, the water industry is
regulated by three separate, independent bodies: Ofwat, the Drinking
Water Inspectorate and the Environment Agency. Ofwat is the economic
regulator responsible for ensuring that water and sewerage companies
provide consumers with a good quality service and value for money. This
includes setting price limits to ensure that customers receive a fair
deal, while ensuring that the companies are able to attract low-cost
investment in our essential services.</hs_para>

Government commissioned an independent review of Ofwat and consumer
representation in the water sector in 2011. Undertaken by experienced
regulator David Gray, the review concluded that regulation in the water
sector has worked well since privatisation and that major changes to
the statutory and institutional 
<?notus-xml column=341?>framework were not required. The Ofwat review made a range of
recommendations about the ways in which the regulator could reduce the
regulatory burden it places on the industry. In response, Ofwat put in
place a programme of internal reform and substantially reduced
reporting and other burdens. It has since revised its approach to the
price review—something we talked about earlier today—in
order to ensure that companies focus on their customers’
priorities rather than looking to the regulator for
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000426">The
Environment Agency regulates the impact of the water industry on our

abstraction as well as the treatment and discharge of wastewater back

Government have introduced a process whereby all public bodies are
subject to triennial review to scrutinise how the Government deliver
their objectives as effectively and efficiently as possible, achieving
the best possible value for taxpayers and the public. The Environment
Agency was reviewed under this process in 2013. The review looked at

laid down by Ofwat. In fact, the market operator will serve to minimise
bureaucracy by providing a single set of administrative systems for
switching customers, which would otherwise need to be duplicated by
every company operating in the market. In our debates on this matter on
Tuesday my noble friend Lord Selborne noted that such bodies are a
common feature of regulated utility industries.</hs_para>

challenging red tape and bureaucracy. We have the Red Tape Challenge
process, which has already scrutinised all the regulations affecting
the water industry. We have established the principles for economic
regulation to guide the high-level institutional design of the
regulatory frameworks by the Government. These reinforce the
Government’s role in establishing the policy direction and
appropriate guidance, leaving regulators to regulate independently. A
new regulators’ code also takes effect in April that will apply
to non-economic regulators such as the Environment Agency and the

about the possibility of the map I proposed being made on a catchment

county-by-county map, is that it is not very effective. One of the

agencies and requirements in one place on the one website. That can
certainly be on the gov.uk website, as the Minister has kindly
suggested, but they all need to come together so that a consumer, an

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak also to Amendment 124.
These amendments deal with the water resource management
plans. Water resource management plans, to colleagues who are not
familiar with them, are the 25-year plans which each water company is
required to produce, which then have to be approved by the Environment
Agency. Those plans are fairly strategic. A lot of thought and work
goes into them and there is a lot of consultation on them—but it
is not always clear what they are used for thereafter. One presumes
that the companies follow them for their own strategic decisions. To a
limited extent Ofwat follows them in terms of the allowance for capital
expenditure that is required in the price review. However, that covers
only five years, and Ofwat, try as it might, cannot always see 25 years
ahead as regards the changing capital and management requirements that
will be
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:34:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000437" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000437">The

the key issue. However, it is also important that the plans allow
various regulatory, environmental, water quality and resilience
requirements to be met. For example, water framework directive
timetables and objectives and various ecological requirements have to
be met. Following the Government’s inclusion of resilience as a
primary duty of Ofwat, companies will undoubtedly have to meet
requirements under the resilience criteria by a certain date. The
amendment seeks to broaden what the plans deliver in public
policy terms and therefore includes a requirement
to meet environmental, quality and resilience
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14020661000439" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000439">Amendment
124 deals with an issue at which I hinted earlier—namely, that
once the relevant plans are in place, the environmental regulator and
the economic regulator need to pay attention to them. At the moment,
following a change of direction or policy on the part of either Ofwat
or the Environment Agency, decisions can be taken which do not accord
with the plans. Theoretically, the relevant company then has to change
the plans but probably does not do so until it has to revise them in
five or six years’ time. Amendment 124 suggests that
the Bill requires the relevant regulator to have regard to those plans
when conducting price reviews, and that the Environment 
<?notus-xml column=344?>Agency must do so when conducting its regulatory and enforcement
activity. If that is not done, the plans will gather dust on the shelf,
will be referred to occasionally by the companies themselves but will

Exactly the same thing is happening in electricity—carbon
considerations are resulting in more and more powers being given to the
regulator, and it is now happening in respect of all the

closer joint working between Ofwat and the Environment Agency than may

are minor and technical amendments to ensure consistency and to correct
drafting errors, or provide consequential provisions to the Bill. For
example, Amendments 126 and 130 change the wording in new Sections
63AF(3) and 110O(3) of the Water Industry Act 1991 so that they refer
to “a code” rather than “the code”, as is
currently the case. This corrects a drafting error and provides
consistency in Clauses 31 and 32 respectively. Amendment 149 makes a
consequential change in Schedule 7 by changing an incorrect reference
to “any licensed water supplier” so that it refers to
“any water supply licensee” instead. I beg to

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 134 and the other two
amendments in this group deal with the issue of collective consumer
rights. We are now into the consumer field. The water industry or
service has pretty standard terms. Tariffs, whether by volume in the
metered sector, or by rateable value in the non-metered sector, are
pretty standard. Charging schemes and means of payment are also usually
pretty standard. The nature of the service—the supply of
water—is fairly straightforward. However, there are wider
services 
<?notus-xml column=348?>in terms of advice, and emergency services when a customer is cut off or
there are leakages. If something goes wrong on all these fronts, more
than one consumer is likely to be
affected<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:51:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000456" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000456">The
Bill introduces a degree of choice, but only in a relatively limited
field. It leads to the possibility of switching, but in general people
will be faced with standard terms and a standard service. Failure to
provide the service or the misallocation of costs or mis-selling of
prices is likely to affect a significant number of people. However, the
consumer rights in this field and the procedures which are written into
this and more general legislation are almost entirely written in terms
of
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:51:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000457" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020661000457">Amendment
134 allows group complaints. If a whole village complains about the way
its water has been cut off, the complaint would not need to be dealt
with property by property. If a whole tranche of customers feels
aggrieved by the prices they are being charged or the overcharging of
prices, the amendment allows them all, either on an opt-in or opt-out
basis, to bring complaints. The noble Lord, Lord Spicer, raised an
example a few minutes ago in relation to the overcharging of people who
have agreed to pay by direct debit in advance on a metered

recently introduced the Consumer Rights Bill in the other place. That
legislation does something that I have been advocating for a
considerable time—it introduces a degree of collective rights
and collective redress generally across the consumer field. However, it
only relates to abuse of competition law; it does not relate to
mis-selling or unfair contract terms. But it is at least a start. I
have argued on most Bills, whether on banking services, the energy
industry or more generally, that we should have more collective
provision in terms of enforcement rights. That should also be
recognised in this legislation as regards

provide the basis for dealing with such a complaint in the first
instance and for redress to be granted on a collective basis. In other
words, everybody who suffers from unfair treatment should be allowed to
have equivalent redress, however many pounds that would be in
compensation. Noble Lords will be aware of how this has got out of hand
in another sector where every PPI claim has had to be pursued by
individuals or claims companies. We know the effects of that. Had the
complainants woken up to this a lot earlier, they could have proposed a
collective redress system. This is less likely to arise in water
because it is a less complex industry, but, by definition, that means
that where it does go wrong more people are likely to be involved. It
is therefore important that this is written into the

the 2003 Act—and provided a number of consumer rights or
protections. Most subsequent legislation has adjusted to the fact that
CCWater now exists, but not in relation to the provisions on charging
schemes. I am therefore suggesting,

clarification about the effect of the amendment, which it seems
concerns individual complaints as well as collective ones. As I see it,
having been in business, complaints are normally dealt with by the
business or authority to which they come. You do not want to have
special schemes unless there is something pretty serious and bad. I
want to understand the purport of this amendment—if it is
actually bringing in a whole load of new things that are going to be
done by an authority or statute rather than by the company that is
meant to be doing the right thing for the consumer, I am

for his amendments, which, as he laid out, relate to the vital question
of consumer protection. Most noble Lords, bar one, seemed to be

noble Lord thinks that, at the moment, this provision applies only to a
single claimant. I will address whether the consumer redress scheme
includes complaints made by groups of customers as well as complaints
made by individual ones. I can clarify that the ability to address
consumer complaints, whether they relate to a single customer or to a
group of customers, is already reflected in this clause, which is
drafted in such a way as to be inclusive rather than exclusive. To be
clear, it covers complaints by both individual customers and groups of
customers collectively—I want to put that very clearly on the
record. The noble Lord might like to know that CCWater has already
successfully taken up complaints on behalf of groups of customers, for
example in a conurbation where a number of neighbours wished to
challenge their surface water drainage charges. I hope, therefore, that
he is reassured on the first area that he flagged up here.</hs_para>

agree that consumer protection is an important matter in the context of
the Bill. I also put on record and inform noble Lords that this is an
area where action is already being taken. The industry, Ofwat and the
Consumer Council for Water are working together to improve their
collective approach to consumer redress. An independent
dispute-resolution scheme is being established to give all customers an
independent route for resolving their complaints without 
<?notus-xml column=350?>having to go to court. The new scheme aims to provide a transparent
mechanism for resolving complaints that have reached a deadlock under
current arrangements. Work on this scheme is already well advanced,
with all the water companies having signalled their support, and I note

Consumer Council for Water also has a central role in the new scheme.
It will continue to negotiate with companies on behalf of customers,
and be responsible for identifying when complaints cannot be resolved
and therefore need to be directed to the adjudicator. This approach is
backed by the companies, Ofwat and the Consumer Council for Water. All
involved agree that referring complaints to the adjudicator should be
the exception rather than the rule. Like my noble friend Lady
Neville-Rolfe, we want to see companies get this right first time. In
this context the role of government should be to facilitate rather than
to regulate. If we want the industry to take greater responsibility for
meeting customer expectations we must enable it to take responsibility
for resolving customer complaints, and so we are pleased to see this
scheme being taken forward by companies, Ofwat and the Consumer Council
for Water.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020662000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0002.htm#14020662000006">The

it is important to put it on record in relation to CCWater. The second

investigate any relevant complaint referred to it, and to report on
those matters to Ministers and the regulator. However, CCWater is an
advocate on behalf of customers. Its crucial advocacy role means that
it would be inappropriate to give it adjudication responsibilities.

are systems involving CCWater for taking it further. Ultimately it

more capital than was allowed for in the price review, they can go back
in. Thames Water went back in to see Ofwat about additional money for
the super-sewer. It was knocked back by Ofwat but it had the right to
ask. I imagine that companies do not do it more often because if the
company reopens the price settlement, Ofwat has the right to reopen it

does not have the power to initiate a reopening. It uses informal
powers, and has been quite successful in negotiating with some
companies over the current five-year period for reductions in prices

the cost of capital was significantly less in practice than had been
allowed for when the price review was concluded. In reality, as my
noble friend Lord Hanworth has pointed out more than once, that
allowance for capital has permitted a significant degree of profit
enhancement and dividend enhancement by companies, and it is important
that Ofwat keeps an eye on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020662000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0003.htm#14020662000016">Amendment
137 would allow Ofwat to reopen the settlement if it thought that the
way in which it was operating was no long appropriate to the economic
circumstances, or that the company’s own behaviour gave it cause
to reopen it because the terms of the settlement were no longer
appropriate. Amendment 146 would provide some background for
this. It would require water undertakers to provide information to
Ofwat on a regular, annual basis on their financial affairs. This could
be dealt with separately from the other amendment, but we have grouped
them together for these purposes and there is an interrelationship. If
this is a different provision from the very detailed cost breakdown
that Ofwat now requires from companies in advance of the price review
every five years, and if we move to a more competitive market, the
details of that form of regulation may not have to be so onerous over
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020662000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0003.htm#14020662000017">This
amendment looks at how companies perform during the price period. It
will provide a big picture of how the financial operation as a whole is
working out. As we have constantly reiterated, there is a problem in
this industry of a vertically-integrated regional monopoly, with higher
levels of gearing, dividends—they have been at over 90% of
income over the past few years—and rates of return on assets, in
a relatively low-risk industry, paying relatively low levels of
taxation. There are issues about the totality of the finances of the
sector that a regulator ought to be free to query. It certainly should
have information on it. Your Lordships may have heard a recent
programme about this on the BBC’s “File on 4”. I
did not agree with all of it, but it pointed out, for example, that
some of these companies have at least seven levels of executive
decisions before reaching the real decision-makers at ownership level.

particular.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020662000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0003.htm#14020662000018">It
is important that Ofwat can challenge the way in which these companies
conduct their financial affairs. Amendment 146 would provide it with
the information for doing so and Amendment 137 would allow it to 
<?notus-xml column=353?>reopen the price settlement if it saw that there were serious and
endemic concerns about the way in which a company was operating, or
about changes in the cost of capital or the level of corporate internal
transfer pricing and so forth. It is important that Ofwat understands
the total system and it is important that it has the ability to reopen
the settlement. Of late, water companies have received fairly bad
publicity because of their overall financial structure. At the moment,
the regulatory system cannot really address that and does not have the
information needed in order to address it. This is a gap in
Ofwat’s powers that needs to be filled. I beg to

would place a new duty on Ofwat to take into account the proposed

then give Ofwat a further power to consider this information when
determining whether to reopen a price review. Ofwat already has the
power to reopen a price review under the substantial beneficial effects
clause of the water company’s licence or by making an interim
determination. If a water company is profiting from factors outside its
immediate management control that were not anticipated at the time of
the price determination, Ofwat can reopen its five-year price
settlement. So Ofwat has the powers necessary to revisit price
determinations. However, given the importance of regulatory stability
in keeping prices down for customers, it rightly utilises these with
caution and considers carefully whether there would be benefit to
customers.</hs_para>

Minister rightly admonishes me for looking backwards rather than
forwards, but we have to look backwards to the immediate past. We have
had two 
<?notus-xml column=355?>five-year price reviews. At the beginning of those reviews, the cost of
capital, which is a huge part of the actual expenditure of the
industry, was seriously overestimated over a period of 10 years, and
prices set accordingly. During that period, the capital value of water
companies went up substantially; the dividend payments went up
substantially and a number of them were taken over, sometimes two or
three times. Somebody made a significant amount of money out of that;
it was not because of the increased efficiency of the industry,
although the industry did make some efficiencies. It was a
fortuitousness similar to when Ofwat, with what it thought was the best
information at the time, set the allowance for capital; that allowed a
much bigger profit than one had assumed at that

its existing powers, Ofwat did not judge, nor did successive
Secretaries of State seek to nudge them to intervene. If the public
knew that the system of regulation did not allow them to do so, they
would be pretty appalled. I therefore think we need to do something.
The Minister might not like my particular proposals—and they
certainly are not perfect—but Ofwat needs to know what the
unforeseen financial consequences are of the companies’
operations. It needs to have some ability to intervene on behalf of
consumers—business as well as individual consumers—if it

on this one. When I saw this provision, it jumped out of the page at me
because the Bill seems to delete the requirement to provide mapping of
flood vulnerability. Having now checked the impact assessment and
checked with the Environment Agency, I see that it is clear that the
particular clause is not inappropriate in the circumstances, but I
thought I would use this opportunity to ask the Minister to tell us,
perhaps in writing, what maps are now statutorily required for flood
risks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000494" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0003.htm#14020661000494">This

is some urgency to the issue because I know that there are, to put it
neutrally, constraints on the Environment Agency’s resources in
this area. The agency is, probably rightly, trying to focus what
resources it has on front-line services. However, if you focus on
front-line services in a diminishing budget, you inevitably cut
backroom services, some of which are in this area of mapping and
prediction—which is done by the 
<?notus-xml column=357?>Environment Agency but often in conjunction with the Met
Office—of where flood risk is likely to arise in future. As I
said, I do not expect a detailed argument from tonight’s

an indication of what mapping is required and what resources are there

I support my noble friend Lord Whitty in his challenge to the
Government and, to some extent, the Environment Agency. At the moment,
my home down in Dorset is technically under a flood alert. I can look
at maps on the Environment Agency’s website and the detailed
data on river levels at the station near to my home which, during this
sort of scenario, are updated every few hours. In conjunction with
looking at the Met Office website—because I am an experienced
watcher of these things—I can predict pretty accurately whether
we will flood. I am willing to put on record that I do not think we
will flood over the next 24 hours. We put our floodgates up—some
of them, but not all of them—but that is mostly because we could
not be bothered to take them down from the last
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020661000497" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-0003.htm#14020661000497">This
whole business is obviously very worrying for householders. I pay
tribute to the Environment Agency for making all the data available so
that people like me can, assuming we are online and confident enough to
use those tools, make that judgment. However, it is really important
that those resources are sustained and, as technology and resource
allows, are improved as more and more householders, given climate
change, worry more and more about their resilience for

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, when I heard the earlier debate about
consolidation and clarifying legislation, I thought that this was a
case in point. The noble Lord, Lord Whitty, rightly spotted that, too.
This amendment allows me to put something on record. The issue is about
duplicate records. Our plan is to repeal Section 195 on the basis that
a single record is all that is required. The Environment Agency is not
aware of any request having been made for the inspection of the
duplicate record required by Section 195. Of 
<?notus-xml column=358?>course, it will continue to maintain its primary and comprehensive sets
of data, including maps. I can assure the noble Lord, Lord Knight, that
public access to this information can be obtained under the
Environmental Information Regulations 2004, or for that matter under
the Freedom of Information Act 2000. This is a small
efficiency and cost saving to the Environment Agency, without detriment
to necessary data collection, maintenance or public access. I will
write to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, with details of the data held by
the Environment Agency. On that basis, I hope he will be happy to
withdraw his

that these maps are there but will change. They will change as a result
of development activities, because of climate change and our experience
of floods that are supposed to happen once in every 200 years in the
Somerset Levels—to return to that topic—but have happened
in two years. It is vital that mapping resources are there and
accessible to everybody, as they clearly already are to my noble friend

Hayman (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to have the
opportunity to introduce today’s debate on progress in combating
neglected tropical diseases and I draw attention to my non-financial
interests in health and development, particularly as a trustee of the
Sabin Vaccine Institute and the Malaria Consortium. I am also delighted
that what many would consider an abstruse and minority interest subject
has attracted such a large and expert speakers list—and even an
equally distinguished audience in the Moses Room—and I look
forward to hearing the
contributions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000004">I
am also glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Bates, here today as the
Minister replying. I welcome him to our world of worms, snails, flukes
and flies, the vectors of the group of parasitic and bacterial diseases
that are categorised as neglected tropical diseases—NTDs. Of
course, these diseases—afflictions such as river blindness,
human hookworm and elephantiasis—are not actually part of our
world as people who live in rich, developed countries. They are the
diseases of the world’s poorest people, predominantly the rural
poor. For them, NTDs are far from abstruse or a specialised interest;
they are illnesses that affect one in six of the world’s
population and blight the development of half a billion of the
world’s poorest children.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020664000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000005">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:02:15"></hs_TimeCode>
NTDs do not cause as many immediate deaths as AIDS, TB and malaria,
they kill, they maim and disfigure and they stunt and disable, causing
decades of pain and, often, isolation. These diseases not only have
direct effects but also weaken the immune system, cause anaemia, put
infected individuals at higher risk of contracting other diseases and
impair the ability to resist infection. They increase the risks in
pregnancy and childbirth and they can have a negative effect on the
efficacy of treatments for diseases such as TB. The link in particular
between genital schistosomiasis 
<?notus-xml column=128?>and HIV infection, particularly in young women, has not been taken
seriously enough in the past. Beyond those health effects, NTDs also
form a terrible barrier to education and employment. They are not only
the diseases of poverty; they are the diseases that cause poverty.
Combating NTDs is therefore one of the best routes to cutting the cycle
of poverty itself and to the sustainable development that we all
seek<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:03:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000006">The
good news is that, unlike with many diseases, we have many of the tools
necessary to combat those afflictions. We know that the combination of
mass drug administration and water and sanitation projects, for
example, can result in dramatic benefits and reduction in the incidence
of disease. With concerted effort, with research into new vaccines, new
diagnostics, new insecticides and medicines, with improved mapping and
monitoring, with operational research, we could make much more
progress. Much of that work is in train in academic institutions, in
the voluntary sector and in the countries themselves</hs_para>

of 2012, whose second anniversary we mark with this debate, was hugely
important, because it brought together funders, both national and
philanthropic, pharmaceutical companies that donate the drugs necessary
for mass drug administration programmes and endemic countries
themselves in an effort to co-ordinate the fight against these
diseases. Together with the ongoing support of the World Health
Organisation, which has championed this work in recent years, we have
seen a significant shift in the global prioritisation of neglected
tropical diseases. Their inclusion in the healthy lives goal of the
high-level panel on the post-2015 development agenda, published in May
last year, was, I believe, a crucial step
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000008">I
welcome, too, the formation of NTD coalitions, such as the very
successful one that we have in the UK, in countries across the world
and, particularly importantly, the drawing up of integrated NTD control
strategies in endemic countries. The academic and voluntary sector,
both of which are so strong in the United Kingdom, have much to offer
both in research and in resource. For example, the London Centre for
Neglected Tropical Disease Research, which had just been launched when
we debated this subject a year ago, works continuously to improve the
effectiveness of control measures. We need to know how to do what we do
better. Such technical support will be essential for plans such as the
recently drawn-up Africa regional NTD strategy if it is to be
successful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:05:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000009">As
well as technical support, money remains an issue. Even given the
relative cheapness—we know that many would argue that treating
NTDs was the best bang for your buck that you could get in public
health expenditure—and the cost efficiency of NTD control work,
given the extensive drug donations, it has been estimated that there is
still a £200 million funding gap to be bridged if we are to meet
the goals of the London declaration. I am not asking Her
Majesty’s Government to meet that gap themselves; they have
already been generous and committed in this area. However, I ask the
Minister what progress the Government are making in championing
investment 
<?notus-xml column=129?>in NTD work with other key international donor Governments, particularly
perhaps France, Germany and
Australia<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we have recently and sadly seen with polio eradication, conflict can
threaten to destroy the painstaking work of decades. When countries
experience violence and civil wars, health programmes and the benefits
that they provide to the poor and the marginalised are threatened.
Through the Malaria Consortium, I know of the situation in South Sudan.
There, it is working on DfID-supported programmes and bringing
long-standing expertise in malaria to bear on programmes to combat
neglected tropical diseases. We have discussed in your
Lordships’ House before the issue of not working in silos in
this area. Members of the charity’s staff had to be evacuated
during the recent violence and have only just been able to return. I
pay tribute to the courage and commitment of the very many—both
local and international—NGO workers throughout the world who
continue to operate in extremely difficult and often dangerous
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:08:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
On the specifics of South Sudan, I understand that the DfID NTD
programme, though not the malaria programme, is on hold because of the
perceived continuing dangers. I wonder whether the Minister could give
any indication today, or perhaps in writing, of when that programme
might be
restarted<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:08:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000011">I
return to the issue of a post-2015 millennium development goal.
Combating NTDs punches above its weight in broader health and wider
development terms. We need to renew and reinvigorate our commitment to
research, prevention and treatment programmes. By integrating existing
strategies such as mass drug administration with broader public health
programmes such as those on water, sanitation and education, we not
only enhance the effectiveness of those strategies but start to build
from the bottom up the sort of universal health coverage and health
systems needed to underpin development. Therefore, I end by
congratulating the Government on the leadership that they, together
with the United States, have given so far and I urge them to ensure
that NTD control features in the final formulation of the sustainable
post-2015 health
agenda.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020664000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000273"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:09:25"></hs_TimeCode></I>2.09

and expertise of the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, that brought me into
this world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>. More
than 200 million individuals in Africa are infected by schistosomiasis,
causing malnutrition, stunting, anaemia and eventually early death
through liver disease and bladder cancer. Dr Alan Fenwick and his team
at the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative at Imperial College run huge
and detailed programmes that reduce all this enormously. I declare a
non-financial interest as a trustee. His team and I are concerned first
with the humanitarian effects and alleviating suffering. I am there not
as a medic but to see that the charitable moneys are used cost
effectively—and they certainly
are<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:10:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:10:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000013">In
Africa, in 10 countries that receive aid from us, 50 million people
lose their ability to work each year to these diseases. Even if they

<?notus-xml column=130?>this amounts to $18 billion a year lost through disability. DfID is
currently investing £50 million over five years towards the
control of schistosomiasis and intestinal worms. For this amount, we
will be heading to eliminate these infections in two of these countries
and, for an estimated £50 million more, we could approach
elimination in another four of these countries. It will take longer in
the larger countries such as Ethiopia and DRC, but I was in Egypt only
this weekend, where they have demonstrated that it can be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000014">Since
the London declaration in January 2012, we have certainly taken several
positive steps. Donations from the pharmaceutical industry have
increased. GSK and Johnson &amp; Johnson have donated more de-worming
medicines, and more than 700 million people every year receive
albendazole either for lymphatic filariasis control or worm treatment
or both. Merck has increased its donation of praziquantel from an
annual 25 million to 250 million tablets in 2016, enough to treat
100 million children every year. But this is not
elimination<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000015">The
member states of the 2012 World Health Assembly adopted a resolution to
try to eliminate schistosomiasis where feasible by 2020. All that is
being done will help to reach elimination in some countries but not
without technical assistance and supplementary funding. In addition,
DfID has doubled its support and between 2011 and 2016 we will assist
Governments in the 10 countries to deliver 200 million
treatments. Mindful business people have stepped in, such as Luke Ding,
who manages his philanthropy through Prism the Gift Fund, where I am a
trustee. We administer the giving by individuals such as Luke and by
large foundations by helping them to gift significant amounts to
charities cost effectively. Luke made a donation last year of
£275,000 to assist SCI in general and our programme in
Madagascar<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:12:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000016">All
this is great. We know that we could reach elimination with economic
development and better water and sanitation, which could be done by
pulling together British and American aid programmes to work
synergistically across Africa. With an additional sum of £200
million for 2014 and 2020, we would have the guaranteed funding for the
programme for the integrated control of schistosomiasis in sub-Saharan
Africa, or ICOSA. We could expand coverage and move towards the WHO
target of elimination of schistosomiasis in particular and the other
NTDs in the poorest rural communities in Africa. That sounds a lot of
money, but noble Lords should remember that the successful elimination
would save 50 million DALYs—disability annual lost
years—which would mean $18 billion a year
saved for ever

some noble Lords may know, Guinea worm is a parasitic infection
contracted by drinking contaminated water containing water fleas
harbouring infective Guinea worm larvae. Inside the human’s

long as three feet or more and, after a year of incubation, the worm
creates a lesion in the skin and slowly emerges from the host
person’s body. The contamination cycle begins when the victims
immerse their limbs in water to ease their agonising pain, stimulating
the emerging worm to release larvae into the water and begin the cycle

it is worth comparing to the situation with tuberculosis. As far as I

40 million women of childbearing age and 7 million pregnant women per

million women suffer from genital schistosomiasis. Apart from causing
much pain and distress, this condition also is linked to horizontal
transmission of the HIV/AIDS virus and is a possible major factor in
the AIDS epidemic. Hence, it is important for the control of HIV/AIDS,

the children in Africa and less then 10% of young girls, particularly
women. Millennium development goals post 2015 should include new
policies and advocacy of neglected tropical diseases, including the
elimination of helminth infection, which is possible, and better
alignment. Control of these infections to HIV/AIDS and malaria control

applaud this Government’s continued commitment to international
aid. Combating disease is a crucial part of this programme. We are now
marking the two-year anniversary of the historic London declaration on
neglected tropical diseases. Neglected tropical diseases affect more
than a billion people throughout the world. They often affect the
poorest people in the hardest-to-reach areas. The combined personal and
family suffering also translates into wider economic hardship, trapping
communities in a cycle of poverty. Eliminating NTDs is thought to be
one of the most cost-effective and comprehensive ways to achieve
development goals and eliminate poverty. Therefore, it is important
that work to combat NTDs is absorbed into wider-scale initiatives on
poverty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000033">Prevention
is also a key principle. Measures such as better health education,
greater nutrition and the provision of safe drinking water will help to
reduce cases in the first instance. We must celebrate the progress that
has been made in a number of ways. We have made political progress.
Last May, 32 countries took part in deliberations during which the
World Health Assembly adopted a resolution on all 17 neglected tropical
diseases. This resolution calls for more effective
financing and implementation of prevention and eradication
programmes. It makes important references to increasing access to
treatments. I am proud that the United Kingdom strongly supported this
resolution and has pledged to continue playing an important role in
this
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000034">We
have made progress on awareness. Neglected tropical diseases are
receiving more coverage than ever before and are firmly on the
international agenda. The engagement and generosity of pharmaceutical
companies must also be noted. We now have all the treatments required
to control and eliminate the seven most common NTDs. These account for
over 90% of the global
burden.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000035">Although
we have made progress, though, we must of course not be complacent. It
is still necessary to further increase and maintain this progress if we
are to reach our target. The millennium development goals expire in
2015. This provides us with a perfect opportunity to renew and
accelerate the focus on eradicating NTDs. In its report last summer,
the High-level Panel of Eminent Persons on the Post-2015 Development

up integrated NTD control and elimination strategies is considered one
of the most cost-effective ways to reduce global poverty. Virtually all
of the “bottom billion”, the 1.4 billion people around
the world who are living on less than $1.25 a day, are afflicted with
one or more of the seven most common NTDs: elephantiasis, hookworm,
river blindness, roundworm, whipworm, trachoma and snail fever. NTDs
disable, debilitate and perpetuate poverty and in worst-case scenarios
they can kill. They cause blindness, huge swelling in appendages and
limbs, severe malnutrition and anaemia—all brilliantly
highlighted, I might add, in the END7 Youtube video featuring Eddie
Redmayne and others.</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="14020664000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000039">Those afflicted include
more than 500 million children. In a randomised controlled trial in
Ethiopia, researchers found that consistently treating trachoma halved
childhood mortality, while a study in Kenya demonstrated that deworming
children leads to a 25% decrease in school absenteeism. Compare the
cost of one cup of coffee at Starbucks, which can range from
£1.75 to £3.50, to the fact that just 30p—or 50
cents, half a US dollar—per person per year is all that is
needed to treat and protect one person against all seven NTDs. This in
turn averts malnutrition, improves education outcomes, improves
maternal and child health, reduces new cases of HIV and sets the stage
for sustainable economic development. In Africa, the entire at-risk
population could be treated for £250 million or less annually.
Yet efforts to control and eliminate NTDs receive less than 2% of total
global health funding, and the elimination of many of the NTDs will not
be achieved without significant investment in water and sanitation
interventions. Such an approach should surely be central to post-2015
objectives, and I hope that we will hear from the Minister on
this.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020664000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000040">I am
particularly concerned that the 2013 report of the
Sustainable Development Solutions Network, <I>An Action
Agenda for Sustainable Development</I>, does not mention NTDs. Surely
that should be rectified. I hope that the Minister will comment on
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020664000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000041">Many of

and failing our duty, not to do it. My noble friend therefore deserves
our thanks for keeping this issue on the agenda, and the United Nations

parliamentarians and Governments the world over to make this achievable
objective a reality. I hope that the Minister will tell us that the

the pharmaceutical companies, global health organisations and

truly admirable. They were intended to be game-changing and I am
delighted to hear from my noble friend that the drug donations,
research and development funding and co-operation are making real
inroads in the attempt to control, eliminate or eradicate the 10 named
NTDs by 2020. The promise of the pharmaceutical companies under the
London declaration to donate many more drugs, worth hundreds of
millions of dollars a year, was a wonderful step but, as Dr Margaret
Chan, director-general of the World Health Organisation, said at the
time, drug donation is one solution but not the only
solution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000044">In
my four minutes, I will stress the importance of our investment in
research into NTDs and highlight the work of some of our health-focused
universities and their major contribution to development. The UK is a
hub of research excellence, with many academics from different
institutions all contributing to the fight against NTDs. Their work has
global impact and changes the lives of some of the poorest people on
the planet. The breadth of UK academic expertise and research in this
area is world-leading. It covers anthropology, public health, basic
science, epidemiology, clinical medicine, mathematical modelling and
operational research.</hs_para>

leading the way are Imperial College and the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine. Together with the Natural History Museum, they
last year formed the London Centre for Neglected Tropical Disease
Research. The centre’s research builds on the long-standing
expertise of UK academics in the epidemiology and transmission of NTDs,
such as that of Professor Alan Fenwick, whose team, working with
ministries of health across sub-Saharan Africa, assisted in the
delivery of 100 million treatments in Africa and, indeed, the Middle
East during 2013. Other speakers have referred to the research
priorities of the centre, including bilharzia and intestinal
worms.</hs_para>

our universities are well placed for multidisciplinary approaches from
the bench to the field. The Drug Discovery Unit at Dundee, referred to
by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, has made major breakthroughs in NTD
research, with £10 million of funding from the Wellcome Trust,
including more than £8 million for a partnership with
GlaxoSmithKline. Its teams work across academia, industry and the
charitable sector
worldwide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000047">There
is always more that needs to be done. For example, there has been very
little research into Buruli ulcer, an NTD in the leprosy family which
is on WHO’s road map but not included in the London declaration.
The exact mode of transmission is still unknown. There is no vaccine
for primary prevention, and secondary prevention is based on early
detection. WHO says that 80% of cases detected early can be 
<?notus-xml column=136?>cured with a combination of antibiotics. But early detection and
antibiotic treatment require health education at community level,
training of health workers and village volunteers, strengthening of
health facilities, laboratory confirmation of cases, standardised
recording and reporting systems, and monitoring and evaluation of
control
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000048">I

Trees (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, it is my pleasure to join others in
thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, for initiating this important
debate. The control of NTDs is a challenge, the success of tackling
which has been to some extent quite remarkable to date. To make it a
total success story, it is critical that the international community
maintains the momentum of the London declaration of 2012 to achieve the
goals of the WHO NTD 2012 road map on implementation for the control,
elimination and in some cases eradication of NTDs between 2015 and
2020.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000050">Most of
the NTDs are parasitic or bacterial diseases characterised, as has been
said, by high morbidity and chronicity, which affect some 1.4 billion
people in the world. These are severely debilitating and, in some
cases, disfiguring diseases, which have profound social, cultural and
economic effects. They contribute to poverty and poverty contributes to
their causes in a potentially permanent cycle of poverty. This
restrains economic development, social justice, equality and female
emancipation, as females and children are particularly at risk. The
targeting of these diseases is therefore an important contribution for
the attainment of the millennium development goals and any such targets
to be set
thereafter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000051">Historically,
these have been relatively neglected diseases, although, as a number of
noble Lords have commented, not by the very strong UK scientific
community working in this area. Indeed, we can take pride in the
efforts of British scientists such as Professor David Molyneux at
Liverpool, Professor Peter Holmes in Glasgow—he is chairman of
the NTD committee of WHO—and many others. We have heard about
the contributions from Dundee, Imperial and others. We can take great
pride in the contribution of those British scientists to ensuring that
these diseases are getting adequate research attention. Critically, the
WHO and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, among other NGOs, are
now taking these diseases seriously.</hs_para>

which has not had a great deal of attention in this debate so far but
is a major contribution to the control of these diseases, is the
generous donation of drugs worth between $2 billion and $3 billion a
year by a number of pharmaceutical companies. In spite of this
remarkable commercial philanthropy, there is still a funding gap, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, has commented, not only in ensuring
adequate surveillance, monitoring and delivery of the drugs that we
have, but also in research to improve therapies and to provide, in some
cases, vaccines. British institutions have a major role to play in
this.</hs_para>

development assistance for health is devoted to NTDs. The British
Government have set an excellent example, along with the US Government
and NGOs, but I join the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, in urging the
Government to exert all the pressure that they can on other richer
countries, particularly in the EU, to ensure that they contribute more
to this endeavour.</hs_para>

case of enlightened self-interest, this is it. Healthier, wealthier
populations can feed themselves better, relieving the pressure on
global food supplies; they are more stable, relieving the pressure on
migration; and, ultimately, they will be purchasers of the products and
services that richer countries can provide. Tackling the NTDs gives a
big bang for one’s buck. Huge benefits accrue from relatively
modest investment. Not only does it make economic sense, but it
satisfies our obligations to relieve poverty, create opportunity and
achieve fairness and social justice for all in our
world.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/99C09A921C8E449C06A6A3497A34F13F357E03DD" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2014">Thursday,

declare an interest as chair of trustees of Sightsavers, which deals
with two of the major blinding diseases. Trachoma was endemic in London
400 years ago—so it can be eliminated—and I am delighted
that DfID has supported Sightsavers to lead a collaboration of partners
who are mapping trachoma worldwide. This will enable us to understand
exactly what the level of trachoma is in every community and how we can
go about eliminating it. It is a very important programme. DfID has
also been supporting us in tackling trachoma in Nigeria in particular,
with another project with the Government there. I am also delighted
that the Diamond Jubilee Trust has chosen trachoma to be its major
target for the funding that has been raised, with the intention of
eliminating trachoma from five countries in the

other great disease we deal with is onchocerciasis, or river blindness.
This reminds me of the wonderful co-operation there is in the world of
neglected tropical diseases. It is public-private, as we have heard,
and, in the case of onchocerciasis, Merck committed itself
25 years ago to give the drug ivermectin free for as long as
it takes to eliminate the disease around the world. There is
co-operation between countries and co-operation between academic
departments and services, which several noble Lords have highlighted.
It is worth remembering that there are people who have been quietly
working away for 25 to 30 years on those diseases before they had a
high public profile, and it is great to see them now getting some
recognition for that tremendous work over those many
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000058">The
other group worth mentioning is the communities themselves in Africa.
The African Programme for Onchocerciasis Control, which is one of our
partners 
<?notus-xml column=138?>at Sightsavers, has 100,000 community distributors of drugs, one in each
village, who, once a year, deliver the drugs to everyone in the village
in an attempt to eliminate the disease. That is an excellent example of
community self-help, but it also allows them to distribute drugs for
other diseases. A point of co-operation in this field is the way that
we in Sightsavers, while focusing on blindness, also distribute drugs
through that network for lymphatic filariasis and other
things.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000059">Your
Lordships will gather that I am proud of what Sightsavers does, but I
am also proud as a British citizen of what the UK is doing. That seems
to me to be real solidarity between some of the richest people in the

do. As my noble friend Lord Alton said, the reason why it is so urgent
is that, largely, we know what to do. We need money and the priority to

me finish on three final points. The first, as other noble Lords have
said, is that this programme of dealing with neglected tropical
diseases needs to integrate with the wider development push, so that it
is not just dealing with those diseases but linking it in with water
cleanliness and everything
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000061">The
second point, which has not been raised, is that although this is a
fight to eliminate those diseases, many people are disabled by them. On
the wider issue of disability, there are about 1 billion people
disabled in the world, and 80% live in developing countries. They have
not been systematically included in international aid programmes, and
we ask DfID to develop a strategic approach to disability-inclusive
development to sit alongside the valuable work on preventing
disability. I ask the Minister to respond on that point; I would very
happy to receive a letter. I hope that he can, because that is very
important and would be another example of the UK’s leading the
way internationally on development by having disability-inclusive

Although neglected tropical diseases are the most common infections

necessary for counteracting the seven most common NTDs. Fifty US cents
per person per year can treat and protect against NTDs, as the noble

Bates (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to have the
opportunity to respond to this debate, which has been fascinating, and
led so movingly and passionately by the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman,
who comes to this area with great expertise as a trustee in the Sabin
Vaccine Institute and the Global Network for Neglected Tropical
Diseases. Putting this on the map annually is a way of ensuring that it
keeps the heels of Her Majesty’s Government and others to the
fire. It ensures that progress continues to be
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000069">The
noble Baroness welcomed me to her world, which is a fascinating one.
She outlined some of the creatures that inhabited it. I was going to
make a quick aside about being no stranger to this world because it
sounded rather familiar as a member of the Government Whips Office, but
it would be inappropriate to do so. I am pleased to answer the question
because every year neglected tropical diseases adversely affect the
lives of more than a billion people, causing disability, disfigurement,
stigma and an estimated half a million deaths, mainly in the poorest
countries. By helping countries to tackle them we alleviate unnecessary
suffering and help to reduce poverty. That point was made by
many noble Lords, including the noble Lords, 
<?notus-xml column=140?>Lord Collins and Lord Alton, who quoted the former President
of Ghana, John Kufuor, in talking about the silver bullet and the bang
for the buck, which I think the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, mentioned, in
terms of public health and its effect on alleviating
poverty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000070">The
noble Lord, Lord Collins, asked me to update your Lordships on progress
made since the London declaration. Since that meeting the UK has
launched a trachoma programme that completes the mapping of the
disease. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, referred to that in his
association with Sightsavers. It is an incredible programme that will
be immensely beneficial as part of the general research effort. We are
delighted to be part of it. New programmes will be developed to tackle
NTDs in an integrated fashion in Nigeria and South Sudan. I will come
back to the point about South Sudan, which the noble Baroness, Lady
Hayman, referred to, later in my remarks. We have helped World Health
Organisation to strengthen its NTD capacity, and approved a programme
to help deal with kala azar in south Asia and east Africa, which I am
sure that my noble friend Lord Sheikh will be pleased to note given the
personal experiences that he brought to the debate.</hs_para>

support for the Carter Center’s Guinea worm eradication
programme, and I am grateful to my noble friend Lord Chidgey for
raising that example. As someone who was clearly coming to this from a
non-expert position, to be frank, it was heartening to hear that a
disease that in 1986 had 3.5 million people suffering with Guinea worm
in 20 countries could be reduced to 154 in four countries, through
concerted effort and focus and investment in research. Within a
lifetime, that is a remarkable case study. He was also absolutely right
to remind us that we cannot be complacent, because of the example of
TB, which he
highlighted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000072">The
noble Lord, Lord Stone, spoke about support on river blindness and
bilharzia. We have extended our support for that, including the
elephantiasis programme. We have invested in more research on how best
to deliver the NTD programme in a cost-effective and sustainable way.
The point about research, raised effectively by the noble Baroness,
Lady Warwick, was important. I will come back to that if I can, because
research is at the heart of this. It was heartening to have so many
contributions, including those from the noble Lords, Lord Patel, Lord
Alton and Lord Crisp, referring to the excellence in research. Those
were the words of the noble Baroness, Lady Warwick: the UK is a hub of
research excellence. The noble Lord, Lord Stone, spoke about exciting
initiatives with Imperial College combining with the London School of
Hygiene and Tropical Medicine to provide further research in that area.
I would be delighted to arrange a meeting with the appropriate
Ministers and officials in the Department for International Development
to see how we can support that work going
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000073">There
are also product development partnerships, including the Foundation for
Innovative New Diagnostics and the Drugs for Neglected Diseases
initiative—FIND and DNDi—which we are supporting. We also

results lies a collaborative network. We continue to work closely with
donor colleagues, particularly the US Agency for International
Development, the World Bank, the World Health Organisation and, of
course, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, to improve the way in
which we tackle these diseases. National Governments are key partners
too, particularly in the delivery of mass drug administration through
schools and communities. An important point was made on that by, I
think, the noble Lord, Lord Crisp, about this being about not just
national Governments—that because these are diseases of the
rural poor we should have people down at a village level engaged in
tackling
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000075">Several
of your Lordships mentioned the need for better integration between
different NTD initiatives, as well as closer working with other disease
programmes and with sectors such as water and sanitation, which are all
part of the same issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, mentioned
that, and the noble Lords, Lord Alton and Lord Crisp, and of course the
noble Lord, Lord Collins, all referred to the vital way at which we
should get better at integrating how we tackle these
diseases—not just with medicines, but with water, sanitation and
research. These challenges would be much tougher without the major
contribution that the pharmaceutical industry makes through sustained
and highly effective drug donation programmes. Combining their
donations and our support to improve delivery is at the heart of the
public and private sector. Several noble Lords referred specifically to
the work of Merck in that capacity, and the great generosity that it
has shown.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000076">The
noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, asked for an update on the closure of
AstraZeneca, and the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, also referred to that.
It has announced that it is closing a major factory in India that was
producing NTD medicines. Her Majesty’s Government believe that
the pharmaceutical industry has an important contribution to make in
enhancing access for the poor to essential medicines. The AstraZeneca
decision appears to be part of a wider restructuring programme. Other
pharmaceutical companies remain active in this precise area, including
Merck, Johnson &amp; Johnson and GlaxoSmithKline, and they donate free
drugs to certain neglected diseases. The French drug maker Sanofi is
also working on a vaccine for dengue fever. That is part of the update
there.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020664000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000077">The
noble Lord, Lord Crisp, asked me to consider what DfID could be doing
for those living with disabilities. More than 1 billion people, 15% of
the global population, live with disability. Many of the programmes
tackling NTDs prevent disability, so as well as prevention DfID is also
pressing for disability to be included in the post-2015 framework under
the principle, outlined in the high-level panel report, of “no
one left behind”. That is a very important principle that I hope
offers some reassurance to the noble Lord, who rightly raises those
concerns.</hs_para>

increased our commitment in terms of donations. Several noble Lords
referred to the amount of funding that goes into this area and the
funding gap that is still there. We acknowledge that, but it is worth
putting on record that if you look back to 2008 you see that the
average budget going into NTDs from the UK Government for research,
medicines and so on was about £1 million. As a result of
the London declaration conference that went up to
£10 million per annum, and now it stands on average
at about £40 million per annum.</hs_para>

Patel and Lord Alton, spoke about how it was important to encourage
other countries to step up to the plate and make their contributions in
this area. Her Majesty’s Government are continuing to do that.
It is also the place of international organisations to do that much
more effectively, such as the World Health Organisation.</hs_para>

millennium development goals. This of course brings us right back, as
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman commented, not to repeating the same
Motion before your Lordships’ House as last year but, this year,
emphasising the importance of the millennium development goals. The
high-level panel, which was co-chaired by my right honourable friend
the Prime Minister, included in its recommendations that NTDs should
not just be listed as “other diseases” under MDG 6, as
they are in the present MDGs, but actually ought to be specified and
listed—at least seven of them, and perhaps 10. That was the
recommendation that it made, which her Majesty’s Government
absolutely support. That programme is now under review. There are some
30 groups that the UN Secretary-General has established to take forward
the recommendations by the high-level panel, and they will be put
before the General Assembly when it meets in September. The period of
time between now and September to re-emphasise the importance of having
those diseases specified is therefore very important.</hs_para>

Jay of Paddington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to have
this opportunity to debate the Constitution Committee’s report
on the pre-emption of Parliament. As your Lordships are aware, I had
the privilege of chairing the committee, and the report follows a short
inquiry which we undertook last year. As always, I am grateful to the

first sight, it may appear somewhat arcane as a subject even for the
Constitution Committee but in fact parliamentary pre-emption concerns
the central constitutional principle that, in the United Kingdom,
Parliament makes the laws and Governments implement them. To put it
simply, Ministers may propose changes to matters of policy which
involve changes to organisations or institutions—or, indeed, to
have full-scale reform and introduce new structures—but they can
do so only once Parliament has passed the necessary legislation. That
principle is obviously especially important when the proposed policy
requires the expenditure of large amounts of public
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000085">As your
Lordships will be aware, however, Governments sometimes jump the
gun—changes are begun and money is spent before the relevant
Bill has passed through all the stages of Parliament. The argument for
doing that is usually that it improves public administration and cost
effectiveness, but we have called that practice the pre-emption of
Parliament.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000086">I
am particularly glad that my noble friend Lord Beecham is speaking for
the Opposition today, as he has been one of several Members of the
House to draw the Constitution Committee’s attention to this
matter. He was particularly concerned about the passage of the Public
Bodies Act 2011. At that time, many organisations—notably, the
Youth Justice Board—were initially told that they would be
abolished. After the passage of the Bill, and particularly amendments
made in this House, they were reprieved—but not, of course,
before there had been considerable disruption and anxiety within the
organisation. A similar issue—sadly, with a different
result—arose during the House of Lords proceedings on the Health
and Social Care Act 2012. The noble Lord, Lord Owen, who regrets that
he is unable to be here today, sought to challenge the Government for
beginning widespread reorganisation of the NHS, which affected many
services, before the Bill had passed, but in that instance was told
that it was too late to stop the
changes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000087">The
Constitution Committee decided that there were sufficient recent
examples to provide the basis for a focused inquiry to enable us to
take evidence on the origins of and authority for pre-emption and how
it is understood in government. It was a surprisingly fascinating
exercise. We uncovered historical precedents and significant
conventions which had been hidden in layers of obscurity. We discovered
government action often depending on agreements drawn up more than 80
years ago, or on historical advice from individual lawyers which had
become enshrined as Whitehall
“doctrine”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000088">I
must emphasise that we did not find evidence of deliberate
constitutional malpractice or a widespread determination to bypass
parliamentary process. Rather,

central aspect to our inquiry was the role played by the Treasury in

Assent<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:05:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The
foundation of this authority is concordat drawn up as long ago as 1932
between the Treasury and the House of Commons Public Accounts
Committee, which states that the authority for government expenditure
should normally derive from a specific Act of Parliament rather than

words, in the interests of constitutional propriety Parliament must
specifically approve expenditure, indicating that it should not
normally be incurred before Parliament has approved the expenditure

Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000091">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:06:12"></hs_TimeCode>
problems that can arise are well illustrated by the matter that I have
already mentioned—the passage of the Health and Social Care Act,
when the noble Lord, Lord Owen, among others, raised the question of
pre-emptive expenditure and was told that the scale of the expenditure
undertaken on NHS reorganisation before the Bill had passed made it
practically impossible for the Bill to be abandoned. This effectively
meant that Parliament was being told that it could not refuse to pass
the legislation. The practical consequences for the NHS, we were told,
would have been overwhelming, so the constitutional principle was
apparently
abandoned<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:06:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000092">The
Treasury publishes guidance for the Ministers and their departments on
pre-emptive public expenditure; this is called <I>Managing Public
Money</I>. The guidance states that to incur such expenditure there
must be a genuine, urgent need for it and it must be in the public
interests. The relevant Bill must have passed Second Reading in the
House of Commons and the planned legislation must be certain to become
law in the near future. In evidence to us, Mrs Paula Diggle, Treasury
officer of accounts and a very senior official, said that the
requirements were interpreted by the Treasury as encapsulating
parliamentary control over pre-emptive expenditure. She said that the
Treasury was the “guardian of Parliament” and ensured
that departments did not spend money before appropriate approval had
been given. In its written evidence, the Treasury described this as an
“ancient convention”. However, the committee concluded
that, while the Treasury’s role is important within government,
Parliament’s interests over pre-emptive expenditure should
primarily be guarded by Parliament itself. Given this, we did not think
that it was appropriate to describe the Treasury’s role as a
convention in the constitutional
sense<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:07:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000093">We
felt that the same was true for the general understandings about public
expenditure being legitimate after a Commons Second Reading had been
passed. We found no evidence that Parliament has ever endorsed 
<?notus-xml column=145?>this practice and, therefore, we felt that it should not be called a
constitutional
convention<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:07:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000094">More<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:08:30"></hs_TimeCode>
significantly, we concluded that there is really no basis for assuming
that pre-emptive spending can be justified after Second Reading in the
Commons. Of course, a successful Second Reading in another place is
usually an indicator that a Bill will become law. However, as your
Lordships will be aware, particularly from some recent experiences, a
Bill may well still be defeated or significantly amended at a later
stage. The Second Reading practice is obviously complicated when a Bill
starts in the Lords. We therefore decided that the Second
Reading really carries no independent constitutional

our final section, on the political oversight and authority for

we recommend that a consistent method of explanation and information
should be developed, perhaps by way of an Oral Statement during a
Bill’s passage or through statements in documents accompanying a
Bill. We further recommend that the Government should at the end of
each Session produce a Written Statement summarising the pre-emptive
activity undertaken across all departments and including the amount
spent and the powers under which the Ministers acted. I am grateful

Norton of Louth (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Jay of Paddington, on initiating this debate and the
Constitution Committee on producing this timely and important report.
In the time available, I wish to make two points. The first is one of
clarification. 
<?notus-xml column=146?>For me, the key quotation in the report is that of Sir
Stephen Sedley at paragraph 68, as
distinguishing,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14020664000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000258">“between

is a clear distinction, but it is one somewhat masked by the title of
the report. The report states in paragraph
2:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="14020664000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000248">“During
this inquiry we have described Government action in anticipation of
Parliament passing a bill as the ‘pre-emption of
Parliament’”.</hs_quote>

“pre-emption” constitutes the second of Sir
Stephen Sedley’s categories. It does not encompass both. There
is a difference between anticipatory action and pre-emptive action. The
first, in some circumstances, may be acceptable. The second is
not.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14020664000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000101">There
are no grounds for pre-empting Parliament’s capacity to enact
primary legislation. If there is some urgency, it is in the gift of
Government to seek all-party agreement to a Bill being passed in the
course of 24 or 48 hours. There are various instances where that has
occurred. Any claim for pre-emption in the event of a national
emergency has in large measure been eliminated by the Civil
Contingencies
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000102">My second
point is on the other aspect, that of anticipatory action. The
committee recognises that waiting for a Bill to pass may impose such
strict restraint on the Executive as to be inefficient or expensive.
This, it says, is widely recognised. The report proceeds on the basis
of the acceptance that there is a case for such anticipatory action. It
does not seek to challenge it; it is more concerned with the mechanisms
by which it is reported and
scrutinised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000103">I
fear that I am going to take a more sceptical view. We really need to
test the case rather than take it as given. I do not challenge the
claim that preparatory work may need to be undertaken by the Government
before a law comes into effect. However, we already have a mechanism
for that, one that ensures parliamentary approval before action is
taken. I refer to commencement orders. Through their use, one does not
have to anticipate parliamentary approval. Parliament has already
considered the measure and the Minister is acting on the basis of
statutory authority in deciding when to bring the provisions into
effect. I initiated a debate in November last year on such orders and,
in replying to the debate, my noble friend Lord Gardiner of Kimble
confirmed that the Government had no plans to change the use of
commencement
orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000104">Given
the use of such orders, then, what therefore is the case for
anticipatory action by Government? The report cites two activities that
could qualify but I am not persuaded by either example. Hiring a
project team is something that should await enactment and is the sort
of thing that can be undertaken before a provision is commenced. One
could sound out the potential members in advance, but that is a
different matter, entailing no commitment and no expense. As for
scoping inquiries, I am not clear why they would be undertaken after a
Bill has been introduced. I would be rather worried if a measure had
been drafted before a scoping inquiry was
undertaken.</hs_para>

Minister to explain the case for anticipatory action in the context of
my point about commencement orders. It is not sufficient to say that
there is a case for taking anticipatory action if that action can be
taken following Parliament’s approval of the measure and before
the relevant provision is commenced. We need to be far more rigorous in
making sure that anticipatory action is undertaken only in truly
exceptional circumstances—I look forward to hearing what they
are—and that the Government, in reporting these to the House,
explain why the action cannot be taken after Royal Assent but can be
before the relevant provision is commenced. That at the very least will
impose a useful discipline and, I trust, a
deterrent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000106">I

Andrews (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I too congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Jay, on securing the debate and the committee on its
choice of subject, for many of the reasons raised by the noble Lord,
Lord Norton. The report reveals government practices that are indeed
obscure. They may be occasional, but if one can determine a pattern
then that is very helpful to the House. They are governed by an obscure
and complex set of protocols, and when they are described as a
convention that sets alarm bells ringing in this House. I found the

certainly arcane.</hs_para>

take that point. Many years ago I was a clerk in the House of Commons,

control, with the distinguished exception of the recent Select

lot of time trying to get to the bottom of the Ram doctrine and dealing
with the Treasury assumption of guardianship of Parliament, which is a
very counterintuitive concept. The question of how far the Government
can go, or how much it can it get away with—I take the noble
Baroness’s point that there is nothing very deliberate or malign
about this, but there is certainly a behaviour—was asked and
answered in many different ways in this report.</hs_para>

concern, however, was rather specific. Having been assiduous and read
the written evidence, I came across the Treasury’s own written
memorandum and—in the Treasury’s own words—the
demanding conditions to justify pre-emption that must be met in every

the Health and Social Care Act ever passed those tests at all. The

were notorious because of the lack of consultation. If I may make a
personal reference, English Heritage was not threatened with
dismantling before Second Reading but we were on death row with all the
others, with a deeply uncertain future ahead of us. The first that the
public bodies attached to the DCMS knew about the Bill—and there
are many, because it is essentially a devolved department—was
when we were summoned by the Secretary of State and told about it, and
the bare bones were set out. I asked immediately whether there would be
consultation, to which the Secretary of State, who was Jeremy Hunt at
the time, said, “No”. I said, “Well, how are we
going to know?” and he said, “You will be listed in a
schedule to the Bill”. That was the extent of
consultation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:19:55"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:24:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000113">Likewise,
much of the burden of the argument against the NHS Bill was that it
controverted a manifesto commitment not to introduce major
change—therefore, by definition, there could have been no
consultation. The evidence of the Youth Justice Board underlined this
point. It said that if consultation had taken place before a decision
was finally made, it was just possible that the Government might have
changed their mind, so heavy was the burden of contradiction in the
evidence. The noble Lord, Lord Beecham, made the same point in his

cannot see how that is fulfilled by the Public Bodies Act in relation
to the RDAs, for example—and again I cite the noble Lord, Lord
Beecham. The Treasury answered that by saying that the public bodies
legislation contained wider flexibilities, but it was not so wide that
it would have been justified in demolishing without 
<?notus-xml column=149?>replacement the fundamental character of those bodies. Neither was it
true of the NHS Act—and my noble friend has made that point. The
argument constantly used against the Opposition was that we were
actually making it worse by pursuing opposition that would only add to
the chaos of what was already happening on the ground in the NHS. There
is a huge leap of logic here, because the argument in the Treasury
response was that it enabled the Department of Health to put in place
the transition programme, but that programme was necessary only because
the Government had sprung a major reform on the NHS that went far

Maclennan of Rogart (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to
congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, and the committee on
producing what I believe to be a notable constitutional report. The
response of the Government seems to have recognised its significance
although, as the noble Baroness, Lady Jay, said, it was somewhat terse.
What is required is a clear statement from the Government not just
about pre-emptive public expenditure but about pre-emptive action that
bypasses Parliament. They have indicated that they will set out their
pre-emptive public expenditure rules in their text, <I>Managing Public
Money</I><I>,</I> and refer to it in the <I>Cabinet Manual</I>, but
that does not go quite far enough. The Public Bodies Act has been

is exceedingly important that Parliament and the Executive are open

pre-emptive action, make that need explicit and clear and seek to
justify it. There is a good deal of uncertainty in the law about the

is fair to argue that if we had to have the Executive enabled by

ancient conventions that go back no further than the 19th century ought

Chancellors, would have insisted on proper record-keeping. It is highly
likely that the Treasury’s self-appointed role as the guardian
of “Parliament interest in Whitehall” stems from
Gladstone’s years as Chancellor in the 1850s and the
1860s—years when, in his own words, he gloried in the name of
skinflint, saving the nation’s candle ends. By establishing the
Treasury’s firm control over Westminster’s costs at this
time he brought down public spending in this country as a proportion of
GNP from 10% to 6.4%. The people’s William did not believe in

simply wish to add a few words on chapter 3 concerning the legal basis
of pre-emption in the context of the Crown’s common-law powers,
which have been summarised as the power to do things that are ancillary
or incidental to the ordinary business of central government. As we
shall see, some have argued that the powers go wider than that. The
statement of the ministerial powers that has been most frequently
relied on by the Government is to be found in a memorandum drafted by
Sir Granville Ram—of whom we have already heard from the noble
Lord, Lord Lexden—who was then the First Parliamentary Counsel
in 1945. However, it was not published until 2003, following a series
of Questions by the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill.</hs_para>

professional life has often been pre-empted by the Granville Rams of
this world, and the memorandum states that a Minister of the Crown is
unlike a statutory 
<?notus-xml column=152?>body, which is a creature of statute and has no powers, except those
conferred on it. In contrast, a Minister is not a creature of statute
and may, as an agent of the Crown, exercise any powers which the Crown
can exercise except those precluded by statute. The memorandum, of
course, is an opinion prepared by counsel for his client—in this
case, the Government. As such it has no force in law. Furthermore, the
majority of our witnesses agreed that, whatever may have been the
position in 1945, the memorandum is not an accurate reflection of the
common-law powers today. Today, in addition to statutory restraints,
Ministers’ ability to exercise common-law powers is constrained
by public law, by limitations on government action enforced by judicial
review, by human rights law, by the pre-existing rights and significant
interests of private persons, and by rules on financial propriety set
out in the 1932 concordat and the Treasury guide <I>Managing Public

troubling to the committee was the statement by the Treasury that there

most worrying and immediate example of pre-emption is currently in

public safety and the lives of those for whom it is
responsible—namely, the probation service. The Government are
bent on privatising 70% of the work of this service without properly
piloting how the new system would work. There is huge concern about the
risk to the public of outfits like G4S, Serco and other organisations
that purport to be able to deliver almost any public service without
prior experience. This is particularly acute as offenders move between
risk categories. A binary system for probation is clearly
unsatisfactory. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and I collaborated in
moving amendments to the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, which began its
life in this House, without which the matter would never even have been
discussed. The amendment requiring any major reorganisation to be
approved by Parliament was passed by this House but overturned in the
House of Commons. It will no doubt return to us shortly.</hs_para>

Government, it emerged from the documents, deliberately avoided
including their proposals in the Bill precisely because of the
opposition that they knew would be engendered. They simply ignored the
concerns and pressed on with this massive reorganisation—or
should I say fragmentation?—of a service with a demonstrable
record of achievement, recognised by a national award. They continue to
do so now, even though their timetable has slipped beyond the
recklessly adopted target date of, appropriately enough, 1 April, and
they do so under the cover of a misrepresentation of which the Lord
Chancellor should be ashamed. He makes much of the reoffending rate of
prisoners released after serving short sentences as if this were
something for which the probation service were responsible whereas, as
he must know, the service has no responsibility for those offenders.
This is the latest and most egregious example of a Government
overreaching themselves and treating Parliament with contempt. If the

Commercial Secretary to the Treasury (Lord Deighton)
(Con):</Member></B> I thank all noble Lords for their contributions
today and in particular the members of the Select Committee on the
Constitution for their extremely thorough report and the airing that it
has brought to these very important issues. I have found the discussion
that we have just had extremely interesting. I learnt a lot. I am not a
lawyer; I had never heard of the Ram doctrine or Sir Greville Ram
before I was briefed for this opportunity to take the short straw and
respond on behalf of the Government. I am a lot smarter now than I was
45 minutes ago.</hs_para>

may not be able to respond to all the individual issues that have been
raised but I will try to cover the key aspects of the
Government’s response, answer some of the broad concerns raised
today and lay out the steps that the Government are taking to address
them. I start by stressing that the pre-emption of parliamentary assent
is an area that the Government take seriously, and Her Majesty’s
Treasury polices it strongly. We were pleased to note, and I thank the
noble Baroness, Lady Jay, for pointing this out, that the inquiry
revealed no widespread use of pre-emption that went against
constitutional principles. As the report says, the Treasury does not
allow expenditure on new policies until after Second Reading in another
place, and then only in very limited circumstances, including there
being an urgent public interest to do so. The Treasury has strict
criteria to determine whether an area of proposed expenditure is urgent
and in the public interest. Although value for money is important,
regularity, propriety and Parliament’s wishes are key and fully
respected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000144">Many
noble Lords will have seen the written government response. The noble
Baroness, Lady Jay, is right that it is terse, but it is positive. I
will be a little more expansive, but my experience of watching
Ministers being too expansive gives me some warning. Several of the
recommendations in the report that have been mentioned have already
been taken on board, and I shall run through a few to illustrate this
because it is important to look at the changes that we have made. For
me, the most critical thing about what the committee’s findings
bring to light is the importance of transparency and codification.
Those two go together because the codification is part of what allows
for the transparency, and of course it is the transparency—the
noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, referred to the dialogue—that allows
us all to determine whether the judgments being made are appropriate,
given all the circumstances. So although our response is terse, it
accepts the need for that codification and transparency, and everything
else follows from
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000145">To list
some of the things that we have done, we accept that Ministers should
always make clear when pre-emption is intended—where possible,
orally at Second Reading but, failing that, in a Written Ministerial
Statement; Written Ministerial Statements are always 
<?notus-xml column=156?>made before a contingency fund advance is permitted, which, as noble
Lords know, is how pre-emption is funded; and the Government will
publish an annual summary at the end of the parliamentary Session of
when pre-emption has taken place during the period. I can tell the
Committee that in the current parliamentary Session there have been
three instances where spend was permitted in advance of Royal Assent.
Two of those were in advance of the Energy Act that received Royal
Asset on 18 December 2013, and one advance relates to the Pension Bill,
where Royal Assent is planned for April 2014.</hs_para>

departments on the pre-emption of Parliament—or “new
services”, in the Treasury’s parlance—is a
publication that has been referred to, called <I>Managing Public
Money</I>. I can say from my own 14-month experience in the Treasury
that there is no duty or activity that is taken more seriously than the
control that the Treasury imposes on individual departments. That is a
very strongly exercised function. That publication, as has been
referred to, was updated in July 2013 in line with the recommendations
in the report. We removed the references to the Second Reading
conventions—we have stopped calling things conventions that, as
noble Lords have pointed out, actually are not—and, to the
relief of many noble Lords here, we have also taken out any reference
to the Ram doctrine.</hs_para>

Manual</I> also uses these terms but again, consistent with the
report’s recommendations, the Cabinet Office will take those
views on board when it next reviews the guidance. The Treasury is also
going to issue an update to the detailed annexe on new services in the
near future to be clearer about the very limited scope for pre-empting
Parliament.</hs_para>

recommendation that the Government are not intending to act on is the
proposal that there should be a Written Ministerial Statement at the
end of each parliamentary Session listing all ministerial directions
made across Government. That is because this information is already
published in all departments’ annual accounts and further
publication is not considered necessary. However, by way of
information, there have been no ministerial directions during the life
of the current Government. The Government appreciate that the
accounting officer of a department could potentially seek a direction
from the Minister if pushed to pre-empt Parliament. However, this is
really a signal that further discussion is needed to find a practical
and appropriate way through. As noble Lords will be aware, directions
are always a last resort.</hs_para>

further into the detail of some of the issues that noble Lords referred
to. The noble Baronesses, Lady Jay and Lady Andrews, referred to the
disquiet caused in the cases of both the Health and Social Care Act and
the Public Bodies Act. I did my research on these because I understood
that that was what had prompted the committee to have a look at this
issue. The essence of the Government’s position was that they
already had the powers to effect the changes that were put in place.
That is why there was no need to call on the contingency fund. The
Government were essentially relying on their existing powers to cause
those reorganisations.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=157?><hs_para UID="14020664000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000150">In the case of the
Health and Social Care Act, the Secretary of State for Health has broad
duties and wide powers under existing legislation, including the
National Health Service Act 2006, which confers a duty to promote a
comprehensive health service and allows public expenditure to do so.
That enabled the Department of Health to put in place the transition
programme, which included setting up clinical commissioning groups,
closing down primary care trusts and so on. The savings that the
programme is designed to deliver would have been wanted irrespective of
the organisation of the NHS to meet the requirements of the spending
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000151">In the
case of the Public Bodies Act, to which a number of noble Lords
referred—clearly this was a controversial subject at the time,
so I understand their reaction—each of the bodies involved had a
bespoke set of duties and responsibilities appropriate to its
functions. The powers that they already had left considerable
discretion about exactly how the functions should be discharged, which
allowed for some reorganisation ahead of Royal Assent. That was the
basis on which those actions took
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000152">The
noble Lord, Lord Norton, talked about commencement orders. This is not
my particular area of expertise but, as I understand it, it is a timing
question, because commencement orders cannot be put until Royal Assent
has been given, so it does not help with anticipation.</hs_para>

may be worth my running through the criteria that the Treasury applies
to determine whether an action is urgent and in the public interest.
The reason why the test would be met is that otherwise there would be
an increase in implementation costs, efficiency savings would be lost
or it would be detrimental to the public. Ministerial or policy
imperative is not a relevant criterion in securing a contingencies fund
advance.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020664000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000154">A
lot of the discussion was around pre-emptive action rather than
pre-emptive expenditure. I agree that this is a difficult issue, which
is why transparency and scrutiny are so important. In the vast majority
of cases, though, pre-emptive actions will require a financial element,
which is why <I>Managing Public Money</I> and the Treasury’s
watchdog approach are a substantial defence, although I agree that that
cannot work in absolutely every
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000155">The
noble Lord, Lord Hart, was far more eloquent about the Ram doctrine
than I could possibly be. I can tell the Committee that we have removed
reference to it. The Treasury and the Government absolutely accept that
the actions of a Minister are constrained by public law, human rights
law and so on, as the noble Lord pointed out. It is the balance that
really counts.</hs_para>

Government take controlling the pre-emption of Parliament extremely
seriously. We are grateful that noble Lords have shown such an interest
in this area and shed such light on it. I think that the changes that
will result will make us a better Government. We have looked again at
our guidance and modified it, and we are satisfied that we are
operating a robust system.</hs_para>

mobility is damaging to individuals and leaves countries’

golden age of social mobility is often said to have been between the
post-war years and the 1970s. I am sure that many of us here today are
the product of parents and ancestors who demonstrated character and
resilience in their lives. My mother was adopted into a family where
the sons, much older than my mother, who had survived the First World
War returned 
<?notus-xml column=161?>to what seemed a very bleak future. They organised a barrow and started
a business selling groceries on the streets of Bradford. The business
developed and my grandmother became the owner, with her sons, of a
successful grocery and delicatessen business, no longer working from a
wheelbarrow. The family recognised the value of education, which in
those days was not freely available, and paid for my mother to attend a
good school. Their success was down to drive and
resilience<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:12:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

father when he was very young. There was no widow’s pension in
those days to support his mother and his partially sighted brother. My
father was bright and was offered a place at the grammar school.
However, his mother, who worked as a housekeeper to provide a home for
her family, could not afford to pay the fees so my father could not
accept the place. He had to leave school at 14 and work long hours,
studying for a degree at night. He became an apprentice to Mr Rolls of
Rolls-Royce fame and developed a successful career as a professional

many who fight against the odds today and succeed in spite of all that
life throws at them. I fully approve of the care that the welfare state
provides today in all its forms, but I sometimes wonder how much
resilience we have lost along the way. Governments have a role in
ensuring that barriers to mobility are removed and that equality is
truly achievable. The key determinant is, however, the attitude of the
individual—the fire in the belly. The desire to succeed comes
from within and is not something that government and state can
create.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020664000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000294"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>4.14

McNally (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord McFall. I shall take up two points that he made
that are important to the character of this debate. He talked about the
inequalities that have grown over the past few decades. It is important
that we see that this has been under the stewardship of both
parties—indeed, all three parties. He also made the point that
not all public money has been well spent. That also colours the

probably belong to what I would describe as the guilty generation. My
father never earned more than £1,000 a year in the whole of his
working life. I was born on an ICI estate, but I went to grammar school
on a Lancashire county scholarship and to university on a similar
scholarship with a grant. I was never quite aware of how universities
were funded in those days, but it certainly meant that my social
mobility was on the back of a very generous
state<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:15:34"></hs_TimeCode>. In those
days, of course, the early 1960s, I represented only 6% of my
generation. I have never accepted that more means worse as far as
university education is concerned, and have welcomed the expansion over
recent

real advantages that I had, I see that I had aspirational parents; I
had a home with books; I had a secure family background; and I lived in
a stable community—not a particularly wealthy community, but one
with values. I want to share two things that stick in my mind from my
experience over the past few years as a Minister. One was a visit to a 
<?notus-xml column=162?>school in Leicester. I was walking around and talking to the deputy
headmaster. I asked him, “Any problems here?” and he
said, “Yes, that big estate over there is mainly white working
class. In that estate now, we have the third generation of welfare
dependency”. The other was a visit to a young offender
institute. I was walking around with one of the people in charge, and
we crossed a yard and saw about a dozen young, mainly black, youths, He
just nodded across and said, “Most of those can’t read or
write. Their contact with our educational system has been but passing
for the whole of their lives”.</hs_para>

encapsulate the problem for people of my generation and that of the
noble Lord, Lord McFall. I came into politics with certainties. We were
going to implement the Beveridge report, provide a welfare state that
would deal with poverty and we would have comprehensive education that
would be not bog-standard but a gateway for social
mobility<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:17:54"></hs_TimeCode>. We
need to accept that some of the aspirations of the 1950s, 1960s and
1970s have not come about. As was said by the noble Lord, Lord McFall,
we have found mounting inequalities over the past three decades. What
is more, we have found them being embedded in our society. I received a
very good brief from Oxfam. It quotes Sir Peter Lampl of the Sutton
Trust, who said recently:</hs_para>

opportunities”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14020664000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000244">I
do not think that there is some magic solution to this. Perhaps we will
get a fourth way or a fifth way later—I do not know. Michael
Gove and Iain Duncan Smith may not be everybody’s cup of tea
politically but there is no doubt that, in trying to deal with welfare
dependency and educational failure, they are addressing the right
problems. In that respect, there needs to be a certain humility across
the political divide in meeting those

social mobility and no equality in terms of finance, environment or
opportunity. There are two ways of doing this. One is a needs-based
approach—what are the needs and what resources can 
<?notus-xml column=163?>you put in to try to improve things?—and there is what they call
an asset-based approach, which means asking what these people have in

want to name a couple of presuppositions that we have to be careful of
in this debate. We live in a world where everyone wants the social
mobility graph to go up. There is a celebrity culture and everyone
wants to be up there. Of course, things can only go up if other things
go down. It is a very complex world. We tend to see equality and social
mobility through a very individual lens. That is where “the

what I think is the missing ingredient here—perhaps the noble
Lord, Lord McNally, hinted at it with his common values—which is
mutuality. This is a debate with anecdotes and stories, and I am going
to tell a very short story to illustrate mutuality. Aristotle says that
we are social animals and the Christian Gospel says that you have to
love your neighbour. We cannot live on our
own—mutuality.</hs_para>

was privileged to rededicate the grave of a man called William Coltman
VC. He received four other awards for bravery in the First World War,
and he is buried in a village called Winshill near Burton-on-Trent. He
went to war as a young man with a wife and young child, and he was a
stretcher-bearer. On the front he won many awards and was in fact the
most highly decorated soldier in the whole of the First World
War—this is someone who did not have an officer rank. There are
amazing stories of him crawling out and rescuing people, Germans as
well as Allied people, saving lives and serving others. He came back to
the little village that he had left, Winshill, as a local hero, but he
resumed his job for the local council. He was a council
gardener—he worked in what we call the parks department, I
suppose—for all his life. There was no social mobility in terms
of his becoming a vice-chancellor, his salary going up or whatever. His
life was about service to others. He was involved in the Christian
church in the place and he ran a Sunday school to form young people in
mutuality. However, his life was fulfilled, exemplary and appropriate.
He did not have to go up the social scale and did not have to earn a
certain amount of money, but he lived a life that was full of
mutuality.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020664000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000188">In
a world where mutuality is disappearing in personal relationships,
which we see through an individual lens, from the workplace, because it
is all about individual rights and benefits, and from politics, because
the pitch that we make is to the selfish interests of each voter to
vote for their own best deal, there is an enormous challenge to all of
us to face up to what has been called “the social,
stupid”. I ask the Minister: what role do the Government have,
along with other agencies, to encourage people to look at this whole
issue of inequality and the lack of social mobility, not just through
the economic and individual lenses of progress and that kind of
thing—going up the chart—but through the kind of common
values that create communities and mutuality, where there is a
different way of handling the downs as well as the ups and you are not
measuring yourself or crucifying yourself against the wrong
criteria?</hs_para>

city renewal project that I am involved in will flourish only through
mutuality. There is not enough money, resources or good jobs to lift
all these people, but there is something in the human spirit that can
deliver. Governments do not control the human spirit but I think that
they can initiate partnerships, set benchmarks and give signals to
challenge “the social, stupid”, which is about measuring
individual achievement, and they can try to bat for
mutuality.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14020664000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000296"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:25:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.25

the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission highlighted in their

aspiration. My noble friend Lord McNally spoke eloquently about
aspiration. For
those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:26:05"></hs_TimeCode> children
whose experience has been limited and who know little of stable family
life, or perhaps of the rewards and demands of working life, schools
have a vital part to play in introducing them to the opportunities of
the world of work. From an early age, children should understand the
connections between school and work, between study and business, and
between applying themselves and earning a living. Even at primary
school, children’s imaginations can be captured by hearing about
jobs and careers that they knew nothing about—and better still
by visits to workplaces and meeting those genuinely enthusiastic about
the work that they do. If this is important for children who enjoy
academic learning, it is even more so for those who struggle with
conventional lessons but who may have practical skills and talents that
are not immediately valued, especially in league tables in a school

chance to shine. I had been a classroom teacher, and I recall visiting
schools that offer prevocational qualifications. The enthusiasm of the
students was contagious as they applied themselves to mending car
engines, caring for babies, planning and cooking meals—the very
young people, as the schools told me, who had been demotivated and
disruptive in academic lessons. They were acquiring not only skills but
confidence and self-respect, which

of us are probably old enough to remember the days when professions had
direct routes from school which were as highly regarded as graduate
entry and led to careers that could be just as successful. For many
young people, learning at work is more in line with their culture and

professions and the end of inequalities between academic and practical

I pay tribute to youth organisations for the part that they play in
social mobility. Organisations such as scouting and girl guiding and
the cadet organisations, and a wide range of voluntary and community
youth groups, provide invaluable services, particularly in more
disadvantaged areas and give young people an opportunity to develop
personal and social skills, take responsibility and gain confidence,
and learn both self-respect and respect for others. With the uniformed
organisations and schemes such as the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award
scheme, young people are faced with challenges; they learn how to
manage risk and develop ways which, whatever their start in life, can
lead to fulfilling and useful
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:29:47"></hs_TimeCode>. We cannot
afford to squander the talents of any of our people, but I would submit

Giddens (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I want to take my noble friend
Lord McFall’s question seriously and ask: what is the
relationship between inequality and social mobility? There are often
problems when a technical concept enters popular and political
discourse, and that has certainly been the case with the notion of
social mobility. There are many misunderstandings about it. If one does
not sort them out, it is almost impossible to make proper
policy.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:30:34"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000199">For
example, the idea has taken hold that there has been a serious decline
in social mobility over the past three or four decades. To quote the
<I>Observer</I>, social mobility “has ground to a halt”.
It was this concern that prompted the Milburn report and a range of
other publications. However, there are two problems 
<?notus-xml column=166?>with this view. First, it seems to be substantially false. It has been
subjected to a powerful critique from John Goldthorpe and his
colleagues at the University of Oxford.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>—I
hope that noble Lords will forgive me for being an academic about this
but it is essential—the current discussion of social mobility
fails to grasp the crucial distinction which sociologists make between
absolute and relative mobility. We cannot understand current patterns
of mobility if we do not grasp that notion. It is an essential
distinction to make.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020664000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000200">Absolute<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:31:41"></hs_TimeCode>
mobility refers to the proportion of people from specific class
backgrounds who move upwards: in other words, the number of people who
move upwards. Relative social mobility is a very different notion. It
is the one that many people equate with social mobility, but that is
wrong. Relative social mobility means the chances of individuals
becoming mobile. In other words, it is a measure of social fluidity. It
refers, if you like, to some individuals succeeding at the expense of
others. It means that if there are high levels of relative upward
mobility, there must be high levels of downward mobility as well. They
are two very different notions and we have to sort them
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000201">The
results of Goldthorpe's work are interesting and instructive for
policy. They show that rates of absolute mobility from one generation
to another across the 20th century in the UK and elsewhere have
actually been quite high and remain high. The reason is simple: there
has been an expansion of white-collar and professional occupations at
the expense of less skilled manual jobs. The main reason for the
apparent fluidity of our society is that structural change has produced
a lot more opportunities at the top. Goldthorpe also shows,
interestingly, that relative mobility has remained static across that
period. In other words, contrary to what one might assume, the UK did
not become a more fluid society over the past 40 or 50
years; there was not more fluidity and movement. Almost all the
movement was upward mobility going into the jobs that were
created<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000202">Of
course, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, described, individual
capacities make a difference as to who gets into those positions.
However, the dominant feature is structural mobility over that period
not, if you like, a more just or equal society.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020664000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000203">Obviously<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:33:52"></hs_TimeCode>,
that does not mean that the plethora of policies contained in the
Milburn report are without value but, as Goldthorpe says, no matter how
gratifying those policies may be, politically their impact is likely to
be quite limited. He is right to say that. In other words, more
advantaged groups are often able to draw on their resources to negate
the policies introduced with the best of intentions for introducing
more relative mobility. That is a serious issue for such policies. For
example, you might introduce a policy to help kids from an inner-city
school to get into a higher level of the system, but middle-class
parents can easily mobilise to negate that because they are not stupid
and they know what is going on,
too<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:34:53"></hs_TimeCode>. So there is
a powerful dialectic in all of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000204">The
conclusion that I draw is similar to Goldthorpe’s conclusion,
which is that we must place the emphasis on equality rather than
mobility. Social mobility in everyday talk these days functions as a
kind of relatively 
<?notus-xml column=167?>seemingly painless equivalent for equality. As the noble Lord, Lord
McFall, stressed, equality comes first because without greater equality
we cannot improve social
mobility<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:35:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
Equality not only trumps mobility, it is the main source of
achievement. I do not see what policies the Government have for
limiting the structural inequalities that were so well defined in the
opening speech of the noble Lord, Lord
McFall<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:35:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/3E219A978DC570A47AB9BEEFB43B473D1D99EEA9" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 6 February 2014">Thursday,

Tyler of Enfield (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I pay tribute to the
noble Lord, Lord McFall, for securing this vital debate. From listening
to today’s debate and to wider debates in the area, it is
sometimes tempting to think that there is a singular causal connection
between these two worrying economic trends—growing income
inequality and slowing social mobility. I suspect that the truth is not
so simple. There is a significant body of research suggesting that
rising inequality and lower social mobility are both symptoms of the
same condition. This condition, as we heard so eloquently from the
noble Lord, Lord Giddens—I do not pretend to have his academic
background—is what is sometimes called the hollowing out of the
labour market. Increasingly the UK labour market is characterised by
very high-skill, high-wage jobs on the one hand and low-skill, low-wage
jobs on the other. This is having a major impact on feelings of
fairness and social cohesion. For the record, yes I think that the
widening gap between the rich and the poor really
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:36:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000206">In
the light of this fact about our labour market, I would like to focus
today on the role that education plays in creating greater equality of
opportunity. This is not because I do not think that certain economic
measures can improve income equality. In fact, I believe that things
such as raising the minimum wage and encouraging employers to pay a
living wage, which is something I support very strongly, could make a
significant difference. I want to focus on education because, as the
noble Lord, Lord McNally, said, it is only through education that we
can truly tackle the pernicious problem of intergenerational social
mobility. As the Save the Children’s briefing for this debate
highlighted, the top performing countries on international educational
comparisons—Hong Kong, Canada, and Japan—all have a
comparatively low correlation between the socioeconomic status of a
child’s parents and his or her performance in school. Therefore,
if we are going to improve our education system to meet the highest
international standards, which we must, we have to meet the challenge
of improving inter-generational mobility head
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000207">Through my
work as the vice-chair of the All-Party Group on Social Mobility, I
have come to the conclusion that any social mobility strategy needs to
have the following primary goal: continuously evaluating and improving
our education system to ensure that all children develop the skills
necessary to succeed in a demanding and changing labour market. This
means investing to improve the quality of education that
underprivileged children receive throughout their lives. Given that
privileged children continue to enjoy disproportionately high access to
a good education it should be no surprise that a person’s
ability to get on 
<?notus-xml column=168?>in today’s jobs market is strongly correlated with the resources
enjoyed by his or her parents. This lack of intergenerational mobility
will continue unless we make a commitment to ensure that all children
have access to a high-quality education. I think that state sector
education should be as good as, if not better than education in the
independent
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:39:09"></hs_TimeCode>.
Importantly, this equality of access refers not only to education
during the school years, but early years education, further education
and higher education. I would say that further education is often
neglected in these
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000208">I
shall refer briefly, as did the noble Lord, Lord McFall, to the 2010
OECD report on income inequality. That report made clear that one of
the best ways for developed nations to improve their overall rate of
social mobility is by lengthening at both ends the portion of a
child’s life that he or she spends learning, regardless of his
or her parents’ income level. Today, access to high-quality
early years education as well as higher education is still
disproportionately enjoyed by those on the higher end of the income
spectrum. This must change if we are to see any improvement in the
overall level of social
mobility<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the time that every person spends in education will ultimately help
more people be more qualified for better jobs. Employers are
increasingly looking for employees with technological literacy,
advanced foreign language skills and other key qualifications for a
career in the 21st century. At the same time, employers are looking for
certain character and resilience traits. They want people who do not
get discouraged when the going gets tough, who can bounce back, who can
work in teams and build meaningful relationships. These soft
skills—or non-cognitive skills—are crucial to social
mobility and should feature far more prominently among our educational
priorities, particularly in the early years. The evidence shows how
important this
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:40:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020664000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020664000210">I

jobs, fair access to higher education, work incentives that encourage
employment and tackling income inequality. There is plenty of evidence

have always been of the opinion that going to work was good for people.
We must have in place measures to make work pay and to deal with low
pay. It is most regrettable that the UK remains at the wrong end of the
international league table on wages, with more than one in five
full-time workers classified as low-paid. Those most at risk of being
low-paid are young, female, low-skilled workers in temporary or
part-time work, often in the hospitality, retail or care sectors. Given
this and the imbalance in the growth of the economy, things can be very

invaluable debate. I was reading the debate that we had under the
leadership of the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, some six months ago, and
I hope that we shall have another one in another six months’
time because there are some really serious issues that we all have to
struggle

noble Lord, Lord McFall, compared the British position to the American
position. I recognise the comparison but I also recognise the
differences. The American Administration are not attempting to push
through a social mobility strategy as we are doing. Indeed, the
inequalities in the United States, in economic and other terms, are
much wider than they are in Britain. At least we have a consensus
across all parties in Britain that we have to tackle what has been a
long-term problem with a long-term response. The noble Lord mentioned
the former Prime Minister John Major as well as Harold Macmillan; this
issue has developed over the past 25 to 30 years and it will take 25 to
30 years to cope with it, against the headwinds of continuing economic
and technological changes, both within Britain and abroad. After all,
it is partly a result of global economic trends, with the collapse of
the old mass-manufacturing industry that supported the skilled working
class in stable working-class communities, with the institutions that
held those communities together, such as the chapel, the trade union
and the Workers’ Educational Association—a co-operative,
heaven
knows<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:48:16"></hs_TimeCode>—which
have also decayed with the decay of the economic structures that held
them all together. I see the right reverend Prelate nodding. I can say
from the point of view of West Yorkshire that the church has survived
more successfully than many of the non-conformist churches in some of
those areas, and I am very grateful for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:48:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

and that is part of the issue that we have. The noble Baroness, Lady
Eaton, talked about her father and her grandmother. My parents-in-law
were the youngest in a working class family and their eldest brothers

school and university. There was in those years very small-scale social

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> Precisely. Britain’s situation
also reflects the historic anomaly, of which I am very conscious as I
have just come from a meeting of the advisory board on the centenary of
World War I and have been reading into early 20th century history, that
we have much more continuity of social structures over the past 150
years than many of our comparators. We still have the structure of
private schools, which supported the Empire. We still have an unelected
House of Lords. We still have a social hierarchy which is remarkably
resistant to change, whereas in Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark,
Belgium and, to some extent, also in France and Italy those old
structures were swept away, which made it easier to have a more mobile
and mutually respecting
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020667000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000002">The
coalition Government’s social mobility agenda is something which
we see as a cross-party, cross-government exercise, and it starts from
the assumption that there has to be a partnership between economy,
society and state—we have to get all those things in balance. I
say to the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, that we shall be working on that
against a number of very difficult global economic trends and against
the challenge of the next round of economic and technological change,
which may well sweep away a very large number of basic white-collar
jobs, thus raising all sorts of issues about moving towards a society
in which there are a number of extremely successful, very well paid
people and, at the other end, a number of poorly paid, poorly skilled
people. Dealing with that will take quite a lot of effort in our
turn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020667000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000003">I should
tell the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, that when I was an undergraduate, my
most inspirational teacher was a graduate student called John
Goldthorpe, so I have a great deal of respect for everything that John
has written and continues to write. However, as the noble Lord knows
well, perfect equality is not achievable; a reduction in the degree of
inequality is. That is, after all, what a liberal society should
attempt to work for. This Government are mounting an attack on tax
avoidance. We face the problem of what I have to call the rootless
rich, who have escaped the boundaries of nation states and thus managed
extremely successfully to avoid tax. We need taxes on wealth, which is
much less mobile than income. At the bottom, we have increased the
threshold at which people start to pay income tax. There is the move
towards universal credit 
<?notus-xml column=172?>and in encouraging more people into work. We are extremely happy that
the level of youth unemployment is now on a downward trend, and we are
doing as much as we can to ensure that that
continues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020667000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000004">International
economic trends help us. The <I>F</I><I>inancial Times</I> had an
interesting article yesterday which suggested that there is now a
downward trend in excessive executive salaries after the excesses of
the past 20 years. We are affected by what is happening elsewhere, and
we have to push very hard to provide for our own deeply interdependent
society as much of a social compact in the global economy as we can. I
worry about the impact on British society and the British economy of
the influx of the super-wealthy from non-democratic states. That ought
to be of concern, particularly to all those who live in London and the
south-east of
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14020667000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000005">We
have now reached the stage where we all realise that the state cannot
deal with a problem like that alone; the state cannot provide
everything and our taxpayers are unwilling to pay for much more of what
is needed. They want the services, but they are deeply resistant to
higher taxation, so we have to talk about the role of independent
social initiatives—what I still like to call the big
society—the role of local communities and local action.
Incidentally, we have to think about planning and building communities
which hang together. Living in Saltaire, which is a very dense village
where it is impossible not to know your neighbours, and having
canvassed when I was the local candidate for Shipley in a number of the
new housing estates where you do not know your neighbours, the husband
has gone out in the only family car and the wife is marooned on her
own, I am very conscious that the way in which we build communities in
Britain also deserves a great deal more attention. We need more local
government and local engagement and, as we have said about other areas,
we need to persuade more of the young to vote and become engaged,
because we know that all our political parties are pooled towards
supporting the old and not putting enough money into the
young.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020667000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000006">On
equality of education, the Government are now extending the pupil
premium. In September 2014 we will extend 15 free hours of high-quality
early education to 40% of two year-olds—not an easy task when at
the same time the number of two year-olds is rising quite sharply. We
inherited Teach First from our predecessor Labour Government and we
have continued to expand it. The Teach First teachers that I have seen
in various schools in West Yorkshire are absolutely first-class. We all
know from what the All-Party Group on Social Mobility has said that
raising the quality of teaching is a very important part of all this.
Intergenerational equity, putting more money into children at the early
stage, is very much part of what we need to do.</hs_para>

McFall, also mentioned the professions. I have to say that the figures
on professions are deeply worrying, and I hope that whichever
Government come in next time will look in particular at the question of
recruitment into the legal profession as the one that sticks out most
strongly as an inherited one.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14020667000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000008">Aspiration, character
and resilience are clearly extremely important; I think that we have
all now gripped that. Providing children with a sense of self-worth
through 
<?notus-xml column=173?>school, careers guidance, music, sports, volunteering and mentoring is
important. I am an extremely strong supporter of the National Citizen
Service; I am about to ask the Cabinet Office whether it will be
willing to provide an introduction to the NCS to any Member of the
House of Lords who would like to see it, because I became
enthusiastic when I had seen one or two courses myself. Through
partnership with business, the Government now have a business compact.
The Deputy Prime Minister has just given Opening Doors
awards to a number of businesses that have been extremely good at
pulling people into work. Apprenticeships are important, and I have to
say that the apprentice that we had in the Government Whips’
Office was a classic example—a young woman who had been a
hairdresser, and had not thought that she could be anything else, who
blossomed in the six months that she was with us. All these
things help to give young people a greater sense that they can do
things. That is a very large agenda.</hs_para>

Prelate the Bishop of Derby said, we have to be careful to get beyond
the idea that it is all about everyone getting to the top. The
importance of the apprenticeship schemes, which I am extremely proud of
this Government expanding, is that they are giving a number of young
people a sense of self-worth in craft skills. That is a revival of an
old mutuality of respect that we clearly need to do. Unfortunately, we
cannot provide the independent business that also used to be part of
the business of respect. I come from four different families and my
great-grandparents were all small shopkeepers, so I am incredibly petty
bourgeois. The mutuality of respect is part of what we all now need to
rebuild.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14020667000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140206-gc0001.htm#14020667000010">We

not release information into the public domain which is relevant to the
case. West Yorkshire Police must be allowed to complete their
investigation into matters at Kings Science Academy – and make
their judgements about referrals to the Crown Prosecution Service
