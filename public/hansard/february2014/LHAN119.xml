is absolutely essential that this modernising constitutional change is

noble friend that it is important that all 16 realms agree. Indeed, the
intention is that when they all have put in place the necessary
legislation there will be a simultaneous order to give effect in each
of the realms. I make it clear that all realms that took the view that
legislation is required have passed the requisite legislation, with the
exception of Australia. As I informed your Lordships’ House at
Third Reading, the Council of Australian Governments agreed that
respective states would legislate first, requesting that the
Commonwealth legislation be brought forward by the Canberra Government.

legislation; and South Australia has yet to introduce legislation

indeed be very costly for them to travel, especially in rural areas.
Local authorities set out annually the arrangements for transport in
their area. Typically, that is for young people to pay an annual

benefits may be withdrawn from those over 18, is it not time to have a
complete review of the way in which assistance with travel to work, to
interviews, to college or to schools is given? There are many people in
the country who are in receipt of benefits—I am thinking of

<?notus-xml column=925?>training and apprenticeships have become much worse? As she said, the
role of the local authority in supporting travel costs in particular is
discretionary. Although some fund significant subsidies, others do very
little. In fact, in the past few weeks alone, Cumbria, North Yorkshire
and Lancashire—all with extensive rural areas—have
announced further cuts in their travel subsidies for young people. Why
can the Government not ensure that all local authorities provide at
least a minimum level of support for travel costs for young people,

about the education maintenance allowance because the way that it is
organised now focuses on the young people who are most at need and
provides them with more generous support than was the case before.
Therefore, a yearly bursary of up to £1,200 is available to
young people from specific vulnerable groups. A number of these young
people—roughly half—do indeed receive travel passes or
tickets. The councils she mentioned still offer special discounts to

her that the

when looking at the review she talked about, could look at what has
happened in north Northumberland. When the Liberal Democrats took over
the council, they instigated free transport for those aged over 16. We
have a very low level of take-up of further and higher education in
this part of the country and I hope she will look at this because it
increased the numbers of students who took up further education. I hope
that, like me, she is rather concerned that now the council is being

comment in particular. We know that GPs are hard pressed. GP
consultation rates have risen by 40% since 1995. We therefore need to
take several steps to address that. One is in the medium to longer
term: we need more GPs, and we have tasked Health Education England to
ensure that at least 50% of medical students move to the GP specialty.
In the immediate term, there are the measures that I mentioned relating
to the GP contract and the £50 million fund, both of which are

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the resources that have been devoted to GP
practice and primary care have gone up by a third in real terms since
2002. A lot of that was due to the revised GP contract.
Unfortunately, that contract also allowed GP practices to
opt out of out-of-hours care which, over time, has meant that patients
have found it more difficult to access their GPs at evenings and
weekends<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:32:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Meacher" PimsId="5123" UID="140226105000759" xid="1963" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000759">Baroness

important issue. I can tell her that the department and Health
Education England have commissioned an in-depth review of the GP
workforce looking towards a more sustainable solution for the longer
term. The final report will be published in the summer. The preliminary
report suggests that increasing the supply of practice nurses and
greater collaboration with specialists may help to improve effective

Wall of New Barnet (Lab):</Member></B> I follow on from the question of
my noble friend Lord Hunt and the Minister’s acknowledgement
that the effectiveness of primary care needs to be improved. I agree
with what the Minister said about the improvement in some GP services,
but still many individuals come to A&amp;E at all times, whether the
surgery is open or otherwise, which makes things very difficult. For
instance, Barnet Hospital received 117 ambulances yesterday, which made
it extremely difficult to deal with people who had walked in, who
probably could have had their treatment somewhere
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000056"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:34:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="140226105000762" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000762">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> The noble Baroness is quite
right<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The NHS
is seeing an extra 1 million patients in A&amp;E compared to three
years ago. Despite the additional workload, it is generally coping very
well although we know that departments are under strain. This is not
just about A&amp;E, as the noble Baroness will be aware, but about how
the NHS works as a whole: how it works with other areas, such as social
care, and how it deals with an ageing population and more people with
long-term conditions. Dealing with all that means looking at the
underlying causes, and that work is going on at the moment in NHS
England.</hs_para>

McColl of Dulwich (Con):</Member></B> Does the Minister
agree<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> that it
was very unfortunate indeed that certain politicians, who shall remain
nameless, said to the general practitioners: “We know what
you’re doing. You should have been working but you were on the
golf course and, from now on, we’re going to pay you only for
what you do”? The general practitioners thought this was a
rather good idea, because it resulted in a substantial pay
rise.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, there is no
doubt<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> that the
general practitioners bit the Government of the day’s hand off,
10 years ago, and they had every reason to do so with the money that
was being offered to them. However, while a feature of that contract
was the quality and outcomes framework, which was a good idea in
itself, it has resulted in a lot of box-ticking for GPs and it is that
element which we have drastically reduced in the contract for next
year. That will be helpful in freeing up GPs’
time.</hs_para>

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I remind the House of my
registered interest as the senior independent director of the Financial
Ombudsman Service. Amendment 23 stands in my name and in the names of
my noble friends Lord Hutton and Lady Drake. In moving Amendment 23, I
shall speak also to the other amendments in this group. These
amendments may look lengthy but their aim is remarkably
precise.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226105000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000071">Amendment 23 is very
simple. It would retain the power of the Secretary of State to put into
place the consolidation of small pots but would remove the part of the
sentence that limits this to the “pot follows member”
form of consolidation. This sounds technical but really it is not; it
is about fairness. As the state is enrolling people into a pension
scheme without their explicit consent, surely it has a very high duty
of care to them to ensure that the money they are putting aside is not
lost through excessive charges or poor investment choices driven by
inadequate governance.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226105000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000072">“Pot follows
member”, or PFM in the jargon, is the Government’s
solution to a problem. I shall comment on the problem, demonstrate why
I believe that the Government’s proposed solution is flawed and
propose an alternative. The Government believe that action is needed to
address the large number of dormant small pension pots that arise under
auto-enrolment when employees move to new jobs, which they do on
average 
<?notus-xml column=931?>11 times in their career. We on these Benches agree that action is
needed but we do not agree with the form of action proposed.
The impact assessment confirms that the Government considered two
default transfer options: first, pot follows member, where the
small pension pot would follow the member to their new
employer’s pension scheme; secondly, an aggregator scheme, where
small pension pots would be transferred to an aggregator, such as NEST.
The Government had two options but I believe that they chose the wrong
one. However, I do not propose to substitute my judgment for that of
the Government; rather, this amendment would simply increase the choice
available to them. As it stands, Clause 32 allows only for pot follows
member. Our amendments would enable the possibility of the Government
using an alternative default aggregator model without the need for new
primary legislation.</hs_para>

out the context. The core issues of trust and confidence are still
centre stage in getting people to start, and continue, saving for their
retirement. This Bill, and auto-enrolment itself, should give people
the confidence they need to save for their old age, but how can we
demand that people save if they do not trust the savings vehicles and
do not trust the pensions market as offering value for money? The
pensions market is not a typical retail market where the consumer
chooses the product. Under auto-enrolment, the consumer does not choose
the product; the employer does. The only choice for the employee is
either to stay in or to opt out and lose the employer’s
contribution to their pension. There are also many intermediaries in
the pension supply chain. Pensions are complex products, lacking
transparency. While many large employers may have the resources to pay
for good product advice or assessment of fund performance, SMEs may
not. The demand side is
weak<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:44:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140226105000232" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000232">3.45

pensions market has some very big players that offer pension fund
products but also asset management and annuities. The OFT says that the
four largest players have 61% of the members, 68% of the
assets and 76% of the schemes. The results are predictable. The
combination of a concentrated supply side and a weak demand side is bad
for savers and allows the conflicts between the two to go unresolved,
against the interests of savers. These characteristics of the pensions
market combine, as the OFT’s excellent report says, to make the
market dysfunctional. The OFT concluded
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="140226105000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000214">“competition

workplace pensions market”.</hs_quotefo>

with other criticisms raised by the OFT, but Amendment 23 and its
associated amendments deal specifically with the challenges of small
pension pots created by auto-enrolment. The Government themselves
estimate that 50 million pension pots will be created by auto-enrolment
by 2050, 12 million of them under £2,000. Already one
person in six has lost track of their pension pots, and there are 1
million unclaimed pension pots with less than £3,000 in them.
The Government estimate that pot follows member will result in 27% of
the workforce having more than five pension pots. The evidence is clear
that a default consolidation mechanism is needed for those people who
do not make an active choice to transfer their 
<?notus-xml column=932?>pension at the point of movement. The point at issue is how best to do
this. The Government have chosen pot follows member but, given the
state of the market, so well captured in the OFT report, pot follows
member carries some really significant risks. There are major
challenges associated with setting up and administering it. There have
also been some significant criticisms of the pot follows member model
of consolidation, as my noble friend Lady Drake explained very cogently
at Second Reading. The National Association of Pension Funds concluded
that the pot follows member system,</hs_para>

members’ savings and would be disproportionately complex for the
industry to implement. We estimate that savers could lose a sizeable
proportion of their savings if they move from a good scheme, with low
charges and good governance, into a bad scheme with high charges and
poor governance. This approach also exposes individuals’ entire
savings to market risk when they
transfer”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="140226105000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000204">We

tell the House which organisations in the field of pensions are backing
pot follows member as a solution to this problem. I believe that the
Association of British Insurers is, but will he list the other
organisations for us today? Will he also tell us why he does not seem
to have given any weight to consumer opinion? The DWP’s survey
showed that 61% of respondents would choose an aggregator. That is the
alternative. By contrast, the National Association of Pension Funds,
the Cass Pensions Institute, <I>Which?</I>, the CBI, the EEF,
Age UK, the TUC and the Centre for Policy Studies all prefer
an aggregator model of consolidating pension funds. That is a pretty
board church of employers, staff representatives, consumer interest
groups, academics and independent experts. They all believe that
aggregators will meet the needs of savers better and, I suggest, the
needs of employers.</hs_para>

ways to pursue aggregators. We know that the NEST model works well.
Cass and the NAPF have other ideas about ways to do it. I
have carefully not sought to prescribe an aggregator in
detail in this amendment, although I think we should take the
opportunity to hardwire into aggregators features that will inspire
trust and confidence and reassure savers who are understandably
sceptical of the pensions industry, including the certification of
aggregators and a public service obligation which would require them to
accept automatic transfers in from pension schemes. The NAPF advocates
a robust regulatory framework for aggregators and suggests that quality
standards could be set so high that it is likely that only a small
number of aggregators would be
accredited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000078">We
all want the consolidation of small pension pots and we all want an
automatic transfer system. Our preference is for an aggregator model,
but all we are asking for in our amendments is to allow further work to
be done and for the possibility of aggregators to be the choice rather
than what the Government have done, which is to restrict the
choice only to pot follows member. If our amendment were
accepted, the Government would have the opportunity for further
investigation without the need for additional primary
legislation.</hs_para>

think many in this field suspect that the Pensions Minister came to a
fork in the road and chose the wrong fork. I understand
that. I have done it myself in my time. I suspect the Minister realises
now that he made a mistake, but he may just feel that he is
too far down that road to turn back. We have the chance to
build a bridge back to the main road where he can reflect
further on the choices available to him. If he then decides he wants to
stay with pot follows member, he may do so, but let us give him the
chance to think again, not for our sake, but for the sake of all those
workers who are doing the right thing and, despite cost of living
pressures, are managing to put aside hard-earned money towards the cost
of their retirement. I beg to

the power of the Secretary of State to make regulations to transfer
small pots automatically, but not the requirement that this must be

without excluding any particular solution, as the consequences of

There will always be a wide range between minimum standards and best

member. It fails those who leave the workforce or become self-employed,
as they are no longer active in an employer’s scheme. Their
small pots are left to flounder. Employers may even default their small
pot into a poorer-quality personal pension because they simply do not
allow ex-employees to remain in their existing scheme. By comparison,
an aggregator does not require a worker to be an active member, so it
can cater for more people. PFM increases administrative
burdens on employers, obliging every workplace scheme to be capable of
communicating with every other scheme. Aggregators reduce this burden
as there would be only a few schemes in which to
transfer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T15:55:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
Auto-enrolment was intended to carry a lighter regulatory burden on
employers, especially SMEs. However, PFM rows in the opposite
direction.</hs_para>

modelled pot follows member and aggregator over a range of pot size
transfer limits, initially setting a £2,000 pot limit for
aggregators while modelling PFM up to £20,000. After protests,
it issued an ad hoc release, modelling the limit for aggregators up to
£20,000. The Government argue that an aggregator solution would
require transfers to be restricted to pots of £2,000 or less
rather than the £10,000 intended for pot follows member, a
figure suggested by providers to ensure that aggregators did not
dominate the market and upset competition. The whole analysis
underpinning auto-enrolment, the building of NEST and the need to
regulate value for money is based on massive market failure and the
inability to rely on fair competition. A hypothesis that dominant
aggregators might emerge is not a valid argument against aggregation at
higher pot

Turner of Ecchinswell (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, we have
before us this afternoon a series of interconnected issues
—the one of aggregation versus pot follows members, the issue of
charge caps and the issue of transparency of charges. They are all
related, because they are all to do with the absolute importance of
getting value for money for
pensioners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:00:38"></hs_TimeCode>. When
we did the work of the Pensions Commission some eight years ago, the 
<?notus-xml column=936?>commissioners had two main
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:00:34"></hs_TimeCode> about
the existing system of private pension provision. The first was a low
level of participation and savings, and the second was very poor value
for money—the phenomenon of many people, particularly those
working for small and medium-sized enterprises and on a lower income,
who paid fees such that by the time they came to retirement 25%, 30% or
even 40% of their entire pension pot had disappeared in the fees
charged to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:01:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000097">Auto-enrolment
addresses the issue of participation and, to a degree, that of cost,
because it has removed some of the selling costs involved. It is
essential to address the other issues driving costs, of which one is
the proliferation of pots and the administration cost that comes with
it. Therefore, it is good that there is a strong consensus that we need
some form of policy intervention to arrive at a better consolidation of
pots. I would accept that it could be done either way—by pot
follows member or by aggregators—but I have not been convinced
by the arguments that pot follows member is the superior
route<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:02:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000098">Part
of the logic originally put forward, as the noble Baroness, Lady Drake,
has said, was I think completely false—the idea that, if we had
aggregation, we had to limit the transfer of the pots to only
£2,000 versus a much higher transfer amount that would be
allowed for pot follows members. There was absolutely no logic to that
assumption. Indeed, I stress the point that there is no logic in any
limit on transfers at all. The logic put forward by the impact
assessment is that we need to avoid too much concentration of provision
in this industry, so that a cap on transfers makes sure that the
business is shared around in a fair fashion for lots of different
providers. But it is very clear from the OFT work that this is not a
market in which market competition works well, and the aim is not to
have competition for its own sake; having a large number of competitors
for its own sake is not an end. Competition is a good thing if it
produces better value for consumers. If it is the case that aggregation
into a relatively small number of aggregators will result in lower
costs to savers, that should be our preferred route—one that is
best for customers, not one that tries to spread the business around as
a form of fairness to those already providers in the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:03:44"></hs_TimeCode>. As a

we accept the logic that we should be allowing full transfers of
whatever amount people have to enable us to get to what the Secretary
of State called one big fat pot, that highlights one of the real
dangers in pot follows member and makes it even greater—the
danger that people can see their funds transferred into a higher charge
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:04:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Suppose
someone has been in a NEST-administered scheme with one employer,
paying 50 basis points—0.5%—for a default fund investment
and then changes jobs and moves to a new employer who has chosen a
scheme with a higher charge rate—perhaps 75 or 100 basis points.
They will have originally made a decision to accept auto-enrolment on
the basis of one set of charges but now we decide, in an Act of
Parliament, to transfer them to somewhere where they will face higher
charges in a way which, as I highlighted  
<?notus-xml column=937?>earlier, has not just a marginal but a huge effect
on the amount of money they pay in charges and, therefore, on their
pension for the whole of their
retirement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:05:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000100">If
we were committed to having in place very robust rules on the charge
cap—this is why the issues before us this afternoon are somewhat
linked—so that, for instance, we were confident that, if you had
pot follows member, you would be going from a 50 basis point fund in
NEST to a 50 basis point fund in where you had been transferred to, I
accept that the decision might be a bit more balanced, although I think
the other arguments that the noble Baroness, Lady Drake, put forward
would still apply. However, we do not have that robust commitment in
relation to the principle of a charge cap, let alone that it should be
set at something like 0.5%. In the absence of that, we should not
preclude the option of aggregation, which may well prove a more
effective route to get to the low costs that we require above all for
savers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_26_PT_1/196DCB3BD74F4536FA9CB786636F76AADEF5D049" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 February 2014">Wednesday,

Hutton of Furness (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am happy to have the
opportunity to make a brief contribution to the debate on this
amendment. It is the first time that I have put my name to an amendment
in this House. I have done so because I believe that this is a very
important point in the progress of the Bill. Clause 33 is to be
welcomed in principle. It is the first time that a Government have
addressed the problem of the large number of small pension pots that
are out there. We need a solution to that problem, so I absolutely
welcome the Government’s attention to this
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:07:02"></hs_TimeCode>. We all
know that one of the by-products of auto-enrolment —it is a very
good policy which clearly at this early stage is encouraging more
people to save—is that we will see many more of these small pots
created. It is certainly not in the interests of pension savers for
these small pots simply to stay where they

do not want to repeat the very able arguments put by my noble friend on
the Front Bench, by my noble friend Lady Drake and, indeed, by my noble
friend Lord Turner, but I will make a slightly different point. Your
Lordships’ House has heard the technical arguments, which are
complicated and difficult to digest. I come at this debate from a
slightly different angle, having been a former Pensions Minister. There
are many other former Ministers in this House and I hope that the
international fraternity of former Ministers, who are represented so
well in this House, will understand this point. There comes a moment in
the gestation of any policy when it is necessary to take a step back to
be sure about it and to satisfy yourself that the policy is the right
one—particularly given the fact that, as my noble friend Lord
Turner said, if we do not amend the Bill, we will make the transfer of
these pension pots compulsory and run the risk that people could lose
out. That is a real hazard of which we need to be aware. In my
experience, the best time to take that pause is before you take that
step; you should not to do so once you are committed to it, perhaps
irrevocably, and when some people will lose out as a
result<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000103">I

the Government’s policy. It gives the Government the opportunity
to take stock of the situation. There are serious concerns about the
impact assessment undertaken to support the policy. Many others have
spoken of their concerns about the impact assessment. It
would be a misstep on the part of this House to take a decision on the

the amendment does is invite the Government to take another look at
this policy. It does not rule out pot following member, if that is what
the Government are committed to doing; it simply gives them the
opportunity, without coming back to this place, to follow the path of
aggregation. Many of us believe that the opportunities of
aggregation have not been fairly and fully explored by the Government.
We should look again at the issue of aggregation, but I do not want to
mandate that as a policy for the Government. That would not be right,
but it would be absolutely sensible and in the interests of
millions of pension savers for us, at this very late hour, to take a
step back—not to rule out the possibility that this might be the
eventual path that we follow, but to allow us, and Ministers in
particular, to take another look at the benefits of aggregation. I
genuinely think that that would be the right course of action for
Ministers to take at this moment, and I hope that the House agrees with

inertia is an accepted principle to encourage savings through
auto-enrolment, and should now be followed to encourage consolidation
of pension pots. Let us remind ourselves that this measure covers
people who do not want to opt to do things according to their own
decision. It deals with people who are not at the moment

dominating the market, or will there be an unlimited aggregator model
in which any scheme that meets certain criteria on charges and
governance can act as an aggregator? There is no clarity about who will
be responsible for selecting the aggregator scheme for the
individual’s pot as it is to be transferred on moving jobs.

is promoted as a safe haven for accumulated pension savings, with the
implication that higher governance standards and restricted charging
will offer greater security than pot follows member. I have to say that
there is a difference in outlook on the process of reform between the
two sides of the House on this issue. The aggregator model, by breaking
the link with the employer’s current live scheme, will make it
more difficult for individuals to understand where their money is and
to engage with their retirement savings. An aggregator model will be a
further distortion of competition in the pensions sector. We know
that the sector is overconcentrated at the
moment; we will merely be making it worse. Size also promotes
complacency and inefficiency, and could increase risk where competition
is weaker. It does not seem logical to attack regulated cartels in the
energy and banking sectors but promote them in the pensions sector. The
aggregator model will exploit inertia, too. Once the aggregator has the
worker’s first pot, it is likely to receive subsequent pots
because the consumer will make no active choice and there will be no
incentive to innovate or improve performance.</hs_para>

pot proposal we are providing two countervailing forces. There will be
greater transparency for the consumer, who will remain close to their
pot and will have a greater opportunity to understand the pension

employer will also be motivated to make the best provision for their

Flight (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, has
made some very good arguments in favour of pot follows member, but I
want to start—and I want to be sure that there is absolute
clarity here—on the question of individuals having a choice
about where they consolidate their pension savings. We are talking
about the default option in discussing pot follows member versus
aggregator and no more than that. When an individual joins a company
scheme on moving jobs, it is quite important that he is able to choose
where to consolidate his pension.</hs_para>

default option, first, I have always felt strongly that the argument
against the aggregator arrangements is: who chooses? That point was
made by the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham. I cannot really see who is in an
appropriate position to choose if we go to aggregators. Secondly, aside
from the cartel point, the larger the amounts of money, the more
difficult it becomes to manage that money. A whole lot of potential
investments almost get ruled out because the market capitalisation of
firms is not sufficiently large. Therefore, I do not see there being a
huge virtue in having a limited number of colossal managers. I might
add that NEST’s charges do not seem to be particularly
competitive, particularly for the earlier years of
membership<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:18:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

believe that there are arguments for keeping all doors open but I do
not feel that the case for the aggregator has by any means been won. On
balance, I think that pot follows member is a better solution,
essentially for the reasons given by

Lord Stoneham, although I shall not repeat them.</hs_para>

German (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall try not to repeat the
remarks of my noble friends Lord Stoneham or Lord Flight, but my noble
friend Lord Flight makes a very important point about the default
choice which is before people. That is what this amendment must seek to
address but I think that it fails to do so. Noble Lords will recognise
that what we have before us is a debate about either pot follows member
or the aggregator; it is not a debate about choice. Except for the
noble Lord, Lord Turner, who said that under certain conditions, the
balance might be right, it is clear that those on the Labour Benches
want to see an aggregator
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:19:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000117">I
accept that that is the purpose behind the amendment but that is why it
is important to examine these issues. I shall say a few words about why
we must have some form of automatic transfers of pensions. The main
beneficiaries of automatic transfers are those people who, for the
first time, are saving for their retirement, following automatic
enrolment into a workplace pension, and then move jobs, leaving behind
a small pension pot. A system of automatic transfers is necessary to
stop the proliferation of small pots that will ensue as a by-product of
automatic enrolment. The average worker in this country will have 11
jobs in the course of their working life. Automatic enrolment by 2018
will probably have 9 million people within it, and maybe even
10 million by 2020 who are new savers, saving more for their

<?notus-xml column=941?>retirement than their work-based pensions. These are people who are
being automatically enrolled. If we took no action the
projection is that there will be around 50 million dormant
workplace defined contribution pension pots within the system by
2050<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000118">A
successful system must focus on the interests of the member, allowing
them to consolidate their pension savings. I notice that the noble
Lord, Lord Monks, is not in his place but he is a trustee of the
NOW: Pensions fund. His fund conducted research of more than
2,000 21 year-old plus people with at least one workplace pension. The
result was quite clear: 39% of the individuals surveyed said that pot
follows member was their preferred option compared to just 6% for the
aggregator model. It was suggested that the aggregator model is so
difficult to understand that people chose the easier one because they
recognised its simplicity. Is it not the case that we are looking for
simplicity? People were asked, “Do you want your pension to
follow you, or do you want it placed somewhere else, which will be some
distance from you both in employment terms and in being able to
influence what it does?” People in that survey, which is
probably one of the most comprehensive that we have had, said, given
the choice, they preferred to have their pot following them when they
changed
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:22:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

explaining an aggregator model to the public, who do not understand the
pensions market well anyway, would be much more of a challenge. People
will not understand what is being made of their pension, seeing it
going away to a distant aggregator, compared to the idea that their
pension moves with them to their new employer. I do not believe that
there is evidence that the interests of individuals would be best
served by the undefined aggregator system. It will be difficult to
administer, as my noble friend Lord Stoneham said, and will lead to the
market being dominated by a few large schemes and providers, and where
everyone will be guaranteed to have two pensions rather than
one<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000120">The
issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Turner, and by the noble Baroness,
Lady Drake, about quality is crucial. I recognise, as we all do, that
the OFT in its report on DC pension schemes said clearly that
competition was not driving good value for money for all savers. That
is precisely why the Government intend to legislate, and we are seeing
some of that today at Clause 43 and Schedule 18, which the Government
are dealing with. The whole process of raising the standard is
crucial—most importantly, perhaps on charges. Perhaps my noble
friend can confirm that it is the Government’s intention to
introduce matters in relation to charging before the end of this
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:24:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000121">I
believe, too, that we have to consider the choices that people will
have to make. Who will decide where an aggregator policy for them will
be placed? How would the allocation process work? Would it be by a
random list, a computer allocation or perhaps names in a hat? These are
all unknowns. What happens to people’s pensions which
are forced on them when they move jobs under the aggregator system is
very unsatisfactory. Far better that they should have a simple system
in which they have one contract with one pension which they take
through with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:24:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the crucial factor is the standards that each of these pensions schemes
have applied to them. That is why I welcome the Government’s
initiative. I know that by the end of this year they will introduce
proposals to ensure that the standards are right. As my noble friend
Lord Stoneham said, we are looking for high standards, not a
minimum standard, in this
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:25:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000123">We
have before us a choice. We already have 2 million new
savers as a result of automatic enrolment, and waiting will mean that
many of the people being enrolled will be denied this opportunity as
another scheme would have to be worked up and compared with the one
proposed. The pension funds are already working with government in
order to work the scheme up and to get it ready and in place. Can my
noble friend tell me what progress has been made already to ensure that
pot follows member is in a fair and fit state to be introduced
rapidly?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000124"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:25:55"></hs_TimeCode>We
have to make a choice. It seems to me that we should choose the

Turnbull (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I have not previously intervened
in this debate. I declare an interest as a director of a life insurance
company, the Prudential, which is not a big player in this market, but
the views I will express are my
own<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:26:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000126">My
first point relates to the high rate of change in our economy and
society, which was remarked upon by the noble Lord, Lord
Hutton. People are increasingly likely to adopt more flexible
employment patterns. Does a seasonal worker—let us
say he is a county cricketer who is not good enough to have
a central contract with the England team but plays cricket in the
summer and works in a fitness centre in the winter or, like
Alec Bedser, humps bricks and builds up his strength—alter his
provider season by season? How would you make that kind of system
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:27:38"></hs_TimeCode>? The
pension pot follows member would not necessarily work for those kinds
of
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000127">Secondly,
the life expectancy of employers is not as great as one might think.
Only 18 of the original FTSE 100 members are still in the
index—some of them have gone out of business or been taken over
and broken up—and turnover is likely to be even greater at the
SME level. So relating pensions to one’s employer is not
necessarily the best thing to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:28:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:28:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000128">The
noble Lords, Lord Stoneham and Lord German, have tried to argue that
the aggregator model will provide a comfortable ride for the existing
incumbents and will create mega-providers. However, who are the
providers of pot follows member? They are the existing pension
providers. We should not make the easy assumption that one model is
anti-competitive and will produce a concentrated market and the other
will create a highly diverse and competitive market. They each have
their own faults and we should not attribute a monopoly of virtue to
pot follows member.</hs_para>

is why this amendment, which provides a degree of choice, is valuable.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:29:01"></hs_TimeCode> would give us

privileged to have been here this afternoon to hear a pantheon of some
of the leading pension thinkers in the country concentrate on an issue.
As a result it has been a very interesting debate. Clearly we all agree
that this is a very important topic. We need to find a solution to the
issue of small pots and I will make a case for why the Government
believe that automatic transfer is the right solution and why we do not

are clear that the pot-follows-member model, with small pension pots
automatically moving and being combined with the individual’s
current live workplace pension, will lead to increased consolidation of
pension pots, better outcomes in retirement and better member
engagement, as well as administrative savings for the industry. The
pot-follows-member model builds on the essential foundation of
automatic enrolment —the employer/employee relationship that is
proving so successful in driving retirement saving, including among
those who have never had a pension before. Employees identify with this
relationship and with the idea of pots following them to their new
employer.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140226105000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000132">My
noble friend Lord German mentioned the research carried out by NOW:
Pensions. It showed that 39% of individuals would like their
pot to follow them automatically compared with 6% who wanted their pot
sent to an aggregator scheme. For the purposes of that research, NOW:
Pensions defined the aggregator model as a pot that is automatically
moved to a central scheme that meets certain standards. This
definition, although high level, is helpful because otherwise we have
no clear sense of what an aggregator actually is. Indeed, these
amendments do not help define what an aggregator is or how it would
work. In fact, these amendments—which have been revised since we
discussed them in Grand Committee—appear to be even less
workable than before. For instance, they appear to give the
decision about where to move the pot to the ceding scheme. By
definition, the ceding scheme is the scheme with the least interest in
the individual and their outcome in retirement because it is losing the
pot.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140226105000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000133">This
seems entirely counterintuitive when compared with the successful
current account switching service—CASS—that helps
customers move banks. This service puts the onus on the new bank to
ensure that the switch happens, because it was recognised
that the bank gaining the account will have more interest in
making the move as smooth as possible than the old one. It
is perhaps not unreasonable that when people move employers and join a
new pension scheme they will expect the new scheme to do the work of
transferring the pot for them, as happens when they switch their
current account, but this would not be true under a push transfer model
which these amendments would introduce.</hs_para>

friend Lord Flight, who points out a real problem with the proposed
aggregator model. It really is not clear who chooses where the pension
is aggregated. There are other fundamental flaws, such as the lack of
any provisions to ensure that the same scheme is used each
time—someone could end up with pots in multiple aggregators,
undermining 
<?notus-xml column=944?>the core aim of consolidation. Moreover, there is no
definition of what an aggregator is, who could set one up and what the
criteria for doing so would be. This lack of clarity will not help the
industry in driving forward the development of the implementation

strange that, in response to the OFT’s conclusion that there is
a lack of competition in the pensions market, the Opposition are
calling for the creation of a market dominated by a few big master
trusts. We need only to look at other industries, such as the energy
market or banking sector, to see that dominance by a few powerful
players can result in real concerns for consumers. If we were to press
on regardless with enabling these large aggregators to come into being,
we would need to be clear that there would be no turning back. It would
be extremely difficult to reverse the process if we found that an
aggregator model was not sustainable, and to tackle the vested

Government’s starting point is the consumer—and it is the
individual who wants to see their pension follow them to their new

touched on, underlines. The ABI’s consumer research showed that
58% of individuals said that the pot should follow them automatically
to the new job; 10% were in favour of a new central scheme, the
aggregator; 15% said the pot should stay where it is and it is up to
you to move it; and 17% said it should be visible with all other
pension pots at a central place online. That is the sentiment among
consumers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000146">I

Lady Drake and Lady Sherlock, raised concerns about consumer detriment.
I remind the House about the work the Government are doing to ensure
that all schemes are good schemes. Uniformity 
<?notus-xml column=946?>is not good for consumers, but only if all aggregators had identical
charges and standards would we completely remove the risk of an
individual moving to a worse scheme. The noble Lord, Lord Turner, made
the point about the interconnectedness of these issues. The Minister
for Pensions has confirmed that he remains “strongly
minded”—I think that is fairly parliamentary language
—to introduce a charge cap. My noble friend asked about the DWP
response to the OFT and the consultation on charges. That response is
coming soon and we will be discussing that later this

the current live pot where the individual can see it growing, rather

response to the assertion of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, that
pot follows member would be hard to set up, we have recently had some
very positive workshops with industry representatives and HMRC. The
model is already inspiring some exciting and innovative approaches to
transferring money with an employee as they move jobs. The cost of the
transfer was specifically mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Drake.
It will be the same for an aggregator as for pot follows member. Altus
has challenged the claim that pension transfers are too hard and too
expensive by stating that transfers for ISAs and funds cost £1
or less, and that this can be replicated for pension
transfers.</hs_para>

believe that we are rushing into this measure. We first consulted more

extensive discussions with industry and consumer groups within that

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have
contributed to what has been another classic House of Lords debate. I
particularly thank my co-signatories to this amendment, my noble
friends Lord Hutton and Lady Drake. The Minister referred at the outset
to a pantheon of pensions expertise, and indeed it has been. The noble
Lord, Lord Bates, joked in Grand Committee that the Pensions
Commission was almost quorate since two of its three members
were gathered there. I say to the Minister, as I said then to the noble
Lord, Lord Bates, that if I were sitting where he was and this pantheon
was sitting opposite me and telling me that I was wrong, I would be
pausing, just as my noble friend Lord Hutton suggested.</hs_para>

have been made today. The Minister says that the Government have been
discussing this for two years but this House has not. When we discussed
it in Grand Committee, I do not recall hearing a single
supportive speech for pot follows member. I am glad that the
researchers of the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, moved him from his
position then to the position that he articulated so clearly today, but
I do not think that anyone in this House has heard those arguments made
until today. I am glad that we have 
<?notus-xml column=948?>heard them, and very glad that the Minister has been doing
work with the industry to get it ready to deliver what will be this
Act. However, it is still a Bill; it is not an Act and this House has
every right to make its own decisions. Whatever decisions Parliament
makes, I have no doubt that at that point the Minister and his
colleagues will go out there to deliver.</hs_para>

heard today against our enabling amendment? First, we have heard that
it is not clear what the choice is. Well, that is the point: the
amendment says to the Government, “Go back and think
again. We will work with you if necessary, but think again”. It
is said that there will be a delay. Yes, there will be a delay, but the
wrong thing would be to rush ahead and make a decision because you want
it now, if the consequences would be very serious because it is the
wrong decision. This is too serious to rush into. A lot of criticisms
have been made so far. For example, the Minister says that the way in
which this amendment is constructed would leave the choice of the
aggregator with the outgoing employer. If the Minister looks again at
Amendment 23J, he will find in fact that it says that regulations may
do one of two things. There is a big “or” between the
two; it is either push or pull. Everything about these amendments is
constructed to say that we recognise there are choices to be made but
think that the Government have not given enough thought to what should
be the right way forward for consumers.</hs_para>

to counter the arguments made across the Benches here. What about all
those who leave employment? What about the self-employed, who make up
the fastest-growing sector: where do their pension pots go? What
happens to the pension pot of the seasonal cricketer mentioned by the
noble Lord, Lord Turnbull? I am sorry, but I live in Durham and our
cricketers are mostly in the England teams, so I cannot advise him
there. However, I can tell him that that person would really struggle
under pot follows member. What about all those people in mini-jobs who
will find themselves in a position of not having a single employer?
Much has been said about the relationship between employer and
employee, but the truth is that every model of pension scheme struggles
with employee engagement. As the noble Lord, Lord Flight, pointed out,
the whole point of this is that it addresses only the position of those
who make no active choice themselves, yet those are the people to whom
the state owes the greatest responsibility. These are the people
who<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T16:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>se funds we

has been made of the fact that we want all the schemes to be of the
best quality, but let’s get real—the OFT has already said
that the market is not working. The noble Lord, Lord Turner, has
described the challenges they found: people are learning when they come
to retire that between 25% and 40% of their pension pot has gone in
charges. If the Government really are committed to tackling charges I
would invite the Minister to intervene again and to give a proper
answer to his noble friend, the noble Lord, Lord German, about when the
Government will cap pension charges. If he will not tell us now, I have
a very simple solution for him—he can vote for our amendment in
the next group and cap the charges
tomorrow.</hs_para>

cross-party, consensual discussion about the way forward. The Labour
Party introduced auto-enrolment and I pay tribute to the Government for
taking it forward. We all share a common objective: to get as many
people as possible saving for retirement. They can do so only if they
have trust and confidence in the pensions market and in the schemes
they are investing in. If they do not have that confidence they will
not save and we will all be the poorer. The best way to do it is to
ensure that there are schemes in which people can have confidence. I

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, it was Parliament’s original
intention that everyone should be automatically enrolled, subject only
to age and earnings criteria. This has the advantage of a very simple
approach. It made it clear that all employers, whatever their size or
the nature of their business, would be covered. It relied on
individuals to opt out if pension saving was not right for
them.</hs_para>

automatic enrolment into a workplace pension is working and we are
seeing reassuringly low opt-out rates. However, we also recognise that
there are some very limited situations in which automatic enrolment
simply does not make sense for the jobholder. Opt-out is effective but
it does not take away the need for employers and pension schemes to go
through the enrolment processes and for the individual then to opt out,
even where it clearly makes no sense for that individual to be put into
pension saving. This is a waste of employers’ time and
frustrating for individuals.</hs_para>

evidence from stakeholders of instances in which it makes no sense
automatically to enrol individuals. Our consultation of March 2013,
<I>Technical Changes to Automatic Enrolment</I>, sought
views on how the automatic enrolment process could be improved and
invited views on whether there were certain categories of workers whom
it might make sense to exclude from automatic enrolment. The responses
strengthened our view that in certain circumstances automatic enrolment
is not appropriate and that, for these individuals, the most suitable
option is to give their employer the option not to enrol them in the
first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000171">On 12
February, we published a response to the consultation on how the power
to make exceptions to the automatic enrolment duty might be used and
identified four situations which merit further consideration: first,
people who could face tax charges if they make further pension savings;

exceptions to the employer duty, but we have made it clear on more than
one occasion that we will not use it to exclude large numbers of
employers based solely on size or the nature of the employer’s
business. We do, however, acknowledge that the power could, in theory,
be used to exclude small and medium-sized employers and we understand
the concerns raised by the Opposition on this point. We are content to
limit the power so that it cannot be used in this way. Amendment 24
therefore specifies that regulations cannot exclude an employer from
their automatic enrolment duties on the basis of size. I beg to

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we should thank the
noble Lord, Lord Freud, for bringing forward this government amendment,
which as far as it goes is a restriction on the power to create
exceptions to the employer automatic enrolment duty. It responds in
part, as the noble Lord has acknowledged, to the amendment moved in
Committee by my noble friend 
<?notus-xml column=954?>Lady Sherlock and by Gregg McClymont in another place. We are grateful
for the Government’s movement on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:15:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000174">As
we have heard, this amendment narrows the circumstances in which
regulations can be deployed, and precludes them being used to provide
an exemption for employers of a particular size. This will therefore
appear to deny the exemption, whether size is determined by numbers of
employees, profitability, turnover, capitalisation or asset base, or
some other size criteria. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that that is
how he sees it. Nevertheless, the Bill would still leave scope to carve
out exemptions on a fairly wide basis. That could be by
reference to a description of worker, “particular
circumstances”, or “in some other way”, as the
Bill provides—for example, by
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:15:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000175">We
accept entirely the assurances of current Ministers that the purpose of
the government amendment is to offer employers more flexibility in a
limited number of specific situations that affect only a small number
of workers. However, even as amended the Bill is not so tightly drawn
and opens up the prospect in the future of a wider impairment of the
employer duty, which is the foundation on which auto-enrolment is
built<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:16:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000176">We

therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:17:25"></hs_TimeCode> arises
as to whether the four circumstances identified—and remember
that that was after a very extensive trawl, including the experience of
live running—warrant the potentially broad amendment which will
remain in this legislation. The four circumstances referred to by the
Minister—those with tax-protected status for existing pension
saving, those on the brink of leaving employment, those who have given
notice of retirement, and those who have recently cancelled membership
after being contract joined—might well justify an exemption on
automatic enrolment rather than rely on workers opting out, especially
given the potentially large tax penalties which might arise for those
with tax-protected status. However, until the practical consequences of
putting this into effect are fully considered—and we welcome the
commitment to consult on a draft instrument, albeit still a negative
one—we cannot be certain that the “cure” is better
than the
“ailment”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000179">On
reflection, <hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:18:01"></hs_TimeCode>a
better way forward might have been to identify these four specific
circumstances in primary legislation together with the power to
introduce regulations for the exemption of the employer duty in all or
any of these situations. This would have removed concerns over the Bill
retaining the still potentially wide powers of exemption. If it is too
late to consider this approach, as it might be, I hope that the
Minister can give as much assurance on the record as to the intended
use of what will remain of this
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:18:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Freud:</Member></B> Let me just deal with the first specific question
raised by the noble Lord, on the issue of size and what we mean by
that. Clearly, the Opposition were primarily concerned when we went
through this in Grand Committee that a Government—this one or
any other—should not be able to exclude small and medium-sized
employers from their duties on automatic enrolment. The primary
definition of size here is to prohibit an exception based on the number
of workers, which is one central understanding of the size criteria,
but it could also mean, as the noble Lord indicated, turnover, profit
or VAT registration. We do not have the need to define it further in
the Bill because whatever measure of size was used would be prohibited
by the government
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:20:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000181">On
whether there is a better way in which to limit the power that is the
thrust of the noble Lord’s question, we have identified these
four circumstances. We are not confident that they are the only
circumstances; more may come up. We have considered in legal terms that
this is the best way to be able to respond in making sure that when
other circumstances arise we can use this power. We believe that it is
prudent to leave this Government and future Governments the flexibility
to consider other criteria. However, I can say on record that we have
no particular situations in mind here; we are simply leaving ourselves
the option to respond to new or changing

the four situations that have been identified, we will develop
proposals for workable exceptions, and they may have to work in
different ways in different circumstances. As the noble Lord said, we
will consult with final proposals and draft regulations in due course,

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:22:44"></hs_TimeCode> honourable
friend the Minister for Pensions announced in a Written Statement in
the other place at the start of this week, the Government remain firmly
committed to ensuring that consumers receive value for money from their
pension savings and to seeing this through during the life of this
Parliament—a point that I made earlier. Our response to the
consultation on charges, and further proposals on quality and
transparency in defined contribution workplace pension schemes, will be
published soon<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:22:46"></hs_TimeCode>.
We are taking action to ensure that those who are defaulted into
pension 
<?notus-xml column=956?>saving through automatic enrolment can be confident that their money is
invested in well governed and transparently managed
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000186">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:23:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:23:53"></hs_TimeCode>
26A demonstrates our firm belief that transparency of costs and charges
is fundamental for good scheme governance and to enabling comparison
between schemes. On this we are in complete agreement with the my noble
friend Lord Lawson and the thrust of the amendments which he has tabled
on this subject. I take this opportunity to thank him for the helpful
discussions we have had on this issue thus far and I look forward to
engaging with him further on the detail of these
provisions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:24:05"></hs_TimeCode>. We
have always been clear that disclosure of transaction costs should be
improved; that is why we sought views on the best way of doing this in
our consultation following on from the Office of Fair Trading study of
the defined contribution workplace pension market. In the consultation,
we suggested using our existing permissive powers in the Pension
Schemes Act 1993 to require improved disclosure of
information<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:24:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, I am pleased that our Amendment 26A goes further than this
and, for the avoidance of any doubt about our intentions, requires the
Secretary of State to make regulations requiring greater transparency
around the transaction costs incurred by work-based defined
contribution schemes. It would also allow the Secretary of State to
disapply that duty in limited circumstances in which he is content that
there is an alternative regulatory regime in place for specified
schemes. The intention is for this to provide for a situation in which
the Financial Conduct Authority has made its own rules for disclosure
of information about transaction costs in relation to contract-based
schemes, in which case the Secretary of State may need to make
regulations only for trust-based schemes which are regulated by the
Pensions
Regulator.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000187">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:25:29"></hs_TimeCode>
amendment would provide for the types of transaction costs covered to
be specified in regulations. Here again, we are in agreement with my
noble friend Lord Lawson that the full range of transaction costs that
may be borne by scheme members should be disclosed. I would like to
reassure the House that we do have the powers to ensure that this
happens, but the Government need the flexibility to require disclosure
of types of costs that might become apparent over time. Government
Amendment 26A has therefore been drafted specifically to provide this
flexibility and to future-proof the legislation. We will formally
consult before making the regulations but, at this stage, and in the
first instance we would expect them to include costs such as stamp duty
and bid-offer spreads. We would be more than happy to involve my noble
friend Lord Lawson, and other noble Lords with an interest in this
matter, in the discussion of what the regulations will
cover.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000188">The
amendments of my noble friend Lord Lawson also provide for making
information about transaction costs publicly available on a common
basis. This is, again, a suggestion with which we fully agree
and thank my noble friend for highlighting this issue.
Making such information publicly available will surely support
consumers, employers and others in making comparisons and deciding
between schemes. Public comparison of charges is something on which we
sought views in the recent charges consultation and will publish
further 
<?notus-xml column=957?>proposals soon in the forthcoming government response. Our existing
disclosure powers would enable us to regulate for information on
transaction costs to be made public, but given the importance of this
issue, I am happy to consider between now and Third Reading whether any
changes can be made to primary legislation to reinforce and make
explicit this commitment to provide for information to be made publicly
available.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000189">To<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:27:56"></hs_TimeCode>
touch briefly on the scope of the disclosure requirements, the duty
that is created by this amendment applies to money purchase, or defined
contribution, pension schemes only. This is narrower than the
provisions of the existing power, which will remain, under which
regulations can apply to all occupational and personal pension schemes.
The reason why the Government are focusing the new duty on the defined
contribution market in their package of measures on charges, scheme
quality and transparency is that in defined contribution it is members
who bear the risk of their investment, and members whose pension
savings may be diminished by high or unclear charges. It is also the
defined contribution market that the Office of Fair Trading has
investigated and recommended action to
reform<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:28:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000190">Members
of defined benefit pension schemes already enjoy a level of protection
from such risks. However, the power to require greater transparency of
scheme costs and charges could cover all schemes, and we will continue

Amendments 25, 26, 30 and 31. We have been clear that we want the
ability to protect those in both trust-based and contract-based schemes
and that this protection must extend to closed schemes, by which I mean
schemes without any active members. However, the definition of
“work-based” schemes currently used in Clause 43 and
Schedule 18 does not extend to this group of
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000194">Members
of the House may be aware that the Office of Fair Trading and

<?notus-xml column=958?>the audit of high-cost and legacy schemes. This
exercise will focus on those schemes that the Office of Fair Trading
has identified as being at risk of offering poor value for money for
members. Where the audit identifies changes that are needed to address
shortcomings in these schemes, we expect these to be made on a
voluntary basis. However, we think that it is important to
have the ability to require improvements in these schemes,
should this prove necessary. Government Amendments 25, 26, 30 and 31
therefore make technical changes to the definitions used in Clause 43
and Schedule 18, to ensure that this can be
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226105000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000195">This

Lawson of Blaby (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin
by welcoming very warmly what my noble friend has said. The
Government have done the right thing and moved a long way since we
debated this issue in Committee. We see government Amendment 26A as
part of that move, but I am glad to say that the Minister has at the
Dispatch Box this afternoon said that he will, quite rightly, go even
further<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:32:58"></hs_TimeCode>. I
should therefore like to go over the points, perhaps for clarity. The
Minister does need to go further, some of the reasons for which he has
mentioned. I will not therefore speak to any of the amendments in my
name as such because they have been overtaken by events. It
is the substance that
matters<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226105000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000197">There seem to me to be
four ways in which further improvement is needed beyond Amendment 26A,
the first of which my noble friend has agreed to. That amendment would
open the door to disclosure but to a limited number of categories. It
is essential that there should be full public disclosure. This is
important. For example, all potential members of pension
schemes and workers should know what is happening, given
that every -one knows that the costs of pension schemes vary
enormously, as the noble Lord, Lord Turner, mentioned. This
is not in dispute. It is a fact. Studies have shown that that variation
bears no relation to performance, and some of the costs are
absolutely enormous. In money purchase schemes, that is a direct cost
to the pension that the beneficiary will get at the end of the
day<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:34:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226105000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000198">Nobody has mentioned
this so far but I do not think that we should forget the press. There
are sections of the press that give excellent consumer advice on
financial matters, and not just the press: there is the excellent Paul
Lewis, with his “Money Box” programme on the wireless.
All these people need the information. They need to be the
beneficiaries of disclosure if they are to be as effective as they
might be for the benefit of members of pension
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:35:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, there should be total disclosure, and I suggest in my
amendment that perhaps the best way of achieving that is for there to
be disclosure to the Pensions Regulator, who publishes a public
register which anybody can look at. However, there may be another way
which the Government prefer and which is equally good. I was
very glad to hear my noble friend say that there will be full public
disclosure, which goes beyond that set out in Amendment 26A. That is
what is
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=959?><hs_para UID="140226105000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000199">Another way in which
Amendment 26A is inadequate is that it refers to “some or
all” of the costs. My noble friend touched on that but it is of
the first importance that it says “all costs” and that
all the costs are itemised. It is obvious that if only some
costs are disclosed, it will be easy for investment managers to load on
to their costings costs which are not among those that need
to be disclosed. That is a complete nonsense. It is absolutely
essential that all costs are itemised and
disclosed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:36:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226105000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000200">There is another thing
that needs to be attended to and where further progress needs to be
made, but again it seems that in the spirit of what my noble friend
said he is prepared to go there. His amendment concerns disclosure of
information about transaction costs. It refers exclusively to
transaction costs and, again, that is not adequate; it has to be all
costs. There are, for example, investment managers’ fees,
performance fees and custody fees, all of which are not transaction
costs. Indeed, the Investment Management Association has stated that it
does not classify equity commissions as transaction costs. Therefore,
clearly the limitation to transaction costs is an invitation to abuse.
All costs that are incurred have to be
included<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:37:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226105000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000201">The final way in which
the amendment needs to be improved is perhaps less important than the
other three ways; none the less, it is still important. The present
proposal—my noble friend made this clear—relates only to
money purchase schemes. It does not apply to defined benefit schemes.
Defined contribution schemes, money purchase schemes, or whatever one
likes to call them, are more important because the proposal directly
impacts on the benefit that the beneficiary of the fund or pension gets
at the end of the day. If it is a defined benefit scheme, one could
say, “Why does it matter?”, but I do not think that it is
a matter of indifference. Investment managers can say, “We have
to control our costs, and reveal our costs, on money purchase schemes
and defined contribution schemes. We can get the money back by loading
extra costs on to the defined benefit schemes”. That would be
wholly unsatisfactory. Most defined benefit schemes may be closed to
new members but they are still going on and are substantial.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:35:00"></hs_TimeCode> further point
is that on a number of occasions the Government have expressed
concern about pension fund deficits. This proposal could
have a direct effect on the size of pension fund deficits. Therefore,
it is necessary to bring defined benefit schemes into this disclosure.
Transparency should not be explicitly and exclusively confined to money
purchase
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:39:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

areas in which further progress needs to be made. My noble friend said
that he would be happy to discuss how it will be done between now and
Third Reading. I would be happy to take part with other interested
parties in these discussions, following which we look forward to
further proposals and amendments at Third

point for clarification about something that is slightly obscure. I do
not think that it has been mentioned yet—certainly
not by the Minister. Subsection (6) of the proposed new clause in
Amendment 26A states
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="140226105000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226105000222">“subsection

can assume—I hope my noble friend will clarify it, as I cannot
believe that he has some other Bill up his sleeve—is that there
may a European Union directive in the offing that may cover this area.

may be redundant now, as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, has indicated,
but my noble friend Lady Sherlock and I support Amendments 27 and 28,
which require full disclosure of management and transaction charges for
each work-based pension scheme. Amendment 26B amends government
Amendment 26A that is broadly to the same effect. Amendment 26B
requires the information that the Government now belatedly agree should
be disclosed to pension scheme members should also be disclosed to the
pension scheme regulator who, in turn, must maintain a public register
of all costs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:43:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, I welcome Amendment 26A and I thank the Minister and
congratulate him on having tabled it. I have the advantage of the

the Government have—I will not say U-turned—but changed
their position substantially by almost 180 degrees on the very issue of
transparency and disclosure. I welcome the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:44:11"></hs_TimeCode>. When
the Minister was explaining this, his overconcentration on the
amendments of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, and his engagement with this
process—airbrushing out the contribution of my honourable friend
Gregg McClymont, who persistently raised this issue in amendments in
the House of Commons—may have given some people the impression
that the Government’s change of position is more to do with
Conservative Party discipline than their commitment to disclosure and
transparency in these issues in the interests of the
saver<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:44:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:45:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140226114000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000166">5.45

to the amendment tabled in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson of

my noble friend Lady Sherlock and I tabled an amendment in Committee in
similar terms—needs explanation. This is particularly important
given that only a few months ago the Pensions

the public register issue, which is now embraced, I commend to the

Pensions Minister when it was suggested by my honourable friend Gregg
McClymont and proposed as an amendment to Clause 35 in similar words to
those used by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, in his

do I make so much of this in the face of this significant concession by
the coalition Government? It is because—I shall construct this
argument carefully—the reason for Amendment 29, and our support
for it, is that it is difficult to follow exactly why the Government
were so reluctant to go down this path, and why they have accelerated
down it in such a way in the face of the intervention of the noble
Lord, Lord Lawson, if they really believe that the process of capping
charges and its transparency is in the interests of the saver and are

shall construct my argument and the Minister can respond to it. It has
always been Labour’s position that it supports broadly the
reforms contained in both halves of the Pensions Bill. As my noble
friend Lady Sherlock made clear in her excellent speech at Second
Reading on 3 December 2013, simplifying the complexity of the present
state pension system into a single-tier pension is supported for many
reasons, which include that it provides a predictable platform on which
the individual is then encouraged to build, principally through private
pensions.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140226114000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000008">My
noble friend went to argue that the success of the complementary
private pension savings model is dependent upon automatic enrolment of
all workers into a workplace pension scheme—which is moving
well—provided that every one of the 10 million being
auto-enrolled between 2012 and 2017 can be sure of getting value for
money from that pension scheme. This necessity has driven every single
one of Labour’s amendments to the private pensions part of the
Bill and is at the forefront of our arguments today.</hs_para>

all agree that pension charges have to be reasonable for people to have
the necessary confidence to invest their hard-earned money into pension
schemes, but from the evidence available now it is difficult to
exaggerate how obscure the charging structure for pensions is and how
dysfunctional the market is. For reasons we have debated repeatedly in
this Bill, the market alone cannot address this challenge. It is a
regret that the Government have been slow to understand the depth of
the problems in the pensions market and now appear reluctant to take on
the industry to solve them.</hs_para>

how we got to this better place of a cap on charges and disclosure of
the detail of them is necessary. In July 2012 my right honourable
friend Ed Miliband first raised this issue, identifying pensions as the
next big scandal and warning that savers must be protected from hidden
pension fees that 
<?notus-xml column=962?>strip them of huge percentages of their savings. He called
for a new regime imposing a clear charging structure on pension funds
and warned that fees needed to be capped. Disgracefully—and I
use this word advisedly—the Pensions Minister joined industry
voices who were then accusing my right honourable friend of
“scaremongering”. Indeed, the Pensions Minister accused
him of being “irresponsible”. In the lexicon of
parliamentary language, scaremongering and irresponsible are quite high
up the
scale<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:50:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000011">There
followed the publication of reports from independent bodies that
corroborated the basis of Ed Miliband’s concerns and in
September 2013 he announced at the party conference that Labour would
support an OFT inquiry into the pensions industry, put a cap on pension
charges and force pension firms to stop hiding their charges and the
full impact of them. The Government’s resistance to this agenda
was palpable. Even in January 2013 when the OFT inquiry was announced,
the Pensions Minister, Steve Webb, was still maintaining his scepticism
about capping pension charges. More investigations followed. The OFT
reported and, in the words of the Minister in the pot-follows-member
debate, its report showed that the pensions market was utterly
“dysfunctional”. In October 2013, almost on the day of
the Report stage of the Bill in the Commons, and forced to do so by the
findings of the OFT report, the Government U-turned on setting a cap on
the maximum charges that can be levied on savings in default funds and
announced the launch of a consultation. Finally, Labour had won the
argument on the issue.</hs_para>

is staggering that it has taken the Government so long when their own
figures show that individual savers could be losing as much as
£230,000 from their lifetime savings. The noble Lord, Lord
Turner, in his intervention in the pot-follows-member debate, described
in a very telling way the scale of the charges that can be charged,
particularly on small pension savings pots. At this point, the Pensions
Minister, Steve Webb, said that every passing month of delaying the
introduction of pension cap

agree with him. In announcing the consultation and the choices for
capping he quite deliberately attracted headlines that created an
expectation that a cap would be introduced shortly, probably by April
of this year and at less than 1%. In October 2013 he said,
“Enough is enough” and in October 2013 it was
enough.</hs_parafo>

his resolve now appears to have collapsed in the face of lobbying by
pension companies. Days after we debated these issues in Grand
Committee, in his response to the consultation the noble Lord, Lord
Bates, dangled in front of us the prospect of some positive response in
the Grand Committee the next Thursday when the Minister would make a
public speech. I remember the response of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
to this. What did we get? He kicked the cap down the road for at least
another year. Now insurance companies require at least a year’s
notice of a potential cap during which—using the

effect of our Amendment 29 is simple. If the new expectation that

moment. There has been a most interesting engagement between the noble
Lord, Lord Stoneham, and the Minister over this issue—I am
sorry, I mean the noble Lord, Lord German. The noble Lord, Lord
Stoneham, always causes difficulties. The noble Lord, Lord German, who
effectively speaks for the Liberal Democrats on these issues and must
be very close to the Pensions Minister, had an expectation in the
earlier debate that he would get a very clear assurance from the
Minister that the cap would be in place by April 2015. He asked for
that assurance in the pot-follows-member debate. The Minister used a
very telling phrase. He said that the Pensions Minister was
“strongly minded” to impose a cap. Everybody outside
thinks that the Pensions Minister has decided to impose a cap because
that is the impression that has been created. Later, in trying to get
more specific answers from the Minister, he used various phrases
including seeing this through in the life of the Parliament. Many of us
have been at that side of the Dispatch Box and know the restrictions on
Ministers in the use of language but we also know that the use of this
language is decided to give flexibility. However, on this issue very
few Members of your Lordships’ House want to see any
flexibility. There is an expectation that this cap will be in place
before the end of this Parliament and that expectation has been
created, even if reluctantly, by the behaviour of the
Government’s own
Ministers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:56:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interpretation of this history it can appear that the Government,
despite their constant reassurance, have been dragged kicking and
screaming to this point, all the while apparently being prepared to put
the industry’s interest before savers’ when push comes to
shove. This is the last opportunity for your Lordships’ House to
make it clear that Parliament has a different set of priorities which
are in favour of the saver and not the industry. It can do so simply by
creating a statutory deadline to compel the use of the power to cap,
which the Government reluctantly put in this Bill by way of an
amendment following the OFT report, on the date that the Government are
creating the impression that it will be used by.</hs_para>

I have already said this afternoon, the issue of total charges is
fundamental to what we are trying to achieve with this Bill. The
Government’s paper on 
<?notus-xml column=964?>charges makes it clear how important they are.
Figure 2 says that if you are a saver throughout your life
and you pay a charge of 0.5% when you get to retirement you will have
given up 13% of your pot in charges. If the charge is 1.5%—which
to the ordinary person might not seem all that much
higher—you give up 34%. The difference between paying charges of
0.5% and 1.5% is that you will be 20% worse off throughout the whole of
your retirement. This is not minor, but absolutely fundamental to how
we achieve good provision for people in
retirement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T17:59:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_26_PT_1/0FCE16FB30B2EA402CA9399F5ED8AEE9D50D119A" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 February 2014">Wednesday,

Turner of Ecchinswell:</Member></B> Obviously, it is possible that with
higher charges there might be a higher return, but many of the
variations that we see in charges in the industry are for things that
clearly will not produce a different return. One sees, for instance, a
wide spread of charges for index funds, where one knows that there will
be no difference. We also know that, on average, active management does
not add a return above index funds: that is a very strong empirical
result from a lot of analysis. While it is possible that with higher
charges come higher return, in a great many cases that is not so. One
thing pension savers would be wise to concentrate on is the charges
they face, because that is one of the few things that they can
definitively influence, whereas the gross return is a promise that may
or may not be
delivered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000021">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:01:33"></hs_TimeCode>
are the reasons that led the Pensions Commission to focus very strongly
on the issue of cost and the variation of cost. We noted, for instance,
that many people employed in the UK are in large trust-based schemes
and already enjoy, on defined contribution schemes, total fund
management charges of 20 basis points, 0.2%, or less. For those 20
basis points, they get fund management at the gross level quite as good
as people paying 1.5%. If you pay 0.2%, by the end of your savings
life, you would have given up only around 4% or 5% of your savings in
the charges, which is probably about as low as we can get it, given the
fundamental things that have to be done. Again, that is confirmed in
the Government’s own consultation paper on charging, which
illustrates that 10% of trust-based firms have annual management
charges of 0.19% or less. That is possible, provided we get economies
of scale, without giving up a significant choice of range of funds.
However, at the other end of the scale, we noticed many SMEs were
paying 1.5% and therefore, as per the Government’s consultation
paper, losing 34%; or 1%, at which point you lose
24<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:02:27"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000022">That
is why, as I said earlier, the recommendations of the Pensions
Commission covered not just auto-enrolment, to use the inertia power to
get people to save, but the design of the scheme, to ensure that access
at the sort of low costs already enjoyed by employees of large firms
can be enjoyed by employees of small firms. That was the reason for the
design of NEST, which was designed by looking at detailed cost analysis
and working out at what level it ought to be possible to deliver a
default fund and also at models 
<?notus-xml column=965?>from elsewhere, such as Sweden. We became convinced
that it ought to be possible to deliver to all people the opportunity
to invest in a default fund—probably an index fund—with
all explicit end costs of 0.3%. A set of decisions were subsequently
made that the cost would have to be 0.5%, which is what it
went forward as in the NEST
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:03:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
That at least establishes a benchmark and means that people
who invest in NEST are only giving up 13% of their end-of-life savings
pot in
charges<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000023">It
is important that that should be the benchmark and that we have a
charge cap. We know from the OFT’s and other analysis that this
is simply not a market where the operation of individual customer
choice is effective in driving cost-efficient competition. If that were
the case, we would never have had to have the recommendations of the
Pensions Commission and the auto-enrolment to which we are now
committed. If we do not impose a charge cap, we will leave many savers,
in particular lower-income people working for SMEs, facing
unnecessarily high costs. I think they are unnecessary if, for a
default fund, we are above 50 basis points, or 0.5%. I am
therefore concerned that the two options the Government were looking at
in their consultation paper on charging were 0.75% and 1%. If we come
forward with a cap of 1%, we are giving to the ordinary saver the
extraordinary promise that, on their behalf, we have made sure that
their loss of pot at the end of their life is only 24%. I do not think
that is a very compelling promise to give to people. I therefore
strongly believe that we should make a clear commitment, by a clear
date, to get on with this and have a charge cap in place, and that 0.5%
is the appropriate
figure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:05:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000024">Although
a price cap on explicit costs is important, it is not sufficient. That
is why I strongly support the sentiment of the amendment of the noble
Lord, Lord Lawson, which seeks to cover all the other costs which are
not covered in explicit fund management charges. The issue of these
other costs was also one with which the Pensions Commission was
concerned. We were concerned that, beyond what you can see in an annual
management charge for a fund, there are lots of other costs involved.
These are precisely the sort of costs described in Amendment 28, in the
name of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, which

the Pensions Commission, we sought to see whether research had been
done on how big these were. Interestingly, there was one piece of
research, which was sponsored by the FSA back in 2000 and written,
after a lot of research, by a man called Kevin James. It tried to work
out just how large these other costs were in the UK and in the US. We
called them implicit costs in addition to explicit costs. There is a
box in the first Pensions Commission report which explains that piece
of analysis and how big they are. His analysis, which we interpreted,
suggested that some of these costs might be as high as 90 basis points,
on top of the overt, explicit costs. We ended up, for the purposes of
modelling, believing that if we were to try to
understand what got lost between the gross return on equities that you
see by looking at the FTSE 
<?notus-xml column=966?>All-Share Index every year and what the saver gets, we had to allow, in
addition to the explicit asset management costs, for 65 basis points on
average going in these implicit costs—more for actively managed
funds, less for index
funds.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0001.htm#140226114000026">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:07:34"></hs_TimeCode>
is possible that those costs have come down since that analysis was
done and since we looked at it—there has, for instance, been
some compression of bid-offer spreads—but they are sufficiently
large that it is incredibly important to focus on them, pay attention
to them and, as it were, bring the disinfectant of transparency to bear
on this bit of the cost base. Let us suppose that they were 65 basis
points. That means that if somebody thought that they were paying 0.85%
on an explicit annual management charge, between the gross return on
equities in the market and what they actually get, they would be paying
85 basis points plus 65 basis points, which takes us back to the 1.5%
per annum, which is 34% of their pot

noble Lord, Lord Lawson, has put an immensely important issue on the
table. I would encourage the Government to widen their focus even
beyond pensions, because it is important not only in the pensions arena
but for the other ways that people save, for instance with ISAs. When
people save in ISAs, they are looking at an overt, explicit asset
management charge, but sitting behind that is a set of other hidden
costs. This is an issue where more information will help. It will not
transform the situation—we are deluding ourselves if we believe
that lots of individual savers are themselves, individually, going to
pay attention to this—but as the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, has
said, the press, including the specialist press, will pay attention to
it and a wider debate about just how large these charges are is very
important. It would, for instance, be very interesting to start seeing
how much higher these hidden costs are for actively managed funds
versus index-linked funds, because that is a piece of information that
people ought to bear in mind when they make those decisions between
different classes of
assets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000028">I

costs—and to see this as a start point of an extremely important

“some or all” rather than “all” for

what costs should be included but our intention is to include all
transaction costs, which incorporates not just the transaction costs
that my noble friend Lord Lawson made the point about but all costs,

get all costs, not just transaction

giving way. On this very point about the transparency of transaction
costs, my understanding of the Government’s amendment is that
they have given themselves the power to exempt from transparency where
there are existing FCA rules in relation to transparency. The existing
FCA rules on transparency exempt transaction costs, so how will the

only too well, when you look into this legislation there are bits and
pieces scattered all over the place, but I can summarise it in that

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 31A,
which stands in my name and in the name of my noble friend Lady
Sherlock, proposes the addition of a simple clause to the Bill. The
clause would require the provision of an independent annuity brokerage
service or the offer of such a service to all members pending
retirement. The clause goes on in later provisions to set out how best
practice should be defined and maintained in the brokerage service
offered to the retiring member or to which he or she is directed. It
calls for an independent brokerage service to assist people to
annuitise at the point of retirement. This is hardly a radical
proposal. It fits the description of best practice and is what many
employers with DC pension schemes already offer.</hs_para>

practice says that providers should tell people decumulating that they
can shop around and transfer the funds to another provider and advise
them to seek advice before so doing. However, that is not enough. As
Dan Hyde wrote in an article in the <I>Telegraph</I> in
December:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="140226114000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000137">“The process
starts with a ‘wake-up’ pack sent to savers months before
their named retirement age, in which pages of often unintelligible
information, packaged in unhelpful ways, baffle even the
well-informed”.</hs_quote>

can purchase their own independent financial advice but the majority do
not retain or use independent financial advisers or accountants. A
one-off appointment would be expensive—equivalent to a
week’s take-home pay for workers on average wage—even if
they knew where to go.</hs_parafo>

employers’ firms can negotiate a better rate but the scandal of
annuities is well known and widespread. In one sense, how often do we
need to be told? Only last week, in yet another report, the Financial
Conduct Authority confirmed again that the annuities market is not
working and that it is disorderly. The number of adjectives that can
now be found to describe financial services markets is interesting. The
Financial Conduct Authority has ordered a further review but we need
immediate action. Each week, more than 1,000 people are buying
annuities and those transactions are irreversible. Once bought, you
cannot change your mind and getting the right one can be the equivalent
of an extra £1,500 in savings. With respect to the FCA, it 
<?notus-xml column=974?>hardly needs another competition market study
to find out why consumers do not shop around. The problem is
that the pension companies which sell them are simply not
doing enough to explain to people that they can shop
around.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140226114000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000053">When
this amendment was debated in Grand Committee the Minister used the
same diversionary tactic as Steve Webb, the Pensions Minister, did in
the Commons and as the Minister who responded to the Westminster Hall
debate on annuities did too. Depressingly, I fear that the Minister can
be expected to repeat that argument today. It is all very
well to suggest that those reaching retirement age can do
many other things—other than plan for an annuity—but it
is insufficient, in the face of the continued mass selling of
inappropriate annuities, to say to people that they have many different
opportunities and need lots of different advice beyond annuities. The
fact is that the variety in the annuities offered and the deals
available is considerable. Those people—1,000 of them each
week—need independent support and advice right now.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226114000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000054">The need for
independent advice at this point may be obvious but the reasons for it
are worth repeating. First, on the complexity of choosing the right
annuity option, annuities are a complex product and decumulation is a
complex process. Comparison between the providers is difficult. Before
we debated this in Committee, I saw a quote for an annuity pot of only
£30,000. In one short e-mail the following terms were contained:
single life, level escalation, anticipated bonus rates and required
smooth return rates—every single one of which was without an
explanation. It offered four choices to a “conventional lifetime
quotation” annuity described as income-choice annuity or
with-profit annuity, and out of nine total options the rates varied
between £700 and £1,400, with most around the
£1,200 mark. It is no wonder, with such complexity, that no one
should exercise a choice without advice; and so it is no wonder that
over 50% of people just go with their existing
provider<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

website has been launched. This is a step in the right direction.
However, the independent pensions consultant, Ros Altmann, who gave
evidence to the Commons committee, did not think that it was simple.
She said that it was disappointing and not easy to use. Annuities are
complex products with multi-options and perhaps there never can be a
simple comparison

this point I intend to repeat questions that I posed to the Minister in
Grand Committee. They demand answers from the Government, to explain
their resistance to this amendment, and they were not answered when we

the Minister accept that annuities are complex and that people need
independent advice? Does he accept that purchasing that
advice is beyond the grasp of most people, particularly
those with no knowledge of investments? If he does so accept, how does
he suggest that those who need this advice now can be
guaranteed to get
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T18:41:31"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

the variety in the kinds of annuities offered and the deals that people
can get is bewildering. The NAPF and others have said that annuitising
with the pension scheme provider pays on average 20% less
than shopping around. In effect, inertia, or being 
overwhelmed 
<?notus-xml column=975?>by the complexity of making a choice, is exploited by pension providers.
Insurers are making excessive profits from purchasers failing to shop
around. On “Newsnight”, Ros Altmann said that if you had
an annuity with the worst performers you would have
to live until you were 100 to get back just what you had
paid in.</hs_para>

as I say, is a powerful force that results in
excess profits for insurers. They penalise you, not reward
you, for loyalty. Estimates suggest that £1 billion
of retirement income is being lost to savers every year just by
the force of inertia. The report of the FCA Consumer
Panel—the FSCP—was published in December and made many
points. I have drawn on these points before in

the tactics used by insurance companies and brokers were
“tantamount to burglary” of old-age pensioners. The
report said that it is nearly impossible for pensioners to know whether
they are getting a good deal. Pensioners are hit by excessive profits
and exploitative pricing. Insurance companies are making 20 times more
profits on annuities than any other financial product. As for poor
returns, on a pot of £100,000 Clerical Medical offers
£4,664 per annum while Reliance Mutual offers £6,111.

for opaque charges, brokers are incentivised to sell particular
products; in some cases they make 6%, or £12,000, on a pot of
£200,000. There are sharp practices with brokers shopping
around, resulting in a referral fee from each. Many also have
exploitative pricing; that is, they have sold a product for a fit
person when they are not fit, or an adviser neglects to tell people of
other products such as income drawdown because the profit margins are
slimmer. Companies can make £35,000 profit over 25 years on a
pot of £100,000. I have to say that that was the finding of the
report, although the figure was denied by the ABI. The ABI has not,
however, said what profit is
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000062">As your
Lordships will be aware, the Pensions Minister, Steve Webb,
commissioned a review of annuities from the FCA which reported last
week. To no one’s surprise, the FCA concluded that the annuities
market was not working. It was “disorderly”, according to
the FCA’s chief executive, and the watchdog’s report
suggested that four out of five consumers could get a higher income by
just shopping around. To many people’s frustration and
disappointment, after this extensive review the FCA said that it would
launch a further review, a competition market study, to find out what
we all already know. Consumers will now have to wait many more months
for this second-stage investigation before regulatory action of some
description can be started. In the face of 1,000 people a week still
making this irreversible decision, that is not good
enough.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000063">People
who have gone without, who have diligently saved throughout their

the FSCP’s word, by a profit-hungry industry and its associated
sales force. Annuities are building up to be the next scandal and

out. We need to strengthen the buyer side, and Parliament needs to take
action on behalf of savers. If we do not sort out
annuities we will undermine auto-enrolment.

pension policy where the buyer deals directly with the provider and
makes choices. With independent support these choices will be better
informed choices. Access to an independent service will protect savers
from making poor choices that could reduce their income by up to 20%.

come to the core of why this amendment is not the right response.
Indeed, it is rather funny that the noble Lord was quoting examples of
sharp practice, with brokers shopping around and not
informing their clients of the income drawdown. This is the point
about, “While there is a problem, this is not the
solution”. Making annuity brokers the first port of call for all
would simply create a captive market for one part of the
industry without effectively adding to consumer protections. Annuity
brokers, unless they are also FCA-regulated advisers, are not required
to ensure that the product is suitable for the consumer. I must be
absolutely clear on this point: this measure would not
provide the member with regulated advice. The Financial Services
Consumer Panel recently published a report identifying a
number of risks for the consumer in going down the
non-advised route.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226114000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000072">This measure would
therefore push people down a brokerage route and could lead to the next
mis-selling crisis, not help to avoid it, as the noble Lord suggested.
The amendment as it stands would mean that people would be been pushed
into receiving non-regulated advice and might end up locked into
unsuitable products without recourse to the protections that regulated
advice affords. Furthermore, the measure focuses almost exclusively on
annuities; it makes reference to information on alternative
at-retirement products, but it has to be recognised that annuity
brokers are not necessarily impartial—they make their money if a
member buys an annuity. Indeed, that is a point that the noble Lord
made in his own
speech.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000073">This
Government’s position is that it is essential for people to
understand all their options, not just annuities, and to work with
relevant bodies to ensure that appropriate help is available. Clearly,
our work is not complete. However, we do not believe that this
amendment, pushing people down a single product path, is the
right solution. We are committed to ensuring that consumers have the
information that they need to make good choices and that the annuities
market works effectively for consumers. It is ongoing work but we will
continue to challenge the industry if there is no significant
improvement. The Financial Conduct Authority’s review findings
will be vital in that
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000074">While
I welcome the debate, which is clearly an important one, this amendment
would not deliver what the Opposition actually want. It
risks making things worse for the consumer. It would legislate to make 
<?notus-xml column=978?>annuities the foremost option for deriving a
retirement income when this may actually not be the right route for
many, especially those with small pots. It would put the responsibility
for providing information to members solely in the hands of annuity
brokers, leaving many without the protections afforded by regulated
advice. As I said, if that is not a potential mis-selling scandal, I
would like to know what is.</hs_para>

use of the word “burglary”, which is not one that comes
easily to a Scottish lawyer because we in Scotland have no such

burglary. I deploy the word because it is evocative but also because it
describes quite well what is going on.</hs_para>

Minister for setting out the Government’s ambition in this
regard, which is far-reaching, complicated and, I understand,
ambitious, but the scandal continues. While we discuss the complexity
of all this and indeed add further complexities to it, 1,000 people a
week, most probably through inertia, are buying annuities, many of
which are tantamount to burglary of their savings. We are suggesting
with this amendment that we must do what we can to try to stem that
process, while all the other complex things that need to be
done—I accept the detail and the challenge of that—can be
done. The scale of the scandal demands a deep and wide perspective of
responses; I accept that. However, there is something we can do about
this. Given that these people are going down this path without
independent advice, the purpose of the amendment is to get them access
to that information and that service so that they can make
choices.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140226114000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000079">I
now come, in just a few sentences, to the core issue that the Minister
used as his principal push-back against this amendment. I suspect that
he did not read all of the amendment carefully enough. Had he got as
far as proposed new subsection (3), he would have seen that all this
advice has to be best practice, defined by the Pensions Regulator after
public consultation—a form of regulation—and that that
process has to be subject to a continuing review. It was intended, in
the flexible sort of way in which I have got used to this Government
working, to provide a process of engagement, discussion and
consultation that allowed best practice to develop in this area and to
improve the performance of those people who provide independent annuity
brokerage services. This is a model that I have learnt, in my time in
your Lordships’ House, from the conduct of the coalition
Government. I commend it to the Minister, I commend it to the House and

noble Lords will be aware, we are proposing to change the compensation
cap in the Pension Protection Fund to recognise long service in a
scheme. The standard cap shall be increased by 3% for each year of
pensionable service over 20 years. Schedule 20 contains most of the
provisions needed to implement the long-service cap. However, some
technical amendments are needed to reflect particular situations and I
shall address them in groups.</hs_para>

deal with the identification of pensionable service for certain
individuals—obviously an important issue, given that the
long-service cap kicks in once a person has 21 years of service.
For example, a person who has been a member of a scheme for
10 years has that amount of pensionable service. However,
they might also have transferred into that scheme a pension built up in
a previous employment. Where the PPF has deemed service, say 15 years,
in respect of this transfer, these amendments will permit the two
periods to be added together so that the individual will be treated as
if they had 25 years’ service in total.</hs_para>

deal with a scheme in the process of assessment when the legislation
commences, where the scheme applies for the decision not to transfer
the scheme to the PPF to be reconsidered. While the 
<?notus-xml column=982?>application is being considered, the current cap
will apply for the purposes of assessing the scheme’s protected

the Government tabled a new clause, now Clause 50, dealing with the
compensation cap. As my noble friend Lord Bates explained at the time,
the clause was needed to ensure that the legislation reflects the
policy and current practice when applying the compensation cap
separately to compensation based on benefits deriving from different
sources which are payable on the same day—for example, where an
individual has entitlement to a pension but also a pension
credit deriving from a divorce settlement. Clause 50 has a
retrospective effect so as to cover payments already made. However, it
applies only to cases where the two benefits were payable on the same
date.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000087">Amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:12:41"></hs_TimeCode>
41 is needed to provide retrospective cover in cases where compensation
derived from different sources is payable on different dates. It
modifies the relevant provision of the Pensions Act 2004 to allow us to
bring forward regulations that have a retrospective effect, so that
such payments already made in accordance with the accepted policy and
practice are covered.</hs_para>

(b) relates to the operation of private pension schemes. Given the

our views on whether the private pensions system is working well; I
think that we all know that there are challenges. Some of the changes
that are needed, such as to the annuity market, may well need primary
legislation, but many will not. The review will take the opportunity to
look at whether the various changes, legislative or not, which the

to the concerns expressed by many women born between 6 April 1951 and
April 1953. I am sure that all noble Lords have had many
communications from women in that category who are affected. In Grand
Committee, the Minister was pressed by various noble Lords, including
my noble friend Lady Hollis and the noble Lord, Lord Paddick, 
<?notus-xml column=985?>to be clear as to whether or not this cohort of
women would be better or worse off under the new system. The assumption
of the Government is that they will be better off, but I never got a
satisfactory response to the question I posed in Committee as to why
the Government think that women born between 1951 and 1953 are better
off under existing arrangements, and yet also claim that women will
mostly be better off under the new pension arrangements. I still do not
quite understand how both can be right. The amendment asks the
Government to report to Parliament on the actual impact of these
provisions, rather than simply relying on analysis of what the impact
is likely to be.</hs_para>

on the need for a review of the knowledge of young people of the
system. Young people currently face a challenging work environment with
high youth unemployment, the potential for high debts if they go to
university and astonishingly high rents. We may safely conclude that,
for most of them, concern about living in poverty in their dotage is
not chief among their concerns, so a call to start contributing to an
auto-enrolled pension may not ring loud. Yet that is of course the very
best time to address those
concerns.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000097">Better

underpinning the Bill is that people should have a state pension that
is simple to understand and that they should take responsibility for
saving for their old age through work-based pensions. We also need to
have it acknowledged today that the state owes a duty of care to the
large numbers coming under auto-enrolment. In light of the broad
consensus that industry must improve its standards and reduce its
charges, its progress towards that should be monitored by Parliament.
The amendment sets out a method of parliamentary scrutiny to ensure
that we have got it right and that the Pensions Bill will last us, as
the Minister aspires, for decades to come. As there will be an election
before enactment—and, of course, a change of Government, one

can be under any misapprehension that the Government value extremely
highly the role of evidence, analysis, consultation and evaluation in
policy-making. Our approach to designing this once-in-a-generation
package of pension reforms has been heavily informed by a robust and
wide-ranging evidence base. However, looking at the text of the
amendment and its 
<?notus-xml column=986?>timing, I must make clear that the provisions on the
new state pension, and many of the other provisions in the Bill, will
simply not have been commenced by spring next year—the time used
in this amendment. Therefore, all that would come out of such an
amendment would be a rehash of the information that has already been
provided to Parliament: there would be nothing to add. We have no
particular objection to this amendment in terms of sentiment, but its

said, that a set of reforms of this nature is accompanied by a
strategic approach to monitoring at sensible intervals. I am not saying
anything that noble Lords will disagree with when I state that pensions
is a very long-term policy area, and that the impact of many measures

recipients of benefits, what is happening with pension credit, and so

give particular attention to the two groups mentioned by my noble

that they have missed out on something important with this.
If the Government turn out to be right, and they are better off under
the current system, it is important not just that the Government find
that out but that they share that knowledge as widely as possible. If
that is the case, those women will be reassured—and, if not,
they have a right to know anyway. Can the Minister also look
at the position of those who would have been affected by,
for example, the removal of derived rights, and whether the
transitional protections are working well for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:27:06"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226114000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226114000112">Secondly,
as well as all the work that has been done to an appropriate timescale,
will the Minister give some thought to how that might best be shared
with the House? The proceedings have been very good as the Bill has
moved through Parliament. A lot of issues have been raised—in
this House in particular—and a lot of expertise has been brought
to bear on this, and we have all learnt a lot from the process. Having
done that, rather than have the results of it disappear into the
department, marvellous as it is, it would be helpful if they could come
back out so that we can all learn from that, both for the Bill and for
future legislation. However, I will take his assent to those marvellous
suggestions as read, and on the basis of that—and because he
asked so nicely—I beg leave to withdraw this

been dashed. That was based on one conclusion of the report: it was
unlikely that prefunded products to pay for long-term care would
emerge, at least in the immediate future—that is, products that
people had paid for during their working life. I am myself a
journalist, but I am afraid that that really was news only to the
<I>FT</I>. There have been no such products for a very long time, and
they are even less likely in the light of the Dilnot cap on care costs.
The fundamental reasons are very simple: they are supply and demand.
From the point of view of companies providing them, they are very
difficult policies to produce, because they require you to assess many
years in advance how long people will live for, how long they will
claim off the policies for and how much the cost will be. That is on
top of all the usual problems of moral hazard with any insurance
product. To put it technically, they are virtually impossible to
price.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="140226119000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226119000004">Even
if those products
were<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:30:12"></hs_TimeCode> on offer,
who on earth will buy them? We know that people during their working
lives do not much care to think about their last years of life. We know
that roughly only one in three people go into residential care and are
therefore most likely to benefit from prefunded products, and we know
from talking to independent financial advisers that if you try to raise
this sort of product with people during their working lives, they are
not interested. They are interested in their pensions, yes, but not in
care products. So they have never been a possibility and nothing in the
Government’s plans has ever assumed that they were a possibility
or were going to happen. If I were an insurance salesman, which thank
God I am not, I reckon that I would have a better chance at selling
heating to the denizens of hell than I would of selling these products

the real story in the account, which is that there are two classes of
product that are saleable and suitable and would supplement the
recommendations of Dilnot as interpreted by the Government. One is
point-of-use products whereby, if I go into a home tomorrow, I can
insure myself so that my care costs are covered, however long I live.
The second product is the enhanced annuity—that is, I start off
with one pension and then, as I develop greater care needs, that
pension is enhanced. I want to say a word or two on each of those
products, which are essential in complementing the Dilnot
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:31:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226119000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226119000006">Point-of-use
policies already exist. It is a small and specialised market, with
about 7,000 policies extant and about 1,000 sold a year with three
firms providing them. However, very few elderly people know of their
existence. That is a point that I shall return to later—not, I
think, greatly to the Minister’s surprise. They have a very
important part to play in the Dilnot settlement. Dilnot caps costs at
£72,000, or at least that is the story. But in reality, for many
of the better-off people who go into a residential home it does not cap
costs at £72,000 at all. They have to pay £12,000 in
living costs on top of the £72,000 but, more importantly, that
is £72,000 at the rate that a local authority will pay for a
home. To cite the example of someone whom I know and love, who is in a
home in Oxford that costs roughly £1,000 a week, she is
marvellously cared for but the local authority will not fund
£500 so there will not be £500 to count towards the cap.
If she wants to protect herself so that she can stay in that home for
the rest of her life, as she would like, one way in which she can
ensure that is by buying one of the private policies. But Ministers
have spoken rather with forked tongues about this. I do not mean the
Minister here in particular, but Ministers from the Prime Minister
onwards, who have tried to obfuscate the fact that the cap covers only
the cost of a home at the rate provided by the local authority. Really,
the Government have to come clean with the public about what the cap is
so that they can protect themselves, and know that they need to protect
themselves, if they wish

lot of difficult issues here. For example, there could be tax
difficulties. If you have an enhanced annuity that raises your income
to a level where you are paying higher rate tax, that would be quite a
difficulty. Indeed, the tax situation on these annuities is not
altogether clear, partly because the Inland Revenue likes to ensure
that annuities are taxed. Although they are allowed to rise in line
with prices, they are not necessarily allowed to rise in line with
needs. The Government have more work to do before those policies can be
safely marketed, sold and developed as they should be to help people as
their needs

conclude with two final sine qua nons—I am sorry, that is
naughty. I have used two Latin tags in one speech, but your
Lordships’ House will forgive me if nowhere else will. Those
sine qua nons must be met if the financial services industry is to
fulfil its potential as a complement to the post-Dilnot world and not
as a substitute for the government cap or assuming that the Government
will pay for everything, which is the world that we are, thank God,
finally leaving.</hs_para>

regulation. I am afraid that I could speak for a long time on that but,
fortunately, this is a time-limited debate. In particular, I am not
convinced that the standards required of independent financial advisers
operating in this field are sufficiently high. Too many advisers sell
too much on the basis of too little knowledge. The standards are simply
not high enough. I exempt, as of course I would, SOLLA-qualified
advisers, who are very fully trained and equipped—but others are
not<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:36:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226119000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226119000010">There
is also a worry that needs a good deal of thought, and I do not have
the solution to this one yet. There is something about in the industry
that I would call the fear of FOS—the Financial Ombudsman
Service. Many advisers who could play a very useful role for society
and themselves by getting into this business are frightened that,
although they sell the policies reasonably honestly, they will be found
to have mis-sold them by FOS and will be forced to pay huge amounts in
compensation. That is something that the Government need to look at, to
see if any reassurance can be provided if we are to have the advisers
available to provide the advice that people
need<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:36:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226119000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226119000011">The
second sine qua non is the provision of information from the Government
about precisely what the scheme does and does not offer as well as what
it remains for individuals to provide for themselves. Does that make
three Latin tags? On the subject of information, we made very good
progress during the passage of the care Bill, and I thank the Minister
and his ministerial colleagues for being so open-minded about this. The
Government are committed to a national information campaign and to
monitoring progress in public understanding, as well as to obliging
local authorities to play their part in what we hope will emerge as a
holistic system of advice and information. But the devil lies in the
detail. I think that it is on balance right that the detail is not in
the Bill, but getting the rules absolutely right is essential and
giving local authorities the resources that they need to fulfil their
advice functions is also
essential<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226119000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226119000012">There
are also in the advice field complexities entirely of the
Government’s own making. It is absolutely crackers to have one
date on which the deferred payment scheme is introduced, whereby people
do not have to sell their house, and a quite separate date when the
Dilnot scheme comes into effect. Can noble Lords imagine how in that
intervening year a financial adviser is to explain, let alone provide
sound advice, to a client? It is simply impossible. What happens if
someone comes to him a few weeks before the new benefit rules come into
effect? Does he tell them to take out a deferred payment or not, when
that benefits scheme may pay a lot of those costs? This is simply mad.
The Minister will be glad to hear that if he agrees to reconsider his
policy on this—and I hope that he will discuss it with his
colleagues—the Government would actually save a bit of
money<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:38:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226119000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226119000013">I
conclude as I began. The private financial services market has an
important role to play as a supplement to Dilnot and providing a
holistic system of support, particularly in helping people who have
saved hard all their lives to make sure that they protect the assets
that they wish to leave to their children. However, although 
<?notus-xml column=991?>we have passed the Bill and it is passing
through another place, there is still much work for the

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted to join
in this discussion, particularly as the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, has
made many important points. I am glad to hear that he is on the Equity
Release Council’s advisory board. Equity release is something
people know very little about; they are suspicious of it and distrust
it because they do not understand it. Equity release schemes will have
to prove themselves if they are to satisfy
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:40:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000002">I
first debated a cap in connection with care costs years ago and I think
that the relevant figure at that time was less than £10,000,
which shocked me a bit. Even now it is less than £24,000, so it
is appropriate that Dilnot has proposed a much more realistic figure
for our times. However, a great difficulty arises as regards financial
products and older people. In earlier times, older people could get a
bridging loan from their bank. Now it does not matter what your assets
are, the banks will give nothing at all if you are over 75, and some
banks will not give anything to people over 70. They do not want to
know you if you are in that age group. They will give you a loan if you
want to buy something to rent but, if you want to use the money to
cover your own future needs, despite the fact that they can easily
recoup it from the sale of the property when you die, they do not want
to
know<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:41:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000003">In
many parts of the country, particularly London, many elderly people are
capital-rich but have only a very small income. If they wish to remain
in their own home, they have to find a means to raise money. At the
moment, equity release or insurance seem to be the only two available
options. Kensington and Chelsea is cited as having more people who have
lived in their home for more than 50 years than anywhere else in the
UK. When I came to London, I rented a flat near Portobello Road. The
porter of the block lived in a small house in Portobello Road. Those
houses were selling in the 1950s for £750. As a sitting tenant,
the porter was offered his for £450, which, sadly, he could not
afford. Today, those same houses are selling for well over £2
million. If a mansion tax is introduced, the residents will be liable
for that tax. Tremendous social upheaval would be caused if people who
have been in their house for 50 years suddenly have to find ways to
release cash in order to stay there. I have asked equity release
organisations whether those people could use equity release for that
purpose and was told that they could. However, if they do so, there
will be less money available to pay for their care. Moreover, the
relevant bodies are willing to provide only a certain amount given that
risk is the big factor in all financial transactions now. Everyone
wants to avoid risk and we want to be sure that the banks are sound.
They are risk-averse, so the whole thing is very
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:42:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000004">As
I say, the public do not know enough about equity release, and
regulation is very important. I was interested to hear the comments of
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, on regulation. There are good regulations
in this field—for example, the regulated home reversion plans,
sale and rent back plans and home purchase 
<?notus-xml column=992?>plans. The ombudsman scheme to which he is referred is, I am pleased to
say, free for the complainant, which is important. People are still a
bit rattled by what happened at the Co-op, which everyone had thought
was so sound. However, the regulator regulates standards of behaviour,
not of pricing. We need to be sure that equity release does not end up
like the payday loan scheme and rip people off in a big
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:43:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000005">The
Financial Services Authority was replaced in April last year by the
Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, so
a lot of these matters are still regulated, but are the Government
satisfied that the systems in place are sufficiently hands-on to cope
not only with existing problems but those that might arise when the
schemes to which I have referred get
going<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:44:11"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000006">I
meet people who bought their flats years ago in what were then council
blocks—some, indeed, who did so in the days of Mrs Thatcher.
Obviously, the value of those flats has increased hugely over that
time. However, when the right to buy council flats was introduced,
purchasers had the right to sell their flats back to the council if
they needed money. The councils were happy to buy those flats as it
cost them less to do that than to build new ones. However, no such
provision is available now. The flats have all been farmed off to
housing associations and housing organisations that operate schemes for
the local councils, which has made life much more complicated. I hear
of people who are on a pension of £170 a week but are required
to pay their share of roof repairs costing £12,000 or
£13,000, which is more than their income, so these issues are
difficult to assess. It is tremendously difficult for people to assess
whether or not they can afford to meet the costs of their care, their
daily living costs and the costs of staying in their own home.
Furthermore, elderly people in particular know their way round their
own property and are safer in their own property than when they move to
another one. People do not fall down and break a hip in a place they
have lived in for years; that happens in the new place they move to.
Therefore, if people do not require full-time residential care, there
is great merit in staying in their own
home<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:45:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000007">I
suggest that we need a free, independent advice service. However, that
is no good unless skilled staff run it. It is useless if people think
that they are getting good advice only to find that the person to whom
they are talking knows less about the issue than they do themselves.
This issue is a huge project for the future. The Government cannot
think that it is resolved, all sorts of problems will come up that we
do not even envisage now. The financial services can, and should, do a
lot more in this area and should adopt a positive approach. It is a
difficult situation as anyone running a financial services organisation
is torn between satisfying the Government that they are risk-free and
have plenty of spare capital, and satisfying the people who would like
to avail themselves of funds from a reliable source, who then find the
whole issue is much more complicated than they

am told that there is far greater confidence in the equity release
market at present. Recent figures indicate growth of 12% since last
year, with £473 million of housing wealth unlocked in the first
six months of last

in home equity that could be released under equity release
products. That is interesting and the release of that money makes
sense, but only if it can be handled in a sound way that protects the
consumer and helps people. I think that the Government support the

Brinton (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord,
Lord Lipsey, on securing this important debate that joins together
progress in health and social care for the elderly and how our
financial services can help deliver this from 2016—two
years’ time—in the wake of the Dilnot commission

rising cost of care, however, has become an increasingly worrying
issue. Two years ago, the commission estimated that the cost of the
reforms was approximately £1.7 billion. Inevitably with an
ageing society and limited resources, the state does not have
sufficient funds to meet the increasing demand of social care for the
ageing and disabled population. As Bruno Geiringer
noted,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="140226124000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000058">“with

we have heard from other speakers, currently, individuals are meeting
costs by drawing down equity from their housing assets,
purchasing insurance, or taking from their pension funds. Where they do
not have access to these sources, many have to sell their
property, while still alive, to fund their nursing care,
but, frankly, this is such a hard decision at a very difficult time in
people’s lives as they face reducing their independence and
losing their home. It is evident that there is,
or will be, a market for the financial services
to support the older generation. With a cap on
the individual’s lifetime contribution, this can be much more
clearly defined than under the present
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000012">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:49:38"></hs_TimeCode>
challenge is that the financial services industry must take greater
initiative in funding these reforms. Several key financial products,
some of which have been mentioned, are possible sources of funding. The
disability linked annuity works by reducing the income of an otherwise
flat annuity, but then doubles or trebles the income once care is
required. In marketing this product, customers need to be aware of the
tax treatment of annuities because they are treated as pay as you earn
under current pension taxation rules. The second source of funding is
products linked to housing assets. Many people fund their social care
by utilising a portion of their housing equity to meet costs by either
downsizing or taking out loans that are secured on their house, payable
on death. The third source is linked to insurance. There is an
opportunity for critical illness or life insurance policies to cover
care costs. Similarly, top-up insurance can also assist individuals in
the amount they spend on general living.</hs_para>

no providers currently offer pre-funded insurance, mainly because there
is a lack of demand for it. This is why pre-funded insurance products
have failed in the past, and consequently are no longer available on
the market. However, such products could fit the new profile needed to
fund social care in the future. I ask the Minister, if these insurance
products are indeed beneficial in covering care costs, how can the
Government help the industry stimulate demand for the products? A
potential alternative to the previous options is a deferred payment
scheme. Under this, people could pay insurance fees after they have
died. This works by taking a portion of an individual’s life
insurance and applying it towards paying for care fees.</hs_para>

the potential of these products, there are many concerns
that have been raised by both the Dilnot commission and the Government.
As I have outlined, some products exist but face low take-up due to
demand-side barriers, including reputational issues, a lack of public
awareness, and the cost and complexity of the products. I am sorry to
say that reputational issues have led to a loss of trust by many people

then, that we address issues related to engagement barriers in an
effort to encourage people to seek private sector solutions. We must

too late.</hs_parafo>

already established an expert working group that will involve the
Government, the financial services sector, local authorities and the
care sector. It is exploring ways in which individuals can best be
directed to truly independent financial advisers, and will build links
with pension benefits and other services. However, it is shocking that
out of 53,000 self-funders in residential care only 7,000 received
financial application advice in 2009. This may be a possible
explanation as to why one in four self-funders ran out of money and
sought help from the state. Clearly, there is a necessity for the
support of financial industry in the form of products and advice. The
Department of Health expects the financial services industry to respond
by 2016. However, that is only two years away and most financial
products take between five and 10 years to design before they come to
market, let alone general take-up. I therefore ask the Minister, if
this is the case, then where are these financial products and where is
the early launch of information and advice to reassure the public on
the adequacy of these financial options?</hs_para>

conclude, there are too many individuals unaware of the social costs
related to healthcare and the ability of financial services to help
them finance costs. Although there is broad consensus that action needs
to be taken, there is also a real fear that the commission’s
recommendations could be left to rot because of the lack of products.
This issue must be dealt with now because the financial services
industry has the potential to minimise the full-scale effect of these
costs on the lives of the ageing and disabled population. Equally
importantly, it will remove the lottery of how much people have to pay

Greengross (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I add my congratulations to the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, on securing this debate and pointing out so
much that still needs to be done to fulfil the potential of the Dilnot
recommendations. While we all regret the fact that it does not seem
that long-term care products will be available for some
time—perhaps that was predictable and perhaps we all knew
that—we have been encouraged by the Government’s decision
in its Care Bill largely to accept the Dilnot commission
recommendations for a cap to be created for an individual’s
lifetime contributions towards their social care costs. That represents
an important starting point from which new care funding solutions can
begin to
emerge<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T19:55:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226124000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000022">An important outcome
from those reforms for the industry would be the long-term stability
and sustainability of the social care funding framework. A stable state
framework should give consumers the confidence to invest in solutions
to pay for their share of care costs. It will also have a positive
impact on providers’ willingness to enter the market. However,
much of the detail around the operation of the cap, in particular the
modus operandi of the benefit eligibility criteria, as the noble Lord,
Lord Lipsey pointed out, will be clear only when the promised guidance
finally emerges from the Department of Health. It would be helpful if
we had a better idea about the timetable for the appearance of that
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000023">The
legislation itself will not deliver a new care funding option unless it
first creates the right environment in which new markets for care
funding products can develop. Accordingly, I warmly welcome the new
statement of intent between the Association of British Insurers and the
Government. That is an important step in the process of helping people
to plan and prepare for the costs of long-term care. From my
perspective, an important element of that statement is the declaration
that there will be a joint initiative to raise public awareness of the
reforms in advance of 2015. In the absence of such an effective
information and education campaign, possibly run in conjunction with a
campaign on pensions awareness, low consumer understanding about the
realities of care funding—as the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton,
pointed out—will continue to reduce the demand for new care
funding options, which the financial services industry could
potentially develop products to
meet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000024">Currently,
for those who can afford them, immediate needs annuities are the only
products dedicated to care fees funding. These guarantee an income for
life to 
<?notus-xml column=996?>fund care costs in return for a one-off premium. In the continued
absence of any form of pre-funded long-term care insurance products, it
is to be hoped that products such as disability-linked annuities and
vehicles that combined care insurance with other protection insurance
options—the so-called care conversion and hybrid protection
products—will emerge. We should do all we can to encourage such
innovations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000025">Unless
local authorities, as part of their mandate to establish a competent
local information service, have effective processes in place to refer
future consumers—who are already emerging and may require
appropriate regulated financial advice—perhaps to members of
SOLLA, who are reliable and can give them the correct information, not
only will the information programme be wasted but many consumers will
not get the outcome their sensible considerations and planning merit.
Some reassurance from the Minister on both the information programme
and service would be helpful. I hope that he can give that assurance to
us.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140226124000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000026">For
people with property assets, one of the routes to funding care fees
that emerges may be based on the current equity release products, as we
have heard. For example, only yesterday the think tank Demos launched a
research report which explored the possibility of helping customers to
ring-fence a proportion of their housing equity to help them to meet
their long-term care costs in later life. It is also important to
remember that, while the proposed extension of local authority deferred
payment schemes is positive, these are complex financial arrangements
with long-term consequences. In many ways they are very similar to
fully FCA-regulated equity release products but without the
accompanying consumer protection and redress
features<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:00:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

information and advice campaign must be aligned with that on pensions;
secondly, the guidelines should be consulted upon, and eligibility
criteria and the level of need should be thought about again—it
is really important that we build in some protection for
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:00:46"></hs_TimeCode>—and,
thirdly, eligibility criteria should, I think, be national rather than
local so that minimum standards are guaranteed and could be exceeded
locally but not lowered.</hs_para>

older population has within it people of all different shapes and sizes
with different aspirations and needs, and a one-size-fits-all solution
is inappropriate. I end by echoing the aspirations of the statement of
intent, in that all of us must continue to work together to help people
to better plan, better prepare and better save for care costs. We must
spare no effort in seeking to identify the best care funding solutions
for all our different people of all ages and

referred to the statement of intent and to the difficulties that the
industry has encountered in producing policies, for the reasons that he
set out. 
<?notus-xml column=997?>We have studied the statement of intent with care. I noted that the

fact:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="140226124000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000057">“In

one admires more than me the Department of Health but it does seem to
have taken rather a long time for this to have been reported. I should
have thought that it would have been more helpful to noble Lords if it

<I>Financial Times</I><I>—</I>but I do not think that my noble
friend was surprised. As he said, he does not really hold out much hope
that there will be a market in the future in the way that noble Lords
have been talking about tonight: first, as he said, because of the
difficulty of pricing products due to the uncertainties in the years
ahead, and, secondly, because of the reluctance of most of us to buy
those products even if the industry were certain of being able to put
them on the market. I should be interested to know whether the noble
Earl agrees with my noble friend’s analysis or whether he is
more optimistic. If he is more optimistic, then
why<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:03:51"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="140226124000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000032">However, my noble
friend pointed to what he described as two saleable products: first,
point of use and, secondly, enhanced annuities. He felt that those were
essential to underpin the Dilnot proposals. I do not want to go over
old ground but I agree with my noble friend and other noble Lords that
the real problem for us is that, while we obviously welcome the
foundations laid in the Care Bill, the fact is that it does not really
produce what we originally thought it would—a clear cap that
people can understand. We have the £72,000 cap but, in reality,
we know that it is much higher. There is the £12,000 per annum
living cost and there is also the fact that the £72,000 cap is
related to what the local authority will pay. We know that private
funders pay more than that, and there are many suggestions that private
funders are subsidising people funded by the local authority. Whether
that will survive the transparency that will come in a few
years’ time, I very much doubt. We argued and debated this when
we discussed the Care
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:05:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226124000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000033">I know the nursing
home that my noble friend referred to because my mother has instructed
me that, if she has to go into a nursing home, that will be the one to
which she goes. She sized it up and everyone in Oxford knows that it is
a very good nursing home. However, £50,000 a
year—£1,000 a week—is much higher than the local
authority will be paying for the people for whom it will be
responsible. Therefore, in essence, the cap will be much higher than
£72,000. I agree with my noble friend that the Government need
to come clean on this. We will not get the certainty that is required
or achieve the required literacy among ourselves and other people
unless it is clear what the likely liability is going to be for many of
us and our
relatives<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:06:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two further points. The first concerned regulation. He is not convinced
that the standards required of independent financial advisers are
sufficient. This is worrying. Noble Lords will have received very
interesting briefings for this debate from the Equity Release Council
and the Just Retirement organisation. The Just Retirement briefing
refers to polling that it commissioned, conducted by YouGov. It found
that when individuals were asked where they would go for information or
advice on how best to pay if they needed to organise professional care,
one in five chose their local council, a similar number chose a CAB and
almost a fifth said that they would go to the National Health
Service—I am not sure whether that is advised, but there we
go.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226124000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000035">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:07:17"></hs_TimeCode>,
interestingly, the poll also revealed that when people were informed
that they would face a large care bill before reaching the cap, almost
two-thirds recognised the need for professional financial advice. That
is encouraging as long as we can be sure that the independent
professional advice is of a high order. I share my noble
friend’s concerns that this is very variable, and I am not sure
that the regulatory context in which those providing the advice operate
will deliver the goods.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226124000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000036">The second point that
my noble friend raised comes back to being clear about what people are
liable for. There are continuing concerns about the role of local
authorities in this and their capacity to deliver. I am still concerned
about their ability to undertake assessments when the new clock starts,
and I have not been convinced that local authorities really do have the
capacity to do the job effectively. However, that then raises the
question of the nature of the very welcome campaign that the
Government, as a result of our debates, have agreed
to.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140226124000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000037">A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:09:03"></hs_TimeCode>
national public awareness campaign is very important, but it has to be
done with effectiveness and vigour. I wonder whether the noble Earl
will be able to say a little more about how the campaign is going to be
organised, what the budget will be, when it will be launched, how long
it will run for and what partner organisations his department will work
with. I refer him again to a poll by Just Retirement, which found that
nearly one-third of those aged 55 and over believe that councils pay
most of the cost, with individuals topping up the rest, while 40%
believe that individuals pay most, with councils topping up the
remainder. Many, many people do not understand the liabilities that
they will face. We need to do everything that we can to ensure that
people understand and can get proper advice, and we need to ensure that
where the insurance market has a role to play, that role will be as
effective as possible. This debate, although very short, is very
important if we are to go forward with confidence in terms of Dilnot
and the many liabilities that people are going to have to face in the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_26_PT_1/1E8F33A96060AEACACE800DEF4A4A8A679E79E4F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 26 February 2014">Wednesday,

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by thanking the noble Lord,
Lord Lipsey, for raising this very important issue. I thank equally all
speakers for their contributions to the debate. The noble Lord, Lord
Lipsey, and I have conversed many times of late 
<?notus-xml column=999?>on the Floor of the House about the provisions of
the Care Bill, so I am in no doubt that he is very well
acquainted—perhaps more than most of your Lordships—with
the recommendations of the Dilnot commission on the funding of care and
support. However, for the benefit of others who may not have been
following as closely, I will take a moment or two to refresh our
memories<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:10:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000040">The
commission found that the current system is simply unsustainable and
not fit for purpose. We need to ensure that we have a system that is
sustainable and that people do not face catastrophic care costs. This
is what the reforms we are introducing will do. The commission defined
a new model for funding care and support—a new partnership
between the individual and the state. It suggested that where
individuals can afford to contribute they should do so but that it was
simply not fair to expect people to spend their lifetime savings
meeting the cost of their care. To address this current imbalance we
are putting in place a cap on care costs, as recommended by the
commission, to provide people with an insurance against catastrophic
costs and the fear and worry that these can bring. We are also
extending the means test and, as a result, we will be giving 35,000
more people means-tested support with their care costs immediately when
the system comes
in<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:11:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000041">These
are all ways that the state will be providing additional protection.
However, we must remember that what the commission described was a
partnership, and there are at least two sides to every partnership. It
recommended that where they can afford to do so, individuals should
also contribute. It is just as important, perhaps even more so, to make
sure that we are providing individuals with the support they need to
meet their contribution. We as government are providing flexibility
through the introduction of the universal deferred payment scheme and
additional support through the new Clause 4 duty on local authorities
to provide financial information and advice. I shall say more about
that in a
moment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:12:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000042">We
cannot, however, do this alone. The financial services sector needs to
provide some support, too. The noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, recommended
Ministers to go away and think about a postponement of the deferred
payment scheme. I am sure he would agree with me that the deferred
payment agreements perform a very important function and are one of the
ways in which people can pay for their care more flexibly. Local
authorities, as he is aware, already offer deferred payments. That
gives me grounds for believing, and indeed having confidence in
believing, that they have the ability to implement the universal scheme
in April of next year. Given the fundamental function that these
deferred payment agreements will fulfil, I am very hesitant, if not
reluctant, to consider delaying the universal scheme. However, I will
convey the noble Lord’s views to my honourable friend Norman
Lamb<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:13:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000043">I
should like to address the precise question placed before me by the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. He asked what plans the Government have for
the role of the financial services industry in funding care provision
in the light of the Dilnot commission reforms. My straight answer to
that question would need to be that we have no direct plans because the
industry is independent of 
<?notus-xml column=1000?>government and, as such, we have no control over what it
does. We cannot compel it to play any role, however much we might like
to. I cannot say what plans we have, but I can tell the noble Lord
about the joint work that we have been doing with the industry, our
shared ambitions and our commitment to continue this joint
working—a commitment, incidentally, reinforced by the briefing
issued by the ABI ahead of this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:14:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000044">In
March 2013, the Department of Health invited companies from the
financial services industry to conduct a review of financial products
to fund care—the opportunities that the Care Bill would provide
and the barriers that needed to be overcome for it to flourish. The
review reports were published on 21 January this year, alongside a
joint statement of intent between industry and government, where we
both committed to working together on this agenda. The industry-led
review told us that the introduction of the Care Bill reforms would
largely give us the right conditions for a market of care products to
emerge. I do not think we should overlook the importance of that
finding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:15:33"></hs_TimeCode>.
Further, the reports confirmed that industry saw itself as able to play
an important role in helping people to plan for their care and support
needs—again, a sentiment reinforced by the ABI in its briefing
yesterday<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mean that our job is done. We need to be realistic about what we might
expect, and when. More work needs to be done and there are some
barriers to overcome if we are to see this market take off. Again, I
have no need to familiarise the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, with some of
those barriers. Indeed, he has spoken of them in the debate. Public
awareness of how care is funded is woefully low. We need to build an
understanding, a greater awareness of how the system works and the need
for people to plan and prepare for future care needs—something
that the Government have already committed to do. My noble friend Lady
Brinton asked how demand for financial products could be stimulated. We
need to make sure that there is good information and advice to support
and enable people to make well informed decisions about the types of
care they want to receive and how they can pay for it—something
that we will ensure happens through the new information and advice duty
on local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:16:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000046">To
be successful, an awareness campaign needs to be delivered in
partnership—national and local government working alongside the
wider care sector. We are already working with partners to develop the
right approach. I can tell the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that we
have already embarked on a joint programme with local government to
implement the care and support reforms and that awareness raising will
be an important part of this. The department will co-ordinate the
messages to ensure that a simple, coherent campaign can be delivered
nationally and locally. We are engaging with the voluntary sector, care
providers and the financial services industry to make sure that we can
all play an effective part in communicating these
reforms<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>. The

the sector in the way these reforms are implemented. If we combine our

about what we should expect, I want to be clear that I do not expect a
big bang moment where financial services companies across the country
release hundreds of new products. I want to see a sustainable market
develop, with products which are designed to meet the demands of
customers. These developments will be incremental and are likely to
take some time. That is emphasised in the ABI report, which states that
it will take a much longer period of time before younger people are
encouraged to purchase care products. It also identifies products that
could be adapted and brought to market in the short term. It suggests
that the first step, the quick wins, would be to adapt existing
products such as pension annuities, health insurance and, as my noble
friend Lady Gardner said, equity release, to name but a few. The recent
announcements made in January by a number of leading firms confirm that
the industry is beginning to develop its offer for the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:19:43"></hs_TimeCode>. That is

noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, asked
about the timetable for the guidance. We will consult on the draft
regulations and guidance for the April 2015 reforms in the spring of
this year. We intend to consult on the draft regulations and guidance
for the April 2016 reforms—that is, the cap on care
costs—in the autumn of this year. We have committed to do this
to make sure that they get the scrutiny they require and to give local

noble friend Lady Brinton asked how people could obtain information and
advice about the adequacy of the products they were being offered.
There is a separation of roles here. It should be the role of
government to raise the levels of awareness of how care funding works
and encourage people to plan and 
<?notus-xml column=1002?>prepare—I have already talked about that—but it should not
be for government to recommend or give a gold seal to any financial
product. Advice is regulated precisely because whether something works
or is appropriate is down to individual circumstances. That is why the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, emphasised the point around the expertise of
SOLLA representatives, for
example<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-26T20:21:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226124000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-0002.htm#140226124000051">The
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, suggested that the eligibility
criteria for deferred payments should be national. Eligibility criteria
for deferred payments will be in national regulations to ensure that
there is protection for those people who face having to sell their
homes in their lifetime to pay for care—that is the minimum
offer. Local authorities, however, will have discretion to be more
generous than the minimum offer, and we will consult on all the draft
regulations and guidance that are to come in next year, as I have
mentioned, in the spring of this

noble Lord, Lord Hunt, returned us to the issue of the cap on care
costs and suggested that, in reality, people would find themselves
paying more. I would not seek to argue with the points that he and the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, made. It is a difficult issue. We want to
extend state support for social care to tens of thousands of people who
get little or nothing under the current system and the Care Bill
establishes a legal framework to enable this. We would like to be able
to set a lower cap, which may well be possible in the future, but we
also need to live within the broader economic constraints on public
spending that we currently face. It is a matter of finding that balance
at the current time. We have committed to reviewing this question every
five years to ensure that we continue to get that balance

am optimistic that the financial services industry will step up to the
plate and play a role in helping people to plan for their care costs.
We will encourage it to do so. Our continuing work with the industry is

the framework provides the appropriate balance between ambition and
flexibility. Second, what the next steps should be for the policy

Tuesday 20th July 1982. As members of the Blues &amp; Royals
Regiment of the Household Cavalry rode along South Carriage Drive on
their way to Horse Guards for the Changing of the Guard, a car bomb
exploded. The effect was devastating. Four of the Guard were
murdered—Lieutenant Anthony Daly, who was aged 23,
and Trooper Simon Tipper, who was aged 19, died at the
scene; Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young, who was aged 19, died the
following day; and Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, who was

he was on route to Greece. On his arrest he produced a letter stating

that letter he was charged by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) with
four counts of murder. Before he was charged my consent was sought, as

allegations faced by Mr Downey were of the utmost seriousness. The
bombing was an attempt by the Provisional IRA to bring their terrorist
campaign to London and to attack armed forces personnel who were on
ceremonial duties. Whatever the circumstances in which the letter had
been sent, and it is now clear that its assurances were wrongly given,
it was right that the matter should be tested in court. Neither I nor

turning to the detail of the proposals, I would like to remind the
House of the background to the administration process at Mid Staffs.
Monitor appointed an independent Contingency Planning Team (CPT) to the
trust in October 2012. In January 2013, the CPT concluded in a report
for Monitor that Mid Staffs was neither clinically nor financially
sustainable in its current form. In a subsequent report the CPT advised
that neither the Trust nor local commissioners would be able to deliver
the changes required, and consequently recommended the appointment of
administrators. On the basis of the CPT’s conclusions, Monitor
appointed TSAs to Mid Staffs with effect from 16 April 2013. Since
taking up their role, the TSAs have found no reason to dispute the
CPT’s conclusions regarding the trust’s sustainability,
and their analysis has only strengthened the case for change.</hs_para>

have been working with the trust, local commissioners and providers,

TSAs’ report recommends that Mid-Staffordshire NHS Foundation
Trust is dissolved, and that Stafford and Cannock Chase Hospitals are
operated by other 
<?notus-xml column=107?>local providers. It is vital that this structural change is made as soon
as possible to stabilise local health services. The TSAs have also
proposed a clinical model for the services currently provided by the
trust, which their independent Clinical Advisory Group (made up of
leading clinicians from the Royal Colleges) has confirmed will be
clinically safe. I am pleased that under this model the majority of
patient visits, approximately 90%, will continue to take place at
Stafford and Cannock hospitals. I also welcome the enhancements
proposed for a number of current services, for example, the inclusion
of specialist frail and elderly support within the Medical Assessment
Unit at Stafford. All of this will contribute to a much improved offer

to ensure this improved offer, it is clearly not possible for all of
Mid Staffs’ services to go on as they are, and therefore the
TSAs’ recommendations will mean moving a small minority of
services away from Stafford hospital. Local people can be reassured
that local commissioners would need to be satisfied that there is
sufficient capacity available elsewhere before moving services. In
parallel, I am asking NHS England to identify whether consultant-led
obstetrics could be sustained at Mid Staffs in a safe way in the
future. In doing this, NHS England will work with local commissioners
as part of their wider review of the local health
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226101000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226-wms0001.htm#140226101000031">The
TSAs’ report also identifies the funding required to support
this model and I am satisfied that, in light of intervention from the
NHS Commissioning Board (also known as NHS England) in the form of time
limited funding, and a commitment from commissioners to deliver further
savings during and following implementation, the recommended clinical
model is affordable in the medium term and, subject to the actions of
local commissioners, can be a financially sustainable one. My Rt hon

this basis I am content for the proposals to proceed to implementation.
I would like to emphasise the critical role commissioners have in this
process, and in particular their commissioning freedom to build upon
the TSAs’ recommendations, such as in maternity, where they
consider this is to be sustainable and in the interests of patients.
Local commissioners will also oversee and monitor local service changes
as part of their on-going commissioning responsibilities, including,
where going beyond the recommendations, undertaking further public

2013’s National Infrastructure Plan ‘Investing in
Britain’s Future’, my Department undertook to review
Government rail functions in order to identify what actions were

Review recognised that much has already been achieved since the
Department’s rail functions were brought together into a single
Rail Group in January 2013. A clear, professional franchise programme
is underway, implementing Richard Brown’s review of franchising,
along with the Government’s ambitious rail investment programme.
Building on this progress, the Review recommends further developing the

Executive will support the drive to strengthen our focus on passengers;
build an enhanced culture of commercial expertise and innovation; and
ensure greater coordination of improvements to track and trains. A
single team will manage the interdependencies between rolling stock,
track, stations, freight and passenger services; and between existing
services and HS2. It will also develop an effective framework agreement
for Network Rail, for September 2014, when it will be classified as
public sector. A new approach to recruitment, reward and career
development for commercial rail skills will allow the Rail Executive to
increase capability at all levels and bolster commercial experience in
the management team. This will reduce the Department’s
dependency upon consultants and increase its ability to negotiate the
best deal for passengers and the taxpayer.</hs_para>

that there should be a clear focus on rail passenger services within
the Rail Executive. This will be provided by a new Office of Rail
Passenger Services, forming part of the Rail Executive, with
responsibilities including delivery of the franchise programme and the
management of existing franchises. It will be led by an externally

Minister of State, Department for Transport (Baroness Kramer)
(LD):</Member> EU Regulation 181/2011 on bus and coach passenger rights
came into force in all Member States on 1 March 2013. In order to
ensure that UK businesses were not put at a competitive disadvantage
compared with their European counterparts, the Government took the
decision to make use of a number of time-limited exemptions, including
one exempting drivers from mandatory disability awareness
training.</hs_para>

Government committed to review the use of this exemption in March 2014
in the light of the industry’s progress with disability
awareness training. 
<?notus-xml column=272?>The Department for Transport then wrote to industry representatives to
encourage the completion of such training at the earliest opportunity
(sent by the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport,
the Hon Member for Lewes, Norman Baker, on 9th July
2013).</hs_para><hs_para UID="140226106000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140226w0001.htm#140226106000213">In
order to inform the review, I wrote to the bus and coach industry on
24th February to establish the structure and effectiveness of
disability awareness training courses used by various organisations and
to assess whether a significant upward trend in the provision of
disability awareness training amongst drivers has occurred since the
exemption's
application.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2014-02-26?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_26_PT_1/Index/39E98FF1004352B7477FF77875FD4A1F3F9D3050" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="5" cday="Wednesday" cmonth="March" cyear="2014" date="26" day="Wednesday" issue="119" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="" printing="daily" session="201314" volume="752" year="2014"><tocdate col="WS103">Wednesday 26 February
