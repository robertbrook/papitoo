warmth component of the ECO—the element that helps low-income
households—was trading on the brokerage at between 25p and 30p

maximum of £840 is available for each job, whereas last year
£3,500 would have been available. Given that the

on many counts. First, the structure she describes as a cartel was
created by the previous Government. The big six were created during the
consolidation under Labour, so they are Labour’s big six. It is
under this coalition Government that we have seen a massive increase in
the number of entrants to the market; we now have 20 independent
suppliers taking on Labour’s big six. That is good competition
that will help people. Secondly, we take winter deaths extremely
seriously. If she looks at the data, she will see that winter deaths
have gone up and down over a period of years and that the highest
figure over the past decade was actually when the Leader of the
Opposition was doing my job. The reason they go up and down is that
they are related not simply to energy costs, but to health matters such
as flu epidemics. We need to ensure that we have a cross-Government

slightly about the solid wall insulation industry. The figures he
referred to are the de minimis; they are not the maximum. There are
other ways in which we will be installing solid wall insulation, not
least working with our cash-back. I am surprised he did not mention the
cash-back, as we are now offering up to £4,000 for solid wall

if she has read the details of Ofgem’s wholesale market reforms,
for example, there is a lot of work to suggest that it is not at all
clear that vertical integration is bad for consumers; it may be in some

clear: vertical integration was adopted so that people could hedge the

As the Secretary of State will recall, I told the House back in
November 2013 that the npower call centre in Thornaby was placing 500
jobs in jeopardy through its proposal to close the centre and relocate
on its existing Sunderland site. We now know that more than 400 members
of staff have opted for voluntary redundancy because npower’s

there was, and there continues to be, an annual inquiry by the Select
Committee into the expenditure of its Department. I do not know whether
that is replicated elsewhere. As the hon. Lady will know from the work
being done by the Public Accounts Commission, the future strategy of
the National Audit Office prioritises the availability of its support

union members and many workers in this country who are not trade
unionists will recognise that the Conservative party has their
interests at heart. It is a party that is cutting their taxes, creating
jobs and giving them a sense of security for the future. That is very
important, because it is the Labour party that is in denial about all
this. It is in denial about the deficit; the shadow Chancellor, in

time with my hon. Friend in his constituency, the issues that arose on
the downgrading of maternity services. To reiterate the point I made
earlier, in that case it was far from clear how the changes that were
to be undertaken would deliver an improved service for the patients and
communities served, which is what we are setting out to do as regards A
and E. I cannot comment on the circumstances in Huddersfield and
neighbouring communities, but I know what Sir Bruce Keogh’s
report said about the issue, because I was involved at the outset in
understanding the nature of the problems in A and E departments. Those
problems are often caused by a large number of patients with the most
serious conditions being brought into A and E departments that do not
necessarily have the specialist skills required to give them the most
effective treatment as rapidly as possible. We need to deliver that
treatment while not limiting access for the great majority of patients
to A and E services in their local

demand of the petition is straightforward: the motion is, in essence, a
call for a cumulative impact assessment of all the welfare changes that

put forward is that if politicians and society only knew the full

bearing the cuts four times worse than the average, while the burden on

consequences from what is happening. First, disabled people are being
forced more and more to rely and depend on care from their own family
members, who are themselves, to be frank, overstretched in providing
that care, especially as local authority respite care is now being cut
back so dramatically. Startlingly, as we found in a previous debate, a
large number of these carers are children caring for their parents. A
year-long investigation by Carers UK confirmed that carers, who save
this country an estimated £119 billion a year in care costs, are
about to lose £1 billion in benefit

the care needs of many disabled people are simply not being met. A
recent inquiry by the all-party groups on local government and on
disability found from the evidence they took that four in 10 disabled
people are failing to have their basic social care needs—which
my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall) has

support their family with a regular wage. For some, the tragedy is that
their disability is so severe that they will never be able to work and
will have to rely on welfare benefits to ensure that they do not live
in poverty, while others need positive and sensitive practical support

That was exposed as an invention by the insurance companies simply to
avoid paying out for claims. My right hon. Friend is, however,
absolutely right that Atos was brought in and then given a contract to
churn through large numbers of assessments very rapidly—as fast

me turn to the personal independence payment. Some 3.2 million disabled

it is meant to help with the additional costs caused by disability. It
allows disabled people to get by and to overcome some of the

families receiving DLA and the carer’s allowance £80 a

the benefit cap, costing £2 billion. Universal credit looms over
all of this. Research by the National Association of Citizens Advice
Bureaux estimates that 116,000 disabled people could lose £40 a
week; that 230,000 severely disabled people who live alone or with only
a young carer will get between £28 and £58 less a week;

undertake a cumulative assessment of the effect of all the benefit
changes on disabled people, others have done so. The Demos-Scope study
calculated that disabled people will lose £28.3
billion by 2018. Dr Simon Bamber concludes that disabled people in
poverty, who make up 4% of the population, will bear 13% of the cuts

conclusion, what do these changes mean in reality? They mean poverty
for many. They mean not enough income for someone to heat their home
adequately—there are nearly 1 million disabled people now in
fuel poverty. They mean someone choosing not to eat so that their
children can do so, and their feeling shamed and humiliated by having
to rely on the generosity of others and support from the food bank. I
urge people to look at the website, Calum’s List. For some it is
all too much and they become another in a coroner’s report whose
suicide is associated with the loss of benefits. Many of the disabled
people I have met say the same thing. They tell me they feel hounded by
the media, by politicians and by this Government, just for being
disabled and claiming the benefits they are entitled to

simple fact of government that policies designed to deal with the
general often struggle with the specific. Despite the need for a clear
structured process to assess whether someone qualifies for a benefit, I
acknowledge that no responsible Government can approach something like
the WCA as if it is some sort of industrial quality control test. This
is not a question that can always be answered with a simple yes or no
because decisions taken have a clear effect on people’s lives,
and reaching the wrong decision can be devastating. However, the
Government have not approached the test that
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022773000363" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022773000363">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:44:46"></hs_TimeCode>

incapacity benefit was designed to be replaced by the employment and
support allowance.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:45:08"></hs_TimeCode> coalition
Government have carried that programme forward, including the key
commitment that the WCA testing regime needed annual review and
improvement for at least the first five years of its life. There have
been four such reviews: three under Professor Harrington and the latest
under Dr Paul Litchfield, which was published in December. Of Professor
Harrington’s cumulative 49 recommendations, 35 were accepted in
full and a further 10 in principle. Of the 35 accepted,  29
have been fully implemented and three partially implemented. A further
three are still in progress. Of the 10 accepted in principle, five have

12 December, the evidence-based review of the WCA was published. It
compared the results produced by the WCA and those of an alternative
designed by a consortium of experts and disability representative
organisations, with a panel of experts reviewing each case. Many cases
were looked at more than once. The report makes for interesting reading
and two conclusions jump out: the WCA creates a much more consistent
result than the proposed alternative; and the WCA is significantly more
likely to accord with the judgment produced by the expert panel
reviewing each case than with the proposed alternative.</hs_Para>

conclusions are important because they tell us how the WCA should work
as a whole. We know that it is pretty much impossible to find a single
general test that fits all eventualities. What we have is a system with
an appeal mechanism that clearly anticipates that the WCA, even with
Department for Work and Pensions staff interpretation and other
evidence overlaid, will not always produce perfect results. That is why
there will be a considerable number of successful appeals. That is
exactly how the system should work, and  it does.</hs_Para>

a number of years now and that is because no one knows precisely the
full force of everything that may be falling on individual families and
individual households. Unless we do that cumulative impact assessment,
we will never know, and in the meantime those families and households
are struggling to makes ends meet, falling into debt and having to make
the choice between eating and heating. They are having to make choices

heaviest impact on the most vulnerable. The largest share of
adult  social care users—older people, people with
physical disabilities and people with mental health
problems—have to bear the brunt of reductions in social care.
The recent joint inquiry by the all-party groups on local government
and on disability showed that four in 10 disabled people are
failing to have their basic social care needs met and that nearly half
of disabled people say that services are not supporting them to get out
and about in the community. Three quarters of the 4,500 respondents to
“The Tipping Point” survey said that losing some of their
disability living allowance income would mean they would require more
social care support from their local council, at a time when the

allowance underpaid per year is £190 million; the amount of DLA

turn briefly to PIP, because we were told that it would help the most

with a number and framed a policy around that number. The National
Audit Office report published this morning is devastating; it shows
that the Government went into a reform of benefits that affects the
most disabled in our community without knowing where they were going,
or how they would implement the reform. According to the report, on the
first day of the claims process, the Government met their target, but
when we get to the claims being passed to the assessment provider, that
information is not recorded. The expectation is that assessments will
be completed in 42 days, but 64 days is what is actually being
delivered. Worst of all, the terminally ill—those who have a
life expectancy of no more than six months—are having to wait 28
days. The Minister may tell me that that has changed, and I hope that
it has, but it seems that a sixth of those people’s total

disappointment, but it is important to point out, at the outset, that
the report talks about the implementation, rather than the policy aims.
That is important. The report is not a criticism of the policy aims. It

PIP.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022773000447" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022773000447">This
issue and this debate are framed in the context of the idea that
changes to the welfare state are being undertaken in response to the
need for austerity. I would argue that the issue is far more important
than that; it is very important that it is dealt with, not because of
austerity but despite it, because we have a failing welfare system.
Anybody in this Chamber who argued that, prior to 2010, we had a system
that we could be proud of would be very brave indeed. It is to the
credit of the Government that the welfare reform agenda is being
implemented not primarily to save money, but to ensure that the system
does not trap people in a way that is unproductive and
unfair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022773000448" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022773000448">Today’s

one reads the detail—complaining about the impact of welfare
reform in Wales, I would have expected Labour Members from Wales to
highlight their concerns in a debate as important as this one.
Surprisingly, they are not here. Perhaps that is because they know full
well that the Labour party is committed to a zero-growth spending
review. We have heard Members express a lot of passionately held points
of view today; it is important to point out that in a zero-growth
spending review, it is very difficult to envisage any increase in the
welfare budget. That is a point that any honest Member should be happy

although I do not think that that is Labour’s policy. Are they
saying that there should or should not be some sort of work capability
assessment? If we have work capability assessments, as I believe that

north Wales housing associations are falling in two out of three cases.
The statistics shows that more than two thirds of discretionary housing
awards have been made because of a need arising owing to factors
outside welfare reform. From listening to Opposition Members, one would

security with Sir Keith Joseph, the arch-right winger of the Heath
days. We all believed at the time that he was going to hit the poor,
and of course—in a marginal way, compared with today—he
did. However, remarkably, in the Macmillan era and even the in
Heath-Keith Joseph era, the welfare state was by and large a status
quo. I have to say—I will probably never say it
again—that even in the Thatcher years this chaos did not happen.
She did a lot of things—she privatised all the public utilities,
smashed the pits and all the rest of it—but, by and large,
we never had capability assessments or a march by 3,000
blind and disabled people, which was what heralded the beginning of

about the mess that has been created for the people I met at the Atos
headquarters last Wednesday. It was not a trade union gathering; it was
a different gathering altogether. There were more wheelchairs than
there were police. Fancy speaking to a crowd of 70 to 100 people

firm that is in charge—for a while anyway, so I am told, before
it moves on to other pastures—literally hundreds of thousands of
people are being turned down. When I represented people at tribunals,
it used to be that we would have an appeal in four weeks and I would be
off to Nottingham with those miners, but David Cowpe had cancer and
waited 10 months for an appeal, and he died before he had a chance. It

complex. The spectrum of disability alone includes those that are
unchanging, those that are progressive—there is constant
change—and those that are variable, such as multiple sclerosis
and bipolar disorder, where people have peaks and troughs, feeling well
and extremely unwell. Such an assessment would also have a wide range
of contributors, including local authorities—in particular
social services departments —children and adult services, the
Departments for Work and Pensions, for Communities and Local Government

the benefit cuts hitting the disabled mean that they are about 30%

have a job to go to. They wanted to work and earn a living, not to take
state benefits. The closures were very much an ideological decision by
the Government. There were difficulties in the Remploy system, but they
were with the management at the top of the hierarchy, who were keeping
a lot of the money. The changes that were needed to make Remploy more
effective should have been made at the top, where money was being
wasted. The ordinary disabled person working in the factory was not
causing that waste. Rather than looking properly at how to make Remploy
work better, the Government managed to abolish it. As a result, many of
the people who worked there have ended up unemployed. They are sitting
at home, claiming state benefits and getting incredibly depressed,

negligible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022785000023"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T12:50:41"></hs_TimeCode>Lastly,

“Mr Sheridan, where can I work? Where can I go? If I get on a

out. So where do I go?” The only enjoyment that man had

reform has not only encouraged the “shirker” myth about
the sick and the disabled, but made life increasingly difficult for
them. The Minister will probably say that the Government have put in
place this legislation to ensure that the right people receive
benefits, but it is a tactic to divert attention from the gross abuse
of power by those with money in this country. Reference has already
been made to the obsession with people receiving welfare benefits, but
for those with money—the tax avoiders and evaders—life
goes on as normal. If only a fraction of the resources used and the
time spent on 
<?notus-xml column=449?>chasing down those on welfare benefits was diverted
to tackle tax avoidance and evasion, some people might understand the

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022785000037">Like<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T12:56:47"></hs_TimeCode>
many colleagues here today, I have had many constituents come to me
with various concerns about the proposed reforms. There are so many
different problems that it is difficult to know where to start. The
move from DLA to PIP has been a particular concern. Since that move
began, fewer than one in six people who have applied have had their
claims decided. As other Members have indicated, some people have died
before the process is complete. That reminds me of the cases some years
ago when people were dying after being diagnosed with mesothelioma
cancer but while still waiting for compensation. At that time, their
claim died with them.</hs_Para>

Scotland has highlighted the case of the father of an applicant who was
told that they would have wait at least 10 months for any kind of
decision, and perhaps even for a first assessment. A constituent of
mine who is undergoing cancer treatment has been told that the
eight-week time frame given by DWP is an unrealistic amount of
time in which to process an application and offer an assessment slot.
When my staff called the MPs’ hotline, they were told that they
simply cannot process the number of applicants as there are not enough
staff. They also say that most people who have applied for PIP will not
be entitled to it, even before individual cases have been looked at. If
that is the mindset of the staff processing the applications, it is
hard to see how balanced decisions will be
made<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T12:58:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022785000039">When
people finally hear about their assessments, there is not much hope.
Only 15.4% of new claims have received a decision, and only 12,654 of
the 220,300 people who have made a new claim since April
2013 have been awarded some rate of PIP. A constituent of mine
got in touch because her father had been diagnosed with
lung cancer. Because there is a possibility that his treatment will
work, giving him a life expectancy of up to five years, he has not been
classed as terminally ill. He is not well enough to attend a medical
assessment and so will have to wait longer for a home visit. It appears
that letters from his GP, cancer doctor and cancer hospital are not
enough to prove the seriousness of his illness.</hs_Para>

assessments and the benefits system more generally. Most of them have
at various times been on courses to improve their employability, some
have done work experience placements, and some have had supported
employment, but the challenge is to find employers who can take them on
and give them a proper job. I have been working with employers and
talking to social enterprises, but the number of opportunities does not
match the number of adults looking for work, and the work capability
assessment does not cut them any slack. It is all very well to place
adults with learning difficulties in the work-related activity group,

all the adults I meet in this context are living at home with older

support in doing so, yet carers are also having to pick up the tab if
people are sanctioned.
Research<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:09:43"></hs_TimeCode> by the

Scotland, a cumulative impact assessment has already been carried out.
It shows that £4.5 billion of cuts are resulting from welfare
reform, but it is much harder to assess how much of that is falling
directly and indirectly on disabled people. Citizens Advice Scotland
estimates that disabled people stand to lose £1 billion in
benefits payments alone, but, in a sense, that is the easy bit to
calculate. It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:09:43"></hs_TimeCode> is
important to understand that it is not just changes to disability
benefits that affect disabled people. We debated the bedroom tax at
length yesterday, and I will not dwell on that, except to repeat that
80% of households in Scotland affected by the bedroom tax are the home
of a disabled person. The vast majority of people paying the bedroom
tax are disabled, so the 
<?notus-xml column=451?>steps we have taken in Scotland to mitigate its impact will primarily
benefit disabled people.
Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>, the
decision to mitigate the cut in council tax benefit for over 500,000
households will be helping disabled people, along with other low-income
households. However, working disabled people—probably about half
the working-age disabled population—are also likely to have been
badly affected by changes to tax credits, especially if they have
children. Disabled people are more likely to be in part-time or
low-paid jobs and therefore more likely to depend on extra support, and
they are likely to be worse off overall because of changes to the tax

health problems. We do know, though, that the majority of us will
become carers at some point in our lives. In that respect, we are all

of the most profoundly disheartening experiences for me as an MP since
being elected in 2010 has been the relentless way in which disabled and
sick people have been vilified and stigmatised in the public discourse
about welfare reform. Those who had very little responsibility for the
financial collapse and subsequent economic problems have nevertheless
had to carry the can. The attempt to discredit disabled people in order
to justify harsh and punitive cuts in their already fairly paltry
incomes is quite shameful. It appals me that the most disadvantaged
have been asked to pick up the tab disproportionately for the
profligacy of others. As we look to the future, we see further cuts of
£12 billion, at least, promised in the years ahead. For disabled
people in Scotland, the choice between two very different futures is
opening up before them: one with decisions on welfare made in Scotland,
or one where further cuts slash their incomes even more. That choice

uprating of benefits. That has a big impact on many people with
disabilities, who, in effect, will be getting less than they would have

have been in touch with me and, I think, illustrate routine problems of
the kind that people are facing. My constituent John Scott was
diagnosed with cancer in the summer of 2013 and sent in his application
for personal independence payment soon afterwards. I raised his case in
Parliament on 13 January, when he was waiting for his initial medical
assessment. At that point, he had had no payment, never mind a decision
in his case. Since then, he has been in for an operation and had his
bladder removed owing to the extent of his cancer, and cancerous cells
were found in the muscle tissue in his prostate. He is still
recovering, but to date has not received a medical assessment to see
whether he qualifies for a personal independence payment. He has
therefore not had a payment since July last year, although
he has obviously been struggling with household bills
and accruing arrears, and has had to carry on without any
assistance.</hs_Para>

been diagnosed with brain injury and has related mental health issues.
He is separated from his partner, but they have a child and therefore
found it mutually beneficial that he stay in the house to supervise the
child while his former partner was at work. However, the Department for
Work and Pensions thought that they were co-habiting and sanctioned his
benefits. We found out last week, of course, that one in five people in

tax benefit. On 17 December, she was sectioned under the Mental Health
Act, because she was struggling to cope. While in hospital, she had a
heart attack, which caused her to be in coma. Now, at the end of

load of staff dealing with benefits has increased dramatically,

people are going to it for help because they find it too daunting to
deal with the Department for Work and Pensions. Demand has also gone up
sharply for the food parcels that it distributes, as has demand for
help from its hardship funds. Typically, it has found that people are
struggling to pay for food, toiletries and fuel. One reason why the
demand for food parcels has increased is that people are running out of
money between benefit payments, often because they have been switched
to a benefit on which they receive less money, but also because, in the
process of being switched from one benefit to another, there is a gap
of two to three weeks during which they do not receive any

the last Administration in 2008 and has so very clearly failed people
in need. The British Medical Association’s GP committee voted
unanimously in 2012 that, after four years, the policy had been a
failure. It was clear when it was introduced that it was part of an
attempt to appear to be hard on benefits and to be clamping down. It
happened at the same time as things were being made harder for lone
parents, with more and more conditions being piled on. It is part of
the rhetoric about the deserving poor versus the undeserving poor that,
sadly, we still hear

the local advice agencies in Brighton and Hove that came together to

case studies from Macmillan that were included in the report. It
mentions Mr C, a 56-year-old single man who, following cancer of the
spine, lost his mobility and became confined to a wheelchair. Mr C was
forced to stop work owing to ill health and constant pain. Macmillan
made contact to start the PIP application process last September. To my
knowledge, it is still not resolved. At the same time, an application
was made for ESA. That application followed a similar path to the PIP
application. Mr C is still being paid the assessment phase rate of just
£71.70 a week, with no information from Atos as to when it will
assess him further. Four months on, we are still counting and he is

advanced bowel cancer and who came to the charity for help. It took

mental ill health. After months of delays, which caused her extreme

conclusion of the report by my local advice agencies is that people are
going through what they call “awful experiences” while
waiting for their claims to be processed. Advisers are spending
disproportionate amounts of time making calls to the DWP and the
privatised PIP providers. That is frustrating and is a drain on
resources. Claims that need to be followed up are taking more than
double the amount of time that is usually allocated to such work. The
advice sector in Brighton and Hove has made it very clear that the
situation is untenable. It is looking to the Government to sort it out.
In the meantime, it is asking for local contacts within the DWP and
Atos so that organisations do not have to keep wasting huge amounts of
time contacting DWP and Atos nationally. I hope that the Minister will
respond to that specific request. It is quite a small one, but it would

a week in their household income after they have already lost his
earnings. They have also been affected by the bedroom tax, because they
are in a two-bedroom house. They have put a lot of money into that
house over the years. When they first applied for discretionary housing
payment, they were turned down because, with Jean’s earnings and
Jim’s DLA, they had too much income to be eligible, despite his
clear disability. I am glad to say that that has changed, due to extra
money being made

interlocking effect that we are asking and reasonably expecting the
Government to look at. Governments should look at what is happening to
people. A piece of research was commissioned by the previous Government
and published in 2011, but it has never been followed up by this
Government. One very worrying statistic from that research is that 43%
of the people who had been found fit for work were neither in
employment nor on any out-of-work benefit after a year. The percentage
of that cohort who were in work after a year, 23%, was hardly higher
than it had been after three months, at 22%. That is a whole lot of
missing people, and those are the sorts of facts and research that a
Government should commission. It is disappointing that the Government

introduced the WCA, you introduced Atos, and therefore it is all your

my maiden speech I mentioned ESA and WCA, and said that whoever formed
the Government, I would be raising that issue. There have been points
over the past nearly four years when the Government could have changed
tack. They did not have to extend Atos’s contract or proceed
with the migration of people from incapacity benefit to ESA as fast as
they did, without looking again at what the first few years had told

frequent reassessments of people, and they would not stop even when

don’t need

independence payment, however, is entirely this Government’s
baby, and the problems go back to the beginning. This change was driven
by finances, not by any research or understanding that a change needed
to happen, and it had to be geared to financial savings. There was an
urgent—and shortened—consultation on the changes, which
many people complained about at the time. Despite the demographic
changes, the straw man of too many people receiving DLA was erected,
and there were assertions that DLA was granted constantly without
medical evidence and that hardly anyone was ever reassessed. That
ignored the big changes that had taken place in the previous 10 years,
and the fact that increasingly, new awards were time limited.</hs_Para>

with poor evidence, and with arguments and assertions rather than fact,
we end up with a flawed proposal. In 2013 we saw the start of the
personal independence payment, and the delays and assessments have been

exactly the same problems. The flaw is in the system that has been set

Government and elsewhere have said a number of things about why that is
happening, and in December the Minister said to the Work and Pensions
Committee that every single assessment for PIP was being audited
internally. That suggests either a lack of training or a lack of
confidence in their own staff. We are now told that each individual
assessment is taking twice as long as expected, and that far more
face-to-face assessments are having to take place. Might that be
because the forms are not very good and the information is not coming
in? Those are all things that a proper pilot would have tested. Instead
of that, however, many thousands of new applicants—not just a
few hundred—are being treated like guinea pigs in a system that
the Government did not scope out or test properly; they did not look to

cuts highlighted by my hon. Friend the Member for Leicester West (Liz

disabled people seem to have been targeted. The services they rely on
are being attacked from all directions, resulting in greater
inequalities, poorer health and a growing sense of anxiety, fear and
trepidation over their future. The cuts have not been made fairly, and
they are not spread evenly across public services or entitlements. The
cuts have been targeted, with more than 50% falling in just two
areas—benefits and local government—affecting sick and
disabled people disproportionately.</hs_Para>

for children and adults makes up 60% of all spending over which local
authorities have any control. The huge 40% reduction in local
government funding spells disaster and will have a huge impact on
adults and children who depend on vital public services. An interesting
statistic is that by 2015 and the next general election, £8
billion will have been cut from social care in 
<?notus-xml column=463?>England—about 33% of the total. Last year,
320,000 fewer people received local authority brokered
social care compared with 2005. As my hon. Friend the Member for Hayes
and Harlington said, one reason for that is the change in the
eligibility thresholds that many local authorities have been forced to
make. As well as being unjust and denying people adequate social care,
that has unsustainable consequences. It is a false economy. By removing
care in the community, we are putting pressure on other public
services, for example accident and emergency.</hs_Para>

created is a climate of fear, a climate of social outcasts and a
climate where the understanding of the sick and disabled has gone. They
are seen to be the undeservingly ill. We need to focus on the human

2009, her son was horrifically injured in a road traffic accident. She
was forced to move from the property she had lived in since the 1970s
to a specially disabled-adapted property. This has meant that she is no
longer eligible for relief from the bedroom tax. To avoid it, she would
have had to have lived in the same property since 1996. She has a
two-bedroom property. Her son lives downstairs, but she needs to have
one of the bedrooms for her daughter, who allows her some relief at

payments, social security and disability. When the Government

size of the cuts and the devastation to local government, education and
so many other areas. What was not fully realised, however, was the
impact of the changes to the welfare benefit system on those with
disabilities, and the unfair way in which 15% of the cuts would fall on

of return-to-work interviews. Those whose applications for benefits are
subsequently rejected go through a period of incredible stress, and

they are not; on some days they have a terrible time, and on others
life is more stable for them. It is when such people undergo the
additional stress that results from being told that they may be forced

terrible things happen. The numbers of suicides that have resulted from

Harlington (John McDonnell) and the Backbench Business Committee for
arranging it. Like others, however, I pay particular tribute to the
104,000 people who signed the War on Welfare petition that forms the
basis of the motion, and who were the driving force behind
today’s debate. The volume of signatures is testimony to the
strength of public feeling about these matters. I have had the
opportunity to meet War on Welfare campaigners in my constituency and
here at Westminster, and I can testify to the anger and fear that many
feel about the impact of the Government’s policies on disabled
people. It concerns non-disabled people as much as disabled people,
which is not surprising in view of the fact that—as my hon.
Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) so powerfully reminded
us—only one in five disabled people is born with a
disability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0002.htm#14022785000140">It
is to our shame that, in all walks of life, disabled people face
injustice and unfairness. They are twice as likely to be treated
unfairly at work as non-disabled people; they are more likely to be
victims of crime; they face additional living costs associated with
their disabilities; they are twice as likely to live in poverty; and
they are less likely to be in work. Today the employment rate among
disabled people is 45%, while the rate among the working-age population
as a whole is 71%. The hon. Member for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford)
rightly identified some of the labour market barriers that disabled
people face. Moreover, shamefully, they are on the receiving end of a
virtually non-stop flow of hostile and abusive rhetoric.</hs_Para>

expect that, faced with that grim picture, the Government would focus
their efforts on tackling the injustice and discrimination that
confront disabled people, but the policies of the current
Government so often make matters worse. That is why Labour
wholeheartedly supports the call for a cumulative impact assessment of
the effect of those policies on disabled people, and why we called for
such an assessment last
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000142">The

assessment, but Labour never unleashed such a deluge of negative
policies on disabled people. Let me say to the hon. Member for
Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) in particular that our record speaks for itself.
<I>[Interruption.] </I>He should listen to this. Poverty among disabled
people, which stood at 40% when Labour came to office,
subsequently fell to about one in four, 
<?notus-xml column=467?>and the employment rate among disabled people rose by 9 percentage
points. We introduced a host of measures to strengthen the rights of
disabled people. We passed the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 and
introduced the Equality Act 2010, we formed the Equality and Human
Rights Commission, and, in 2009, we signed the United Nations
convention on the rights of persons with disabilities.</hs_Para>

contrast that with the damaging policies of the current Government,
which have been highlighted today. Cuts in local authority budgets have

Green:</Member></B> The hon. Lady largely made a very helpful
contribution, but there is an important point about the legitimacy of
the assessment process—a legitimacy that disabled people will
themselves recognise confers on them the entitlement to the benefits

public’s perception of
entitlement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:12:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000159">Meanwhile,

disabled people have to wait weeks, if not months, for a decision,

their claim. Why on earth Ministers awarded a PIP contract to Atos,

replacement of the DLA with PIP also comes with a 20% budget cut,
leaving disabled people and their carers facing the loss of vital
financial support. Some will lose their Motability vehicles, and some
will fall out of work as a result. The Disability Benefits Consortium
has suggested that if 50,000 people leave work as a result of losing
the mobility payment, that could cost the Exchequer £464 million

is not just about cuts to benefits specifically for disabled people
either, because other benefit cuts affect them disproportionately too:
the bedroom tax; the introduction of the benefit cap, which will also
significantly impact on carers, many of whom cannot take paid work to

right place, and I hope it is. I consider it a great honour to do this
job and I desperately want to make things right and proper. If we look
at the spending since 2009 going forward and projected 
<?notus-xml column=471?>into 2015, we see that the budget in this area of Government expenditure
will continue to rise. We have a slightly more cumulative figure than
the ones I cited earlier, and it is about £50 billion a year, so
we spend just under £1 billion a week in this budget.
The key for everybody in the House is how we spend it—that we
spend it correctly.</hs_Para>

also believe in having a work capability assessment. I do not agree
with the motion, but I do agree with the shadow Minister. I think that
the assessment was brought in for the right reasons. I am not going to
say all the problems were caused by the previous Administration
because, frankly, the problems with Atos and the WCA have been there
for everybody to see since the general election as well. It is not
quite as simple as saying, as some Members have, that we should go out
tomorrow morning and sack Atos. It has a contract. As I said at oral
questions earlier in the week, I am determined that once we have
negotiated the position with Atos—and we are in negotiation with
Atos, which is why I was so surprised to read the views of Atos in the
press over the weekend—we must make absolutely sure
taxpayers’ money is not paid to Atos as compensation for the end
of the contract when that comes. That would be fundamentally wrong and
I would not agree to it. The negotiations continue.</hs_Para>

National Audit Office report has been mentioned today. It was a
snapshot report based on the situation in the autumn of last year. When
I appeared before the Select Committee, I spoke extensively about one
aspect of the report, which dealt with terminal illness. It is crucial
to understand that I hid nothing away from the Committee, and that I
said that the length of time involved in dealing with those cases was
unacceptable. It has now come down to about 10 days. That is still too
long, although it is less than it was under the previous scheme. We
will get it down even further. I am working closely with Macmillan, and
we have agreed to pilot a scheme for the 2% of terminal cases in which
we will return to a paper-based system until I can get a secure PDF
into place. Macmillan is pleased with what we are doing on that.

problem now lies with the assessment method, which involves only
form-filling and box-ticking. That is why we can no longer assess
people’s disabilities properly. In the old days, a medical
expert gave evidence on a person’s ability. If we were to bring

When the banking crisis took place, the Government —with the
support of all parties in the House—found £1.3 trillion
to bail the banks out. Since then, virtually every other part of
society has been paying for that bail-out, other than the banks
themselves. Is it not ironic that we are debating cuts affecting people
with disabilities in the week when RBS is putting together a half a
billion pounds pool to pay bonuses?</hs_Para>

disabled people are enduring as a result of the cuts, and to be frank,
I have heard nothing today about alleviating that suffering. That is
why it is important to make a commitment to carry out a cumulative
impact assessment. Any good Government would want to assess the impact
of their policies, so why are this Government refusing to do so? I
think it is because, if an impact assessment were published, people

have also had your plea, Mr Speaker, for a more civilised Prime
Minister’s questions—good luck on that one! Is it all
about macho culture, as many say, or is there something intrinsic in
the confrontational shape of the Chamber? A great deal has been written
in recent months about the rather narrow socio-economic background of
most MPs. People ask, “Why so few working-class MPs?” All
of that is relevant to this debate. However, the reason I applied for
this debate is more prosaic. In the previous Parliament, I was
vice- chair of the Speaker's Conference on parliamentary
representation, and one of the recommendations was that, every two
years, there should be a debate on the issues raised in our report on
the Floor of the House. It was hoped that such a debate would raise the
importance of having a diverse Parliament, look at the progress made
and come up with suggestions on to how to improve the situation. The
Speaker’s Conference felt that if the issue was not discussed
regularly, the need to take action would be forgotten. The last debate
was in January 2012, so this debate is to fulfil that
recommendation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:31:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000200" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000200"><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="14022785000610" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000610"><B>Keith

representative; it seems obvious. The people sitting in this Chamber
should reflect the whole of British society. They should come from all

conscious effort from those with the power to ensure that the

ones who choose the candidates, so it is incumbent on them to ensure
they have candidates who come from an ethnic minority, are lesbian,
gay, bisexual and transgender, have a disability—and are not all
white men from private schools. I always use the phrase “private

I also commend the Government for introducing the Access to Elected
Office for Disabled People Fund and for announcing its extension up to
2015 a couple of weeks ago? The Speaker’s Conference recommended
setting up such a fund to help disabled people overcome one of the
barriers they face in seeking selection—the extra costs that
they incur. The money might go to pay for a signer, or postage for
someone who cannot hand deliver letters to members, or extra travel
costs. It is important and it is a

fund can be accessed by disabled people across the UK for selection to
Westminster, it does not cover elections to the Scottish
Parliament and Scottish local authorities—I am sad that
the members of the Scottish National party have disappeared out of the
Chamber. Those elections are the responsibility of the Scottish
Government who have yet to set up such a fund in Scotland. Despite warm
words and a motion and debate in the Scottish Parliament last year,
nothing has yet happened. Therefore, while English disabled people can
access the fund for local government elections, Scottish disabled
people cannot. As political parties in Scotland have already begun
their selection process for the next Scottish Parliament elections in
2016, the need for such a fund is urgent. If they leave it too late,
potential disabled candidates could miss out. I hope the Scottish
Government hear my call and follow the example set by the UK Government

have been other changes that have made Parliament more accessible. We
now have more reasonable hours, and the programming of business has
meant an end to the old late nights spent in the bar. The opening of
Parliament’s crèche has also been a step forward.
However, there is no room for complacency, and unless the women MPs who
are standing down in 2015 are replaced by even more women, then the
overall numbers could drop. There is clearly a need for us to look at
ourselves to see why so many people think that being an MP is not a job

side issues. If it is too expensive to enter a selection race, people
from modest backgrounds are not going to be in that race. If the public
continue to hold MPs in such low regard, why would anyone in their
right mind want to be an MP? Of course perception is far worse than the
reality, which may explain why a higher proportion of the people
wanting to be an MP already have a knowledge of the world of
Parliament—either because they are related to an MP, they have
worked for one or they have been a political special adviser. What puts
other people off, does not seem to discourage them. Perhaps they
realise that being an MP can be fun. I must say that I have never
regretted standing for Parliament, and I do not come from the typical
MP’s background. How do we get across the fact that, for most of
us, serving as an MP is a privilege and an honour and the best decision
of our lives? Having said that, we must be honest about the issues that
put people off. Perhaps we should do more work shadowing, such as that
organised by Operation Black Vote, and look closely at the work of my

the number of children that women MPs have and the number of children
had by women of their peer group in wider

key recommendation of the Speaker’s Conference that remains
unresolved was aimed at ensuring that political parties choose a
diverse range of candidates in potentially winnable seats: the
publication by political parties of diversity data relating to
candidate selections has not properly happened. It is worth setting out
again the reason why the conference thought that was so important. We
found evidence to indicate strongly that inequality persists in
candidate selection. The reasons for that are complex, and it is
difficult to identify and apply solutions because parties and
constituencies select candidates by different methods and,
frequently, independently of central
control.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000212">The
vast majority of MPs are selected on a party ticket. The parties are
the agents of change, and the choices the parties make about candidates
are central to shaping what the House of Commons looks like. Those
choices are important to the parties as well: the message of inclusion
is a very powerful one that could help to engage new audiences and
develop closer bonds with alienated communities. We recommended the
creation of a formal monitoring scheme, requiring political parties to
publish anonymised data on the gender, ethnic background and other
characteristics of candidates selected. Knowing that the parties
already hold that type of information, we gathered it from them
ourselves and published it in the six months preceding the last general
election—that shows that it can be done.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:41:52"></hs_TimeCode> also secured
an amendment to the then Equality Bill—it is now section 106 of

the election, however, and the end of the conference, the central
publication of data has stopped, despite my writing to the political

their agreement to publish voluntarily. But that has not happened, so
may I ask the Minister whether she can implement section 106, so that
candidate selection can be tracked? Now is the right time to do it, as
candidate selections for 2015 were delayed owing to uncertainty over
future parliamentary constituency boundaries, so it was only at the end
of last year that selections for Westminster constituencies began in
earnest. Data on current candidate selections have now been published
online by Labour and the Liberal Democrats, but not, as far as I can
discover, by the Conservatives. Some of the information that has been
published is not necessarily comparable across the parties, but I hope
the Minister can help with all
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000214">I
appreciate that all political parties have different cultures and so
may not all adopt the same approaches in tackling under-representation.
It might be through all-women shortlists, through the use of primaries,
through the use of an A-list or by whatever means, but a conscious
effort must be made because this will not happen by accident. There is
no silver bullet or magic wand to wave that will change the make-up of
the Commons, and it would be an enormous missed 
<?notus-xml column=479?>opportunity if the Parliament elected in 2015 is
less diverse than this one. Changing that make-up will require all
political parties to accept they have a role to play in fostering
talent and in candidate selection. The Government can play a role, too,
in providing leadership and encouraging a cross-party approach, as we
have seen with the access to elected office fund. But Parliament has to
be more welcoming, too, and perhaps, if I may be so bold, Mr Speaker,
that is where you come in as well. Our democracy is precious—it
is too precious to be wholly in the hands of a narrow elite. We can

Conference proposals, which were made before many of us entered the
House, live and carry on delivering the successful outcomes that they
have started to deliver. I agree with much of what has already been
said; we are here because we all care about our democracy and know how
fundamental it is that all Britons, regardless of their ethnic origin,
gender, sexual orientation, where they come from or social background,
should not be barred from playing a full part in our parliamentary
democracy. So this debate involves the issue of fairness, as well as
the effectiveness of our legislative process. As I found in business,
things are much more effective where a diverse group of individuals,
with a variety of backgrounds and experiences behind them, come
together to have an impact on the process. Later in my contribution I
will give a few examples of small ways in which that has been achieved
by our greater diversity.</hs_Para>

will talk a little about some of the measures that have been taken and
that have worked to various degrees. Clearly, the all-women shortlists
that the Labour party introduced in 1997 have had a positive effect on
the representation of women in Parliament, and I am sure that they have
had much to do with why 33% of Labour MPs are women. Positive
discrimination, if I can put it that way, has also benefited
Conservative representation, perhaps not so much in this place as in
Europe, where 
<?notus-xml column=481?>we have two or three very good MEPs who were elected at the last
European elections because we were brave enough to say that in the
primary system of election, whereby we were electing candidates, the
highest placed woman went to the top of the

in the Chamber. As many Members will know, it was a system whereby half
of the list of candidates from which an association could select were
female. We went through a few other developments on that theme, and
later in the cycle of selections there was a system whereby
associations had to have gender parity at each stage of the selection

busy people. I am glad to say that all the Ministers I know are fully
committed to diversity and equality, but the issue is not always at the
top of their mind—they have very busy lives and many
responsibilities—so it is up to Back Benchers. I applaud many of
my fellow gay Back Benchers on keeping the Government to their
promises. There has been the legalisation on gay marriage; the removal
of historical convictions for consensual sex between men; the pardoning
of Alan Turing; and support for anti-homophobic bullying campaigns in
school. There are many other examples, too. It is because we have more
diversity that we can make that sort of difference, and that is why we
need more of
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000238">I

Member for Maidstone and The Weald (Mrs Grant). Now, 25% of
non-executive directors on boards are female; that is up from 16%. I
can see business outstripping politics if we are not careful. Of
course, I hope that business wins the battle to get more diversity and
inclusion. It realises that it will not win corporate battles by
relying on the talent pool that used to win in the past, and that areas
of great shortage, such as engineering, need to attract more women.

are many ways to lead. Lloyds Banking Group has set a target: it wants
women to be 40% of its senior executives in five years’ time.
Procter &amp; Gamble has a big programme on developing women leaders
globally. Thomson Reuters has a female management academy. Those
organisations recognise that women need support and training, and a
champion at board level to enable them to fulfil their potential. I see
an opportunity there for politics in Westminster. I think that we are
all aware that HR at Westminster is perhaps a little antediluvian,
compared with HR in industry. We need to learn lessons from these
organisations, which do not just set targets, but have committed people
dedicated to making those targets a reality. On those programmes, women
are identified and put into positions that are known as feeder jobs, in
which people can acquire critical skills that they will require at
board level. What I am saying is that it is not enough to get greater
diversity in Parliament; we then need career progression, which needs
to be managed and led from the top. There is a great opportunity there,

and citizenship and that they receive proper unbiased tutoring in those
subjects. I was very pleased that the Secretary of State for
Education—I do not often say that—took a step back and
did not remove citizenship from the school curriculum, but there is
still a discussion behind the scenes about parity with other curriculum
subjects and the timing of any review of programmes of study. I hope
that that will be sorted out between the Department

said, we often pick this up too late. If young people are turned off
from the whole idea of public engagement—not just standing for a

activities that we would all see as crucial dynamics in a living civil
society—we will lose them. By the time people start having

fact that the Chamber is changing will lead to more change. Let us face
it: someone would need to be a bit odd to want to stand for Parliament.
We were always the odd people at school; most people were interested in

Chamber who they feel might well represent them, they are more likely
to stand for Parliament. Therefore, the changes that have started to
occur will continue.</hs_Para>

system has a great advantage and a great disadvantage—it is
called first past the post. I love our electoral system; it is very
good. It means that we represent a definable geographical area, that we
have to deal with people who do not vote for us—people come into
our surgery who voted Labour, Liberal, Conservative or
whatever—and that we have to get to know our constituencies very
well. That is a big advantage in terms of representation, but it does
mean that, on the whole, associations joyfully go ahead in selecting
one person. If every association selects the one person they want, that
does not necessarily mean that the team we get at the end of the day is
balanced or representative. The one advantage of proportional
representation, as in the European elections, is that it enables a
slightly more balanced approach.</hs_Para>

all the political parties are signed up to change. The driver of that
change is ultimately political competition, because each party wants to
get the most votes possible and realises that it can do that only if
there is much more balanced representation in the House. Although
articles in newspapers often say that there is a deficiency of women
voting Conservative, the polling evidence is that as many women now
vote Conservative as vote Labour. There is a slight propensity among
younger women to vote for the left and older, or more mature, women to

elections to see that the very heavy preponderance of young women
voting Democrat was probably the reason Obama won the election, because
although the margin in terms of the electoral college was quite large,
in terms of the vote it was quite narrow.</hs_Para>

of the things that makes me feel that the situation will continue to
improve is that we have a very competitive political system. All the
political parties want to get the maximum number of votes, and they all
realise that that necessitates changing the manner in which we carry
out our selections. That sometimes means educating our own best
friends. We all have in our associations people we have known for years
and dearly love, and who are great supporters, but sometimes do not
always act in a way that is in the broadest, greatest interests of the
party. Political parties have to try to persuade their own members that
change is necessary. That is a big challenge for those of us who have
been in elected politics for a number of years. The Conservative party
has changed in the way it sometimes carries out selections. That is to
be commended and is starting to have

Gentleman that the role of the Independent Parliamentary Standards
Authority has not helped. People with caring responsibilities,
particularly those with children, are not well catered for in the
expenses system. The abolition of the resettlement grant is a
retrograde step. If we have fixed five-year Parliaments, a Member
coming up to their 60s has a choice whether to go or to stay for five
years. If there is 
<?notus-xml column=489?>a financial incentive to go early, that will mean
more selections, and if there are more selections we will have a more
diverse House, so it is a simple way of getting change. If we abolish
the resettlement grant, there is always the temptation for a Member to
hang on for one more term, even when they may have lost interest. I
hope that IPSA revisits this, because there ought to be positive
incentives to manage people out of this House rather than the other way
around. As we all know—we all have our dear friends in this
House—there comes a time when everybody has to go, and usually
it is sooner rather than later.</hs_Para>

Speaker and many other people in this House—there are many great

family-friendly. For many years, the Conservative party was run by
women, and many of them dominate our associations and our local
councils, but the problem is getting them into this House. It is not
necessarily about women, but about women with children—that has
always been the biggest barrier. It is vital to deal with caring
responsibilities, and sometimes it is very important to educate my own
party in that regard. I am glad to see that both the leadership and

Mactaggart</B> (Slough) (Lab):</Member> I was proud to serve as a
member of the Speaker’s Conference and I want to reflect on some
of its broader aspects, because I think it is regarded as being
just about how to change the composition of the House of Commons. In
fact, it was a big reflection on democracy and politics. I strongly
recommend to Members that they read the whole report because there is
not enough in politics today that makes the case for political parties
and for an active democracy. That is what I think the conference
did<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:26:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000286">The
reason issues of representation became so core to this is that in order
for democracy to work, people need to trust politics. In order to trust
those of us who are professional politicians, they have to think that
we get what is happening in their lives. That means that we have to
look normal to them. When the Leader of the Opposition,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:27:02"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband), demonstrated
the other day that the composition of the Front Bench of the governing
party was all-male on that day, one of the reasons why that had so much
resonance was the 
<?notus-xml column=490?>sense that half the country felt that they were not
there —that we are extremely odd, peculiar, not like them. Until
there is a sense that politics gets it and that it is like us, that gap
of trust between the voter and the votee, if I may call us
that, will grow. It is extremely
significant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:27:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000287">It
is only in the past four years, for example, that we have had any
Muslim women in this Parliament. On the Labour Benches in the previous
Parliament, the hon. Members for Gloucester (Parmjit Dhanda) and for
Bradford West (Marsha Singh) were Sikhs. Now on the Government Benches
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:28:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Wolverhampton South West (Paul Uppal) is a Sikh. I know that my
Sikh constituents believe that I can understand their
issues—such as whether Britain was involved in the invasion of
the Golden Temple or not—but they want to make sure
that somebody who has the gut feeling, the cultural baggage which is so
important to them is part of the conversation. Having that genuinely
does change the
conversation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000288" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000288">I
will never forget the conversation that I had with the Clerk to the
Defence Committee in about 1998. I asked him whether having women on
the Defence Committee had made a difference. It was the first time
there had been any women on that Committee ever. “Of
course,” he said. I asked what difference. He said,
“Well, we always used to talk just about how big the bombs were,
and now we talk about the families and children of the soldiers and the
other people who are out there defending us.” It seems to me
quite obvious that if we are asking someone to be extraordinarily
brave, the most important thing for them to know is that their family
is safe. It is a no-brainer, but it took women on that Committee to
have that insight.</hs_Para>

is true that diversity brings different kinds of insight. If we miss
out on those insights, politics is poorer. For example, one of the
achievements of the Speaker’s Conference was changing the rules
in relation to Members of Parliament who have mental health challenges.
The interesting thing since those rules changed is that a number of
colleagues have been able to come out and say that they have suffered
from poor mental health, and that has helped the general public feel,
“Oh, maybe they’re more normal.” Confessing to
abnormalities has made people feel that we actually have the same
struggles and challenges as
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:30:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000290" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000290">I

as politicians know that it is political party activists who only ever
go to talk to people about politics and how to vote. I am very proud
that I and my Labour colleagues have spoken to at least 18,000 electors
in Slough since December. We are very dynamic in the way we go to talk
to voters and we can probably claim the best record in the country.
That is one of the reasons why I am still the Member of Parliament for
Slough, because my constituents know that they can engage with people
on the doorstep who are like them—people who might not feel
comfortable doing what Members do in this Chamber every day and who
might not be able to make the sacrifices in their lives that many of us
have made in ours, but who nevertheless recognise that political

of the things that really worries me is that the media perceive
political parties as a conspiracy against the voters and as somehow
trying to defraud them, and I believe that we feed that conspiracy by
having a lot of private little arrangements to deal with things. For
example, we have no formal maternity or sick leave arrangements.
Instead, the Whips secretly make deals across the Chamber to pair
Members. Why are those things not proper rights and more transparent?
We need them to be. The risk of us looking antediluvian and ancient is
not just because of who gets here and the fact that we do not reflect
the whole of society as well as we ought to, but because of our ancient
habits and ways of doing things and our habit of saying across the

Mordaunt</B> (Portsmouth North) (Con):</Member> The hon. Lady is making
an incredibly important point. When accusations are made about really
appalling behaviour—bullying—they are not made about or
ascribed to an individual behaving badly in the Chamber or outside it,
but to a general group of people. For example, they are 
<?notus-xml column=492?>made about our male colleagues who, on the whole, are kind, supportive
and generous individuals. Do such accusations not perpetuate the
impression that this place is an ordeal, particularly for women,

the tarring; I think that our media are unable to differentiate
sufficiently between groups of people, and therefore ask whether men

make a better world, even though some of them have a very funny idea of
what that world should look like. We have not done enough to advocate
democratic politics as a better way than any other of changing the
world and building a better society. Out of this debate should come
very strong consensus throughout Parliament about such a belief, as

what is happening is that they are people whose lives were quite
normal; who have not been through generations of hateful politics and
developed skin a mile thick; and who found the change to their lives,
their income and their families very challenging. They have thought,

all need to have a bit more solidarity for one another, so that people
who want to do that noble thing of representing constituents and
building a better world do not get put off by the exigencies of public
life. We could all help to meet that challenge through our own
behaviour, whether it is by shouting less at Prime Minister’s
questions or by offering just a little support to someone when they are

particularly political backgrounds—I did serve as a local
councillor for a while, but that was very different from this

the invasion into what were previously perfectly normal lives can be
difficult to take. It has made me question on more than one occasion

the Member for Stourbridge (Margot James), I want to talk about social
class. Much has been said about gender. This place is
under-representative in terms of gender, race and sexuality, but it is
also under-representative in terms of social class. That is not often
spoken about. There is an intense debate about all-women shortlists. I
have always come back at people by saying that there is little use in
replacing a privately educated, middle-class man with a privately
educated, middle-class woman if the person who misses out is, for
example, a working-class, northern mechanic. That does not increase
diversity in this place in any real

that the selection processes for 2010 had changed somewhat, but in all
parties our selection processes still favour people who come from a
certain professional or educational background. At many difficult
comprehensive schools, pupils simply keep their heads down and try to
get on with surviving school, rather than putting themselves forward
for things that might exist in other places such as debating
societies—not at my school—or wanting to be something
called a head boy or a prefect. We did not have anything like that. In
many difficult inner-city comprehensive schools, pupils simply keep
their heads down and get used to not raising them above the parapet,

that benefit? As a school teacher, I was okay doing that; I just
thought I was speaking to a load of five-year-olds—actually,
they are more frightening that the selection executives of local
Conservative associations. However, it certainly feeds into the fact
that a lawyer or a barrister will be more used to doing that kind of

cliques and all the rest of it, it is a bit like a private members

tokenism. I was disgusted with the debate on which party has the most

women MPs on the Labour Benches have said that they are not standing at
the next election than have those on the Conservative Benches—I

in some way, sell favours to our wealthy friends. Well, that is not the
case for the vast majority of us, if any of us. Every institution,

been unsuccessful. Then there were a great many retirements, which
benefited me because plenty of seats became available. It was probably
the Speaker’s Conference that finally pushed me into making
another attempt, and I think that it also sent a message to the

change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000334" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000334">The
first point that I want to make is about the qualities that we have. I
do not think that there are such things as male and female qualities.
Some women—including me, it could be said—enjoy the cut
and thrust of debate, or challenging people, and some men do not. I
think we should acknowledge that we have a mixture of patterns of
behaviour. We know that many men nowadays take out the rubbish and
change nappies. There is even a new word for them. I do not know

[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “Hear, hear.”] So

many Members will know that it took both men and women in the House to
push forward the change in the hours, which has made a huge difference
in giving us a decent, family-friendly workplace. The leaders of the
three main parties, all of them men, supported that proposal.</hs_Para>

point is about diversity. As many Members have pointed out, diversity
is important because it is important for us to look like the country
overall—to represent the full range of people, both able-bodied
and non-able-bodied, including people with have different conditions.
Let me give an example of the way in which Members with long-term
conditions have changed the way in which Parliament works. People with
epilepsy used not to be allowed to climb to the top of the Clock Tower
to see Big Ben. It took two of my co-members of the all-party
parliamentary group on epilepsy, the hon. 
<?notus-xml column=498?>Members for South Thanet (Laura Sandys) and for Blackpool North and
Cleveleys (Paul Maynard), to do such a thing. They climbed the Tower,
as a result of which the rule was changed. Anyone can climb the Tower
now, including people with epilepsy, but if those two Members had not
done so, the change would never have happened. I apologise for not
telling them that I was going to mention them in the debate, but I will
write to them later.</hs_Para>

Members will know, people in a number of professions—including
some in Parliament—used to say things like “This is not a
woman’s job”, and women were kept out of those
professions. There were quotas: for instance, only a certain number of
women could become doctors. It is only when women and people from
different backgrounds are given opportunities that others can see just
how capable we all
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000338">How
do we address that need? You, Mr Speaker, are doing a huge amount to
change our way of doing business in Parliament. For instance, when you
call Members to speak in debates, you alternate between the two sides
of the House, and check whether the women have spoken. We owe you a
debt of gratitude for the way in which you are changing Parliament. I
was very honoured to be part of your delegation to Burma, Mr
Speaker. When we were there people were asking, “How do you
change Parliament?” I think you will recall that I gave them the
example of how you have changed the way we take part in debates. You
look around and see who has not spoken before—Members on the
Back Benches, for example—and do not necessarily give first
place to Members on the Front Benches or those who have had a lot of
speaking time. You are going some way towards addressing the way
Parliament works, therefore, and it is much appreciated, certainly from
the 2010
intake<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:00:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000339">How
do we address these matters? We must have a level playing field. That
involves ensuring, as many Members have said, access to opportunities
and to support, which you are also doing, Mr Speaker. Judges used to be
picked by a tap on the shoulder, and that was the same in lots of
different professions—I think in previous times many Members of
Parliament were picked in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:00:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000340">Turning

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:00:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stourbridge (Margot James) talked about business. She is
right that it is moving ahead of us in certain aspects. Many businesses
now have crèches, and when women have to go on a career break
they do not come back to a lower stage than they were at; their
position is protected. So we do have something to learn from
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:01:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000341" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000341">Let
us focus on the question of positive action. It is always the case that
people have to fulfil the criteria for the post. They are not the
lesser candidate because there is positive action; they are of equal
stature and they have fulfilled the requirements for the post. We have
to look at where there is underrepresentation, and in some instances
men will be given positive action. We start from the premise that
everyone can do the job.

come to this debate from the perspective of being white and male and,
because I was a solicitor by profession before I entered the House, I
would be widely regarded as being middle-class. That points to the

white middle-class males.</hs_Para>

is not the whole story, however, because we need to look more widely
than that. We must look at a person’s background. I came from an
ordinary working-class background in the north of England—in
south Yorkshire, where my father was a steelworker in the rolling mills
in Sheffield. On that score, by all accounts I am underrepresented in
this House. So statistics can be made to prove anything really. The
statistics show that there were 48 solicitors among the Conservative,
Labour and Liberal Democrat Members elected to the House in
2010—some 7.7% of all Members—so we are certainly
over-represented<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:04:46"></hs_TimeCode>.

women. I remember one occasion when we had all gone out for an evening

British Asian, with just 37% white. The Labour candidate was Mr Imran
Hussain, a Muslim, who was the deputy leader of Bradford council. He
was no outsider; he was not parachuted in from London. Any observer
would have thought he was the ideal candidate, yet, as we all know he
lost not by just a few votes but by more than 10,000 votes, and he was
beaten by a man who is
white—the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:07:15"></hs_TimeCode>

of the key requirements for this job is an immense amount of self

in schools, we tend to find that in primary school, children are

secondary school, we find significant differences between the way boys
and girls perceive themselves. Children who consider themselves to be
not so bright academically think that they are second rate compared
with those more successful pupils. We often hear children saying,
“Oh, they never pick anyone from this class.” They may
also say that about the street in which they live. We must deal with
that sort of attitude, because confidence is such a key part of
political representation. We have to believe that we can do something

councils can be effective in primary schools. Quite often, young pupils
come forward with good ideas, and they have opportunities to implement
them. In secondary schools, there is less of a direct connection
between what pupils come up with and what can be

for Llanelli (Nia Griffith) and I welcome today’s motion, for
the fact remains that, 
<?notus-xml column=503?>notwithstanding recent progress, both women and ethnic minorities are
woefully under-represented in our Parliament today. So what are the
facts? As we have heard, we have 27 ethnic minority MPs, which is just
4% of the total number of MPs, whereas about 18%—not the 8%
mentioned earlier—of the population are represented in the 2011
census as coming from a non-white background. We have 147 women MPs in
Parliament, which represents 23% of all MPs, whereas just over 50% of
the population are women. Clearly, we can do better and we must do
better.</hs_Para>

co-chairman and co-founder of Women2Win, I intend to limit my remarks
to what my organisation has been doing to address the concerns
legitimately raised in the motion. Parliament and political
representation is made stronger by diversity, and we should all be
working to make this change happen. Without buy-in from men, attempts
to encourage more women into Parliament will not be as successful as
they could be, so we all need to engage with the issue of diversity of
representation. I strongly believe that, which is why I co-founded
Women2Win in 2005, in order to work with other parliamentarians to
address the imbalance. Back then, there were only 17 female
Conservative MPs—a paltry 9% of our MPs. Women2Win was launched
in November 2005 by myself and Baroness Jenkin to support and enable
more Conservative women to gain election to Parliament. Women2Win helps
a substantial number of women candidates to gain selection and
election, through headhunting, mentoring, training and supporting in a
variety of ways. Over the course of 2013, we have had more than 30 MPs
volunteering their time and expertise to run training sessions and to
mentor candidates, and I am pleased to say that more than half of those
volunteers have been men.</hs_Para>

there is a closed shop, or guild, for politicians, and I worry that
that is very much to the fore at the moment. All political parties need
to do more to dilute
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000390">The
final area that I want to talk about is business experience. The Labour
party has been very good at diversifying the make-up of those on the
Opposition Benches, but it has been particularly poor when it 
<?notus-xml column=505?>comes to getting Members with a business background.
Figures from the Library show that just 20 Labour MPs out of 257 have a

experience, particularly experience of micro-business and small and
medium-sized enterprises, to stand for our party.</hs_Para>

easy solutions, and I will not go into lots of detail, because of the
time, but we need to put more effort into encouraging people to come
forward for selection, and to change the culture in our political
parties. Earlier this week, I wrote a piece for the <I>Manchester
Evening News</I> about having a turnout threshold for elections of, for
argument’s sake, 20%, so that if not enough people voted in an
election, there would be no political representative. That is quite
controversial, but it would concentrate political parties’ minds
on who they selected and whether that person related to the community
that they were trying to represent. It would certainly make candidates
work harder. Also, if MPs in safer seats perhaps relaxed too much,
there would be an emphasis on them to get out and do more. There is
also an argument for looking at
primaries.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000392" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0003.htm#14022785000392">To

Stewart</B> (Beckenham) (Con):</Member> I will be as quick as I can, Mr
Speaker. Fifty-one per cent. of our population are women, so if we are
to be fair, 51% of Members of Parliament should be women. There should
be more chance of the Prime Minister being a women than a man under
those circumstances. Looking at the numbers, the Labour party does
better than the other parties by a factor of at least two, but no
political party reflects our population, so how can we balance the
equation better? The best way is for society to change, so that people
do not even question the idea that women should naturally be in
Parliament.</hs_Para>

changing through societal evolution, rather than revolution. As hon.
Members can tell, I am entering young old age, and I accept that some,
particularly on the Conservative Benches, will look at me as a
dinosaur. I somewhat reflect my generation. I freely admit that I have
not done enough to equal the effort made by my wife when it comes to my
family; it is something like 90% effort from her, and 10% from me.
Maintaining our home has really been up to her, and I am not a very
good father, at least in terms of care, but my children—I have
several—are very different from their old man. Those with
children of their own do not even question the need to share duties,
the idea that women should be equal, or the idea that Parliament should
be made up equally of men and women. That is wonderful.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Brigg and Goole (Andrew Percy) said, there is no
point in a constituency denying a strong local working-class man being
the Member of Parliament by insisting that in that particular
constituency, where perhaps he has worked for years, there must be an
all-women shortlist. No, the way forward is to recognise, as my hon.
Friend said, that society is changing. It is a mystery why Conservative
associations, which have always been dominated by women, have selected
so few women. There was some feeling perhaps in the past of
“Where I cannot go, why should I send somebody else?”
There was perhaps a feeling of jealousy. All that is changing, so we do
not need to impose our centralising tendencies on our local
associations; we need to have confidence that they will themselves want
to select more women and the best candidates.
One<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:39:17"></hs_TimeCode> of the ways
forward is through the open primary system. That is highly democratic.
It takes power back to the local people. It takes it away from the

way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000413" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000413"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>I

give up a successful practice to come and live under our present
expenses system, to be stuck in a rented one-bedroom flat, and not just
for the occasional business trip, but for half her working life? It is
difficult. The problem is not so much that we have created structures

Thornberry</B> (Islington South and Finsbury) (Lab):</Member> I
requested this debate to help secure the heritage of the British postal
museum and archive. It was closed in the mid-1990s and, if the plans go
well, a new museum will, at long last, open its doors and the public
will once more have access to not just stamps, but the history of
communication and the social history that will be on
display.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000457" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000457">When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:00:39"></hs_TimeCode>
I first thought about the possibility of having a stamp museum
just outside my constituency, I did not think that it would
necessarily set the world alight. However, as has been
explained to me, it is about communication and, particularly, how we
communicated throughout the 20th century. The way in which we
communicate with one another is, in the end, what makes us different
from the
animals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000458" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000458">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>
am sure that the House will be pleased to hear that I will discuss
Royal Mail without delivering a tirade about the outrageous proposal to
develop the Mount Pleasant site above ground. The Minister will know
that Mount Pleasant is one of the largest development sites in London,
yet, of the 650 homes that are proposed for the site, only 12% will be
affordable housing. That is frankly scandalous, particularly given that
the viability report shows that it could support more than 50% of
proper affordable housing and still make a profit. However, I will not
talk about that
today<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:01:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000459">I
want to make it clear that there is a difference between the
development overground and the development underground. The development
underground is the railway and to the side of that is the new postal
museum. There is a distinct difference. It is important to underline
that difference because the new postal museum and archive and the
underground railway will apply to the council for planning permission
on 10 March and, on the same day, the council will not be asked to
discuss the plans for Mount Pleasant above ground because the
developers have decided to bypass local opposition and go straight to
the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson. They hope that they will get a
better hearing from him than they would get locally, where we are all
against the development. We are not against the British postal museum
and
archive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:02:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000460">As
the Minister will know, the museum and archive has strong historical
links to the Royal Mail Group. It is an independent charity in its own
right and is the caretaker of a remarkable history, some of which I
will share with the House. Currently, the archive is based at Freeling
House. Freeling was the secretary to the Post Office, which was the
equivalent of a chief executive. Because of his expertise in
international mail routes, particularly across the continent of Europe,
he was an extremely effective spy during the Napoleonic wars. He was
therefore not only the chief executive of the Post Office, but a spy
from the 1780s until the 1820s. He collected all the accounts, mail
coach maps and employee records and put them into an archive. He was
therefore the founding father of the
archive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:03:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

are other, more immediately attractive items. There is a remarkable
sheet of stamps that depict the ageing Edward VII. The stamp was known
as the Tyrian plum and was used only once. On the night that the old
King died, one of the stamps was sent to the new King. The used stamp
that was sent to the new King is in the royal collection and the sheet
of unused stamps is in the archive. That was the only time that the
stamp was used to post a letter. George V, who was an avid philatelist,
collected
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:03:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000462" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000462">Another
remarkable sheet of stamps was designed in the 1970s. At that time, it
took a long time to design a stamp, print it and make it available, so
they had to be prepared in advance. Scotland was in the World cup
finals in 1978, so stamps were produced so that they would be ready if
Scotland won the cup. Those stamps are in the archive and will be
available for the public to see, so long as the museum is established.
The stamps depict the winning team holding aloft the World
cup and celebrating victory, which, tragically, was never
realised<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:04:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000463" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000463">Another
stamp documents Churchill’s plan during the second world war,
when there was concern that France would fall. Churchill’s plan
was to unite the Kingdoms of Britain and France so that they would
stand together and France would not be able to capitulate to the
Germans. A stamp was designed to celebrate the uniting of the two
countries. The plan did not work, but it is evidence of attempts that
were made during the second world war. Such things one learns from
stamps.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000464" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000464">The
museum is not only about stamps that depict history; the postal archive
holds hundreds of paintings, letters, telegrams and photographs
documenting Britain’s social history. There are two telegrams
from the owners of the Titanic, one from the evening of 14 April 1912
declaring that rumours of the Titanic’s distress were unfounded,
and another from the following morning announcing the death of more
than 1,500 people and saying that women and children had been saved.
The museum owns 100,000 photographs taken by Stephen Tallents, the
person who first coined the term “public relations” and
was the first public relations manager of the Post Office. In the
1930s, he revolutionised how companies were to communicate with the
public.</hs_Para>

many of the posters put up to promote the Post Office in the 1930s was
copied by London Underground, and if we compare some of London
Underground’s more famous posters with those produced by the
Post Office immediately before, we can see where it got the idea. At
long last, when the museum is finally opened in my constituency, those
posters will be available to be seen. They include photographs of
postmen in the 1930s delivering across the country, including to fields
where women and children were working, and to washerwomen in Poplar.
All sorts of different things were delivered. There are photographs of
a postman delivering live fish, and another of a postman holding two
dead game birds in both hands—it seems that pheasants could be
delivered as long as they were not leaking at the time.</hs_Para>

document in the collection dates from 1636 and is a letter from Charles
I to the mayor of Hull. The mayor is told in fairly clear terms that
the mail service is now a monopoly and that he is no longer allowed to
use his own personal service. He is told that the monopoly is now under
ownership of the king and that he must cease using the local mail. It
is a remarkable and unique version of history.</hs_Para>

to spend £10 million on a new archive and museum, and £12
million on the little known rail mail—another gem. The rail mail
runs under my constituency and many others across the heart London. It
was devised in 1911 and completed in 1927 and is a underground railway
that served the main sorting offices from Whitechapel to Paddington.
The idea was to link the major railway stations across London so that
mail coming into Liverpool Street could be delivered straight from
Paddington and out the other side. Therefore, if someone in east
England wanted to write to west England, the post would go down to the
underground railway line. We talk about producing new railways and the
ideas behind them, but that was the first Crossrail devised many years
ago. It was built at a time when the belief was that we would—of
course—continue to invest in the Post Office because the amount
of post would increase and people would always want to communicate with
one another.</hs_Para>

railway line was built across central London, knowing that people were
likely to want to expand the line in future, spurs were built so that
if it was necessary to have a new line going out to Oxford street,
there was a spur already there. It could simply be blocked off at one
end and the railway line not closed completely, and the line could be
expanded. Things are so different now; now we build to a contract and
only to that contract, and hope that we will build it in time and to
budget. The project was built with vision, confidence, and with a
positive attitude for the future of Royal Mail. So unlike our current
times, unfortunately.</hs_Para>

Royal Mail allowed mass communication across the UK and ran for 76
years. The public have never been allowed to see the railway, but
hopefully when the railway museum is opened people will, at long last,
be able to go down to see it. There is huge excitement not just in
train circles, but for many people who are interested in the industrial
heritage of Britain in the 20th century, and they will be able to ride
on that railway underneath the streets of

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:14:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Islington South and Finsbury (Emily Thornberry) on securing this
debate on the future of 
<?notus-xml column=519?>the postal museum and the Post Office railway. I
commend her for such an entertaining and informative speech, which I
think we all enjoyed.</hs_Para>

Government recognise that the British postal museum and archive is the
leading resource for all aspects of British postal history in the
United Kingdom. These records are designated as being of outstanding
national importance. The BPMA was established by Royal Mail in 2004 as
an independent charity to manage and preserve the Royal Mail archive
and to be the custodian of the museum’s collection. As well as
housing the world’s greatest collection of British postage
stamps, the museum and archive hold written records of the
GPO and the Post Office, staff records, telegrams—as we have
heard—posters, photographs, uniforms, pillar boxes, an amazing
collection of postal vehicles including a five-wheeled
“pentacycle”, and a fascinating variety of other
artefacts, including the signature stamp of Anthony Trollope, who
worked for the Post Office for over 30 years, and sheets of
the Penny Black, the postage stamp that is at the heart of the history
of the universal service.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022785000483" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000483">The BPMA
effectively safeguards visual, written and physical records from 400
years of postal history. It acknowledged some time ago that in order to
secure a sustainable future for that heritage, it would need to
relocate and redevelop the museum and archive. The current premises at
Freeling House have space and access limitations; they are also prone
to intermittent flooding, so the staff have had to deal with additional
curatorial issues. As the hon. Lady told us, there was previously a
Post Office museum, but it closed in 1998. Since then, a large part of
the collections has been held at a storage facility in Essex, or held
by other museums around the country. It is clear that the BPMA needs a
permanent and damp-free home, for its museum collections in particular
but also to lay the foundations for a more sustainable
future.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022785000484" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000484">The plans
that the BPMA has set in play to address the situation are beginning to
pay off. These are exciting times. An existing building near the Mount
Pleasant complex is to be the new home for the archive, and the
surrounding land will be used to build a new exhibition space. The
selected building, Calthorpe House, has been provided by Royal Mail,
and planning permission has been granted for the development of a
museum building on adjacent land. The BPMA is also proceeding with
plans to bring back into service part of the historic mail rail
underground system—which we have heard about—as an
additional visitors’ attraction. That will enhance the
visitors’ experience, and I am sure that it will attract many
people to the hon. Lady’s
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000485" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000485">The
cost of all the redevelopment—again, as we have heard—is
just over £22 million, which is a significant sum. The BPMA has
secured much of that funding from a number of sources. Royal Mail and
Post Office Ltd remain firmly committed to the work of the BPMA and to
the redevelopment project. Donald Brydon, the chairman of Royal Mail,
has been a great advocate for the BPMA, and has been consistently in
touch with me about it. Royal Mail has made available a 999-year lease
on Calthorpe House—the new museum and archive premises—at
a nominal rent, and further donations of £350,000 have been made
in respect of preparation work for the new
museum.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000486" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000486">Both
Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd continue to make payments to the BPMA as
part of the ongoing arrangements. For example, in 2012 a
£640,000 charitable 
<?notus-xml column=520?>donation was made for the running and maintenance of the museum. Fees of
£400,000 were also paid for archive services provided by the
BPMA in order to ensure that Royal Mail and Post Office Ltd would meet
their obligations under the Public Records Act 1958, and, in doing so,
would themselves ensure that records of social and historic importance
were preserved and made publicly available after 20
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000487" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000487">Royal
Mail and Post Office Ltd have also contributed to the new project by
providing soft loans and grants of just over £7.5 million, to be
paid at various stages of the redevelopment. To secure the loans, the
BPMA prepared a commercial business case which will enable it to be
more self-funding in future—by, for example, charging for mail
rail, and allowing its facilities to be hired for corporate events. The
BPMA has also secured access to heritage lottery funding of over
£4.25 million, and was awarded £250,000 as initial
funding, with access to a further £4 million-plus. My Department
arranged a contribution of £70,000 to the BPMA last year. That
came about as a result of the terms of the retail share offer element
of the initial public offering which we saw through successfully in
October. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:19:31"></hs_TimeCode>Under
the terms of the offer, any sums less than the offer price of one
ordinary share were not to be refunded to the applicant, but the
Secretary of State could give these amounts to charitable
purposes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000488"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:19:32"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Emily Thornberry" PimsId="4821" UID="14022785000688" xid="857" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000688">Emily

considered what charitable donation would be most appropriate and we
thought a donation to the BPMA was the most merited of the various
possibilities canvassed. The BPMA is also raising significant funds
from charities and foundations by selling surplus duplicate stamp
collections and related material and using corporate donors to help to
raise the funds needed. All proceeds from such duplicate stamp sales
are ring-fenced for use by the BPMA. The BPMA also has
effective plans in place—along the lines of its existing
fundraising activities—to attract the outstanding funds
needed for the
project.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000491" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000491">I
hope that today’s debate has served to highlight the highly
important work for which the BPMA is responsible as custodian of our
postal heritage. That is deserving of wider recognition, and I think
deserving of the highest praise given the history of the museum and
some of the hiccups along the way. Through the hard work and
determination of the BPMA’s administrators over the last few
years, this truly worthy project is now within touching distance of
coming to fruition, and to get this far is a magnificent achievement in
its own
right<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022785000492" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/debtext/140227-0004.htm#14022785000492">I
would like to take this opportunity to thank all who have already made
contributions to the redevelopment project. Through their generosity a
very important part of Britain’s history will be preserved for
the benefit and enrichment of everyone—most importantly, of
course, future
generations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:22:05"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would encourage all charitable trusts and foundations, corporate

any necessary additional funding can soon be secured to ensure that
work can start on schedule for the planned opening in 2016. In the
interim I hope that anybody listening to this debate, including those
of us who have engaged in it, will be encouraged by the BPMA’s
plans and will seriously consider paying a visit to the museum, as I
intend to do, to find out more about a key period of our modern

Committee for supporting me in applying for this debate, and those hon.
Members who have found the time, on a day when attendance here in
Parliament is not compulsory, to join me in supporting this important
agenda, which is incredibly timely given the recent debate and coverage
in the media about concerns over care.data and the wider issues that it
raises. I thank the Select Committee on Health for its hearing earlier
this week and its support for this
debate.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000009">It
is no exaggeration to say that the use of patient data is one of the
most important subjects being debated in this Parliament, because the
use of such data is central to numerous important quiet revolutions.
The first is discovering and preventing another Mid-Staffordshire NHS
Trust, possibly the biggest institutional failure in public services in
recent decades. It is also key to planning the health and care of an
ageing society, the costs of which are one of the key drivers of the
health budget element of the structural deficit that promises to hold
this country in debt.</hs_Para>

to evidence-based policy making and the modernisation of 21st-century
NHS services to tackle the chronic gap in health productivity. They are
key to tackling the growing medicines deficit, which is causing the NHS
and the UK to fall ever lower in the league tables for access to new
medicines. They are key to helping unlock the UK’s ability not
just to tackle that but to turn it on its head by becoming a global hub
of the new model of patient-centred drug discovery sweeping the globe.
Finally, they are crucial to generating huge new revenues for the
national health service and potentially massive savings in the drugs
budget by making the UK the best place in the world to design the new
generation of 21st-century targeted and personalised medicines, which
are replacing the old one-size-fits-all model of drug design—the
old big pharma blockbuster model—which is failing.</hs_Para>

report highlighted a major crisis in the NHS and was a massive wake-up
call for all of us. Let us remember that thousands of patients suffered
unnecessarily as the result of a massive systemic failure of health
care delivery that was deliberately and shockingly ignored by health
professionals, who ignored whistleblowers. It was not identified by any
management data at the time, because although we were recording it, we
were 
<?notus-xml column=174?>not using it. The use of outcomes data to measure outcomes and
performance is utterly core to the successful delivery of modern
services across our society. The biggest crisis in this debate is not
our over-exploitation of NHS data but our shameful failure to allow
transparent performance management in the NHS and care sectors
earlier.</hs_Para>

seen these last few weeks, issues involving the use of patient data can
arouse a storm of controversy and highly charged emotional and partisan
debate, including a hugely visceral set of conspiracy fears based on
the idea of big government allowing their friends in big business to

of Governments to manage data securely. This debate is fuelled by and,
at worst, worsening a profound collapse of trust generally in
Government and big business, which is becoming something of a defining

Freeman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a powerful point. I will
acknowledge later the veracity of some of the points raised, but he is
right that some irresponsible fears have been raised, which do nothing

due to that debacle, many now ask whether there is a future for this
quiet revolution in the use of patient data to deliver the benefits
outlined above. After all the controversy and public backlash, where
can the hope of a data-led NHS go? Is public trust now so low that the
Arab spring of health outcomes and transparency is over? I suggest that
it is not, and that the Government and NHS England’s decision to
delay the care.data initiative in order to give more time for a wider
public discourse provides a platform for rebuilding public trust and
confidence. I will make some specific suggestions for the Government to
consider that I think would go a long way towards achieving
that.</hs_Para>

by sketching out the revolution that I believe is currently under way
in 21st-century medicine and how data are central to driving it. I will
then show how the ten-minute rule Bill that I have introduced on
patient rights over patient data, and the “Patients4Data”
campaign that I helped to found, some of whose members are here in the
gallery, are articulating the benefits of patient data. I will then
summarise and address the understandable concerns of many patient data
opponents, which have been aired in the past few weeks. We must carry
public trust and confidence; how can we put measures in place to combat
those concerns? Finally, I will set out how I believe the scheme can be
saved and

light, or let failures of health care delivery like those in
Mid-Staffordshire be compounded by failures of parliamentary and

they have a duty of care to the patients of this country, so we as
elected representatives have a duty of care to the democratic process

quiet revolution in modern medicine. I suggest that slowly but surely,
21st-century health is changing from something done to us by government
when government has thought that we needed it to something that modern
citizens do for ourselves. It is a revolution ultimately driven by data
in three profound ways—a quiet revolution in transparency of
outcomes across the NHS; in research and how medicines are developed;
and in empowerment of patients to take more responsibility for their
own health care.</hs_Para>

of attorney for my elderly mother, who was hospitalised last summer.
When she came out of hospital, as thousands of our constituents do
every day, she was suffering and in pain, and not getting the care that
she needed. I wanted to be able to log on quickly to see what her
diagnosis was, what she had been prescribed by way of pain relief and
which of the mountain of expensive multicoloured pills she had been
prescribed over the previous weeks and months she should have been
taking that afternoon. I wanted to be able to ask the right questions
of the system and the people in it when she was unable to do so for
herself. Why could she not simply have given me her login password so
that I, with power of attorney, could log on with her NHS number to her
care record and see at a glance live information on her
condition?</hs_Para>

outcomes and patient empowerment. The frightening truth is that we are
currently in a dark age in some areas of our health service. The

second and perhaps most groundbreaking application of data is in
research. The truth is that the traditional model of medicines
development on which we and the NHS have relied for almost 50 years, in
which the pharmaceutical industry goes away for us and spends hundreds

perfect drug claiming to suit everyone, is a model that neither we nor

had a career in biomedical research, my experience is that over the

I spent the last seven years of my career in biomedical science and
research helping to create partnerships in the NHS between NHS
clinician scientists, research charities, industry and university
scientists, in order to try to accelerate the process by which modern
medicines are discovered and

place in the world where we develop and design 21st-century medicines
targeted at the patients who need them, and generate extraordinary
opportunities for NHS patients and clinicians. Instead of being a
country that can no longer afford a spiralling drug bill and that,
through inevitable rationing, becomes an ever less attractive place to
develop and launch new drugs—accelerating our crisis in access

shall give an example that brings that opportunity to life. The last
project that I worked on before coming to Parliament was at
King’s college here in London, with Professor Simon Lovestone,
the head of research at the college’s academic health science
centre and the professor of psychiatry. The project was funded by the
NHS National Institute for Health Research and looked at the catchment
population of the South London and Maudsley NHS mental health
trust—250,000 patients suffering from a range of mental health
ailments. Members will be aware that there is no magic bullet drug in
mental health; there is a huge cocktail of some very difficult drugs,
with often hugely traumatic experiences and side effects for patients.
It is an unsatisfactory area of modern health care in which we are
still failing a large number of patients, despite the best efforts of
those seeking to care for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000028">The
system that was put in place, funded by the NIHR, created an anonymised
data set of the 250,000 patients, which allows researchers to look
across that cohort at relationships between medicines and outcomes and
between disease diagnosis and MRI scans. It shines a light on which
drugs are working for which patients and starts to allow us to improve
treatments, target the right drugs to the right patients, and begin to
understand the complex interplay of genetic, lifestyle and
pharmaceutical factors shaping disease, as well as giving possible
opportunities for breakthroughs in diagnosis and
treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000029">Interestingly,
in the context of the anonymisation debate, crucial to the success of
the NIHR-funded system is the ability to trace and analyse GPs’
notes in a long sequence of diagnoses for an individual patient, and to
understand the interaction of a number of different factors in that
patient’s life in predicting particular patterns of
predisposition and response to drugs. In discussing anonymity,
pseudo-anonymisation and total anonymisation, we must therefore be
careful to ensure that we support a system that allows the right people
to use the right data in the right way in order to drive health
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000030">We

Freeman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend has put his finger on it. I will
come in due course to some detailed ideas, but his question merits an
“in principle” response. It was proposed in the initial
version of care.data to use one or two advisory boards within NHS
England. Their memberships are not particularly accountable or
transparent, and nor are their criteria, although they are no doubt
staffed by laudable and well-meaning public professionals. My hon.
Friend’s question shines a light on the issue—what is the
basis on which different sorts of data are being released, for what
purpose and to
whom?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000033">Later
on I will suggest that we ought to be putting such advisory bodies and
the framework for data release on a statutory footing, with protections
to help to secure public trust and confidence. We must also ensure that
Parliament can look—annually, biannually, or whatever might be
appropriate—at ensuring for itself, and for the benefit of our
constituents, that the system is working as intended. My hon.
Friend’s key point is that if we are to maintain public trust
and confidence in a system based on opt-out—that is essential
for the data set to be maintained at the level of scale and competence
required for its function—we must earn the right to win over
public support for opt-out. If we do not put in place the right
protections, we will not earn that right, and we will risk large
numbers of patients opting out. If that happens, we would have been
better off putting in place protections that we would have preferred
not to be necessary, but were, in order to secure public
confidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000034">To
return to the system in the South London and Maudsley NHS mental health

opportunities for us here in London—and Britain more

third and most important reason this quiet revolution of NHS data is so
important is in what I call empowerment. If health care is to move from
being something that Government do to us to something that we
increasingly, as modern health care citizens, take responsibility for,
we need to be empowered to engage in that health care economy. We need
to be enabled to take more responsibility for our own health, our own
health outcomes and our own predispositions to disease, and enabled to
embrace an active role as health citizens able to use the system to
drive the search for new treatments and cures; and we need to be given
the tools to play a more active role in shaping our own health care

medicine has essentially been passive: we wait until we get a condition

will be all about empowering a new generation of health care citizens
to be proactive, taking an active interest and role in preventing
disease, and helping to engage as patients in research and in treatment
as patient support networks. The revolution in social media and the
internet is already playing a profound role in allowing that to happen,
making Britain the home of some extraordinary work that is being driven
by our medical research charities in bringing patients together to
support research, and also to support treatment, care and networks. It

to their disease, often going back to interrogate old data from
yesterday’s drugs, or failed drugs, to discover whether they
might have worked for particular patient catchments and cohorts. That

particularly when patients are hungry for information, to stumble into
and across the wrong source—unhelpful sources of
information—and GPs often find themselves having to correct
their patients and put them back on track, but I do not think that that
is a reason to say that the revolution is wrong or bad. It is a reason

right to opt out has triggered a massive backlash and public debate

country compared with Europe. We are the only country that has a chief
scientific officer in every Department, and that has a cabinet of chief
scientists that meet weekly to advise the Government as a whole as well
as their individual Ministers. Only three other nations in Europe have
a system of chief scientific officers. Britain has an opportunity to

He proceeded to ask yes/no questions, including, “Do you like
coffee?” and “Do you like tea?” The answers,

UK is pioneering a new model of patient-centred biomedical research.
Across the world, the life science industry is radically reconstituting
itself around what everybody is coming to recognise as the most

model of targeted medicine unlocks the biggest prize of all: a new
model of reimbursement, where, instead of our officials sitting in

one-size-fits-all blockbuster drugs with the pharmaceutical industry,
which neither we nor they, increasingly, can afford, we get to be the
country getting drugs at reduced

working with industry, is increasingly vital to the development of new
medicines. Charlie raised the money through local fundraising to fund a

debate in the past few months. For example, despite newspaper reports

need to make it very clear that the experience of other European
nations shows the importance of having an opt-out system. In Austria,
which has an opt-out system, the consent rate is 99.98%. In Germany,
which has a similar culture, economy and demographic situation to
Austria’s but has an opt-in system, the consent rate is
currently running at 12%. That has profound consequences for
Germany’s public health planning and ability to unlock all the

health system excluded from comprehensive outcome transparency? I do

patients can access their data and use them to discover and drive a new
world of health care. My Bill sets out measures to make the data
available, using the NHS number as a unique identifier, abolishing
charges and letting patients access their data quickly.</hs_Para>

need to enshrine a new duty of care on NHS and social care providers to
collect data properly, using the NHS number to ensure that we foster a
culture of open data and transparency across the health system. My Bill
sets out why that should be a contractual obligation, created through a
new clause in the contracts of GPs and clinicians. There should also be
a new duty of responsibility on NHS and care institutions to ensure
that they are properly collecting and recording data in a way that
patients and GPs can access through an integrated pathway
record.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000074">Thirdly,
we must put the data release advisory bodies on a proper statutory
footing so that the public can have confidence that those bodies have
proper oversight and governance arrangements. We must set out more
clearly the different protections for different fields of data. There
is a big difference between the use of summary care data and the use of
genetic or detailed diagnosis data, and we need to acknowledge and
consider different levels of consent.</hs_Para>

changing what is possible. Sophisticated automated online consent
systems are being developed—by great British software companies,
as it happens. Those systems could help provide patients with that
subtlety of consent framework. That concern is inherent in some of the

Secretary of State should be required appropriately to sign off on
different levels  of data, but equally one
does not want him to spend too much of his time signing off
on individual data release. We need a framework that the public can
have real trust

we need a tougher statutory framework, with real criminal sanctions for
data breaches. That would reassure the public. Campaigners are right to
suggest that fines are of little real deterrence to some. To give 
<?notus-xml column=187?>the public ultimate reassurance about the safety of their data, we must
look again at the punishments that can be handed out for data breaches.
There is simply no way we can ever win the argument on protecting the
public’s data unless there are clear penalties.</hs_Para>

delay in the roll-out of care.data is a valuable opportunity to address
a number of widespread concerns. Ultimately, we must assure the public
that their data will be used only to save lives and improve our
collective health. Rather than focus on who has access to data, we
should focus on how the data are used, and we can do that through a
combination of those five new steps.</hs_Para>

I call for the Minister to take this opportunity to set up a proper
formal working party of interested parties to address these issues, to
show how fears can be addressed and to report back on a workable
solution that could command the confidence of those concerned. We need
to do that now. If we enact some of the described measures, and
possibly others, and set up such a working group, we can use that
six-month delay to get into a position where, when the care.data is
relaunched in October, we have not just dealt with some of the
concerns, but built a profound sense of public, patient and GP support
for the process and the benefits that will flow from the use of these
data. While there are always risks to any endeavour, the debate does
not, as it has in the past few weeks, have to be characterised by a
stale and overly polarised insistence on security on the one hand and
data use on the other.</hs_Para>

explore the issues, break them down and tackle them. There is no
security for the patient unable to live another 20 years because the
data system is incomplete. In short, this is a make or break moment for
the NHS and for public health in the UK. Will we embrace the new world
of 21st-century health care, or do we want to let those advances be
lost in the muddle of fear and reassurances that the public do not
trust? We need to take robust action now to deal with the criticisms at
hand. By doing so, we can make use of the truly world-leading
reservoirs of data that the NHS has, for the benefit of us

projections about structural deficits and the cost of ageing. It is
about one simple question: who wants to be better for longer? With the
right safeguards in place, I know that there is only one real answer to
that question, which is that we all want to be better for longer and we
want to live in a society that is using every means at its disposal

conclusion, this debate and process can be a moment—not just
here today at 2.26 pm, but this year—for our politics to
demonstrate itself at its best. It can be a coming together of
interests, with Parliament and politicians listening to the debate,
taking the best arguments and working together in a non-partisan way to

medical benefits of the exercise. I concede that medical improvements

is not a dialogue; NHS England and the body with the long initials that
was set up are not listening. They do not intend to listen or allow the
public a real choice in the matter—that is the problem. If those
bodies did as the hon. Gentleman said and saw the matter as, “If
we are going to do this, we must gain the trust of the public”,
we would all be in a better position. However, I do not see that as
their objective, which has always been to get through the formal
parliamentary Committee and medical-world structure. The less we know,
the less interference from us and the fewer decisions we are allowed to
take, the better, because the world will be better. Well, the world
will be better medically, but the dangers that we are spelling out, in

dangers worry us in two ways. The first is the bringing together of the
databases into one huge database, where all the information about an
individual patient is stored. That is an important technological
computer problem—a difficult problem that has to be argued out.
The second worry, which I think is the greater, is also difficult. The
exercise so far would not lead an objective member of the public to
trust the authorities. The worry is about the flow of information out
of that database to people outside the national health service or
social
care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000089">I

gets their pile and looks for an individual letter—no. They know
it is Monday, so the pile goes into the bin. That was how the document

“Information will also help us to:”; and “What
will we do with the information?”. It is all favourable. It is
all on the medical side. That is not disputed, if we get the data
together and look at complaints and how they are handled. I am a lad

information in ways one could never do with pen and paper. That is

section called, “What choice do I have?” Anyone getting a
piece of paper like that would read two pages, be switched off before

article was bigger—a whole front page—but I have not
brought the one that I was going to speak about with me. I think it was
yesterday, or the day before, in <I>The Daily Telegraph</I>, or <I>The
Guardian</I>. It reported that a private firm had been in discussion
with the body that is holding our records and building up the database,
because it wants to buy the records, and it wants to buy them quickly.
We have to ask about that individual company having discussions before
the matter is even agreed, but the interesting point was at the end of
the article. Not only was the company set up to deal with
pharmaceutical firms—that is already straightforward—but
the owner set up another company and stated that among the clients
would be pharmaceutical companies. That is the word,
“among”. We have to ask who the other customers
are—the ones that have not been named. If the pharmaceutical
companies are in there, the insurance companies will not be far
behind.</hs_Para>

trust, however, the worst thing is that spokesperson for the body in
question has said that that company has been told that there will not
now be any prior discussions and it must make an application in the
normal way, with others, at a later date. What does that spell
out—that “not now”? Two days after the balloon
goes up, we go into the second period of re-examining the scheme and
the matter is in all the papers, the spokesperson suddenly says,
“We are not now going to have prior discussions with the
firm.” I am sure the Minister will say what in fact the
Secretary of State said on Tuesday in the House, namely that that sort
of thing went on before, but things have been toughened up. Well, the
Secretary of State has toughened things up so much that private
discussions are going on with an organisation that we would all wonder
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000112">A
further issue about trust is this: the records were going to be
uploaded to the big database last autumn, but the process was stopped
because some information about it came into the public arena, and the
organisation took fright and said, “We will look at the
situation for six months.” Those six months, which run out on
1 March —that is, this Saturday—were
used to produce the leaflet I referred to. For all that the
hon. Member for Mid Norfolk says about improved efforts, that was the
response. It was told that it would have to tell the public about the
programme and get the public onside, and the leaflet is what it
produced.</hs_Para>

the records would have started to be uploaded—indeed, there is a
suggestion in some minutes from the HSCIC that maternity and
children’s care records are already being uploaded. I will have
to look at the exact wording of the board minutes, but that is 
<?notus-xml column=193?>worrying. In three months’ time, all the records would have been
in the database and the job would be done, but that was stopped because
of the fuss, including in this place. However, the trust is gone. The
process was stopped because the public had to be told more, but who in
this room feels we have been told more?</hs_Para>

process has been stopped again, and what has the body responsible said
publicly? It has not done what the hon. Member for Mid Norfolk did in
his speech, in which he gave us some information and set out some
starting points for discussion and dialogue to help improve things and
to bring people together—I am grateful to him for that. Instead,
it has said consistently in all the press releases that it is delaying
the scheme so that it can persuade the public how good it is. Perhaps
it will send out the hon. Gentleman’s speech. That would do the
job, because it was wonderful—I could not fault it, as he told
us all the conditions that could be improved.</hs_Para>

are not present could put this case better than me. There are genuine
worries. We represent people whose records are going into the database
without them being aware of what is happening. Questions have been
raised by both Government and Opposition Members, and what does the

months in order to improve a leaflet.</hs_Para>

little light earlier this week, with an article in <I>The

is welcome—saying that the bodies responsible have broadened
their approach: they are now aware that there are dangers in pulling
all these data together and that the question of security has to be
taken more seriously. If that has pushed producing another leaflet to
one side, and they are working on that instead, I think the scheme is
back on the table. Nobody wants to kill it. I have not met anyone who
wants to kill it, or anyone who does not agree that the basis for the
scheme is first class. All we want is for our voices to be heard. I
represent 60,000-odd people, all of whom have medical records. How
could I look one of those people in the eye and say, “I had the
chance to stop your private details being attached to your medical

is the most powerful weapon we have in the fight against disease. For
decades, access to medical data has been integral to meaningful
research—in the 1950s, it showed the link between smoking and
lung cancer; in the 1960s, it proved that thalidomide was harmful to
unborn children; and today, it helps our doctors identify the most
effective treatments for cancer patients—but it is clearly time
to move on from hastily scribbled GP records residing in dusty filing
cabinets. 
<?notus-xml column=197?>Patient data is becoming increasingly critical to ensuring the delivery
of better treatments, and it can radically improve how
long-term conditions are managed and understood in
the NHS and the world of
medicine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000147"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:13:33"></hs_TimeCode>Aligned
to that, we have personalised care, which is, frankly, the future of
medicine. Just a few years ago, cancer was treated by giving all
patients very similar, or the same, surgery and damaging radiotherapy.
As an example, I understand that Cancer Research is now using some
11,000 patient records to see how their cancers respond to particular
treatments. The stratified medicine programme, as it is known, goes to
the genetic core of a cancer to detect the mutations that cause it and
identifies the specific drugs that can stop
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000148"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:14:22"></hs_TimeCode>Researchers
can take on those fragmented pieces of data and collate them. By
identifying broad patterns, they can start to understand the most
effective treatment for specific cancers at the molecular level. That
has undoubtedly developed our understanding significantly. We now know
that one drug is more effective than standard treatment for one branch
of lung cancer and less effective for another. Unlike the
trial-and-error approach of the past, the success of care in the future
will depend on researchers analysing a sample and then
cross-referencing it with a reliable database to identify genetic
markers. A targeted treatment can then be
tailored.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000149">It
is not just cancer that presents opportunities for better data use.
Long-term conditions present one of the most significant challenges for
the NHS, but research enables us to identify the most successful
medications to manage them. The King’s Fund estimates that we
spend £77 billion every year treating long-term conditions. NHS
spending on diabetes, for instance, is set to rise from £9.8
billion to £16.9 billion over the next 25 years. We would be
spending 17% of our current NHS budget just to manage that. If we
replicated those sums of money in lots of other areas of expenditure,
it would clearly be unsustainable. That highlights that we must use
research to identify the most effective treatments, so we can target
resources at
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000150">A
recent Cardiff university study looked at just 10% of GP records in
this country. It compared two different treatments used for type 2
diabetes over the course of 12 years and found that one of
them has a mortality rate that is 58% higher than the other. Patients
naturally seek reassurance that they are being given the best course of
treatment. Colleagues would acknowledge that constituents who come into
our surgeries are very anxious when they believe that the treatment or
drugs they have received are not optimal for their use, and want to
know why others are not available to them. Patients naturally seek
reassurance, but the reality, if we are to reply honestly to our
constituents, is that without expanding the evidence base, it will not
be an easy task to maintain the narrative that most people get the best
drug all the time.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>We have a duty

British Heart Foundation tells us that its researchers face
considerable barriers due to a complex legal framework and the
multitude of bodies involved. That is unacceptable, and it is right

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:18:36"></hs_TimeCode>However,
we should also remember the implications. Just this week, we heard that
researchers are exploring a test that can identify perfectly healthy
patients who are at risk of fatal medical complications based on the
proteins in their cells. I do not presume to understand all that, but I
recognise the principle that as we have more information, we have the
capability to do more, but we remain constrained by the finite budget
of the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000153">On
ethics, the hon. Member for Leeds East referred to security of data and
the lack of assurance. We have presented the use of data as leading to
better outcomes and personalised solutions for patients. We must
recognise that there are also enormous ethical implications in respect
of the prioritisation of finite resources to treat new conditions and
provide new therapies, which may well be just as expensive. So much
more will be possible, but it is important that, in parallel with the
discussion on access to data, we recognise the challenges of providing
an ethical framework for prioritising those finite resources. We will
never defeat human frailty altogether, but I want the medical community
to reflect on the choices that need to be made to prioritise
treatments. Research may find the cure for diabetes or lung cancer, but
the second challenge will be to ensure that it is accessible to the
population at a time of competition for
resources.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000154">Access
to data must undoubtedly include safeguards, and obviously there is a
lot of scepticism about the reliability of safeguards. My hon. Friend
the Member for Mid Norfolk set out five actions that he feels would
address some of those concerns. Legitimate questions must be asked on
how we handle large amounts of data and ensure that they are used in
the right way and for the right purposes. The six-month delay in the
consultation is clearly the right time to explore those issues.
However, it would be a great shame if we were to miss the opportunity
to open up patient data for medical
use.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000155">Hon.
Members should not rely on the argument, which has been in the
headlines of some newspapers, that the data will be used for malign
purposes. I instinctively take a positive view of the state. I think it
acts in the interests of its citizens, although I am a relatively new
Member of Parliament and my optimism may fray if I am still here in the
years ahead. I find it deeply frustrating that, when we have the
opportunity to relieve suffering and find ways of delivering
personalised care for our constituents, we fall back on arguments about
the loss of banking data. I listened carefully to what the hon. Member
for Leeds East said, but the idea that somebody will know our
individual medical histories is pretty unlikely. It would be a real
shame if we did not move forward by allowing the data to be accessed
more
readily.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000156">My
hon. Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk is right that Parliament should
be involved. It is essential that there are annual reports so we
understand where things are moving and the positive outcomes. That
would improve public understanding of progress. However, it is deeply
wrong to prevent medical science from providing more options for health
care. I acknowledge that there are security risks, but it is not beyond
the wit of my former industry and the IT industry to work out the
necessary protocols and
safeguards.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000157">I
welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. It is right that
we are having it, and it is right that we project the
Government’s aspirations and hear concerns 
<?notus-xml column=199?>about them. I hope the Minister will set out in her response the
safeguards that she feels are proportionate and necessary, and explain
what the positive outcomes will be for our constituents, who are often
frustrated by gaps in provision. The NHS is an incredibly complicated
organism, and it is very difficult for a constituency MP to grasp where
the problems lie. However, something positive can come from the
proposal. I thank once again my hon. Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk
for his deep knowledge, enthusiasm and inspiration on this
subject.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/B942664DBD7C27A0321C07FF9AACCCC8AD006122" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="27 February 2014">Thursday

identify him. That is fair enough, but there are those who worry about
insurance companies. If I go to an insurance company and say,
“Will you please insure my life?”, they will say,
“What are your conditions?” I say, “I’ve
had a non-malignant basal carcinoma and I stopped smoking in
1986” and various other things about my life. What do they need
to go for big data for to find out what I have to tell them to get

we start saying, “Why can’t we get good new drugs to

they tend to be developed because someone has had an idea, has done
trials and tests and taken the data. Incidentally, I say this to those
who get frightfully worried about data. If the reporting system shows
that there is or could be a problem with a particular treatment, what
happens? The pharmaceutical company is required to go to the research
database and see what information can be found there. There is a lot of

those needs. It is in that context that the need for data sharing

the Member for Leeds East made that point far more eloquently than I.
We also want to keep the requirement for the Secretary of State to sign
off on any new application to access the data, which the Government are
seeking to remove in the Care Bill. Accountability to the Secretary of
State, to Parliament and to us as Members of Parliament on behalf of
our constituents is a fundamental requirement that would start to

need full transparency for all organisations granted access to the
data, so there is full openness about who has access and what data they

people with a learning disability, autism or sensory impairments, so we

potential is enormous, they can revolutionise systems and processes and
they can get to the heart of problems in certain areas far sooner. It
is hugely empowering for future patients to get away not just from the
silo mentalities of the structures of our health and social care

mentality about data that exists in parts of the health and social care

Government support the sentiments outlined in the private
Member’s Bill that my hon. Friend introduced. They are in line
with the Government’s information strategy for health and care
in England, “The power of information: Putting all of us in
control of the health and care information we need”, which was
published in 2012. His proposed Bill would provide for ownership of,
and access to, patient records and health data to empower patients in
everyday health care and research. He has outlined the principles in
more detail today. The Bill would create a new statutory duty of care
on NHS professionals to use and update information and ensure that the
next professional on the patient’s care pathway is using
properly maintained patient
records.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000209">I
want briefly to deal with those two areas in turn, and, as Members
would expect, I will then touch on some of the aspects of care data
that have been explored during the debate. The Government feel that
there is no need for legislation to provide ownership and access to
patient records—the shadow Minister touched on that. Patients
already have the legal right to access information in their own health
and care records, but it has not been easy get it because it means
requesting paper copies, and people might be charged. Easily accessing
records online does not require changes to the law, but it is a big
challenge to the culture and practices of many health and care
organisations and
professionals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000210" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000210">The

shadow Minister made a good point about the fact that integrating data
naturally follows integrating care. The Government’s information
strategy stresses the need for a change in culture and mindset, in
which health and care professionals, organisations and systems
recognise that information in our care records is fundamentally about
us. It can therefore become normal for us to access our records
easily.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000212">The
information strategy also makes it clear that patients will be able to
access their own health and care records online; review those records,
including test results; 
<?notus-xml column=208?>refer back to them during the course of care; and benefit by sharing, if
they choose, that information with a range of other people who they
want to help them with the care and support they need, when they need
it. However, to alter legal ownership of patient records is a difficult
way forward. Information is not property in the sense in which physical
objects are, but is subject to intellectual property rights, common law
confidentiality rights and obligations, and rights and obligations
under the Data Protection Act 1998. Ownership implies a level of
control over a record that is unrealistic and impractical for NHS
medical
records.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000213">Let
me outline why that is the case. Patients cannot, and should not,
control what a clinician writes in a record, nor should they
be able to delete items from a complete record. However, it is right
that patients should be empowered to use the information in their
records, for example by scrutinising their records for potential
errors, or accessing them to help to manage their care. Colleagues
might find it interesting to know that NHS England has committed to
ensuring that people will be able to access their GP record online by
March 2015. That is a real commitment and is in the NHS mandate.
Ministers will, of course, hold it to account on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000214">The
law already provides individuals with considerable control over medical
records should they choose to exert their rights, but it also provides
a balance that protects the interests of those who provide care, and
enables them to respond to complaints or litigation, monitor the
quality of care they are providing, and learn lessons to improve the
care of others. My hon. Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk gave a
personal example of where that would have been helpful to him, and I
have similar personal experience of where someone being able to give
such easy access to their data would have been enormously useful. That
is also ever more relevant to a sandwich generation of the age of some
of us in the Chamber who are caring for the generation below and the
generation above. My hon. Friend brought that relevant point very much
to
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000215">On
the duty on professionals to share data, sharing information is pivotal
to improving the quality, safety and effectiveness of our care, as well
as our own experiences of care. It is also critical to modernising care
through raising quality, improving outcomes and reducing
inequalities—now a legal duty—as well as improving
productivity and efficiency. My hon. Friend the Member for Salisbury
(John Glen) mentioned the Caldicott review, which outlined the many
benefits of sharing data, as well as the cultural change required to
create a rebalancing of sharing and protecting information that is in
patients’ and service users’
interests.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000216" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000216"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Peter Bottomley" PimsId="4087" UID="14022794000279" xid="58" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000279">Sir

the point. We have all, particularly as MPs, encountered people who
say, “Oh no—data protection!” and obfuscate in
some way, but what they say is almost always absolute nonsense. There
are lots of existing legal requirements to share data where needed to
protect and look after

Secretary of State has challenged the NHS to go digital by 2018. That
will help the sharing of patient records across the whole medial

possibilities. As public health Minister, that is very close to my
heart. Of all the demographic surveys and insights into people’s
situations that I see, the factor that defies the usual arc of
deprivation is the ownership of a mobile phone. That is a great
democratising piece of technology and I am keen to see that we use it
more and give it more potential to put power into the hands of the
previously powerless in this sphere of our
lives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000219">On
Government support for the concept of data sharing and the unique
identifier, my hon. Friend has been working closely with officials from
my Department. We have welcomed that working relationship. Officials
have been exploring possible avenues for legislation to ensure that the

successful outcome in the private Member’s ballot so that we can
make

options and the provision of clear guidance that underlines the need
for sharing and clarifies what the law already allows are being
considered. We are considering placing a duty to share on commissioners
and providers. That would force such organisations to ensure that
contracts include such a duty to help to change the culture and mindset
so that we share data when we need
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022794000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/halltext/140227h0001.htm#14022794000221">In
addition, we are considering introducing a measure to ensure the
consistent use of the unique patient identifier—the NHS
number—across the whole health and care system. The intervention
made by my hon. Friend the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter
Bottomley) illustrated why it is so important that, when we know
critical things about a patient, we join them up. The easiest way to do
that is by consistently using their unique identifier. The use of the
NHS number will unify and standardise the recording and use of
information for the benefit of both patients and clinicians. We have
heard examples, and I am sure we can think of others. The Government
are working on ways in which to ensure that measures are introduced on
the duty to share and the use of NHS
numbers.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/792C017E490A17C4161E27B5E85B6BCA0CF804F1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="27 February 2014">Thursday

reasons I will explain, I want to turn relatively briefly to the

heatedly but sometimes calmly, as it has been today. Members have made
various points about the programme. My view, which I think is shared in
principle by everyone in the Chamber, is that overall the care.data
programme is, or has the potential to be, a good thing, for all the
reasons outlined by my 
<?notus-xml column=210?>hon. Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk and others. It offers a great
deal to help us to bring benefits to patients. We have heard examples

want to add an example that falls within my portfolio. In health care
discussions, there is sometimes a tendency to think that we are moving
forward only from the base we already have—that we bank all the
existing benefits, progress and discoveries and move forward from that
point. However, an area of great concern to people in this country and
around the world is the development of anti-microbial resistance and
the work required on that. The number of drug resistant conditions is

hope that the ability to scrutinise the data will allow us to
understand the pattern of growth of drug resistance, because that

basic level of health care: the things that we have in our armoury

is clear that most people agree with care.data’s aims, but they
have justifiable concerns about how they are being implemented. People

that reaches everyone in a way that they remember. We might reach
everyone, but an awful lot of quite good factual detail has proven that
there will always be some people who do not believe they have been
reached. We have to reach a reasonable level of breakthrough and
cut-through with the messaging. I think that is well understood after

hon. Member for Leeds East also touched on a point that has been well
made recently, which is to be honest about the benefits versus the
risks. I agree, but I think he overdid the risks; he focused almost
exclusively on them. However, he is right to say that we have to have a
balance between the two, and we have to articulate that. Ironically,
people will trust us more if we tell them about the risks as well as
the benefits. I really believe 
<?notus-xml column=211?>that transparency drives greater trust, and I think that point has been
made elsewhere. I read the article by Ben Goldacre, and my hon. Friend
the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) has articulated it as well. The
more transparent we can be about the balance, the better it

the way people view data and balance risk in everyday life, we see the
world rapidly changing all the time. The information that people put
out about themselves in the public domain in exchange for ease of
access, convenience, speed or economy is quite surprising, so perhaps
attitudes are changing around where the balance lies. Nevertheless, we
need to explain it. Picking up the shadow Minister’s point, we
particularly need to explain it and be open about it with those who
perhaps are least able to understand the risk versus benefit balance.
That is a good point, and I will take it away with

have a period for reflection. The delay in the extraction of the first

more time to build up our understanding on the benefits of using the
information, the safeguards in place, and how people can opt out. NHS
England informs us that it does know how to make it easier for people
to opt out if they wish to and that that can be done by phone. That is
one of the points picked up in the debate.</hs_Para>

colleagues—the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries and the data
it used. I think the shadow Minister also alluded to it. I want to put
on the record that the data it used was publicly available,
non-identifiable and in aggregate form. They were used not to analyse
individual insurance premiums, but general variances in critical
illness. The information was used to ensure premiums were fair, not to
calculate individual premiums.</hs_Para>

paid to the Health and Social Care Information Centre were for
administration costs to compile the data, and of course the Health and
Social Care Act 2012 has set stronger legislative safeguards. That does
not mean that the information was wrongly given; it does not mean that
that organisation has said that greater scrutiny should not be applied.
However, for the sake of being straight with the public about the
balance of risk, it is important to put what happened in that
particular instance on the

conclude, the Government are actively looking at what we can do to
promote the sharing of data in a safe and secure way, using the NHS
number to help connect medical records across the whole health and care
system as we move between services. That, as well as professionals
being able to access relevant records online simply, securely and all
in one place—for example, via clinical portals—will
enable more joined-up care. Together with the points I have made about
care.data and the potential that that has, which others have
articulated, I think we know there is an enormous prize in our grasp,
but we know we will win that prize only if we are very careful and
thoughtful about how we proceed, taking the public with us. This

statutory tolled undertakings can be bridges, tunnels, lifts and ferry
crossings where tolls are charged for their use in accordance with
relevant Acts of Parliament. The majority of these are owned by private
companies or individuals but some are owned by local authorities. There
are around 11 local statutory tolled undertakings in England that are
currently required to follow the procedures contained in the 1954 Act
to increase their
tolls.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022774000278" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/wmstext/140227m0001.htm#14022774000278">Under
this Act, operators are required to apply to the Secretary of State for
any increase in tolls regardless of how big or small. This process can
be costly and time consuming for the operator, and will often involve a
public inquiry. These costs are likely to be passed on to the user
through higher tolls. The Government have therefore decided the process
needs to be simplified to reduce the administrative burden on operators
and Government, while ensuring the interests of users continue to be
protected.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022774000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/wmstext/140227m0001.htm#14022774000279">Our
preferred option is a simplified procedure for increases in tolls which
are no greater than inflation minus 1%, so providing an incentive for
the crossing operators to keep any increases in tolls below this level.

draft strategy builds on the good progress we have made so far in
tackling child poverty. Despite the tough economic climate, employment
has increased by 1.3 million since 2010 and the number of children in
workless households has fallen by 274,000. Poor children are doing
better than ever at school; the proportion of children on free school
meals getting good GCSEs including English and maths has increased from
31% in 2010 to 38% in

our strategy, we are publishing an in-depth evidence review which
identifies what leads families  to be stuck in poverty and what
leads poor children to become poor adults. By identifying and
understanding the root causes of child poverty, now and across
generations, we can target action effectively. This is an important
step in our mission to eradicate child
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022774000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/wmstext/140227m0001.htm#14022774000295">Based

central Government action cannot, by itself, end child poverty. Action
is also needed by employers, the devolved Administrations, local areas

on what more can be done and how we can all work together to end child
poverty. Only by working together can we transform the lives of the
poorest children in our

families to help them seek the compensation to which they are entitled,
information on numbers of successful claims is not recorded in a way
that can be easily searched. In the last financial year (April 2012 to
March 2013) the FCO recorded 3,391 deaths that were not natural or
suicides. To provide more information on which of the cases over the

May</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 24 February 2014]:</I> The UK works
closely with international organisations to tackle the drugs trade,
including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). The
Government has pledged approximately £4.5 million to UNODC
projects in Afghanistan and approximately £5 million to UNODC
projects in Pakistan since 2010. The UK encourages regional dialogue on
tackling the narcotics trade. It does so by promoting the principle of
shared responsibility and joint regional action through key
multilateral forums including the UNODC Paris Pact, an initiative aimed
at strengthening international and regional co-operation against
opiates trafficking from
Afghanistan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140227105000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/text/140227w0001.htm#140227105000211">The
UK provides bilateral assistance on counter-narcotics to a range of
international partners in line with the UK's new Serious and Organised
Crime Strategy. In Afghanistan our support includes mentoring the
counter-narcotics criminal justice system and promoting agricultural
development programmes, including in poppy-cultivating provinces. As
set out in the Memorandum of Understanding signed in September 2013, we
are committed to ongoing work with Pakistan with whom we have an
established relationship on tackling counter-narcotics. However, it is
important to protect specific activities which form part of the UK's
contribution to the international counter-narcotics effort and to
respect the principle that international partners are able to operate 
<?notus-xml column=431?>confidentially on matters which concern their national security. In line
with our strategy to work internationally to combat organised crime,
plans for increased co-operation with Pakistan include discussions on
joint work relating to combating a wider range of organised crime

I understand that the regulator, Ofcom, has recently renewed the
Channel 3 licences for 10 years effective from 1 January 2015,
including in Northern Ireland. Ofcom advises that its Cross-Promotions
Code enables television broadcasters to promote other broadcasting
related services without such promotions being considered advertising.
However, the code's provisions relate to the promotion of other
broadcasting related services and do not extend to online services
unrelated to broadcasting. As in other areas, Ofcom decides whether
there is a need to review and make changes to the codes and guidance on
the basis of evidence that change is needed to the existing rules.
Although Ofcom has no existing commitments to review the code, it will
continue to monitor its effectiveness and assess whether change is
necessary in the
future.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="140227105000051" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/text/140227w0001.htm#140227105000051">Trade

full force from the day it was published, on 27 March 2012, and
included an initial implementation period that ended on 26 March 2013.
The specific transitional arrangements applied only in a very small
number of tightly defined cases—where councils had post-2004
plans, and there was only a limited degree of conflict between those
policies and the Framework. This was to allow these areas, whose plans
were expected to already be broadly compliant with policies in the
Framework, an opportunity to check and update their policies where
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140227105000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/text/140227w0001.htm#140227105000468">For
all other councils, the transitional period was not relevant. The end
of the transitional arrangements should not have a dramatic effect on
decision-making, and we have no plans to extend it. To help those
councils who have not yet completed their plans, or do not have a five
year supply of sites for housing, the Government continues to fund the
Planning Inspectorate and the Planning Advisory Service to provide
assistance. Between them, they have visited over 200 councils in the

Government has retained a strong homelessness safety net protected in
law, supported by £470 million in the current spending review
period to prevent and tackle homelessness, rough sleeping and
repossessions. We are seeing this investment making an impact with
homeless families now spending seven months less in temporary
accommodation than at the start of 2010.We have also made some changes
to the rules under the Localism Act to enable local authorities to help
households move more quickly into a settled home. This means households
are likely to spend less time in temporary accommodation waiting for
social housing to become available. The law is clear that families with
children must only be placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation as a
last resort and then for no more than six
weeks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140227105000518" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/text/140227w0001.htm#140227105000518">We
are continuing to support local authorities to raise their game and
have provided £2 million for seven councils struggling with
increasing bed and breakfast use so that they can reduce numbers and
develop long lasting solutions to this problem. The latest statistics
show that, with the help of this funding, Westminster and Croydon
councils have vastly reduced the number of families with children in
bed and breakfast beyond six weeks. We publish performance data and
have also provided £1.9 million for local authorities to take a
Gold Standard approach to help them design and deliver more efficient
and cost-effective housing solutions for vulnerable

to support the early market for ultra low emission vehicles to 2015 and
has committed a further £500 million out to 2020. The UK
currently has one of the most comprehensive support packages anywhere
in the world with money off eligible vehicles, grants for chargepoints
at home, on street and in train station car parks, and a growing
network of super-fast rapid chargepoints which will be Europe's best by
2015. We also have a consistent set of tax incentives driving fleet and
private purchasers towards ever cleaner cars and are revising
Government buying standards to increase adoption within the public
sector. We are now developing our proposals for the shape of our
2015-20 support package and analysing contributions from industry to
our recent call for evidence. We aim to finalise a draft package of
measures by the spring, before seeking state aid clearance from the
European Commission.</hs_Para>

(Rail Interventions Report) reviewed a long list of options for further
study including running double-decker trains on the West Coast Main
Line. Although double-decking could increase the capacity of each
train, the option was not taken forward due to the significant expense
and disruption it would cause, including the large infrastructure
requirements to upgrade the Euston-Rugby section of the line and the
other disadvantages of running double-decker services noted in the
Network Rail feasibility study of 2007. Instead detailed consideration
was given to increasing capacity on the West Coast Main Line through
train
lengthening.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="140227105000584" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/text/140227w0001.htm#140227105000584">A

further mental health problems. Most people's need for support is met
by persons close to them. Good social support can protect against the
negative mental health impacts of being flooded. Advice on protecting

proportion of patients recovering 
<?notus-xml column=462?>to their previous levels of mobility/walking ability at 30 and 120 days
following injury. In addition to this indicator, the Clinical

responsibility for determining the overall national approach to
improving clinical outcomes from health care services, including
fracture liaison services (FLS), now lies with NHS England. FLS aim to
reduce risks of further falls and fragility fractures in older

future hospital admissions and is cost effective for the NHS. NHS
England supports the FLS model recommended by the International
Osteoporosis Foundation and the National Osteoporosis society and

McVey:</Member></B> The number of people aged 55 and over claiming
jobseeker's allowance in Hartlepool has fallen by 8% over the last
year. The proportion of claimants aged 55+ has risen slightly over the
same period. Part of this rise can be accounted for by the gradual
equalisation of state pension age, effective from April 2010, as this
means more claimants retaining eligibility for JSA beyond the age of
60. In recent years the proportion of all JSA claimants in Hartlepool
who are over 55 has been at or slightly below the national
average.</hs_Para>

year 2013/14 is higher than other academies in the area because they
have a higher number of pupils, 2,168 in total, over double that of
most of the other academies. Tollbar Academy has the lowest level of
per pupil funding of all of the academies in the local authority area.
The pre-16 revenue funding for all open academies, free schools and
maintained schools is calculated using the local authority funding
formula and for those with sixth forms their funding is calculated
using the national funding
formula.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="140227105000130" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140227/text/140227w0002.htm#140227105000130">Children:
