The absolute priority for everyone now must be a total focus on working
together to help people hit by the floods and those who are still
threatened. People will still face huge challenges and great anxiety
about the future even after the floodwater recedes. They will have to
get their homes straight, their farms and businesses back on track and
rebuild their livelihoods and communities. We all know how impossible
it can be, even at the best of times, wrestling with compensation
schemes and dealing with insurance companies. Will he assure the House
that the Government are working on that now? Will they bring together
the insurance companies and co-ordinate all the Government compensation
processes

that there are dangers in too much duplication—too many
Government and non-governmental bodies, quangos and other arm’s
length bodies all aiming at the same objective. That is why the
Government have encouraged local authorities and LEPs to work together
to create growth hubs in which there is a single port of call for
businesses that want to access the assistance they need to improve
exports for businesses in the local
area.</hs_Para><Question><hs_Para UID="14021163000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021163000096"><Number>T7</Number>.

that a British Bill of Rights would run the risk of unpicking many of
the protections enjoyed across the United Kingdom, given the fact that
we have a fairly devolved legal system. More generally, of course, this
sometimes poses difficult problems for the House and we have to wrestle

Prosecution Service is currently reviewing 10 cases, and it is very
much hoped that it will be possible to ground a prosecution. However,

the Government doing nothing about it because violence against women

highest ever level of conviction rates for rape,
for domestic violence and for child abuse, and the people who are
prosecuting these cases are doing an excellent job. She knows that we
are investigating fully, through a six-point plan, why referrals are
falling in some parts of the country, but the idea that the Crown

asset recovery is given a high priority and that a taskforce within

number of interesting challenges, which go back long before this
Government came into office. For example, there is a mismatch between
the amounts ordered to be seized and the actual realisable amounts and,
in some cases, the orders made bear very little relation to the assets
available. We are looking at all those things and seeking to prioritise
how we can identify those assets that can best be recovered. I would be

work on homicide as a subject, and I agree with her. The Crown

context of domestic violence, which is an aggregating feature, and to
bring out evidence about the true dynamics of the relationship, so that
such cases are treated as cases of domestic violence. The third is that

substantive questions are then listed. However, during questions, the
Minister of State, Cabinet Office, my right hon. Friend the Member for
Tunbridge Wells (Greg Clark) was on his feet for most of the time. The
Deputy Prime Minister answered only one question. If we were to change
the rules so that we had Minister of State questions, that would be
fine, but I would have thought that it is discourteous to the House if
the Deputy Prime Minister does not respond to his own
questions.</hs_Para>

parliamentarian and he has made his point in his own way. He will know
that the distribution of questions among Ministers is entirely a matter
for them; it is not a matter for me. I have never regarded the Deputy
Prime Minister as a shy or reticent individual. I doubt that he is ever
cowed into quietude by the hon. Gentleman. The hon. Gentleman’s
point has been registered and doubtless he will correspond with the
Deputy Prime Minister on the matter. If I stretch my imagination to its
limit, he might even have a cup of tea with the Deputy Prime Minister
to discuss the matter. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> We really

purpose of the Bill is very simple. Energy companies should not charge
people excessive amounts for the energy they use just because of how
the consumer prefers to pay. Energy bills continue to rise. Gas bills
have gone up by 43% since 2007. Many families are struggling to pay the
high prices. To the Government’s credit, they have taken some
important steps to help ease the pressure, such as forcing companies to
put customers on the lowest possible tariff, providing a rebate to
every domestic electricity customer, and reducing bills by £130
for 2 million of the poorest householders who are most in
need.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000006">One month
ago, a pensioner in my constituency told me that her energy company had
written to her to say that she would be charged an extra £63 per
year unless she started paying by direct debit. She has always paid on
time. Her relative then tried to pay online, but was charged the same
amount, giving the lie to the reasons given by the energy companies of
there being an extra administrative charge. I spoke to the energy
company concerned, which told me that it charges less than most other
companies, so I looked into all energy companies across the UK. Out of
26 companies that responded, five allow their customers to pay only by
direct debit, while 17 charge their customers different rates,
depending on the method they use to pay. Only four companies charge
their consumers the same whether they pay by direct debit or
not.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000007">The companies
involved say that they have to charge more due to increased costs, and
all reasonable people would accept that there will be additional costs
and genuine administrative charges if someone does not pay by direct
debit. I had a meeting with the Post Office, however, which said that
the administrative charges of sending out a bill should not amount to
more than 19p per head. Some companies have added not 19p
but as much as £390 more to the bills of those not
paying  by direct debit, and the average charge was
around  £80 more per year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000008">Figures from
the Department of Energy and Climate Change show that people who do not
pay by direct debit tend to spend £114 more per year, and those
who use a prepayment meter even more than that. Even worse, many of the
companies that charge extra did not say they were adding a surcharge,
but rather that they were “discounting” the bills of
those who use direct debit because they incur lower costs. That is a
bit like calling a mortuary a negative patients output.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000009">Although many
people do not pay by direct debit, they are often among the most poor
and vulnerable. Since starting this campaign, I have been inundated
with letters from pensioners who have told me that they are hit by
these extra charges. They all pay on time, but they do not like direct
debit as they feel it does not give 
<?notus-xml column=715?>them control over their finances. They say that they put their money
aside and do not want to get into debt by overspending. It is not just
pensioners—anyone on a limited income might feel the
same—and with the recent financial crisis in mind, that is
exactly the sort of personal responsibility we should be encouraging.
Some people do not have access to proper banking facilities and are
therefore unable to take advantage of certain payment methods. Nearly 2
million households in the UK do not have access to a bank account that
has an overdraft facility, and half a million of those do not even have
access to a basic bank account that can accept direct payments. Those
households are vulnerable and have extremely limited options over how
they pay. It is wrong that they should be
penalised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021164000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000010">The
energy companies say, first, that their charges are cost reflective,
and they back up that claim by saying that it forms part of the
conditions of their licence. As I have said, I have no problem with a
small administrative charge to reflect the extra cost that companies
face  for processing a cheque, but I do not believe that the
£390 charged by Spark Energy, despite my conversations with it,
is in any way reflective of the cost of sending out paper bills.
Although the market has since changed, it is worth noting that in 2008
Ofgem stated in a report that the annual cost to companies of a
standard credit customer was just £25 higher than a direct debit
customer. Even then, it expressed concerns that those charges were not
proportional.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021164000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000011">Secondly,
energy companies say that they need to charge more because of the extra
cost of providing credit to customers. If something is paid for
retrospectively there will, of course, be an extra cost, but many
companies that charge for services retrospectively charge customers
far less for not paying by direct debit than
energy companies —for instance, BT charges
£24 a year. Furthermore, companies should be able to meet some
of these extra costs themselves, and those currently paying for their
energy by direct debit often pay too much. Figures from Go Compare show
that one in five accounts of energy consumers are more than £100
in credit. Energy companies sit on that money and gain significant
interest from it. That does not take into account the extraordinary
profits that some energy companies have been making, and I am glad that
the Minister is looking into their profit
margins<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:44:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021164000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000012">The
third argument is that the difference in price is due to the discount
that energy companies offer to customers who pay by direct debit. As I
said, however, it is not a discount; it is a premium on the 45% of
people who do not pay by direct debit.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000013"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:45:09"></hs_TimeCode>The
fourth argument is that those who do not pay by direct debit are more
of a credit risk. Depending on the company, about half of the premium
of not paying by direct debit is made up of paying for bad debt. Is it
just that those who always pay on time, such as the elderly constituent
I mentioned, have to pay for other people who are late payers or who do
not pay on time? Furthermore, this argument cannot be used for those
who use prepayment meters, and therefore pay in advance.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000014"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:45:42"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
there is the argument that introducing a cap will result in prices
increasing for everyone. I believe in competition and I welcome the
fact that the Government have extended competition in the energy
market. I do 
<?notus-xml column=716?>not believe that prices will increase. In fact, since Members across the
House began to conduct this campaign, First Utility has announced, only
last week, that it is dropping its price for people who do not pay by
direct debit from £96 to £24; in essence, to my
recommended £2 a month, but with no price increase
elsewhere.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021164000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:46:17"></hs_TimeCode>In
conclusion, the Bill calls for a thorough investigation by the
Government and Ofgem into what has been going on; real transparency for
consumers, so that consumers can understand why they are being charged
so much if they do not pay by direct debit; and a cap of about
£2 a month on the amount that companies can charge. I commend
the Bill to the

bringing to light another issue that has much popular support. He is
renowned for such campaigns. I guess that if I am renowned for
anything, which probably is not much, it is probably  for
sticking up for unpopular and unfashionable causes. Hence, I felt that

I want to look at what is covered in the Bill. The motion refers to
utility bills, but my hon. Friend seems to have concentrated on energy
companies. I do not think he believes there is an issue in relation to
water companies, and he praised telecommunication companies, so I
presume the Bill is about energy companies. Looking at the Monopoly
board, I cannot think of any other utilities that it could apply to, if
it does not apply to water and
telecommunications<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:47:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021164000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000018">My
hon. Friend’s motion refers to additional amounts charged for
paying by direct debit. As I understand it, however, the difference in
amounts is actually a discount for paying by direct debit, rather than
an additional charge for paying by alternative methods. This is an
important point, because the presumption is that if the gap were
narrowed between paying by direct debit and paying by other means, that
would inevitably mean that the costs would be levelled down. It is
quite possible, however, that if we prevent these discounts, the cost
to consumers will be levelled up and nobody will be better off. We will
find that people paying by direct debit are made worse off, and I do
not think that is particularly helpful to
anybody<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021164000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0001.htm#14021164000019">The

benefits of direct debit payment are widely accepted. For example,
councils in London, including, I think, Islington and Westminster, have
offered council tax payers the chance to win £25,000 simply for
switching to payment by direct debit. There are good reasons why direct
debit payments are encouraged. They help with monthly budgeting,
especially in these difficult times, and avoid the need for people to
find bigger amounts of money in one go. They reduce the risk of the
customer being cut off for non-payment and having to face huge
penalties, or even the bailiffs, for not paying their bills 
<?notus-xml column=717?>on time. They save the provider extra costs incurred administering the
payments and the debts that build up on accounts, which ultimately they
have to pass on to someone, whether through increased bills or the loss
of staff. Paying<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T12:49:51"></hs_TimeCode>
by direct debit is probably the easiest, quickest and cheapest way for
people to pay, and companies and councils should be free to encourage

hon. Friend talked about people who pay bills promptly and who should
not be penalised for not paying by direct debit. I agree
wholeheartedly. In the past, some companies, including British Gas,
offered their customers a prompt payment discount, no matter how they
paid their bill—even if they paid other than through direct
debit—but that discount was scrapped because Ofgem insisted on
it as part of its retail market review. If he wants to help customers
who choose to pay other than by direct debit but who are good customers
who pay promptly, he should encourage the regulator to allow companies
to reintroduce the prompt payment discount, which many used in the
first place. That would be of great help to many of the customers he

things get on my nerves in this House, but what does so more than most
is politicians—I do not include my hon. Friend in this

people have 
<?notus-xml column=718?>to pay so much for their energy, when they are exactly the same people
who piled extra costs on to people’s energy bills by passing law
after law pursuing some climate change ideology. Most energy bills
nowadays contain more than £100 a year simply because of the
policy decisions made by the same people who complain that energy bills
are too high and should be reduced by about £100. That nerve and
hypocrisy is the type of thing that does politics no credit whatsoever

kings of Wales. His main historical contribution was that he codified
early Welsh law. It is no coincidence that the building that houses
National Assembly Members, the Welsh national Parliament, Ty Hywel, is
named after him. His name is translated into English as “Hywel
the Good”. He is so known because his laws were visionary, based
on compassion rather than punishment, and were seen as just. In

conference in my home country of Carmarthenshire, at Ty Gwyn ar Daf,
his residence near Whitland on the Pembrokeshire borders, which led to
the legal system practised in Wales before our country was regrettably
conquered. His laws meant that those higher up the social spectrum paid
more for their crimes—a reverse of the post-2008 financial crash

reason for taking the House on this historical journey through

of equality and fairness. Those principles were essential elements to
the sort of society that Welsh political rulers wanted to build and
enshrine in law. Owain Glyndwr was the last ruler of an independent
Wales and the seventh most important person of the last millennium,

of wealth generated by their toil. As the central element of his

excellent start to his speech. I do not know whether he has had an
opportunity to read the first report from the Living Wage Commission,

I think are important in the context of the debate. It states that 6.7
million of the 13 million people in poverty in the UK are in a family
where someone works, that 5.24 million workers in Britain—equal
to 21% of the work force—are paid less than the living wage,
that housing costs have tripled in the last 15 years, that 2.9 million
people classed as over-indebted have a household income of less than
£15,000 a year, and that low-paid workers are increasingly
turning to support in order to get by. That is the context of
governance in the United Kingdom at the present time. Does the hon.

is calculated ignores the fact that falling wages mean even less
resources with which to feed hungry young mouths. The recent rapid rise
of food banks is yet another symptom of growing inequality. The Labour
Welsh Government had set the target of eradicating child poverty by
2020, but they cannot and will never achieve that if they do not stand

privatise Royal Mail has been carried out by the Tories and Lib Dems

social protection—or at least its administration, as is the case

Aditya Chakrabortty’s article in the<I> Guardian </I>highlights
how public money and private wealth are being hoovered up by London. He
notes that last year, the Institute for Public Policy Research
published research that showed that the transport spending system is
broken. Transport spending is £2,731 per head in London,
compared with £5 per head in the north-east of England. In
Wales, we receive only 0.7% of the transport infrastructure spend, yet
we represent 5% of the population. There is still not a single mile of
electrified track in Wales, which puts us on a par with the likes of
Albania—so much for Labour standing up for Wales during 13 years
in power. We welcome the announcement by this Government that they will
electrify the line to Swansea. However, the pressing issue for us is
whether we will get our fair share from the vast expenditure on High
Speed 2, which the Government are intent on pursuing. As
everyone has noted, that expenditure on HS2 will hoover up all
transport infrastructure spending for generations to come. Given that
it is an England-only railway—the last time I looked on a map,
Manchester, York and Birmingham were all in England—Wales

I conclude, it is only right that I focus briefly on the situation in
Wales as part of the broader devolution settlement. There has been much
positive economic news for Wales. Over the past year, the employment
rate has increased by more than in any other region. The number of
unemployed people has fallen by 24,000 since the
election—it is down by 12,000 only in the last
quarter —and the number of economically inactive people in Wales
has never been lower. The majority of jobs created in the past year
were full-time. The number of people in part-time work who want
full-time work is only 18%, and through growing the economy we can help
those 18% to find the full-time work they want.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:11:43"></hs_TimeCode>A positive
future for Wales has been set out by the Silk commission, whose work I
praise. The Government have responded to part 2 of its work by bringing
forward ambitious proposals in the draft Wales Bill. I am pleased that
the hon. Member for Carmarthen East and
Dinefwr<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:19:32"></hs_TimeCode> and his

first engagement with the idea of inequality was in the religious
education class in Craigston primary school at the age of seven or
eight, or perhaps even six, with Mrs MacCormick, God bless her. Looking
back, I often think that we were really doing philosophy classes rather
than RE classes. The example given was this: “If you’re
given a box of chocolates at home would it be best to eat them all
yourself or share them with your brothers and sisters who have not been
given any chocolates?” I have to say that this scenario created
a tension in my mind given my great love of chocolates. As you can see,
Mr Deputy Speaker, I do not have so much a sweet tooth as a whole set
of sweet teeth. I was caught in the tension between doing what was
manifestly right and what I really wanted to do on another level. The
consensus quickly grew in the class that it was best to
share—even among six, seven or eight-year-olds. I am pleased to

era of the Reagan-Thatcher deregulation that led up to the precipitous
problems that finally exploded six years ago. In the absence
of regulation, people have to look into their own hearts, but sometimes
we can spend far too long doing that. The rule of politics, Parliament

note that hunter-gatherer bands did two main things: they hunted and
they gathered, hence, of course, the name—there is no need to be
a Nobel prize winner to spot that. The crucial observation is that they
treated the products of the hunt and the gather very differently. The
products of the hunt were shared out almost instinctively, with many
people who might not even have been on the hunt getting a share.
Anthropologists explain this as the sharing of luck and good fortune,
with those on the hunt realising that they might not have had a
successful hunt in different circumstances and that, given the way in
which the society of the day was arranged, they might earn the good
will of others who might be lucky on another

First, when the 50p tax rate was abolished, Members from Plaid Cymru,
the Scottish National party and a number of other minority
parties—as they are termed in this place, even though we, of
course, are the only majority Government on these islands—went
through the Lobby to oppose the cut. If memory serves me right, Labour

I would support the return of the 50p rate on the basis of need and
argument. I understand that the UK Labour party is suggesting an
increase to 50p for a short fixed term, probably because of the level
of 
<?notus-xml column=745?>the UK deficit, but the Scottish deficit is at a different level. Is the
increase necessary in the UK because of economic
circumstances—that is one argument—or is the hon. Lady

that I subscribe to in any way. Last night, I stumbled across a Channel
4 programme on Walsall and Glasgow housing authorities. It talked about
having to demolish houses in Walsall, due to their being left empty:
people cannot stay in them because of their cost and what people have
lost in welfare. Glasgow housing authority has demand for 1,500 more
one-bedroom properties—people want them so that they will not be

could rub along, shoulder to shoulder, with people earning tens of
thousands of pounds a week. That has also turned the stomachs of many
football fans, especially given that Celtic had cashed in on the story
of Brother Walfrid, a Marist brother who now lies at rest in Dumfries,
who started Celtic as a means to help the poor of the Glasgow east end
in the 1880s. I do not mean to single out Celtic, but to give an
example of the toleration of those in even rich organisations for the

contention is that money is not circulating. That is why some years ago
we had a fiscal stimulus and why we have had quantitative easing. My
problem with QE is that it has not been aimed at the demand
recovery for which Stiglitz and Krugman would look; instead, in the
opinion of many, it is propping up financial institutions. I note that,
at one time, Ben Bernanke suggested that the way to return demand to
Japan 20 years ago, when the country was experiencing stagflation, was
to take a helicopter full of yen notes and fly above Japanese cities
shovelling them out. That is certainly one way to return demand to the
economy, but of course serious voices would recoil at the idea and not
allow it to happen. There are some answers in economics, however, that
are counter-intuitive to many of the things we naturally feel and do
daily. We should not be afraid of looking at some of the other, more
grounded, ideas, but I fear that a Government who have chosen the cult
of austerity over the pursuit of growth are unlikely to look

£1.34 an hour to get to the living wage. I praise the Prime

wisdom of the measure, as a politician in charge of a Government, he is

Members often talk about the importance of family as a building block
of society. I would argue that the living wage benefits and reinforces
families. To take home the same wage that an employee on the
living  
<?notus-xml column=753?>wage would receive for a typical 37.5 hour week, minimum wage earners
would have to work 52.3 hours a week in London or 45.5 hours a week
outside London. In a typical Monday-to-Friday working week, that is
equivalent to working 10.5 hours a day in London or 9.1 hours a day

sleep each night and who has an average commute therefore gets only
three hours and 45 minutes to spend as they wish in each week day. The
same employee would get six hours and 45 minutes of time each day if
they were paid the living wage. That is an extra three hours a day or
almost double the time that a minimum wage worker has to spend with
their family or to do anything else that they want to do. That shows
how those in low-paid jobs have little work-life balance and have to
sacrifice the time that they spend with their children or on social
engagement. That can lead to other problems further down the line. If

exciting proposal in the White Paper that will tackle inequality is to
follow Sweden’s example on child care. Parents of early-years
children in the UK face the highest child care costs in Europe. Parents
in Scotland spend about 27% of household income on child care, compared
with the OECD average of 12%. Independence would give us the
opportunity to make transformational changes to the way in which
Scotland provides child care services. That will allow women, in
particular, to work without worrying about the cost of looking after
their children. With independence, the benefits of their work, such as
economic growth and tax revenue, will stay in Scotland and contribute
to the costs of child care provision.</hs_Para>

couple of final reflections. It was said of Nelson Mandela that he not
only liberated the blacks in South Africa, but also the oppressors.
When I look at inequality I see, of course, great insecurity at the
bottom, but I also see insecurity at the top. People realise that when
the safety nets are removed, they themselves are a step or an accident
or two away from going down. If those people do not have a society with
safety nets in place for their own security, they can never fully
relax. They need to get more and gather more because—who
knows?—they, a relative or a friend might need it.</hs_Para>

me very strongly when I was at Alabama state university on an exchange
programme with a US Congressman and we went to see a game of American
football. We were taken to the president’s box of the
university, and there were people who had made it in life. I met a man
from Leeds, but it struck me that despite having made it, the talk was
all about health insurance, health care, and what sort of plan people
had—conversations we do not have in this country. In reality,
there was deep insecurity because the social nets were not there to
help everybody. When the nets are not there for the poorest and most
vulnerable, we, our friends, our relatives, the relatives of relatives
and friends of friends, are all but one step away. It is not a nice
situation to be in, and I could see the fear in the whites of their
eyes. Even though they personally had made it in society, there was
massive insecurity around them.</hs_Para>

Nelson Mandela liberated the blacks and the oppressors, so too does the
arresting of inequality liberate the poor and the
rich—not quite in equal measure, but it certainly liberates them
both from the insecurity that inequality brings to us all. We should
work to get rid of inequality, and I hope that when we have
independence, we can prove that one of the best ways of fighting
inequality and poverty is through the prosperity that I expect we shall
bring to

an interesting and passionate debate thus far, but I would like to pick
up on a few points made by the hon. Gentleman about the minimum wage.
Members across the House will share the aspiration to increase the
minimum wage, but to accuse the Prime Minister of inaction when he has
simply stated a need to consider the facts is slightly unfair. On
Friday, I met a number of constituents who run small hotels in my
constituency. Not a single one of those six
businesses  
<?notus-xml column=757?>had posted a profit in excess of £15,000 for the past
three years, yet they all employed people and each paid
slightly above the minimum wage. They want to do the right
thing and retain their staff, but when talking about prosperity and
creating jobs, we must ensure that anything we do with the minimum wage
does not destroy the very thing that helps people out of poverty, which
is having a job.</hs_Para>

minimum wage when, as things currently stand, the Government have
already taken tax out of the minimum wage, would look as if they were
kicking businesses for the sake of kicking them. I have supported the
fact that the Government have increased the personal allowance
dramatically, which has made work pay for people in many circumstances,
but my point is that taking time over a decision is not something we
should be ashamed of. Indeed, we should be proud of taking time to make
the right decision on something that is so important for a constituency

self-employed or work for small

must take issue with a few points raised by the hon. Member for
Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards) in his opening remarks.
He began his speech by talking about Hywel Dda, who was indeed
classified as one of the better Welsh kings. I was, however, surprised
to hear the hymn of praise to a royalist from an avowed republican.
Indeed, in terms of Hywel Dda, or Hywel the Good, being good, perhaps
the true title should be Hywel the not-so-good. In addition to being
the man who classified and created Welsh law, he also ordered the
execution—the murder, I should say—of his brother-in-law
in order to take over the kingdom of Dyfed, which is the current
constituency of the Under-Secretary of State for Wales, my hon. Friend
the Member for Preseli Pembrokeshire (Stephen Crabb). Furthermore, so
as to extend his kingdom to the north and take over the whole of Wales,
he also dispossessed the two sons of Idwal Foel from Gwynedd. When
giving examples, I think we must put the man in the context of his
time. It is interesting to highlight, however, that the Hywel Dda laws
were in many ways ahead of their time in trying to achieve a level of
equality between the sexes—not something that we saw in other
parts of the United Kingdom for a very long time.</hs_Para>

proportional representation leads to a more involved electorate. I
would challenge that because, as I was about to say, in my constituency
70% of constituents turned out in 2010 on a first-past-the-post race,

my view, it is a Government-supported way of supporting small
businesses. On Friday, however, in my constituency I met a small
hi-tech IT company employing 23 people, which had been asked to pay 9%
above base to be lent money by Finance Wales. That is the type of
behaviour that, if undertaken by the banks, we would be criticising

engagement is part and parcel of the process through which we engage

rejection of the entirety of the Silk commission report, with the
exception of borrowing powers, should concern us greatly. If we are to
create equality, in Wales and in the United Kingdom as a whole, we
should avoid spending more money on debt repayment than we do on
education. The only part of the Silk commission report that the Labour

have more equality, we need more jobs and economic opportunities. The
hon. Gentleman argues that that would happen with more Government
spending as a proportion of the economy. If that was the case, then
Wales would be, by a long stretch, the most successful part of the
United Kingdom, because there is no part of the UK more dependent on
the public purse. The dependency on public spending in Wales has led to
failure not over the past three or four years, but over a 15 to 20-year
period. It has not led to economic growth or prosperity, and it has not
led to economic opportunities. Indeed, the very reverse is true: the
size of the state in Wales is one of the reasons why the
rebuilding job being undertaken by the Westminster Government is so
important. In a Welsh context, we have created an economy that is
unbalanced and has not created the variety of jobs needed to support
our young people and ensure that we have an equal society. I argue very

of the most moving things I have done as an MP was to visit a Tesco

visit from a 
<?notus-xml column=761?>Conservative MP from north Wales is not something
that happens very often at any store in Liverpool. The Tesco store in
Toxteth was the largest inward investment into Toxteth since the riots
in 1982. It was Tesco that undertook that investment. Half the staff
employed at that store had been unemployed long term—for more
than 18 months. The retention rate was more than 94% and the pride they
showed in the fact that they were now working for a living was
moving—there is no other way of describing it. I met one lady
who ran the bakery section and asked whether she would ever want to

although it is all very well to reduce people’s tax bills, by
increasing the personal allowance tax credits have been reduced. That
is not about what is right for the individuals; it represents the
significant difference between the Government and Opposition.
Government Members want to allow people to keep as much of their
earnings as possible, because if a person goes out there and works we
should tax them as little as possible. The Opposition were quite happy
to tax people earning as little as £6,000 a year and recycle the

in 2000, when the decision was made to apply for objective 1 funding it
was argued that this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for Wales as
the GDP of west Wales and the valleys as a percentage of the European
average was roughly 74%. As hon. Members will be aware, once that
percentage is above 75% the highest level of EU intervention is not
available. It was also described as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity
because in 2004 all the accession countries from eastern Europe, which
had been behind the iron curtain for decades, would become part of the
European Union. Lo and behold, in two rounds since 2001 Wales not only
has qualified for such funding but has qualified because we are going
backwards rather than forwards. Those Members who argue that public
spending, Government intervention and the “Government know
best” mentality are the way forward for the Welsh economy should
seriously consider the impact of public spending on west Wales and the
valleys.</hs_Para>

Gentleman’s arguments; certainly, we should be careful about

that it found the 40p tax rate completely acceptable for the vast

of income tax? That is a question that is often forgotten. Its purpose
is not to bring down and punish the successful. If we believe in a more
equal society, we want more money coming into the Exchequer, because
that means we can do more to support the less well-off in society, but
we have lost sight of that argument. If we reduce taxes and get more
money coming into the Exchequer, that is something that should be
welcomed. Time and again, it has been shown that when taxes are

inequality and the attack in the motion on the Government’s
welfare reforms. Those reforms are crucial to the coalition
Government’s legacy. In 2010, it was said the coalition came
together to deal with the deficit, but just as important, I would
argue, was the welfare reform agenda. It might not work, but if it does
not, it will be the greatest shame. This brave effort to reform our
welfare system is not about penalising people or depriving them of
money; its whole purpose is to show faith in people—a faith
never shown by the opposition parties.</hs_Para>

Government had a make-believe target for taking people out of poverty.
Poverty was defined as below 60% of the average wage, so if the average
wage rose by 10% and the wage of somebody on 60% went up by 10%, they
moved from not being in poverty to being in poverty. They were better
off, but because the line had moved, they were defined as being in
poverty. Even worse, if somebody was on 60% plus £1, they were
defined as not being in poverty and therefore a success for the
Government. That person did not necessarily feel suddenly out of
poverty—they still struggled and found life difficult—but
policy makers could forget them because they were above that line. That
is why we ended up with 5 million unemployed people during
13 years of the previous Labour Government—5 million
people, yes, who had money thrown at them so as not to embarrass Labour
in relation to its poverty target, but 5 million people
forgotten by Labour and denied the initiative to work because they were
being paid to be on welfare. It was deeply shameful that they ignored
people in that way, and I am proud to be part of a coalition Government
who are at least making an effort to deal with it.</hs_Para>

and 2010, 400,000 people born in the UK moved into unemployment, yet
700,000 jobs were taken by people not born in this country. There was
something wrong with a system that said to people in my constituency,
“You can be on welfare, while someone from eastern Europe works
in the local hotel or the abattoir.” That is shameful, and we
need to deal with it, becausethe opportunity to develop must start
somewhere.</hs_Para>

passionately about this issue when I talk to the deputy manager of a
hotel in my constituency. He came to this country from the Czech
Republic, and within 18 months he was a deputy manager. I
was very pleased for him, but I thought that the job could have been
given to someone from the locality if that person had not been held
back by the welfare trap that we had created. Our gradual move towards
universal benefit is a brave move, but although it has been supported
by Opposition Members in terms of their rhetoric, in terms of their
actions they have rejected every effort that we have made to reform a
system that is immoral, and is the basic reason for the fact that we
have so much inequality in Wales.</hs_Para>

party in Wales should feel particularly ashamed. The areas in Wales
that are really struggling have given their loyalty to the Labour party
not for one generation, not for two generations, but for three or four
generations, and they have been failed time and again. It is clear from
today’s debate that the Government are making really brave
decisions to try to ensure that people are not seen merely as numbers
so that they can be taken £1 over a moveable poverty line. Our
coalition tries to see the value of each and every individual, and the
contribution that the individual can make. Nothing will make a bigger
impact on inequality than getting people back to work when they are
capable of making a huge contribution that is currently being
wasted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0002.htm#14021183000203">When
I see motions of this kind, what I see is the same old rhetoric of the
middle-class, left-wing readers of <I>The </I><I>Guardian </I>who have
dominated this country for far too long. What we need are the reforms
that are being implemented by the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions. What we need are the tax reductions that are being
implemented by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. What we need is to show
faith in the people of the country, whether that country is Wales,
Scotland or the United Kingdom. Government Members see those
people’s potential, but I fear that Opposition
Members—especially those in the Labour ranks—saw them
simply as numbers to be dealt with in the context of their poverty
targets while doing nothing to help them, and they should be truly
ashamed of
that.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/6960BBBE797FB96F4910F98AB0A7E577CC80A35A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="11 February 2014">Tuesday

accepted the recommendations of the High Pay Commission, and we have
outlined three key tests that the Government must meet to show they are
serious about executive pay being at such high levels. First, we want
firms to publish details on the ratio of employee average salaries to
executive pay, and for the Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills to publish a league table showing the highest ratios. Secondly,
we want to see an employee representative on the remuneration committee
of every company. Finally, we would repeat Labour’s tax on bank
bonuses to fund a compulsory jobs guarantee for any young person on
unemployment benefits for 12 months or more. These young people are not
our future—they are part of today, and they need to be employed
today and well into the future. That is real action to bring about

power in 1997 we held by the tight budgetary constraints, but as a
party coming from opposition to government we decided that we would
spend the money in a wholly different manner. What did we do with the
chance that came our way? We created employment opportunities for young
unemployed and long-term unemployed people, the disabled and lone
parents through the new deal, and those very chances that were given to
so many people brought about a marked change when coupled with the
introduction of the national minimum wage and working tax credits. It
was not the answer to every woe that people had suffered under the
previous Government, but it was a major step forward. For many
individuals, especially women, it meant that they no longer had to try

Solihull, I would not dream of presuming to talk about the very
specialised problems of other parts of the UK, but I hope that I have a
word or two to say about fairness and inequality. What was unfair was
inheriting a £160 billion deficit from the Labour party. I
appreciate that it was not all the fault of Labour. The banking crash
all started with a company called Lehman Brothers, which makes one
wonder what might have happened if it had been called Lehman Sisters. I
can blame Labour for failing to regulate banks properly for 13 years,
and then having to bail them out with a £500 billion
rescue package. I can also blame Labour for allowing welfare spending
to spiral up by 20% when the economy was growing. That has made
circumstances difficult for our coalition

am proud of what the coalition Government have succeeded in doing. We
have cut the deficit by a third, with more coming from the better-off,
I hasten to say. Our flagship policy of raising the tax threshold at
which people start to pay tax to £10,000 has taken 2.7 million

million people have had a tax cut of £700 or more. Those are
good things. In addressing unfairness, we seek to ensure that those

Scotland have fallen substantially, from 28% in 1999-2000 to 15% today,
compared with a UK rate of 17%. That is a tremendous
achievement by the Scottish Parliament. However, 200,000 more children
across the UK will be pushed into relative poverty by 2016 as a result
of the 1% cap on increases in benefit payments. That equates
to around 15,000 children in Scotland. The Child Poverty Action Group
has estimated that Scotland’s child poverty rate will increase
by between 50,000 and 100,000 by 2020 as a result of the UK
Government’s tax and benefits policy. That is a terrible
indictment of what is happening in our country. That is why we seek
independence: to tackle these problems.</hs_Para>

those things are; it is also an important economic policy. If we can
raise female participation in the labour market to the levels achieved

our ambitious plan for the provision of free universal child

do we need independence to deliver that? Because at the moment, as I
have said, Scotland receives a fixed budget from Westminster. We would
not receive the increased tax revenues resulting from having more women
in the workforce unless Westminster decided that we should, so under
devolution the costs of providing increased child care would have to be
met from within a fixed budget, which would inevitably mean cuts in
other services. Those who are making that argument need to tell us

cuts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:22:28"></hs_TimeCode>. That
social and economic transformation can be achieved only when we have

could also take action to ensure that most people are treated fairly

so what we do with the minimum wage really matters to the living
standards of women and their children. With independence, we will able
to guarantee that the minimum wage will rise at least in line with

today will probably have to work until they are about 70. Of course, we
all have to accept that people are living longer and that things cannot
stand absolutely still—we accepted the first rise in the
retirement age—but the rapid increases being imposed by
Westminster are not right for Scotland, because we have different
demographics. We have serious problems in some of our communities and
we are working hard to deal with them. The fact is that life expectancy

numerous discussions with Labour Ministers who would not adopt it. I
would be interested in what powers a stronger regulator would have. I

off-grid sector. When I sat on the Business and Enterprise Committee,
before the Department of Energy and Climate Change was formed, we

in which the energy company obligation discriminates against off-grid

to all of them and received various letters back that tried to obscure
that fact, but there was no getting around it at the end of the day. I

incomes to reduce their energy bills. It has been extended for two
years, which should help a further 300,000 people. Originally, it was
targeted at pensioners, but it has been extended to help other
vulnerable people in these difficult times, such as the
disabled—including those with severe
disabilities—families with young or disabled children, the
terminally ill and people who are on carer’s allowance. It is
now a much greater scheme than the one that was introduced originally.
The number of homes installing loft insulation has more than doubled
from 40,000 in 2008-09 to 104,000 in 2011-12. That was praised by the

invested over a three-year period to tackle fuel poverty. That is a
great record. As I said earlier, the number of people in fuel poverty

the problem is that the point at which income inequality has been

income inequality if we ruin the economy. If we make everybody poorer,
we can all be poor—and perhaps happy—together. Actually,
I think the British people will not be happy if they get poorer; they
will be happier if they get richer. It is of no pleasure to me that
during the recession, the income of the top decile of income
receivers in the United Kingdom fell by 9%, and that of the bottom
decile by 2.4%. Although it could be argued that the better off are
making a bigger contribution than the worse off, I do not
want to see anybody’s income decline. I want everybody’s
income to increase, and that requires the economic policies that this

beside the point. They might spend it on whisky, which will help the
hon. Gentleman’s constituency. If they spend money, they create
employment and economic activity, and if they save it and put it in a
bank, they provide the deposits against which banks can lend. One of
the great problems of the banking crisis was that the loan-to-deposit
ratio went way above 100%—I think the Royal Bank of Scotland got
up to 135%. It is not practical for banks to lend when they are not
taking in deposits, because they then become dependent on overnight
money, which can be withdrawn much more easily, and has a tendency to
be withdrawn more quickly than long-term stable deposits. When the

expenditure and very high debt crowd out private sector activity. If
the Government had not reduced spending, businesses would not have been

The third problem was that by taking money out of the economy, there
was a

individuals and their families had less to spend throughout the

is that everybody should be better off in employment than not in
employment, is fundamentally right and reducing the withdrawal rates is
possibly the most exciting thing that the Government are doing. If we
go back to 1979—I promise you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that this
will not be a history lesson—and look at the reductions in the
tax rates from 98% to 80% and then to 60%, we see that on every
occasion the incentive to work increased and revenue to the Government
increased too. Some of the percentages for the withdrawal rates for
benefits are in the 90s. If people would not work harder when taxed at
98%, surely they will not work harder when benefits are withdrawn at
90%-plus. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:51:58"></hs_TimeCode>

Abrahams</B> (Oldham East and Saddleworth) (Lab):</Member> I was not
sure whether the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:56:31"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) agreed or
disagreed that inequalities are bad.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:56:43"></hs_TimeCode> certainly
believe—and I can present evidence—that inequalities
between rich and poor are bad not just for the people who experience
them, but for society as a whole. A large swathe of international
academic evidence shows—most poignantly in “The Spirit
Level”, published a few years ago—that the gap between
rich and poor is bad for everyone in society. Inequalities affect life
expectancy, mental health, social mobility, educational attainment and
the extent of crime. So I start from the premise that inequalities are
bad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000356">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:57:41"></hs_TimeCode>
my previous life in public health, I worked on socio-economic
inequalities and their impact on health inequalities, which is what I
want to discuss today. Again, I was not clear from what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:58:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Gentleman said, but he talked about the separate position of the state
and the responsibility of individuals within society. I
believe—again, I think there is evidence to support
this—that the Government set the tone for the culture of a
society, in both their explicit and implicit policies, and how we divvy
up spending reflects those policies.</hs_Para>

I said, considerable evidence shows that the systematic, socially
produced differential distribution of resources and power—I mean
income, wealth, knowledge, status and connections—is the key
determinant of health inequalities. Mortality and morbidity increase as
people’s social position declines. My constituency contains an
affluent part, in Saddleworth, although there are pockets of
deprivation, as in every community, and a poorer part, in Oldham East,
and that differential is reflected in a 10-year difference in life
expectancy, which is a situation that can be replicated across the
country.</hs_Para>

social pattern of disease is universal. It is produced by social
processes influenced by Government policies, both written and
unwritten, rather than by biological differences. There is no law of
nature that decrees that children born to poor families will die at
twice the rate of children born to rich families. We should, however,
take some comfort from the fact that those inequalities are socially
produced and, as such, neither fixed nor inevitable. That means that we
have some hope of doing something about
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000359">I
am very concerned about the direction of Government policy, which,
although largely driven by the Tory party, is to a large extent
supported by the Liberal Democrats. The Health and Social Care Act
2012, for instance, completed its passage because it was propped up by
them. One of the key objectives of the original policy was to reduce
health inequalities, but there is absolutely no evidence that this
privatisation Act will do anything of the kind.

the Health and Social Care Bill became an Act, directors of public
health and public health academics wrote that it would exacerbate
inequality rather than reduce it, but the Government pressed on, and
they continue to press on. The implications of the EU-US trade
negotiations are of particular concern, because the Government have
still not committed themselves to exempting the NHS from the free trade
agreement. We will challenge them vigorously on

recent debacle over NHS resources allocations is another example of the
Government’s total lack of commitment to reducing health
inequality. We saw the writing on the wall back in 2012, when the
former Secretary of State for Health—the present Leader
of the House,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:03:08"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for South Cambridgeshire (Mr Lansley)—reduced the health
inequalities weighting from 15% to 10%, which would have a direct
impact on areas where health was particularly poor. Following last
year’s consultation about how NHS resources should be 
<?notus-xml column=787?>allocated, the Government were prompted to withdraw
their previous policy and include an element that took account of
deprivation in order to avoid another furore, but there are still major
problems in connection with the allocation. A recent analysis
undertaken by academics shows that the Labour Government’s
health inequalities weighting saved lives: three lives per 100,000 in
the population. I am extremely concerned about the new formula, and
about its failure to take inequalities into account.</hs_Para>

health policy is not the only problem. Other Members have already
mentioned the Government’s economic policies. Although the
personal allowance has been increased, the cut in tax credits means
that 40% of the worst-off members of the population will be about
£1,500 worse off. Those policies are doing nothing to reduce the
economic inequalities that ultimately lead to health
inequalities.</hs_Para>

the Government’s so-called welfare reforms, I absolutely detest
the divide and rule narrative that has been deliberately introduced in
an attempt to vilify people receiving social security as the
new undeserving poor. The pejorative language of
“shirkers” and “scroungers” has been really
disingenuous, and the Government are distorting statistics to try to
prop up their welfare reforms. That is absolutely shameful.</hs_Para>

the impact of public spending cuts is significantly greater in deprived

male suicides, with an additional 437 suicides registered in the UK in
2011, roughly mirroring the increase in unemployment.

the current policy trajectory, the social pattern of health
inequalities will continue. For example, the gap in life expectancy is
set to increase, rather than decrease. In England, there is now a
nine-year difference for men and a seven year difference for women. The
Government’s indifference to inequality reflects their belief in
the dated theory that reducing inequality reduces incentives and slows
growth. That theory has had a number of iterations, but the converse
has been shown to be the case. For example, Stiglitz produced evidence
last year to show that inequality caused financial instability,
undermined productivity and retarded
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:09:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000373">The
previous Labour Government did not get everything right, but I am proud
that we achieved our targets on health inequalities. Our key successes
were in achieving our objectives, first, to reduce health inequalities
by 10% as measured by life expectancy at birth for men in spearhead
areas, and, secondly, to narrow the gap in infant mortality by at least
10% between routine and manual socio-economic groups and the England
average. That was quite a feat, and it has not been acknowledged by
this Government. I am sure that the Minister will take an opportunity
to mention it in his closing remarks.

taught people that when politicians profess themselves in favour of

politicians who would rally people to the banner of equality too often
end up repressing those same people once power has been given to them.
So it was with some trepidation that I came to this debate, but the

me address the issue of austerity measures and why they are in place.
First, there is the fact that we have accumulated too much debt.
Another issue is the ripple effects of that debt crisis. As the
Government deal with the overriding debt, individual families,
especially those in vulnerable circumstances, are pushed to the edge
and need to go to payday lenders and other high interest rate lenders
to deal with the consequences of that macro-financial situation. The
individual circumstances of individual households have to be taken into

other issue—again, it is the legacy of what occurred in
preceding years—is the way in which house prices have become
detached from incomes. Shelter is running a campaign on the issue, and
although it is an interesting point to raise, I think that it is about
10 years too late. In the Living Wage Commission report, to
which many hon. Members have referred, there is an interesting
chart—figure 1.21—which looks at the ratio of house
prices to earnings for the years 1952, 1975, 1997 and 2012.
For the entire period from 1952 to 1997, the ratio of house prices to
income fell. In 1952, it was five times the average income, but by
1997, it was 4.1 times. In the period from 1997
to 2012, it rose from 4.1 times to 6.7 times; 100% of that
increase took place in the period to 2007.

motion refers to women and relative pay. I want to draw to the
attention of the House, not by way of answer but by way of contribution
to the argument, the House of Commons economic indicators report for
February 2014. It looks at the gender pay gap and it makes the broad
point that the overall pay gap between men and women has decreased
steadily from 1997, but in considering whether the gap will be
perpetuated in the future, it examines the gender pay gap by age range.
For women and men between 18 and 39, the pay gap oscillates between
1.4% and 0.3%. For women over 40, it oscillates between 12% and 18%,
which raises a question for policy makers such as the Minister: is that
issue to do with career breaks and will it persist over time, or is it
the result of a fairly good news story, with younger women and younger
men on average having access to the same sort of jobs and pay, so that
in about 20 years’ time the differential will go down?
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:22:49"></hs_TimeCode>I do not put

have been a number of contributions about the working poor, poverty and
the living wage. We have discussed raising wages from the minimum wage

small pay increase for the individuals concerned. It is a transaction

benefits and compensation. To contradict

the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), who discussed the

for a married person with two children earning the minimum wage, the
free market is far from working. There could be a strong argument, not

freer market, for urging the Government to increase the pressure on
companies by removing that subsidy, which is supporting labour.

taxation. I am sure many hon. Members know that the ways in which we
raise tax are moving more and more towards fewer people paying a larger
proportion of tax, with 1% of the population paying 30% of income tax
and 29,000 people paying 14% of income tax. On the one hand,
this may be seen as an aspect of inequality. On the other, it may be
seen as a fairly dangerous way in which a Government can
raise money, in which case the shadow Chancellor’s proposal to
increase tax rates again is probably
inappropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:31:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000406" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000406">In
some of the contributions from even those on the Government Benches, we
convey the impression that the Labour Government were benign on tax. I
draw the attention of the House and the Minister to what was going on
between 2000 and 2010. It is in a House of Commons Library note called
“Income tax: the additional 50p rate”, which looks at the
top rate of tax, including social security contributions, between 2000
and 2010. It shows that in France that rate went down 10.6 percentage
points, in Germany it went down by 5.8 percentage points, but in the
United Kingdom between 2000 and 2010 that rate went up by 11 percentage
points. So it is not fair to use the word that has been common in this
debate or to maintain the perspective that somehow, under the Labour
Government, the rich were getting off with low tax rates. The Labour
Government were taxing people at a high rate. They started the process
of a higher proportion of taxes being raised from fewer
people, which results in a very difficult situation for
people

Griffith</B> (Llanelli) (Lab):</Member> Fairness and equality are
fundamental to Labour’s vision for society. Our roots are in the
philosophy and movements that worked for a fairer society, such as the
democratically controlled non-conformist chapels, friendly societies
and trade unions. We believe in a community in which power, wealth and
opportunity are in the hands of the many, not the few. We want to see a
fair day’s pay for a fair day’s
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
it is not just the less well off who benefit from a more equal society.
As has been well documented, more equal societies deliver better
outcomes not only for the less well off, but across the
whole community —not only are the least well off less
disadvantaged, but people feel more secure, safer and less threatened,
and society is more cohesive.</hs_Para>

inequality is about challenging those structures that perpetuate
inequality and about creating the necessary structures to challenge and
mitigate that inequality. It is about challenging and ending
exploitation in its many guises. It is about responsible trade unions
negotiating with managers to ensure a fair share of rewards for working
people and, as we saw in 2008, safeguarding jobs and retaining skilled
workers, even if that meant their accepting temporary reductions in pay
or hours. Tackling inequality is about siding with ordinary people
against the powerful, against whom they feel they have no redress. It
is about empowering them and giving them the means to achieve that
redress. It is about setting priorities to try to redress inequalities
and developing the tools and structures to continue to tackle

Governments have uprated benefits in line with inflation, mostly using
the retail prices index until 2011. Since then we have seen the
breaking of the link between inflation and the rates at which benefits
rise. Do not forget that 68% of those affected by the
Government’s benefits changes are in work. Universal credit will
be subject to annual review, but not to mandatory uprating. There is a
huge danger that it will fall behind

well before we get to universal credit, with its myriad problems, which
are not helped by the sheer incompetence with which it is being
introduced, the Government should look at the impact of the Welfare
Benefits Up-rating Act 2013. Most working-age benefits have been
limited to rises of 1% a year, yet the cost of basic items, such as
food and energy, are rising by significantly more. Even Government
estimates suggest that there might be 200,000 more children living in
poverty, and the Child Poverty Action Group estimates that there could
be 1 million more children living in poverty by
2020<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000417" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000417">Let
us look at some of the benefits that have been affected. The first is
tax credits, which have a huge impact. We have called the cut to tax
credits a strivers’ tax, because it affects the very people who
are desperately trying to make ends meet, often working two or three
jobs and patching together a few hours here and a few hours there. Then
they are told that they have to find more hours, but they are simply
not available—otherwise, they would be working them. Those are
some of the issues that I think the Government need to address. In
particular, they need to look at how they are hitting those who are in
work and doing their best to try to make ends meet.</hs_Para>

all know the proverb, “Give a person a fish and you feed them
for a day; give them a fishing rod and they can feed themselves for
life.” In the same way, we need measures that can make an
immediate difference to inequality. For example, Labour introduced
pension credit as a fast and targeted means of taking the very poorest
pensioners out of poverty. Many of them were women who had had little
opportunity to earn much money outside the
home.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000419" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000419">We
also need mechanisms and structures that can continue to make a
difference. In 1998 Labour introduced the national minimum wage despite
fierce opposition from the Conservatives—I welcome their late
conversion— 
<?notus-xml column=796?>and complete indifference from the Welsh nationalists, who absented
themselves from the vote. During our time in office, we raised the
national minimum wage to above the rate of inflation, but what has
happened under this Government? As I warned when speaking for the
Opposition in the debate on this Government’s first statutory
instrument on the subject, the national minimum wage has been weakened
by galloping inflation. I am glad that the Chancellor is now talking
about the need to raise it to £7, but the question is when,
because as the national minimum wage moves forward, so does inflation.

right. Carmarthenshire county council has decided that over the next

hon. Friend is right: I cannot, in all fairness, paint a completely
rosy picture. People are struggling, and we in this place are tasked
with finding ways to help them and to help those who are trying to help
others. As time has passed in this economic climate, we are seeing
people who once had more than enough struggle to make ends meet. I can
think of developers who, five years ago, were donating hundreds,
sometimes thousands, of pounds to charity, but who are now seeking help

packs—they even have foodstuffs specifically for diabetic people
donated by constituents. They keep a record of why people are referred
to the food bank and they worked out four reasons, of which the first
is low income. At the time the work was done, last summer, there were
604 referrals because of low income, almost 500 because of debt, just

The sense of community has been expanded to supermarket stores such as
Tesco and Asda, whose partnerships are crucial: not only do they allow
store collections, but one store recently donated an additional 30% of
food to what had been collected in a two-day drive. I have been pleased

Friend the Member for Doncaster North (Edward Miliband) set out in his

over the past 30 years is not fit to generate the sustainable growth
shared properly across the whole of society that will be needed in the

in the world have the same wealth as the 3.5 billion people who make up
the poorest half of the world’s population. We need growth 
<?notus-xml column=803?>that serves the interests of people across the United Kingdom and the
world. It is also important to put on record that there is absolutely
no tension between tackling poverty and inequality in these islands,

parts of the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021183000464" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0003.htm#14021183000464">The
fundamental point of this debate is that when we look at the condition
of our country, we see that people are working harder. The numbers of
hours worked are higher than they were before the crisis hit in 2008,
but people have a lot less to show for it. We know from the Institute
for Fiscal Studies that, taking into account tax and benefit changes,
on average people are £891 a year worse off under this
Government. In 2015 this will be the first Government in decades who
have to go back to the electorate, unable to answer the question about
whether, during their time in office, they made people better off than
they were before.</hs_Para>

our economy is not working for ordinary people and the
recovery—welcome though it is—is not yet sustained and
secured, and is different from those of the ‘80s and
‘90s, is that we have not seen the promised rise in business
investment. Productivity has fallen in seven of the past nine quarters
under this Government, and in 2012 this country saw the biggest fall in
productivity in the EU, and the second biggest in the G20. We can begin
to detect the reasons for that slump in productivity because
people’s wages—even people in part-time
employment—have steadily fallen in the past four years. That
failure to have a wage, investment, and trade and export-led recovery
poses severe questions about the durability of the economic model that
the Government are following.</hs_Para>

flawed model, more than 13 million people are in poverty on these
islands—more than half in working households—and two in

Shelter published data that demonstrate the impact that the lack of
housing supply—a responsibility in my constituency of both this

many like it in west and central Scotland and parts of eastern
Scotland, between 600 and 700 people who are under 25 or who have not
worked for two years or longer would benefit from the right to work.
They want to be in work but cannot find it, and it is incumbent on both
Governments to ease those people’s personal cost of living
crisis by implementing policies that will give them a proper jobs
guarantee. That is critical in securing greater equality for the

for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg), who is no longer in his
seat. Many of his arguments were made in this place in the 1930s on
issues such as unemployment benefit. Many people said then that
unemployment benefit, such as it was, was holding people back from
working because it made them lazy and they did not try very hard to get
jobs, and it was a very bad thing. Indeed, we could probably go back
even beyond the 1930s. I suspect that the hon. Gentleman’s
great, great, great, great ancestor in the early 19th century was
probably saying something similar about the poor law—that
provisions had to be made really tough and that people should not get
out-relief but in-workhouse relief, because it was making them lazy and
unwilling to work for low wages. This argument is constantly
reproduced. Nobody—I think nobody—would say now that high
unemployment went on for so long in the 1930s because unemployment
benefit was too generous. Blaming the problem of unemployment on the
unemployed is no new thing, but it is, frankly, wrong, and it is too

the other extreme, we have the “wouldn’t it be nice if we
could do everything” brigade, which is how much of the yes to
independence campaign is being waged in Scotland. This is the idea that
we can do it all and can have everything: a lower retirement age,
better social security benefits and lower taxes all at one and the same
time, and that this is the solution to all our problems. Back in the
real world—which, I have to say, will be the world facing a
Scottish Government whether under independence or not—there are
real challenges and we have to consider how we can deal with them

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:14:04"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

it is to get the economy back on its feet; there would be no reason why
inequality would not then be reduced. The problem—he is no
longer in his place to intervene to tell me I am wrong—is that I
suspect he thinks that the Conservative Government in the years between
1979 and 1997 were right in the way they ran the economy. The trouble
is that during those years inequality rose at a very fast rate. In
these debates, Members frequently say that it continued to rise under
the Labour Government, but it rose far less and the big rises in
inequality came during the years of Conservative government. During

benefit policies that have allowed the gulf between the haves and the

for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown) challenged the motion’s
wording about the upward trend of inequality in the UK. I am prepared
to grant him that, in the early years of the Labour Government after
1997, there was a stem in the rising tide of inequality, but if we look
at the long-term historical perspective we find that it is clear that
from 2003 onwards inequality started to rise again. We can argue the
piece about that, and I would not take away from the Labour party
things it managed to achieve in government that were beneficial to
people, but I question the lack of responsibility we have seen from
Members on both sides of the House. They have tried to blame each other
for not only the financial collapse, but on how we have been dealing
with the aftermath. It is incumbent on us all to take responsibility
for the situation in which we find ourselves and work out how we can

people who are able to secure better-paid, full-time jobs that is
undoubtedly true, but the reality of modern Britain is that now most
poor people are working, but that work no longer guarantees a life
above the breadline. About 5 million people in the UK are paid below
what would be considered a living wage, and millions of working people
find they have to depend on the benefits system to top their income up
to adequate levels.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:37:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil) made the point that
the report published yesterday by the Living Wage Commission showed
that 21% of the work force are being paid below a living wage, which is
a 9% increase in the past 12 months. People cannot get out
of low-paid work. One of the most important points in the report, which
echoes comments made by

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:37:51"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Moray (Angus Robertson), was that once people are in a
low-paid job, it is extremely difficult for them to get out of it. Only
18% of those people manage to get out of minimum wage work in the
course of their working lives; a decade later those people are still
stuck in those jobs. So work is a route out of poverty only for those
people who have well-paid jobs.</hs_Para>

hon. Members, the first being the Minister, mentioned food banks. We
have seen a huge increase in their use over the past two years, which
is a shocking development in a wealthy country. We know that that
increase has been driven by changes to the benefits system,
particularly by delays in benefits payments and the increased use of
sanctions. It has also been driven by the rising cost of living. One
thing that has shocked me most in my constituency is the number of
working people who are now dependent on food aid parcels. Half a

is a mature democracy with a well-developed welfare state, but the tax
and benefits system remains the main lever through which Governments
mitigate poverty and inequality. The recent reforms of the past couple
of years have been overwhelmingly regressive and have exacerbated
hardship. The promise from the Chancellor in recent weeks that
£60 billion of further cuts are on the way shows that there will
be no respite for disadvantaged people in modern Britain. Of all the
regressive measures we have seen in the past few years, perhaps the
changes to housing benefit best illustrate both the willingness of the
Government to squeeze the 
<?notus-xml column=812?>incomes of the poorest households and the
London-centric drivers of policy making. The under-occupancy penalty,
or the bedroom tax as it is better known, is punishing disadvantaged
people in our society who live in social housing and need help with
their rent. It is squeezing the incomes of those who are already most
hard pressed financially and driving the most extreme forms of
inequality. In Scotland, around 80% of those affected by the bedroom
tax are also affected by disability, which highlights that link between
poverty and disability. Disabled people are still disadvantaged in the
workplace and often find it hard to make ends meet.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:40:14"></hs_TimeCode>The proportion
of disabled people in the UK as a whole is slightly smaller than it is

also have a structural mismatch between the available housing stock and

accommodation, yet 60% of tenants need a one-bedroom house. Even if it
was in anyone’s interest to play musical chairs with housing
allocations, there are simply not enough one-bedroom homes to go round.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:40:38"></hs_TimeCode>Provision of
one-bedroom lets in the private sector also falls well short of demand
and, in any case, costs the public purse considerably more than renting

and more likely to be working in jobs for which they are overqualified.
More than 40 years after the Equal Pay Act 1970, women are

find that women, especially women with children, are over-represented.
When we look at who has been impacted most by the
UK’s benefit reforms, we see women once again in the
front line. That is largely because women take on the greater share of
responsibility for child care and for looking after elderly relatives.
Child benefit, child tax credit and working tax credit are all paid to
the main carer of children, and when the changes were introduced, 83%
of in-work families receiving those benefits had a woman

second half of the 20th century saw women enter the labour market in
ever-greater numbers, to some extent masking the ever-widening gulf in
wages by increasing overall household incomes. None the less, women are
losing out heavily and as a society we lose out because women are not
reaching their full potential. According to a recent report by the
Resolution Foundation, two thirds of mothers find the cost of child
care a barrier to working more. The UK labour market has some of the
lowest participation rates by mothers of any OECD country. Some women
make a choice not to work when their children are small and choose to
take a break in their working life. Many, particularly those with more
than one child, want to work part time, but most women find that their
choices are financially constrained. There is clear evidence that many
women who want to work full time or work more hours face barriers
because they cannot afford child care. They cannot get work in the
hours for which they are available, or they cannot get the kind of work
for which they are qualified. We all know families in which a second
earner has given up work because they cannot afford the cost of child
care for pre-school children. That is particularly the case for people
on low and average earnings, but I know men and women on graduate-level
salaries who have given up work because child care for more than one
child, plus commuting costs, adds up to working for free.

working—both parents in the family are working, and at least one
of them is full time. That has not been replicated across the UK. I

apprenticeships. Some 92% of young people who complete an
apprenticeship are in work six months later, with 79% of them in
full-time work. Over 90% of our school leavers are now in positive
destinations, and 89.5% of them are in work nine months later, or in

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:53:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Mr MacNeil). He started by introducing the
philosophical challenge of what to do with a box of chocolates among
children. I disagreed with a lot of his economic analysis, but I
strongly agreed with him when he said that behind all the economic
statistics that we are talking about are real lives. Members on both
sides of the House should not lose sight of the fact that when we talk
about record 
<?notus-xml column=816?>numbers of people returning to work and unemployment falling in our
constituencies, those are real lives. People are making their way back
into the jobs market, upping their skills and getting new confidence,
which will make a powerful difference in our
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:53:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000045">The
hon. Gentleman also made an important point about the decline of social
mobility. I put on record that both his nation of Scotland and mine of
Wales at one time were beacons of social mobility. There was a time in
Wales and Scotland when increasingly it did not matter who one’s
mum and dad were, what street one grew up in or what jobs one’s
parents did. There was a progressive trend of social mobility. We have
gone into reverse on that, and that is one of the great tragedies of
what has happened in the economy in recent
decades.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:54:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:54:32"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) made what I think was
the speech of the day. He spoke with expertise and experience about
small businesses being the engines of job creation, not only in Wales
but across the UK. Members on both sides of the House should pay
tribute to him for the work he has done, particularly on interest rate
swaps and on challenging the banks on the way in which they have
treated small businesses in recent years. He spoke powerfully and
passionately about the ethical and moral underpinning of our welfare
reforms and what we are trying to achieve. It is not just about deficit
reduction, and it is not about attacking the poor or anything so
absurd; it is about seeing lives changed and communities that were
blighted by worklessness unlock their potential so that they can
increasingly share in the emerging economic
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000047">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:55:25"></hs_TimeCode>

and energy markets. I promise to write to him, or to ensure that one of
my ministerial colleagues does, on the specific point he raised. He
mentioned pensioner poverty, as did other Members, so let us remind
ourselves of the figures. In 2011-12, 1.6 million pensioners
were in relative poverty, which is close to the lowest rate recorded.
Pensioners are less likely to be in relative low income than the
population as a whole. The Government want all pensioners to have a
decent and secure income in retirement.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Dumfries and Galloway (Mr Brown) seemed a
little confused and uncertain about what is happening to income
inequality, so let us put on the record what the statistics show:
income inequality is falling under this Government, having reached
record levels under the previous Labour Government. I very much agree
with his comment that young people are not only our future—they
are more important than that—but our today. That is why we are
making efforts to see youth unemployment fall, just as unemployment is
falling right across the country. We take seriously the opportunities
facing our young people and are in no way complacent about the
challenges that today’s generation of young people will face.
However, let me remind Opposition Members that if we are serious about
the kind of future young people will face, we absolutely must reject
the terms of the motion, which calls for a return to more borrowing,
more spending, more deficit and more
debt<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:57:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000049">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:57:19"></hs_TimeCode>

characteristically entertaining speech in which he made some extremely
important points about business being the generator of

<?notus-xml column=817?>of jobs in the economy. He used the analogy of a rising tide carrying

well-judged speech. I just remind her that in the nations of Wales and
Scotland, which we have focused on today, many of the policy levers
that relate to health inequality—housing, health and education,
for example—lie with the devolved Governments. I encourage her
to look at what is happening in Wales. If she studies that in detail,
she might have some serious and difficult questions for her Labour
colleagues in Cardiff.</hs_Para>

purpose in raising it in this Adjournment debate is that the Minsk
process has sought to resolve the conflict since the ceasefire
20 years ago, but now appears to be stalled, if not frozen.

is difficult to understand and almost impossible to appreciate the full
extent and horror of the war that raged between February 1988 and May
1994 in Nagorno-Karabakh. One has to go back many centuries if one
wants to discover its origin, but, for the sake of brevity, Mr Speaker,
and to avoid testing your patience and indulgence, I shall refer to a
couple of simple and basic facts. In that war—and it was a war;
it was not a regional conflict, a local conflagration or
skirmish—on one side was an Azerbaijani army of 42,000 people,
of whom 11,000 died, and on the Armenian side was an army of 20,000, of
whom 6,000 died. There were Afghan mujaheddin and Chechen volunteers
fighting on the side of the Azeris, and Armenian volunteers and people
from the diaspora fighting on the other side. It was an extraordinarily
bloody war, and I think that, because there was UK-British involvement
in the early days of the creation of the boundaries of these republics,
we have a duty to do what we can to nudge the matter
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:16:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000373" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000373">After
the Russian revolution in 1917, the three south Caucasian republics,
Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, together formed a trans-Caucasian
federation, which sadly did not last long, collapsing after three
months. British troops occupied a great deal of the south Caucasus,
particularly Baku in Azerbaijan, in 1919, pending the Paris peace
conference—a period in which we were rightly involved in the
area. However, the Soviet army invaded and set up something called the
Kavburo—the Caucasus bureau—which at the time voted 4:3
in favour of the area we know as the mountainous Karabakh republic or
Nagorno-Karabakh being allocated to
Armenia<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:16:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000374">You
will know, Mr Speaker, as will many in this House, that the dividing
line between the two communities is very deep and very ancient. Armenia
has been a Christian country since 301 AD; the vast majority of the
population of Nagorno-Karabakh are Christian, and the majority of the
population of Azerbaijan Muslim. There has been a degree of tension,
which has spilled over into bloody ethnic
conflict<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:17:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

In the ensuing feeling of perestroika—the slight lifting of the
yoke—there were demonstrations in Yerevan and Baku, which were
very much about determination of what was then called an enclave
between the two countries. In February 1988, there were skirmishes near
Askeran in Artsakh, on the Stepanakert-Agdam road. Then there was what
is still—rightly—called the pogram in Sumgait, in which
many Armenians were killed in the most horrendous circumstances. There
were riots for three days and then the Soviet Army intervened.

spring 1991, Operation Ring, in which Ayas Mutalibov—the
Azerbaijani leader, who was seen at the time as one of the new wave of
non-communist leaders that included Yeltsin, who had just been elected
in Russia, and Levon Ter-Petrossian in Armenia—launched a
military offensive against Armenians in the Shahumyan area, with a view
to ethnically cleansing the area. That is when the diaspora,
personified in some ways by Monte Melkonian, who was one of the great
leaders, realised that it had to support ethnic Armenians in their

between the two armies. Together, Nagorno-Karabakh and Armenia had 170
tanks and 360 armoured personnel carriers, but no fighter aircraft. The
Azeris had 300 tanks, the same number of APCs and, crucially, 170
fighter aircraft. They were helicopter gunships—the old Mil
Mi-24s that were left over from the Russian retreat. Throughout this
sad and sorry story, almost all the weapons, armaments, ordnance and
artillery pieces were left by the retreating Russians. It was like

appalling scenes throughout the war. There were accusations of
atrocities on both sides, many of which have been investigated. In May
1992, the war took a crucial turn when the Armenians captured the
headland or redoubt of the Azerbaijan army in the area that most people
now know as Shushi, but which at that time was called Shusha. At that
time, much of the fighting was being done by Chechens, who were
fighting for jihad. Their leader, Shamil Basayev, referred to the
soldiers of the so-called Dashnak battalion, which is also known as the
Dashnaktsutyun or the Armenian Revolutionary Federation, as the only
people who had ever defeated
him<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000383" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000383">I
could describe the war further, but that is not really the point of
this debate. Towards the end of the war, in January 1994, even by the
horrific standards of modern warfare, things had got to an almost
unbearably painful phase. Azerbaijan extended the call-up to boys of
16. The war entered what objective, independent observers call the
“human wave” phase. Andrei Sakharov, who is often quoted
in this Chamber, said at the

peace process started. In 1994, it was recognised that it was, in
effect, a frozen conflict. The Minsk group, with its three co-chairs,
who are currently Igor Popov from the Russian Federation, Jacques Faure
from France and James Warlick of the USA, is working as hard as it can
to move matters forward. I hope and believe that it is doing so with
the support, knowledge and understanding of Her Majesty’s

matters along the line of contact are not good. Twenty soldiers were
killed along the ceasefire line in 2013, despite the existence of the
ceasefire. There were nearly 200 ceasefire violations between 2 and
8 February of this year. Often, the violations involve
people firing across the border, including snipers, but there are also
more violent incidents. The line of contact is porous and is coming

will be asking themselves the question, as I would be if I were
listening to this debate, “What can we do?” Every Member
of Parliament is inundated by letters saying, “Please put
pressure on country X or nation Y and do something about it.”
What can we do in this case? I think that we have a crucial role to
play. There is not a massive amount of trade between the United Kingdom
and Armenia. Fewer than 10 UK firms are active in Armenia. We gave
Armenia £882,000 in aid last year. I pay credit to our
remarkable joint ambassadors in Yerevan, Kathy Leach and Jonathan Aves,
who work extraordinarily hard to progress British trade interests in
the area. However, we could do much more. By contrast, Azerbaijan was
given £1,335,000 in aid over the same period, and we have very
close trade links. The United Kingdom is actually the 15th largest
trade partner of Azerbaijan, and the major role of BP in oil
extraction, refining and marketing cannot be
underestimated.</hs_Para>

and of involvement at a very high level. Indeed, the FCO was vital in
negotiating what was widely called the “contract of the

was so close that when we first posted ambassadorial staff to the

He never misses an opportunity to defend President Aliyev. That is a
shame, because I would have thought that if there is one thing the
House can agree on it is that a genocide of the most horrendous
proportions did take place in Anatolia, Van and what was then called
western Armenia. The 1915 genocide was the third genocide and was
particularly horrendous. Would it not be a good thing if we were to

soldiers from Azerbaijan and Armenia were present at a NATO partnership
for peace activity in Budapest. One Azerbaijani soldier, Ramil Safarov,
decided to buy an axe and take the head off an Armenian soldier, Gurgen
Markarian. This happened in Hungary in 2004. This is not ancient
history; this is recent history. At the time, the Azerbaijan human
rights commissioner said that Safarov must become an example of
patriotism for Azerbaijani youth and the National Democratic party
awarded him the man of the year award in 2005. When the Hungarians
released Ramil Safarov, he returned to Azerbaijan to be promoted to the
rank of major. He received eight years back pay and was given
accommodation. It is that raw and it is that

Gentleman was right to highlight the fact that the conflict dates back
to before world war one. Its causes are very deep-rooted. The conflict
that broke out between Armenia and Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh as
the Soviet Union disintegrated created not only the problems to which
he alluded but hundreds of thousands of refugees. For many of those
refugees, the situation either has not improved or has improved little

goes without saying that finding a lasting solution will be vital in
alleviating the suffering still felt in the region. I am extremely
grateful for the work being done by the hon. Gentleman and other
Members of both Houses to raise awareness of that tragic conflict. Of
course, it does not need to be said that we are not much further on

hon. Gentleman used the phrase “a frozen conflict”. Let
me gently say that I think that that is misleading. As he rightly
pointed out, fighting continues to this day. The UK is concerned by the
ongoing breach of the ceasefire along the line of contact as well as
along the Armenia-Azerbaijan border. There were reports of increasing
numbers of ceasefire violations in January and early February, as he
rightly mentioned. We were pleased that the Presidents of both
countries committed to a truce during the winter Olympics. While
fighting continues, there is always a danger of escalation, whether
that is deliberate or not, and we urge both sides to exercise restraint

provocation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000403" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000403">The
UK strongly supports the work of the co-chairs of the Minsk group-led
peace process and I agree with the hon. Gentleman on that point. We
also recognise the frustration that he rightly articulated
about the fact that progress has been slow and that it feels as though
we are no closer to a resolution than we were 20 years ago. However, at
last year’s G8 summit in Lough Erne the three co-chairs
primarily made the point that it was for the Armenian and Azerbaijani
Governments to take ownership of the peace process. It is their
conflict and they must take responsibility to resolve it. Of course,
the co-chairs work hard to facilitate progress and we and the
international community stand ready to provide further support when the
time is
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021188000404" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/debtext/140211-0004.htm#14021188000404">The
UK is concerned that neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan is creating a
situation in which a peace agreement would be acceptable to their
populations. A generation of people from both countries now exists

That is all the more regrettable given that throughout much of the

perceptions that many citizens of both countries have of their close
neighbour are now founded on negative stereotypes and
aggressive rhetoric. Neither Government have done enough to counter
that image and, at times, they have actively encouraged those
perceptions. The longer the conflict continues and the longer both
Governments shy from preparing their populations for peace, the greater
the loss of life will be for both sides and the more difficult it will
be to find a lasting solution to the conflict. The UK Government do not
underestimate the fact that finding peace will involve difficult
decisions and compromises. Despite the difficulties, we are committed

hon. Friend the Member for Wealden (Charles Hendry), the Prime
Minister’s special trade envoy to Azerbaijan, was right that a
peaceful solution will be beneficial, in economic and trade terms, to
Azerbaijan, Armenia and the whole of the south Caucasus. We feel that
is a way for the UK to play a significant part in engagement and
reducing tensions, and we specifically encouraged the meeting of the
Presidents of Armenia and Azerbaijan, which happened last November,
after almost two years, and we hope that further meetings between them
will take place

two countries occupy a pivotal geographical position just east of the
EU and are an important part of the EU’s wider neighbourhood,
and the EU works with them through the Eastern Partnership. Both have
huge potential, vibrant, dynamic populations and geostrategic
locations, situated, as they are, between Europe and Asia, with Russia
to the north and the Gulf states to the south. The south Caucasus can
be a crossroads for trade, transport and energy, linking China, central
Asia, the Caspian sea, Turkey, Europe and the middle east.
Given<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:42:47"></hs_TimeCode> that
potential, it is hugely disappointing that this conflict remains
unresolved, not least as we approach the 20th anniversary of the
ceasefire agreement this May. The UK, as a friend of both countries,
will continue to support all efforts to resolve this protracted
conflict. These efforts are crucial to helping both countries and the
broader south Caucasus region reap the substantial rewards and benefits
that lasting peace and stability will bring.</hs_Para>

across the EU for member states to introduce sector-specific cuts for
the tourism industry, which some offer for accommodation rates, some

the island of Ireland via Dublin airport, where there will be a zero

more than one in four young people out of work, and the
Government’s lack of support for the tourism sector is clearly
impairing job creation. A cut in the rate of VAT would create demand,
which would spur job creation and go some way towards reducing youth
unemployment. In Ireland, the VAT cut for tourism has produced an extra
10,000 jobs in just over a year. A prominent report on the subject

industry is significantly constrained by its lack of price
competitiveness. The Chancellor is not long back from Davos. While
there, he may have learned that the World Economic Forum places the UK

countries. The UK sits at the bottom of the international league table,
with businesses facing the challenge of the highest rates in the world
for VAT, air passenger duty and visa charges. The purpose of
today’s debate is not to rehearse the arguments on issues such
as air passenger duty, but that placing shows that the
Government’s lack of action on VAT forms part of a broader
lethargy when it comes to supporting the tourism
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000023">The
Government say that visitor numbers remain strong, but I would suggest
that that is in spite of the current pricing policy, rather than
because of it. The UK’s balance of payments for tourist products
has declined steeply in the past 15 years, making it clear that tourism
growth has not been what it could have been in recent years, and that
we are not maximising the industry’s enormous potential to
deliver revenue and jobs. I would argue that the blame for that lies
with the policy regime, which is holding back the industry’s
potential. Any argument from the Government based on the cost of a VAT
cut being prohibitive is highly dubious.</hs_Para>

strong evidence from the Treasury’s own economic modelling, as
used by Professor Adam Blake in a study for the British Hospitality
Association, that a VAT cut for the sector would benefit the whole
economy. Yes, there might be a loss of some £640 million in the
first year, but that would be comfortably offset by years 2 and 3 of
the programme. Figures show that a 15% cut in tourism VAT would quickly
become revenue-neutral and would result in a radically increased tax
take of £2.6 billion over 10 years, delivering a £4
billion boost to the gross domestic product. I repeat: those
figures  do not come from the industry or lobbying consultants.

lobbied me on the matter. However, she recognised and referred to the
idea that the Treasury would potentially lose money in the short term.
She mentioned some specifics on which she would want immediate
action—tourist attractions and accommodation—but does she
not recognise that if we include other things, such as pub food, we are
looking at a very uncertain tax break? It could cost considerably more
money at a difficult time for the public finances. Is it not therefore

clarify whether the Treasury accepts the figures resulting from its

would like to set the issue in the EU context. Even if the Government
concede that the cost would not be excessive, they frequently argue
that if such a cut was granted to the tourism sector, every other
industry would be queuing up to get a similar cut. That is simply not
the case. The EU has already established that the tourism industry is
one of very few labour-intensive services that would be eligible for a
reduced rate of VAT. Strikingly, the vast majority of other EU member
states, which appreciate the importance of the industry, have exercised
that right, but not the UK. As was pointed out in a report by Deloitte
in 2011, the UK is the only country in the EU that does not apply a
reduced rate of VAT to some part of its tourism sector.</hs_Para>

of only four of the EU’s 27 member states that do not take
advantage of the reduced VAT rate on visitor accommodation, one of only
14 that apply the full VAT rate to admissions to amusement parks, and
one of only nine that apply the full rate to admissions to cultural
attractions. Thirteen countries, including Ireland, also have a reduced
VAT rate for restaurant meals. That is not a record of which the UK can
be proud. We hear much from the Government about how they are
constrained and restrained by Brussels; here is a perfect example of
where the Government have the right to be flexible, but they have so
far refused to exercise that right.</hs_Para>

countries are a rich seam of information on the benefits of a cut. It
is no coincidence that after such measures are implemented, countries
tend to stick with 
<?notus-xml column=196?>them. If we compare Ireland and the UK, we see a tale of two
Governments. The introduction of a 9% VAT rate for tourism-related
business and services made 2013 the most successful year

visitor numbers up 10% and more than 9,000 jobs
created.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000039"><Member ContinuationText="Tessa Munt" PimsId="5729" UID="14021160000233" xid="1176" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000233"><B>Tessa

conclusion, to take the case of Ireland, north and south, the island is
marketed as one area, but it has two different taxation regimes and two
different rates of tax on tourism products, including both visitor
attractions and accommodation. We believe that that needs to be
synchronised in some measure. I hope that the Minister sees that there
is a strong case for a VAT reduction for accommodation and attractions.
It could subsequently be widened to include food served in pubs and
restaurants, which forms an integral part of our wider tourism sector.
That would send a strong message of support to the tourism industry
and, importantly, enable it to compete on a more even basis with other
European nations, which have almost unanimously introduced such
measures. I know that the local tourism industry in Northern
Ireland—particularly in my constituency, where wonderful work is
already being done—would welcome it with open arms.</hs_Para>

pump-prime and grow the local economy, and enable the tourism industry
to invest in growth and jobs. This Government talk a great deal about
creating growth in the private sector, delivering jobs and supporting
local businesses. Here is a ready-made policy that could be implemented
quickly and would deliver instant results. I hope that we have a full
and frank debate about the issue, leading up to the Minister’s
response and, hopefully, to some better news in the Budget report on 19
March.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/79FE68F4657BA41BB7B4870F18A54345A6DE71C2" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="11 February 2014">Tuesday

at the moment is help. We offer a fantastic range of opportunities for
people who want to come to visit—if God made constituencies, he
would have designed Totnes—and I hope that people will visit,
but those businesses are struggling. I have heard from numerous
business owners in my constituency about the effect of competition
across Europe. As people decide where they will stay this summer, they
are considering things such as food prices in restaurants and the cost
of accommodation. Right now, our businesses are crying out for support
from the Treasury. Can we consider seriously the impact that a 5% VAT
rate would have, particularly if applied to hotel rooms and visitor
attractions? It is not just competition across national boundaries that
makes a difference; it is competition within the tourism
sector.</hs_Para>

Minister will clarify the effect in his response. Riverboat and tourist
rail companies currently are not hit by the higher rate of VAT because
they count as transport, but neighbouring attractions are. I am also
told that there is concern across the industry about the position of
charities. We need a level playing field. I am not suggesting for a
minute that we should apply a higher rate to other businesses; only
that we should make the playing field level across the sector. That
would be widely appreciated.</hs_Para>

to mention the impact on employment. Yesterday, I met a large group of
young people from my constituency, where youth unemployment is, sadly,
an ongoing issue. The tourism sector is particularly important in
providing opportunities for young people in my constituency. We have a
very low-wage economy. Numerous businesses have written to me to say
that they would like to pay a living wage but are unable to do so at
the moment. Will the Minister consider what impact higher wages across
this important sector would have on allowing young people to stay in
places such as south Devon? Will he consider the evidence? I have been
contacted this week by one very successful business saying that,
normally, it would employ far more people, but it has had to cut its
staff from the 35 people that it usually employs on the payroll at this
time of year to 27. Will he confirm in his response that he has
considered the impact that a VAT cut could have on that?</hs_Para>

importantly, I reiterate that the south-west is open for business. I
encourage anyone listening to this debate to come see what we have to
offer, but I would also like the Government to do their bit by allowing
businesses to offer lower prices, so that people will make the right
decisions as the summer comes on.</hs_Para>

VAT on tourism to 5% 20 years ago and that was such a success that the
Manx Government have never even considered reversing it. Visitor

there was a sharp decline in tourism, but after the VAT cut, visitor

previously spoken of the potential for tourism in Northern Ireland that

rest of the world, the entire United Kingdom would benefit. The first
part of my three-and-a-half minute contribution is on the question of

Ireland issue is highlighted and exposed by the fact that we border the
Republic of Ireland. The industry in Northern Ireland is linked to
tourism in the Republic of Ireland, so the discrepancy in VAT rates is
noticeable. VAT in the Republic of Ireland has been reduced for hotel
accommodation since 1986. In 2011, the VAT reduction was extended to
cover out-of-home meals. Take those two things together and Northern
Ireland—and, indeed, the United Kingdom—is 11% behind the
Republic of Ireland’s VAT rate. That puts the United Kingdom,
and especially Northern Ireland, on an uneven
keel<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T10:20:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000105">The
Northern Ireland Hotels Federation gives figures that justify a VAT
reduction. The federation indicates that 14,900 jobs would be created
by reducing VAT. Gross value added would increase by £155
million, and wages would increase by £64 million to £225
million by 2020. Those figures indicate a clear win-win-win, because as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T10:21:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion, said, a VAT reduction would mean more jobs,
more money in people’s pockets, and a reduction in benefits paid
to the unemployed. That can clearly be done. The Republic of Ireland
produced 6,500 new jobs and saved 31,000 jobs, which indicates the
seriousness of our position. We are one of only four countries in
Europe that are not availing themselves of a reduced VAT rate. The VAT
rate on hotels is 7% in Germany and 10% in France, and that encourages
UK and EU residents to holiday in those countries. It is time that we
did something about that. Perhaps the Minister will indicate what he
hopes to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T10:21:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000106">The
industry is anxious to find the best way to use a VAT cut for the
benefit of the Treasury and the UK as a whole, for example by ensuring
that at least half the cut is passed on in lower prices, with the rest
used for increased staff wages, training, employment and increased
investment; that would be similar to what the French Government did
with their restaurant
industry<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T10:22:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000107">Time
is against me, but others will join me in proving beyond reasonable
doubt that a short-term investment in the tourism industry will yield
long-term dividends, as has been proved in Europe and can be shown
here, if the chance is taken. Some might ask, “How can we do
that?” I would simply tell them to book a flight to Belfast and
take the 20-minute journey to my constituency. They will see within
seconds why I believe that, with a little bit of help and support,
tourism can and will thrive. There is an opportunity for us all to take
our place on the world tourism stage and to allow others to enjoy what
we have: great lodgings, fantastic scenery, wonderful shopping,
world-class golf, hotels, salons, historical journeys and, most
importantly, our unique Northern Irish hospitality, which draws people
and makes them feel part of the family. It is not for nothing that we
are called the happiest people in the United Kingdom. A holiday in
Northern Ireland will refresh and renew. The Minister has a chance to
enhance that potential, and I hope that he will take
it.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14021160000206" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000206">10.23

About two years ago, I spoke to a Treasury Minister

issue. He was a much more junior Treasury Minister than the one here
today, but none the less he was a Treasury Minister. He simply 
<?notus-xml column=206?>said that the Treasury would dismiss any suggestion of a reduction in
VAT because anything that contributes, even in the short term, to an
increase in the deficit is a threat to interest rates. The Treasury
therefore dismissed such a reduction out of hand, but times have
changed. We have heard much about the Deloitte survey and about
Professor Blake’s use of the Treasury’s model. We have a

VAT charges on tourism, particularly on the hotel and leisure

is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T10:27:21"></hs_TimeCode> all the more
disturbing that a party that espouses the virtues of innovation,
enterprise, grasping opportunity and promoting sustainable growth in
business has so far failed to reduce VAT. UK tourism is almost at the

woods in Glenrothes, the Balbirnie House hotel, a small country house
hotel that achieves the highest standards of excellence and employs
more than 100 people, is fleeced for more than £800,000 in tax
and rates. That is more than £8,000 per employee, and it is only

promote sustainable growth and improve further standards in the

is the fourth debate in which I have raised this issue, so it is not
new. We have seen that Ireland, France and many other countries have
successfully used VAT reductions as a stimulus for tourism, which has
been disproportionately affected by the recession, both overseas and
here. There is no doubt but that such a reduction would help areas,
especially coastal towns, that have particularly weak local economies.
It is therefore puzzling that the Government have so strongly ruled out
looking 
<?notus-xml column=208?>at how to help the tourism industry. On the one hand, there is rhetoric
from the Prime Minister and senior members of the Government saying
that the UK should be the most competitive economy in the world, and
woe betide any suggestion that we increase tax rates, lest that scare
off investment; but on the other hand, there is a twisted adherence to
a particular idea of credibility that insists that we do not want to
minimise the burden on businesses and
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000120">I
specifically mention credibility because it has been the bulwark of the
Government’s argument against VAT cuts. That argument misses a
vital point, because credibility is not particularly quantifiable and
is decidedly context-specific. One could argue that the inconsistencies
in the Government’s fiscal approach undermine economic
confidence and credibility more than the state of the figures produced
by the Treasury. If the Government chose to, they could incorporate VAT
cuts into a narrative of growth, prosperity, stability and a
competitive economy. Those cuts can and should be a credible and
legitimate approach. We have long heard the message that we have
structural economic problems that require long-term solutions. It is
not as if a VAT reduction would be a fiscal disaster. What we lost in
VAT revenues would be regained within a few years by greater income tax
revenue from the estimated 200,000 jobs that the reduction would
create, and significant savings on out-of-work and low-wage
benefits.</hs_Para>

several tourism businesses in my Torbay constituency, and the tourist
trade represents the biggest contributor to the private sector locally.
We have some of the toughest economic conditions in the UK, with the
associated social ills of poor health and housing, high rates of
teenage pregnancy and drug dependency, low educational achievement and
aspiration, and so on. Driving local economic investment is the only
way out. Thankfully, the Government have realised one part of that and
are investing locally in business infrastructure, such as the
Kingskerswell bypass, but we need to do more.</hs_Para>

thing local businesses point out to me is that the UK is one of only
four EU members not to exercise its discretion somewhere within tourism
and leisure spending. We already have high costs compared with much of
Europe, and that unnecessarily harms businesses when they try to
attract visitors. South-west England has a great deal to offer, but
when it is cheaper to visit just about any other country in Europe, how
can we even start being the most competitive in the global

Wilson</B> (East Antrim) (DUP):</Member> I thank the hon. Member for
South Down (Ms Ritchie) for her speech on the impact of VAT on tourism.
I take issue with what she and my hon. Friend the Member for Strangford

constituencies, which are shrouded in mist and doused in rain, from the
stunning coastline and glens of Antrim, which are bathed in

understand the Minister’s dilemma. He is being battered in all
directions by people pleading special cases. As he contemplates this
issue, he should think of one thing: what principles have the
Government and  
<?notus-xml column=209?>the Chancellor laid down on the tax regime? The first  is that
tax changes should be judged by their impact on growth and efficiency.
As the Minister contemplates that, I draw three facts to his attention.
First, 19 Governments across Europe have reduced VAT on
tourism, and some of them have done that not when fiscal times were
good, but when they were difficult. France in 2009, Germany in 2010 and
the Irish Republic in 2011 all did that when facing the same problems
as the Minister. They made a judgment that, because of the tax
elasticity in demand for tourism, there were benefits, and that has
proved to be the case. Some 28,200 new jobs have been created in
France, with 15,000 businesses saved. Tourism in the Irish Republic is
up 16%.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14021160000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000125">Secondly, I
do not want to go into the issue of the model, which has been referred
to time and again, but that model shows that a reduction in VAT on
accommodation and tourist attractions would be four times more
efficient at generating GDP increases than the 2p reduction in
corporation tax that the Government have announced. Extending that VAT
reduction to food would be three times more efficient at generating GDP
than the corporation tax
reduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000126">Thirdly,
to be parochial, the estimates for the Northern Ireland economy show
that a VAT reduction could result in 10,000 new jobs in the tourism
industry, a 50% increase in tourism revenue and a 40% increase in the
number of hotel industry jobs. All those jobs would be available to
young people and would help deal with youth unemployment. The reduction
would also help increase investment in hotels. One hotel owner told me
that they take £500,000 a year, and a 15% reduction in VAT would
give them £75,000 to invest in facilities and to train and take
on new staff. I hope that the Government will listen to those
arguments.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14021160000210" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000210">10.36

de Bois</B> (Enfield North) (Con):</Member> I draw Members’
attention to my declaration in the Register of Members’
Financial Interests. I am also the chair of the all-party group on the
UK events industry. I commend our report on the international
competitiveness of the UK events industry to the Minister and to
Members. That report is relevant to today’s debate, because I
want to draw a distinction between business tourism and leisure
tourism. Business sector tourism is defined as conferences, meetings,
exhibitions, trade shows, corporate hospitality, music industry
festivals and sports events, and that sector is worth £36
billion per annum to the UK economy. The industry forecasts that that
will rise to £48 billion by 2020. It is worth noting that
business visitors to the UK spend £131 a day on average, which
is 72% more than leisure visitors. Visitors from overseas spend nearly
200% more on business trips, so the issue applies as much to the
business sector as to the leisure
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000128">The
Minister will be interested to note that there are more than 25,000
businesses in the sector, including organisers, venues, suppliers and
direct marketing organisations, representing roughly half a million
full-time jobs. The international inbound event industry not only
advertises Britain as a place fit to do business with in the permanent
long term, but drives additional leisure tourism traffic. The many
varied items that bring people 
<?notus-xml column=210?>to choose the UK, and London in particular, as a destination of choice
are all discussed in our report, but I highlight the impact of the
delegate fee for visitors. That is critical when choosing whether to
come to this country for events, and our VAT position puts us at a
competitive disadvantage. The league tables show that the UK is one of
the top 10 countries for international meetings, but we are dwarfed by
countries where VAT is outside the scope of being reclaimed. That
reclaiming adds to the cost of visitors coming to this country. The
USA, Japan and Singapore all dwarf us, as do other European countries
that have lower VAT rates.</hs_Para>

industry thrives or survives is not just down to VAT, but VAT
influences decisions on where to hold events. I urge the Minister to
understand that the impact both on the business events industry
delegate price, which will influence choice, and on the subsequent
leisure prices represent significant leverage in the pursuit of the
industry’s goal of £48 billion in attendee expenditure by
2020. I commend the report to the Minister; in it, he will see the
argument set out in great

other member states have chosen to implement a reduced rate of VAT on

the other tourist taxes that other member states choose to levy. In
addition to the sector-specific reliefs, the UK’s VAT
registration threshold is the highest in the EU. Therefore, many
tourist attractions do not have to charge any VAT to their customers.
It is interesting to note that France, which is often the country
quoted as reducing the rate and reaping the rewards, put its VAT rate
on restaurant services up from 7% to 10% in January. Also, many
businesses in the tourism sector are small businesses and will benefit

I mentioned, Treasury and DCMS Ministers have discussed the Cut Tourism

for South Down, among other things. The campaign’s analysis
assumes that the revenue shortfall associated with a VAT cut should be
met by increasing Government borrowing, but the latest figures from the
Office for National Statistics suggest that reducing VAT to 5% for all
catering services provided by restaurants, pubs, cafes and canteens
would cost the Exchequer between £9 billion and
£10 billion a year. Cutting VAT to 5% for accommodation would
cost the Exchequer an estimated £2 billion a year. I do not have
to remind hon. Members that those costs would have to be met by
increasing other taxes, which would be likely to affect growth and jobs
adversely elsewhere in the economy, by reducing spending or by
increases in borrowing. That would be contrary to the
Government’s long-term economic plan and risk raising interest

broken noses on my medical record, which probably reduces the numbers
that they are looking at from 60 million to about 100; they could also
probably work out my age, if that is removed, from when I had my
diphtheria jab and various other early jabs. It is still possible to

instances could be dismissed as speculation, but we should be aware
that NHS England and the Government see the whole exercise as an
opportunity for the UK to become a major player in medical research,
with both the NHS and the private sector seeing strong economic growth

the question of permission. This genuinely makes me very cross. The
handover from GPs will take place in March—one month’s

of records will be on the national database. That should have happened
already, but the Information Commissioner stopped the process late last
year because the NHS had not consulted or, in the commissioner’s
view, given enough information to the public. The commissioner ordered
the NHS to postpone the process and take steps to give more information
on both what was happening and the right to opt out. It has been given
£2 million to do so, but it is far from clear that it is doing
it willingly—it is doing it in bad grace.</hs_Para>

mention the summary care record, another IT exercise that was carried
out five or six years ago, more limited in its function but with the
same organisational structure. A key element was that, unless a patient
objected, their records would automatically go on the database. That
tactic of forcing people to opt out rather than in was successful and
with summary care records only 1% of patients in the pilot schemes
opted out. There was a discussion about what system should be used for
opting out for the new, greater system and a report was written.
Surprise, surprise—officials chose the opt-out. With no real
publicity, involvement or consultation, they have reckoned from the
pilots that that might be the result nationwide. I thoroughly object to
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021160000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021160000180">NHS

is an insult to the general public. Opting out is not actually spelled
out within the leaflet. NHS England is demanding that people go to
their doctor’s surgery, discuss the matter with a doctor or
practice manager and then give their decision on opting out. The House

important issue. We have seen in recent months and years in the House
that data sit at the heart of so much of the transparency revolution
that is taking place in health care, not least in the Francis report,
which was indeed in part driven by a revolution in transparency, with
outcomes data revealing differences in outcomes across the UK. That has
highlighted that, within our precious and beloved NHS, there is huge
variability in standards and outputs. The genie is out of the bottle,

both transparency on outcomes and patient empowerment—a theme

interest in that I come to this matter after a 15-year career in
biomedical science and research, in the last seven years of which I
helped to create partnerships in the national health service between
NHS clinician scientists, research charities, industry and university
scientists to try to accelerate the process by which modern medicines
are discovered and developed. My experience is that, over the past 10
years, this country has quietly come to lead in the appliance and use
of anonymised cohort data sets and, indeed, specific patient data sets
in particular disease areas to drive and accelerate the development of
modern medicines, with extraordinary benefits for patients in the
NHS.</hs_Para>

that the traditional model of medicines development, on which we and
the NHS have relied for nearly 50 years, in which the pharmaceutical
industry 
<?notus-xml column=219?>goes away and spends hundreds of millions—or increasingly,
billions—of pounds and comes back to us with a perfect drug that
suits everybody, is a model that it cannot afford, and we cannot
either. The more we learn about genetics and genomics, and patients and
disease, the more we know that your disease, Mr Hollobone,
will  be different from mine: our susceptibility to it will be
different, as will be our response to drugs. The revolution in research
data offers an extraordinary opportunity for the NHS to be the place in
the world where we develop and design 21st century medicines targeted
at the patients who need them and generate extraordinary opportunities

mention an example that brings this matter to life. The last project
that I worked on was here in London, at King’s college, with
Professor Simon Lovestone, the head of research at King’s
academic health science centre and professor of psychiatry. The project
was funded by the National Institute for Health Research, an NHS body,
and looked at the catchment population for the South London and
Maudsley NHS mental health trust—250,000 patients suffering from
a range of mental health ailments. As Members will be aware, in mental
health, there is no magic bullet drug; there is a huge cocktail of some
very difficult drugs, with hugely traumatic experiences for patients,
who often have to change dosage. It is an unsatisfactory area of modern
health care, in which we are really failing a large number of patients.
The system that was put in place, funded by the NIHR, created an
anonymised dataset of the 250,000 patients, which allows researchers to
look across that cohort at relationships between medicines and
outcomes, disease and MRI scans, and really shines a light on which
drugs are working for which patients. That gives extraordinary
opportunities to us here in London and in Britain to lead in the field
of developing treatments for a whole range of mental health ailments,
from Alzheimer’s to a range of other indicators.</hs_Para>

that these data are utterly key to the quiet revolution in 21st century
health care and medicine that we are beginning to see for three
reasons. The first is research, as we have discussed. The second is
accountability, as we saw in the Francis report most traumatically, but
across the board. My constituents want to understand and to see that
their patient journey from care is properly tracked. I have power of
attorney for my mother, and last summer I wanted to be able to log on
quickly to see what she had been prescribed and what her diagnosis was
when she was unable to do that for herself. The younger generation
particularly want and are beginning to expect to be able to use data to
drive accountability.</hs_Para>

most important reason is empowerment, which the hon. Member for Leeds
East touched on. We are moving from an age when health care and

touch on. We should be clear that the data will be anonymised, and it
might be worth looking at a framework to ensure that only anonymised
data are released. No one is even beginning to think or talk about
insurance or anything to do with insurance companies. That has not been
mentioned, and it is important to say that here. That is not what the

opting in and opting out, the evidence suggests that patients want
their data to be used in research. The opt-in rate to the biobank
project is 98%, and when patients are told that the data are not being
used for research, they want to know what on earth is being done with
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021162000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021162000012">An
additional point worth making concerns doctor-patient confidentiality.
There are layers of data, and my right hon. Friend’s broken nose
would sit quite high. More discreet information such as notes by a GP
may not be appropriate for release, and we should acknowledge that we
are talking about layers of
data.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021162000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021162000013">I
will wrap up by saying that there is a huge danger in the
Government’s laudable initiative to link their data sets
together to drive the revolution: a clear statement of patient rights
is needed. Patient data are involved, and patients should have a
framework and the architecture to access them for themselves. We should
encourage them to take responsibility for their outcomes, their health
and their data. If we did that, I think that we would find much more
public support for this important initiative, which I

that we can properly combat disease and linking data properly to
understand exactly how to find cures for rare diseases. Importantly, he
referred to the fact that we need properly to understand how good

Hospitals can say whether a patient has been admitted, but most of them

there is no integration at the moment with the care system. The data of

focus of my remarks is the report by the Energy Bill Revolution, which
finds that the core of the problem of fuel poverty lies with the poor
heat efficiency of our housing stock. For many years, it has been more
important to put a roof over people’s heads than to provide a
warm home that is well insulated. That comes from a time when energy
prices were cheap and carbon emissions were not considered to be a
problem. Even if we build 200,000 new homes a year of good thermal
efficiency for the next 15 years, 90% of the houses we live in by 2030
will have been built before 2014, and most of them will have poor

fuel poverty are a complicated nexus of poorly insulated homes, rising
fuel prices, low incomes and limited accessibility to the cheapest fuel

essential work that, if 600,000 houses were treated every year, it

a campaign to get all social housing double-glazed, so that there is no
single-glazing or substandard windows in any of these houses in
Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

factors that make it more likely that a household will be fuel poor are
low income, high energy prices and energy inefficiency of the home,
although people would not know that from much of the noisy debate in
recent months, and from party promises of fuel price freezes and
rolling back charges on bills. By far the most important of those in
the UK context is the state of homes. UK incomes are not especially
low. EUROSTAT figures for real adjusted gross disposable income of
households per capita in 2011 put the UK right in the middle of the

Barnardo’s, the impact of fuel poverty is being felt by families
and older people, but, in addition, 90% of the respondents to its
survey said that families were cutting back financially on other
services and other things to meet their fuel costs. Therefore, although
I support the hon. Gentleman’s debate, I appeal to him to
recognise and highlight the fact that families are facing a squeeze. In
areas with high levels of child poverty, such as in my constituency,
the fuel poverty dimension is a huge issue in the cost of living

by using what is known as a U-value. Data from the Buildings

favourite theme of mine, which is extending the gas main. The fuel
poverty problems of at least three villages in my constituency would be
greatly reduced by the installation of mains gas. Abercraf, a former
mining community of some 1,000 people, used to rely on the free coal
that was available to many of its inhabitants who were coal miners,
their widows or their relations. Sadly, such free fuel is no longer
available to many of the residents, and they have no mains gas. In
Llangynidr, another village, the mains gas supply runs on the other
side of the River Usk, and the installation of a crossing for the mains
pipeline is thought to be too expensive. The third village, Howey,
needs only a short extension from Llandrindod Wells. At the moment,
however, they all remain excluded from mains gas. I know that the
expense of installing such facilities is great and that individuals
will be asked to contribute to that cost, but some of them will find it
difficult to do so because they are pensioners. With funds shortly
beginning to flow from income streams such as shale gas, can the
Minister give some good news to those communities? Those are big asks
for a big solution, but they would bring great benefits to our
constituents.</hs_Para>

the Member for Southport (John Pugh), who cannot be present in the
debate, has concerns about the operation of the ECO scheme with regard
to the replacement of boilers. Manufacturers tell him that because the
scheme is about carbon reduction rather than fuel poverty, it is being
directed at people with large homes and old boilers rather than at the
fuel poor. Many of the big six have already met their targets, and no
more funding is available for free boilers for people in need. Many
boiler companies have done the work only to be told that there is no
funding. Suppliers are switching to inferior boilers manufactured
abroad, which puts consumers at risk. Will the Minister address that

Owen</B> (Ynys Môn) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve
under your chairmanship again, Mr Sheridan, and to follow the hon.
Member for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams). He has been a
sincere campaigner on behalf of the fuel poor for many years,
particularly since we both came into the House in 2001. I very much
agreed with the tone of his speech and the outcomes that he asked for.
I make no apology for concentrating in my speech on some of the issues
that he raised because they are very
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021182000050">One
statistic, which comes from the Department of Energy and Climate
Change, is that, on average, fuel poverty in rural areas is twice that
of urban areas. The fuel-poor are concentrated in many of the rural
areas of the United Kingdom. I am glad that the Minister is present,
because he has given evidence to the Energy and Climate Change
Committee on a number of occasions, and I know that he is sincere in
his wish for an all-UK solution to fuel poverty, whether for those in a
large urban town or city or those in a small rural
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021182000051">I
would like to give some context on why we must do more for rural areas.
I have been campaigning for some time about off-grid gas and for the
extension of the gas mains. I am pleased that the Energy Bill
Revolution campaign has come up with funding mechanisms for that from
the EU emissions trading scheme and the carbon floor tax. That is
important, but I would like to add a third stream to that funding
equation. Shale gas has great potential for this country’s
future revenues. If the exploration goes ahead and the volume of
recoverable gas is sufficient, the profits should be used to extend the
gas mains into rural areas of the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021182000052">As
regulator, Ofgem insists that its policy is to extend the gas mains,
but currently the incentives are just not there for the energy
distribution companies. I support the Government’s stance on
shale gas, and it is quite right that, if we have a bonanza, there must
be local community benefits, but there should also be national
benefits. If the Exchequer is going to enjoy greater revenues from the
exploration of shale gas, similar to those that we have seen from North
sea oil and gas, we should have a national strategy. I would like such
revenue to be put towards extending the gas grid of Great Britain and
Northern Ireland. I stress Northern Ireland because I am fully aware of
the problems that people there have with the high price of
oil.</hs_Para>

disappointed as other Members who have intervened about the fact that
the OFT has not strongly concluded that those who live off-grid do not
enjoy the benefits of those who are on the grid. It has looked at
competition very narrowly. It is difficult to unpick that, and the
Competition Commission has been unable to unpick the unfairness that
lies behind people’s lack of choice when they are off-grid. For
example, they do not enjoy the duel-fuel discounts that the big six and
other energy companies boast about because they do not have dual fuels.
They cannot get gas and electricity from the same supplier so that they
can enjoy a reduction in their bills. That opportunity does not exist
for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021182000054">I
am pleased that the Labour party has made the commitment that the
regulator will look after those who are off-grid in the same way that
it looks after those who are on the gas mains grid. I have pressed the
Government on that issue on a number of occasions. It is important that
the regulator is the champion of people who live in rural areas. The
electricity and gas markets were privatised rather hastily and the
regulations were put in place to look after privatised areas. The
off-grid issue was neglected in many ways, but it is time for that to
end.</hs_Para>

of energy prices, we have seen a fuel poverty crisis in many places.
DECC’s own figures show that people who live off-grid and those
in rural areas have been hurt more than those who are on the grid,
so we must take an important step. The Minister and the
Government are looking at extending the gas mains,
but will he comment today on the possibility of the revenues
from shale gas being used as an incentive for the distribution
companies that often have no
competition?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0001.htm#14021182000056">The
electricity and gas market is not fully competitive. Monopolies set the
prices in the transmission and distribution of gas—huge prices
that contribute between 19% and 24% of gas and electricity bills. We
are not talking about a small fraction like the green levy, which was
X%. A quarter of the actual price is the result of distribution and
transmission. That must be looked into, because bills are increasing. I
was very keen on what the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire said
about the comparison with European prices. He said that that included
tax, but if he looks at the matter closely, the fact that we
have a 5% VAT threshold on energy gives us an advantage, because the
rate is higher in many other European countries. I know that he was
present at this morning’s debate on the effect of VAT on
tourism. The off-grid is disadvantaged. We need a regulator and
champion to bring benefits to off-grid
consumers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000057">I
want also to talk about transportation in rural areas, because it also
has an effect. There is a double whammy: people are paying more for oil
and off-grid gas and more for transportation and fuel. I very much
welcome the Government’s freeze on fuel duty. I have campaigned
for it for a long time, under previous Governments, and previous
Chancellors have frozen the duty for many years. Members will recall
that the fuel duty escalator was introduced in the ’90s. It
escalated quite a lot, and there was a crisis point in 2000,
when there were fuel protests in this country. There were price freezes
thereafter for a number of years. People in my constituency and many
rural areas in the UK are affected by the fact that they are paying 
<?notus-xml column=232?>VAT on their fuel. That 2.5p in every pound that people spend on diesel
or petrol has an impact and creates a cost of living crisis in such

representations on the issue. I am sure that the Minister and my hon.
Friend the shadow Minister will know that I am not shy of criticising
my own party, and I was not shy of criticising it when we were in
government, because it should have taken that step. Nevertheless, it is
wrong now to exclude a whole area—a whole country—because
it is within 100 miles of a refinery. No one in my area, the
most north-western point of Wales, can plug into a refinery. The
independent suppliers are paying extra for fuel because of the cost of
transport from those very refineries. The 100 mile radius principle is
really a fly in the ointment. People in Wales, unlike those in remote
areas of Scotland and in some parts of England, have been seriously
disadvantaged. They are paying
extra.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Dodds" PimsId="2983" UID="14021182000311" xid="171" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000311">Mr

concern and anger that the rural fuel rebate scheme does not apply to
any part of Northern Ireland either, even though we have the highest
diesel and petrol prices anywhere in the UK and, indeed, sometimes in

and looked
at.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000061"><B><Member ContinuationText="Albert Owen" PimsId="2226" UID="14021182000312" xid="461" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000312">Albert
Owen:</Member></B> Absolutely. The criteria should take rural areas
into account, as well as peripheral areas of the UK, because they are
the ones that are disadvantaged. Someone in a rural area of central
Yorkshire, for example, could probably travel in all directions to get
a better deal on their fuel. However, for someone in a peripheral area,
such as the hon. Member for Ceredigion (Mr Williams), there
is only one way to get their
fuel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000062"><B><Member ContinuationText="Roger Williams" PimsId="4622" UID="14021182000313" xid="638" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000313">Roger
Williams:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman and I are at one on this
issue. I emphasise the importance of independent petrol retailers,
without whom many rural areas would not be served. They also serve to
keep the bigger suppliers and supermarkets honest: without the
independents, we do not know what the supermarkets would
charge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000063"><B><Member ContinuationText="Albert Owen" PimsId="2226" UID="14021182000314" xid="461" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000314">Albert
Owen:</Member></B> Absolutely. I ask the Minister to put pressure on
the Treasury to reconsider the criteria for the fuel rebate, so that
areas such as the periphery areas in west and north Wales and Northern
Ireland can be given a fair chance. There is absolutely no doubt that
people in those areas pay more for their fuel, as any cost comparison
shows. That fly in the ointment—being 100 miles from
a refinery—should be excluded from the criteria and the formula.
I reiterate that I congratulate the Government on taking the initiative
forward, because some areas of the UK will benefit.</hs_Para>

the green deal, which I think everybody in the House welcomes. We
welcome the focus of attention on alleviating fuel poverty and
introducing energy efficiency measures. However, the green deal that

would borrow money are too high. Again, there is a simpler
solution.</hs_Para>

answer the question asked by the hon. Member for Brecon and Radnorshire
about boiler replacement. The evidence that I am hearing—I am
talking to many of the energy companies as well—is that most
energy is lost through inefficient boilers, many of which are in older
properties. They are placed in the living room, and most of the heat
goes up the chimney. The boilers themselves are inefficient, so the
heat goes out through the flues. A package is needed to help with
boiler replacements, because modern boilers—condensing boilers,
for example—are hugely energy-efficient.</hs_Para>

remember that most households replace their boilers only
after they break down. We are probably all guilty of that: “Oh,
this inefficient boiler’s got another year left in
it.” That is why the scrappage scheme under the last
Government was so successful. People realised, “I might have a
year or two to go on this one, but it’s well worth replacing it
now.” We are finding—anecdotally, but I have read it on
numerous occasions—that there is a pattern. Many people who want
to use the green deal get the assessment, go through all the paperwork
and find out that just replacing the boiler or the thermostat on the
radiator does the job. That is why I think that we should have a
reduced version of the green deal, so that people can get quick fixes,
perhaps while raising revenues for exterior insulation, for example,
for hard-to-heat homes.</hs_Para>

some good examples in Wales of energy companies—yes, I pay
tribute to the big six for this—giving free insulation for
lofts, or giving pensioners additional insulation in their lofts and
walls. That has been a huge success, but the green deal is missing a
trick due to its cumbersome nature. Fuel poverty is hugely important,
and I am pleased that it has come to the House. This is an important

the Minister will respond in an equally measured way.</hs_Para>

the debate even more timely, especially for Wales, is the fact that

Families are struggling to keep their homes warm at a reasonable price
due to our poor housing stock, as has been outlined. The hon. Member
for Bethnal Green and Bow alluded to work done by Barnardo’s; I
concur with that work. Barnardo’s and the Children’s
Society support the Energy Bill Revolution. The Children’s
Society found, in a survey of 2,000 children across the UK,

moves have been made, as was pointed out by the hon. Member for Gosport

in 2011—inadequate in its coverage, of course, and not enough,
but important to many. It required the big six to provide £135
towards energy bills to low-income, more vulnerable households.
Low-income pensioners are in the core eligibility group. However,
energy companies can use criteria to decide whether struggling families
qualify. It is scandalous that although it may be known that a family
are struggling, they may still not get that support. I endorse the
Children’s Society’s call on the Government to ensure
that no household is without a warm home discount if it is known that
there is a child living in poverty there.</hs_Para>

Minister consider encouraging companies to extend the eligibility
criteria for a warm home discount so that poorer families are

extra child tax credits, or households earning less than
£10,000. The Government have done wonderful things on tax
thresholds for those earning less than £10,000, and have taken
many people out of tax altogether. The additional action that I suggest
is something immediate and pertinent that could be done. Does the
Minister have any dialogue with energy companies, or does he plan to
have any, about extending the criteria for the warm home discount to
working families in which there are children living in poverty? That

It gives residents free advice in a home visit, pointing out ways to
minimise energy consumption, including through draught-proofing, energy

energy conservation will cascade down to other families. I also visited
Cymdogion Cynnes—the Ceredigion Warm Neighbour

agreement throughout the House that whatever measurement is used, the
number of people in the country classed as fuel-poor is too high. It

getting worse, and among the reasons for that is the fact that the
issues raised in the debate are so complex and wide-ranging that there
is not one solution. There are knock-on effects for many Departments.
Housing issues have been mentioned a number of times in this debate,

Climate Change. There are also issues about the supply of energy to
off-grid homes. The solutions to these difficulties will be many and

the problem of fuel poverty is severe. As a result of the age profile
of the UK’s housing stock, we have some of the least
energy-efficient dwellings in Europe. Earlier, an hon. Member mentioned
the U-rating of public housing as opposed to private housing. In my
experience, public housing—social housing—is often of a
far better standard, particularly in the rented sector, than private
rented housing, which has some of the worst energy insulation standards
in our housing stock. There are some difficulties. The fact that our
country has a long-standing population going back many thousands of
years means that we have some beautiful old buildings, but we do not
have buildings that are particularly energy-efficient, and some of the
issues around modernising them are complex.</hs_Para>

Fuel poverty and energy efficiency are important issues. Whenever I

heating bills, and tackling heating bills is not only about tackling
energy costs at source but about ensuring that homes are insulated as
well as they possibly can be, so that the amount of energy used is as
low as possible; that is important because of the impact that it would
have on not only climate change, but household bills. Of course, it is
not just in the domestic market that energy is a key factor; energy
bills are one of the biggest factors in industry, and in employing
people. The knock-on implications of energy are massive, so getting it

using less energy. Hon. Members from all parties care passionately
about fuel poverty. I hope that the Minister listened carefully to what
was said in the debate. I urge him to place fuel poverty, cold homes
and, ultimately, energy efficiency at the top of the
Government’s
agenda.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/0D255832177E03A4B568C0A8A5B91CCCEDB7F400" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="11 February 2014">Tuesday

Minister of State, Department of Energy and Climate Change (Michael
Fallon):</Member></B> I, too, congratulate the hon. Member for Brecon
and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) on securing this debate on fuel
poverty and cold homes. Like the hon. Member for Sunderland Central
(Julie Elliott), I note that all the Back-Bench 
<?notus-xml column=241?>speakers were from Wales. I make no complaint about that at all; these
are important issues. I note that fuel poverty, as a subject, is a
devolved matter. I am not trying to escape responsibility—I will
try to answer a lot of these points—but perhaps some questions
should also be addressed to the Welsh Government and their spending
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000106">Let
me begin by saying a little bit about fuel poverty, something on the
retail market and prices and something about the off-grid issue, which
a number of hon. Members mentioned. I will then try to answer some
points made by hon. Members in their speeches. I hope that they will
allow me to write to them if I do not cover every point that has been
mentioned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000107">I
hope that hon. Members welcome the fall in the last reported fuel
poverty figures as much as I do. Of course, that followed a period in
which fuel poverty rose between 2004 and 2009, reaching a peak of 5.5
million households. I put that on the record as a criticism not of the
previous Government, but of how fuel poverty was measured. To help us
meet the challenge better, with the new more accurate measure that we
are introducing, which deals with low income and higher cost together,
we will be better able to design and deliver effective policies that
can cut bills and increase comfort for those on low incomes who live in
the very coldest homes. I am pleased that the House agreed to the
Energy Act 2013, which allows us to bring in the new
definition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Williamson" PimsId="5547" UID="14021182000326" xid="1066" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000326">Chris
Williamson:</Member></B> Does the Minister understand the scepticism
out there about the Government’s changing how fuel poverty is
calculated? People want to see significant investment in energy
efficiency, to ensure that the shocking increase in excess winter
deaths last winter is not repeated in future. Fiddling around with the
measurement of fuel poverty will do little to address that. People see
winter deaths rising and fuel poverty increasing, but they see spending
on tackling it falling. The Government need to deal with that, rather
than simply changing the definition of what constitutes fuel
poverty.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000109"><B><Member ContinuationText="Michael Fallon" PimsId="3183" UID="14021182000327" xid="195" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000327">Michael
Fallon:</Member></B> I am a little disappointed about that. We all
deplore any excess deaths arising in the winter months, but in terms of
fiddling with the figures, the new definition of fuel poverty that we
are securing was reached by agreement with fuel poverty action groups
that have welcomed the new focus, which, as I say, is on low-income
households as well as high-cost households. The problem with the
previous definition was that it essentially picked out large houses and
wealthy people can be living in large houses. That was not the right
way to tackle fuel poverty. It was also a measure that kept moving;
people kept moving in and out of the
definition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000110">We

issues about whatever calculation we use. However, now that we have

Government and other

that people are not as sceptical about the change for change’s

Members’ individual points. Four million households are off the

is a particularly expensive time for them. One of my first duties as
Energy Minister was to chair the off-grid gas round table, not least at
the instigation of the all-party group on off-gas grid, which has been
working on this issue. I launched, at the all-party group’s

will now address some of the individual points that have been raised.
The hon. Gentleman drew our attention to harder-to-treat homes, which
probably lie at the core of the long-term challenge. Getting energy
efficiency measures into harder-to-treat homes lies at the heart of
solving the problem and catching up with the progress that has been
made elsewhere in Europe. I accept that those comparisons are not
encouraging for us as one of the wealthier member
states.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000122">The
hon. Gentleman asked about hypothecating some of the carbon taxes
towards this objective. If that were to involve additional spending,
the revenue from those taxes would have to be produced from elsewhere,
or else we would become involved in additional borrowing. None of that
is easy at a time when we still face a deficit of more than £100
billion. He asked specifically about extending the gas grid, and the
grid is being extended in the current seven-year period that runs from
2013 to 2020. The aim is to connect some 75,000 off-grid homes each
year. Those homes will be reasonably close to the existing grid, but
that is expensive and a contribution has to be made by the householder,
by some other agency or by the local authority. I do not want him to be
under the impression that nothing is happening. I will take his points
back to the transmission operators and the companies, including his
view that more should be done. The aim is to connect more homes to the
grid in each successive
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000123"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Williamson" PimsId="5547" UID="14021182000334" xid="1066" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000334">Chris
Williamson:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for giving way
again. Extending the grid is welcome, but is not the key actually to
reduce energy demand? Surely, a huge uplift in investment is needed to
address fuel poverty—in other words, properly insulating
people’s homes—using the money that is already in the
system. Unless we can do that, extending the grid will not address the
problem of fuel poverty for millions of

Fallon:</Member></B> I understand that this problem must be addressed
across a number of fronts. The hon. Gentleman is right that energy
efficiency has a huge part to play, which allows me now to address the
energy company obligation. The ECO has been criticised, so I will first
address the suggestion that some of those who work in the ECO scheme
have run out of budget. I am advised that, by the end of November 2013,
published figures from Ofgem showed that approved ECO measures 
<?notus-xml column=244?>accounted for some 60% of the affordable warmth obligation that was to
be delivered by March 2014, so there is still work to do. There are
still affordable warmth targets out there for 2015, and we are now

able to estimate the likely revenues, which is what he was homing in

explore where we are with welfare reform and the options for the
future. The coalition Government inherited a broken welfare system that
was in desperate need of reform. We have started and are seeing through

replacing dependence with independence.</hs_Para>

at what has been done to date. Labour left the biggest ever peacetime
deficit, with £120 million a day in interest bills. Under
Labour, welfare spending increased by 60%, taking inflation into
account. That is £3,000 a year for every household in Britain.
More than £170 billion was spent on tax credits, four and a half
times the cost of the benefits they replaced. By the end, out-of-work
benefits were increasing nearly twice as quickly as earnings. That was
the toxic legacy left by the Labour party, and that is the
out-of-control spending that the Government have fought to keep in
check while protecting pensioners with the triple lock.</hs_Para>

spending is now falling as a share of GDP. Savings of £25
billion will have been made by the end of this financial year, with
£50 billion having been saved by the end of the Parliament. At
every turn Labour has been unapologetic. Labour has opposed every
single reform, including universal credit, and has provided no ideas.
Labour has nothing to say. Indeed, the few policies developed so far
are spending pledges, rather than savings. For example, the jobs
guarantee will cost a staggering £1 billion. On my count, it is
the tenth time that Labour’s bank bonus tax has been spent. To
every problem, its answer is the same: more spending, more borrowing,
more debt and more welfare. It is small wonder that the Labour party is
increasingly known as the welfare party.</hs_Para>

people on welfare, so that they might have independence in place of

giving thought to how work-based benefits could be reformed,
particularly to improve the position of women in the workplace. In our
system, industrial injuries benefits cost £907 million a year,
while maternity pay costs £2.3 billion. The maternity pay
system, however, too often hampers rather than safeguards the position
of women in the workplace. There are still too many barriers to hiring
women. Too often employers are scared of employing women who may go on
maternity leave. Even the Labour peer, Lord Sugar, was moved to
say:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="14021182000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000251">“We

needs to change, as does the shocking complexity of the system, which
involves complex reclaims though the tax system and leaves people at
risk of their employer going bust or otherwise failing to pay. Women
are increasingly self-employed, yet the self-employed are worse off
with maternity allowance, and injury benefits are sparse indeed.
Meanwhile, pay is not even at minimum wage levels. Pay is set at
£137 a week, which is a far cry from the £220 received by
a minimum wage earner for a 35-hour week. To my mind, the system is
ripe for reform, to safeguard and improve the position of women in the
workplace, to increase simplicity and security, to treat the employed
and self-employed alike and to pay parental leave more
fairly.</hs_Para>

be done? We should think about a new system of workplace benefits, paid
for by the workplaces of the nation. We should set up an at-work
scheme—a compulsory pooled risk system along the lines of the
Financial Services Compensation Scheme, backed up by the state but
funded by business with reference to the total pay-as-you-earn income
tax paid by each business. In return, businesses would see a
corresponding cut in their net employers’ national insurance
contributions. That way, the cost would not be affected by the number
of injuries or the amount of maternity leave that might at any one time
affect any one workplace. The at-work scheme would pay out regardless,
whether there were no parental leave absences or many. In that way, the
fear of the burden of maternity would be reduced, and so too would the
barriers to women in the workplace. The self-employed would contribute
on the same basis and be treated in the same way as employed people.
Pay for leave could more easily be increased from the current
£137 a week to the minimum wage level of £220, and that
would ensure that the minimum basic standard would be the minimum
wage.</hs_Para>

words on welfare reform, which is probably the single most important
thing that the coalition Government are embarking upon, because the
principal reason why the coalition came into being was to reduce the

Friend is right when he says that there was a huge problem under the
previous Government with welfare spending. Between 1997 and 2010, it

their children will be entitled to free school meals. At the moment,
there is a difference between those on in-work benefits and those on

it is a fairly cruel and vindictive assault on some of the most
vulnerable people in society, including hundreds of thousands of
disabled people. Even more bizarrely, the Government managed to mess
that up by not spotting the loophole in their legislation. On the same
day, three different Ministers said different things: one said that
only 3,000 to 5,000 would be affected; another said in the House of

Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Steve
Webb):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Dover
(Charlie Elphicke) on securing this wide-ranging debate, which has
actually been quite refreshing, because we so often get caught up in
the minutiae of a clause, amendment or fine detail and it is good to
get back to first principles and the context of what the Government
have done over the past four years. I also enjoyed his blue-skies
thinking about workplace and maternity benefits and so on. I will try
to address both those issues, while providing some reflections on his
idea for workplace
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000166">The
context that my hon. Friend described was one where, for every
£3 that the Government received, they were spending £4.
There is nothing progressive or fair about saying that we will pay for
a higher standard of living for ourselves now and expect our children
to meet the bill. The biggest task that we faced—as my hon.
Friend the Member for Spelthorne (Kwasi Kwarteng) said, this was one of
the reasons for forming the coalition— 
<?notus-xml column=251?>was to provide the country with a stable Government at a time of
economic crisis and to try to get the nation’s finances on an
even keel, which has required a series of difficult decisions,
particularly because social security spending is the biggest area of
Government spending, every one of which was opposed by Labour, but only
one of which it now says that it will reverse. There is a distinct lack
of consistency.</hs_Para>

sure that the record will show—the hon. Member for Rhondda
(Chris Bryant) will correct me if I am wrong—that Labour voted
against the Welfare Reform Act 2013 on Second Reading. He may not
recall, but I am pretty sure that Labour did—it may have voted
against it on Third Reading, which is even worse. The 2013 Act
introduced universal credit, so it is a bit rich to say that Labour
supports universal credit when it voted against the legislation that
introduced it. That shows no
credibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000168">The
hon. Gentleman may say that Labour has been engaged in welfare reform
for the past four years, but it has only said what it is against. It is
against our getting the books balanced by the measures that we have
taken, but the positive agenda has largely been avoided. On the odd
occasion that we get a positive suggestion, it often involves spending
more money, not less. A humane welfare system during a time of
austerity is a challenging task. One would have hoped that the party
that paints itself as progressive would have engaged constructively
over the past four years in how to design such a system, but we have
essentially heard nothing on that
front.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000169">My
hon. Friend the Member for Dover is right that the driver of the
reforms that my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions and the ministerial team have brought forward has absolutely
been fiscal rectitude, but it has also been about more than that. My
right hon. Friend has said—I do not think that I am revealing
any secrets here—that he did not come into his present role
simply to cut, but rather to reform. During difficult times, we are
reforming and bringing together a fractured system. Why should people
have to go to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs for tax credits,
to the local council for housing benefit and to the Department for Work
and Pensions for income support? Why should there not be a single
system? One of the fatal flaws of tax credits, which the hon. Member
for Rhondda praised, is that, because the right hon. Member for
Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown)—the previous Chancellor and
then Prime Minister—wanted to pretend that it was not welfare,
it was claimed that they were negative tax. They were nothing of the
sort. They were social security benefits, but paid over the course of a
year. People’s needs, however, arise on a weekly or monthly
basis. They cannot wait for end-year reconciliation and a
following-year
clawback.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000170">The
beauty of universal credit is that it is real time. It meets
people’s needs when they happen, rather than saying at the end
of the year, “Oh, guess what? We underpaid you,” or, more
often, “Guess what? We overpaid you three years ago by several
thousand quid. Please may we have it back?” That shambles will
be over as we introduce universal
credit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000171"><B><Member ContinuationText="Chris Bryant" PimsId="2350" UID="14021182000355" xid="76" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000355">Chris

Friend the Member for Dover. I want to respond to some of his specific
ideas on workplace benefits. I 
<?notus-xml column=252?>agree with his goals. I absolutely agree that we need a system that is
fair for women; that we need to think hard about anything in the system
that makes an employer less likely to employ a woman of childbearing
age; and that we clearly want the system to work for self-employed
women. He has made some important
points.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000173">As
the system currently works, however, 93% of the cost of statutory
maternity pay is refunded to employers. In fact, more than 100% is
refunded to small firms. Small firms that take on a woman who becomes
pregnant and goes on maternity leave will get back all the maternity
pay that they pay out, plus what is essentially a handling
charge—another 3% on top. Even a large employer gets 92% or
thereabouts of
reimbursement.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000174">If
an employer is reluctant to take on a woman who might have a child,
therefore, the pure finances should not make a huge difference.
Clearly, there is a bureaucracy issue with the reclaiming and so on,
and we are happy to look at whether that can be streamlined, but the
basic principle is that the employers get the lion’s share of
the money back. The thing that might put them off, as my hon. Friend
said in his speech, is the thought, “Well, I employ this person.
They might not be there in some months’ time. I might have to
provide maternity cover, retraining and so on,” but however we
reimburse maternity pay, that will still be a feature of the
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000175">I
am not therefore sure that having a collectivised—I hesitate to
use the word, but my hon. Friend knows what I mean—system of
insurance is any different substantively for the employer. Either way,
employers are getting reimbursed—the costs are being met and are
not in essence falling on the
employer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000176">My
hon. Friend’s proposal is interesting and I am grateful to him
for suggesting it, but one of my worries arises from something that I
have learnt as a Minister. Whenever we set up a new scheme, we have new
infrastructure, bureaucracy and sets of rules. If we had the
levy—the at-work scheme that he described—we would have
to define the new tax base, have a new levy collection mechanism, work
out who was in and who was out, have appeals and all that kind of
stuff. There is always a dead weight to such things. Simply setting up
new infrastructure costs money. I would have to be convinced that we
were getting something back for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000177">In
essence, my hon. Friend is proposing that, instead of the general
taxpayer paying into the pot and employers handing out statutory
maternity pay, which is reimbursed by the Government from the general
taxpayer—the current system—we have a new levy on
employers, although he recognises that he does not want a new jobs tax,
so that it is offset by a reduction in something else that employers
pay and the tax in that world is neutral overall. However, he then says
that he wants the rate not to be some £130 a week, but to be
£200 and something a
week.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000178">My
hon. Friend was commendably brief, so I apologise if I misunderstood,
but I was not clear where that extra money would come from. If we pay
women on maternity leave double, someone must pay for it. If he does
not want that to be an extra burden on firms, paying for it will simply
be a tax increase. That might be the right thing to do, to
increase taxes to pay for it, but it is an
increase.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000179" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000179"><B><Member ContinuationText="Charlie Elphicke" PimsId="5713" UID="14021182000357" xid="1061" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000357">Charlie
Elphicke:</Member></B> Part of the reason for raising the rate is to
bring it into line with the self-employed position. Also, however, most
work places have the 
<?notus-xml column=253?>extra maternity leave as well, yet a small number of less good employers
do not top up the statutory amount. The idea is to raise the threshold,
so that women on maternity leave are overall in a better
position.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000180" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000180"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Webb" PimsId="4546" UID="14021182000358" xid="625" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000358">Steve
Webb:</Member></B> I appreciate that my hon. Friend would like to make
the scheme more generous, but my sense is that that is potentially
quite a substantial cost. If we spend £2 billion already and he
wants to double the rate, is that another £2 billion? I do not
know. Without more detail, I could not say, but it might be a
substantial cost that we have to think
through.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000181">On
the important issue of self-employed women, the dilemma is that if they
have chosen to be self-employed, they are paying class 2 national
insurance of about £2.70 a week, while their employed sisters
are paying national insurance of 12%, or whatever the rate is, as an
employee, while their employer is paying another 13.8%. The best part
of 25% of wages is raised in national insurance from the employed
earner, while £2.70 something a week comes from the
self-employed—or at class 4, depending on how much she is
earning. The amount going into the system from the self-employed is
vastly lower; the maternity provision for the self-employed, however,
is only a bit lower for some
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000182">In
that first six weeks, when we are on 90% of earnings, the employed
earner could get more, but some self-employed women get more than their
employed counterparts, because of the detail of the rules. There is an
issue about some women who pay voluntary class 2 at two or three quid a
week for a period of time, but then become entitled to maternity
allowance running into thousands, having only put in £50 or
£100 into the system. There is a worry that the system is
possibly too lax in that area and we might need to think about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000183">It
is absolutely right that self-employed women get proper maternity
provision, which is what the maternity allowance is for. Relative to
what they put into the system, however, what they get out of it is a
fantastic rate of return compared with an employed earner. An employed
earner is putting far more in, while the employer is also putting
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000184">On
the tax base for my hon. Friend’s idea, he proposes that all
firms should contribute. Unless the self-employed are also going to
contribute, they will either benefit without contributing, or we are
talking about another levy on the self-employed as well. Having chosen
to be self-employed, people often change, because of the lack of
burdens, costs and levies of being an employed earner. We would have to
think about whether we are distorting the choice between becoming an
employed earner or a self-employed person if we made those
changes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000185">I
do not want to end on a discouraging note, because my hon. Friend has
raised an important challenge. We do not want to be in a situation in
which employers, through prejudice or for other reasons, are
disinclined to employ women of childbearing age. That is clearly an 
<?notus-xml column=254?>important issue. We must ensure, however, that the social security
system reflects the labour market as it is now and not as it was after
the second world war. We need to reflect on the fact that there are
growing numbers of, first, women working and, secondly, self-employed
women. The Department is not currently doing work in this area, because
we have our hands full with reform, but it is always good to look at
such
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000186"><B><Member ContinuationText="Charlie Elphicke" PimsId="5713" UID="14021182000359" xid="1061" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000359">Charlie

Webb:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right, and the coalition can be
proud of the shared parental leave approach and for rethinking the
nature of what happens after a child is born and whether it is mum, dad
or a combination of the two who take time off. My hon. Friend is also
right to encourage us to think outside departmental silos: the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills does parental leave, but
the Department for Work and Pensions does maternity pay, and so on. He
makes a welcome link. I am not convinced that his scheme is necessarily
affordable, because of the additional cost involved, but he makes an
important
link.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000188">I
have a final word of encouragement to employers, who may be listening
to our proceedings. About 10 years ago, less than half of
mothers who went on maternity leave came back and worked in the same
job; that figure was about 40%, but it is now 80%. The norm now for an
employer who takes on a woman who goes on maternity leave is
that—four times out of five—she will come back to the job
for which she was trained, in which she is experienced and to which she
can
contribute.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000189">Likewise,
we now find that three quarters of women return to work within 12 to 18
months of having their baby. There is a norm: if someone takes on a
woman of childbearing age, the odds are that she will come back to the
same job within 12 to 18 months. We need to educate employers about the
fact that, if they do not employ women of childbearing age, they are
depriving themselves of talented people who contribute to the work
force. Not employing such women is clearly a bad thing, not only from a
social point of view, but from an economic point of
view.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000190">I

reforms through and deliver them, because we want our legacy to be a
system that, as my hon. Friend the Member for Dover said, encourages
independence, not dependence, that is fiscally responsible, but that
works with the grain of people, so that those who want to work hard and
get on are encouraged and enabled to do so, rather than being trapped
on benefit, which was the risk of the system that we

I would remind the House that we are talking about terror suspects.
Nowadays in Parliament, saying that someone is suspected of terrorist
activity is enough for the political class to assume that that person
does not deserve due process. It is worth reminding the House that
those people have not actually been convicted of any crime. Sadly, I
have to say, the currency of political debate about terrorism has been
so debased, first under Tony Blair and now under the coalition, that
alleged terrorists are now routinely deemed to be the only category of
alleged criminal who are not allowed due process—even alleged
paedophiles have to have due process, but not alleged
terrorists.</hs_Para>

further forward, the UN convention on the reduction of statelessness,
which is where we are supposed to be going, was adopted in 1961 and
ratified by the UK in 1966. It stipulates that, absent circumstances of
fraudulent application or disloyalty toward the contracting state,
deprivations and renunciations of citizenship will take effect only
where a person has or subsequently obtains another nationality in
replacement. The clause moves away from that. This country has spent a
generation trying to move away from statelessness, but we are now going

Brokenshire:</Member></B> I will certainly address some of the hon.

Since 2006, there have been 27 examples of that. The powers have their

current position under section 40 of the British Nationality Act 1981,
as amended by the previous Labour Government in 2002 and 2006, is that
the Home Secretary can deprive a British citizen of their citizenship

false representation or concealment of a material fact. That
essentially means that they used deception to obtain citizenship for
which they were not eligible or, had we known the full and true facts,
we would not have granted the application. In such cases, the person
involved may be left stateless. The second scenario is when the Home
Secretary is satisfied that deprivation is “conducive to the
public good” and the person would not be left stateless as a
result. We want to amend the second of those two conditions to ensure
that individuals who are a serious threat to this country cannot retain
citizenship simply because deprivation would leave them
stateless.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14021182000224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/halltext/140211h0002.htm#14021182000224">As
I said, a Labour Government amended the British Nationality Act 1981 in
2002 and 2006. That provided for deprivation when it was
“conducive to the public good”. That is a broad power
which gives the Home Secretary discretion to respond to changing
threats, and covers cases involving national security, including
espionage, war crimes, serious and organised crime and unacceptable
behaviours such as the glorification of terrorism. Conducive
deprivation can be pursued against any British citizen, including
British-born citizens, as a result of the changes introduced in 2002.
In practice, because a person cannot be left stateless, it applies only
to those who would have another nationality when they are deprived.

safeguards are in place for deprivation cases and those will remain,

arise only after extensive research and understanding of an

Home Office and other Departments are consulted before the information

person deprived of their citizenship has a full right of appeal.
Grounds for appeal can include both the legality of the action and the
merits of the Secretary of State’s decision. Such appeals are
heard at either the first-tier tribunal—the immigration and
asylum chamber—or, where issues of national security are
relevant, at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission, or SIAC. In
both cases, any onward challenge can be to the Court of Appeal or other
higher courts. That is not being changed by the wider, necessary
changes to the appeals system contained in the Immigration

accept that it is a particular tactic. It is simply an operational
reality that in some cases the information comes to light when the
person is outside the UK or that it is the final piece of the picture,
confirming what has been suspected. In other cases, we may determine
that the most appropriate response to the actions of an individual is
to deprive that person while they are outside the UK. Equally, there

seek to remove that individual from the UK once they had acquired

come back to the hon. Lady’s point about the concept, as she
described it, of two-tier citizenship. We do not accept that there is,
or will be, a two-tier citizenship system. The proposal merely reflects
the fact that there are differing routes to citizenship, and therefore,
different actions permissible depending on the actions of the person
concerned. The power to deprive a person of citizenship, as I have
explained, already exists and certain aspects can only be applied
depending on a person’s route to citizenship. Naturalised or
registered citizens can be deprived if they obtained it by means of
fraud, false representation or concealment of a material fact.

that Members are concerned about instances where deprivation action
takes places when a person is outside the UK, and I hear the hon.
Lady’s point. I restate that the Home Secretary takes
deprivation action only when she considers it is appropriate and that
may mean doing so when an individual is abroad, which prevents their
return and reduces the risk to the UK. That individual would still have
a full right of appeal and the ability to resolve their nationality
issues accordingly. It is often the travel abroad to terrorist training
camps or to countries with internal fighting that is the tipping

need to act.</hs_Para>

drivers and no requirement to display a 'P' plate. However, the
Transport Research Laboratory Report on “Novice Drivers:
Evidence review and Evaluation Pre-Driver Training, Graduated Driver

safety. One recommendation was that on successful completion of the
driving test a driver would be permitted to progress to a probationary
licence from age 18. During the 12 month (minimum) probationary licence
the driver would be required to display a green 'P' plate to identify
their licence status and aid enforcement of other recommended

proposed regulation was set out in the relevant Explanatory Memorandum
(EM 10154/13) and in my subsequent letters of 12 November last to the
Chairmen of the Scrutiny Committees, particularly in the impact
checklist attached thereto. The Government's view is that encouraging
fair competition between ports is the best way to secure efficiency
within them, and that regulation of ports that already operate in a
fully competitive environment, and that are already subject (as are
other commercial businesses) to national and European competition law,
should be kept to the necessary minimum.</hs_Para>

together very effectively to tackle antisocial behaviour. However there
are still too many cases of victims reporting the same problem
repeatedly and not getting an adequate response. The community trigger
introduced in the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill will
give victims and communities the right to demand that local agencies,
including councils, the police and registered providers of social
housing, deal with such cases. It will require them to work in
partnership and adopt a collective, problem-solving approach to
persistent antisocial

local authorities regarding the accommodation and support those
relocated under the Vulnerable Person Relocation scheme will need when
they arrive in the UK. The scheme aims to help the most vulnerable
refugees, giving priority to survivors of torture and violence, and
women and children at risk or in need of medical care, and those
relocated are likely to have very specific support or medical needs. We
do not believe, therefore, that it is feasible to place them with
individuals in the UK, and we have no plans to enable individuals to
offer accommodation under the scheme. However, the Government welcomes
offers of assistance for the scheme, and those who wish to help may
want to inquire with their local authority about ways in which they may

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI)
data sourced from the 2011-12 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses
disposable household income, adjusted using modified Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equivalisation factors for
household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for
standard of living.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. Net disposable
incomes have been used to answer this question. This includes earnings
from employment and self-employment, state support, income from
occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources.
Income tax payments, National Insurance contributions, council
tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from
incomes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. Figures have been rounded
to the nearest 100,000.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4. Figures have
been presented on a Before Housing Cost basis and therefore housing
costs are not deducted from income.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5.
When considering the living standards of children, measures after
housing costs can underestimate the true standard of living as a family
may make a choice to spend more on rent or mortgage to attain a higher
standard of accommodation.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6. All
estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a
degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution
as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in
non-response.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>7. The reference period
for HBAI figures is the financial
year.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>8. In Households Below Average
Income, a household is defined as a single person or group of people
living at the same address as their only or main residence, who either
share one meal together or share the living accommodation. This differs
from a benefit unit (family), which is defined as a single adult or a
married or cohabiting couple, plus any dependent children. From January
2006 same-sex partners (civil partners and cohabitees) are also
included in the same benefit unit. A household will consist of one or
more benefit units. The figures above are based on children living in
households in relative low income, absolute low income, and combined
low income and material deprivation, who are in families where at least
one adult works.</hs_TableFooter>

adult entertainment industry which might exploit jobseekers were not
advertised through Jobcentre Plus. The Welfare Reform Act 2012 ensured
that vacancies which involve performing sexual activities were banned

in law to differentiate between performers and ancillary workers.
Jobcentre Plus work coaches are specifically guided to only discuss
these vacancies with claimants who ask about them.</hs_Para>

national prisoners have been given release on temporary licence and for
what reasons. This information could only be obtained by a manual check
of the records of all instances of prisoners being released on
temporary license, which would incur disproportionate cost. It is not

incidence of self-harm in prisons. All prisons are required to have
procedures in place to identify, manage and support people who are at
risk of harm to themselves. These procedures include the Assessment,
Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process, which is a
prisoner-centred, flexible care planning system for prisoners
identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm. The ACCT process is

response to our earlier, wide consultation ‘Transforming
Rehabilitation—a revolution in the way we manage
offenders’. In producing that document we consulted widely and
received nearly 600 formal responses and held 14 consultation events
which were attended by over 800 stakeholders. The Magistrates'
Association welcomed the Government's intention to have short sentenced
prisoners supervised after release and asked a number of questions
about the reforms. Officials and Ministers have regular discussions
with all stakeholders to the Transforming Rehabilitation Programme,
including the Magistrates' Association, and the views received have
been invaluable in informing these
reforms.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1402125000022" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/text/140211w0003.htm#1402125000022">Victim

Wright:</Member></B> The Probation Victim Contact Scheme (VCS), which
was established in 2001, provides valuable support to victims of
offenders who receive a sentence of imprisonment of 12 months or more
or a hospital order for a violent or sexual offence. The VCS enables
victims to be informed of key stages of an offender's sentence, such as
if they are transferred to open conditions or released. Victims also
have the statutory right to make representations about the licence
conditions to which the offender should be subject on
release, to re-assure and protect
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402125000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/text/140211w0003.htm#1402125000195">In
cases where the offender's case is reviewed by the Parole Board,
victims have a right to submit a victim personal statement to the
Parole Board, setting out the impact of the offence against them, and
what the impact of release will be. If the Parole Board holds an oral
hearing, victims can apply to read their statement to the Parole Board
panel, with the presumption that this will be agreed. The new Victims'
Code, which was published in October 2013, enshrines the entitlement
for victims to make a VPS to the Parole
Board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402125000196" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/text/140211w0003.htm#1402125000196">Currently,

patient has been admitted electively into hospital from a waiting list,
having been given no date of admission at the time a decision to admit
was made. Booked admissions are those in which the patient was admitted
electively having been given a date at the time it was decided to
admit. Planned admissions are excluded as they are usually part of a
planned sequence of clinical care determined mainly on clinical
criteria, which, for example, could require a series of events, perhaps
taking place every three months, six months or annually. Because of
this the number of episodes used to generate the mean and median time
waited is likely to be lower than the number of FAEs reported in the
table. It is the case that some providers do not supply the data
required to calculate a time waited on eligible
episodes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.

from 21 July 2010 the HSCIC has published provisional monthly NHS
workforce data. As expected with provisional statistics, some figures
may be revised from month to month as issues are uncovered and
resolved. The monthly workforce data is not-directly comparable with
the annual workforce census; it only includes those staff on the
Electronic Staff Record (ESR) (ie it does not include Primary care
staff or Bank staff). There are also new methods of presenting data
(headcount methodology is different and there is now a role count).
This information is available from September 2009 onwards at the

Poulter:</Member></B> The Department of Health is committed to giving
due consideration of the UN convention on the rights of the child
(UNCRC) during the policy-making process. The Department of Health
consults with a range of expert groups to ensure the best interests of
children are represented within our work. For example, in October 2013,
the Secretary of State for Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for
South West Surrey (Mr Hunt), received a report from the Children and
Young People's Health Outcomes Forum on the issues raised in the report
by Robert Francis QC as they relate to children and young people. Their
report was informed by the views of children and young people,
including those gathered by on their behalf the National Children's
Bureau, one of the Department's strategic
partners.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402125002727" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140211/text/140211w0005.htm#1402125002727">The
United Kingdom Government is due to report to the UN Committee
responsible for the UNCRC shortly. The Department for Education is
co-ordinating the response from other Government Departments, including
the work that the Department of Health has undertaken. Once the
Government has submitted its response to the UN Committee a copy of the
response will be placed in the
