assessment. So assessments are nothing new for this Administration,
because the previous Administration introduced them. They did not do
that very well, but we agree with assessments. Of course if someone is
unfit for work, they can have a sick note put 
<?notus-xml column=3?>in while they are waiting for an appeal to go through—should that
happen—and they will be entitled to jobseeker’s

what he should mention to his constituents, but he might well start
with the fact that this benefits cap was opposed by Labour when we
implemented it. His point about the level is simple. We have embedded
the cap now, it has been rolled out and we have made sure that it has
worked properly. We have seen a huge number of people move back to
work; some 19,000 people who were going to be capped have
gone to work and thus avoided the cap. So the cap is successful
everywhere. However, we should remember that there are differences in
income and in London a lower cap would be a rather severe penalty to
put on people. Therefore, although I keep the cap under review, I have
no plans at the moment to change its level.</hs_Para>

fewer landlords making properties available. It seems to me that that

hon. Friend in her place? It is my personal hope that she remains there
and returns to the House again, because she gets great coverage for her
constituents. The issue she raises is an important one, but we need to
get the right balance between what zero-hours contracts deliver and any
abuses there might be. The Department for Business, Innovation and
Skills is carrying out a consultation, and we are fully co-operating in
that and will ensure that such contracts do not cause problems in the
Work programme. However, it is worth remembering that those contracts
also provide people with a flexible way of working and the freedom to
arrange jobs around other commitments, and they allow employers to be
competitive in response to market trends. I therefore think that we
must get the balance right with zero-hours contracts and not throw the
baby out with the bathwater. We must recognise that for many people
they are positive and helpful, but we also want to end any abuses there
might be for
others.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1402248000026" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0001.htm#1402248000026">Trussell

moved rapidly after that, including the departure of President
Yanukovych from Kiev and the removal of guards from Government

voted to restore the 2004 constitution, to release Yuliya Tymoshenko
and to impeach the President. He has said that he will not step down,
but it is clear that his authority is no longer widely
accepted. A number of members of the previous Government have been

Security Council resolution is a chink of light in an otherwise bleak
and deteriorating situation. An estimated 5,000 Syrians are dying every
month and a quarter of a million remain trapped in areas under
siege. The bombardment of civilian areas with barrel bombs continues
unabated, and there are reports of attacks with cluster munitions as
well. An inquiry led by distinguished British experts reported on the
photos of the bodies of around 11,000 tortured and executed Syrian
detainees. Some 2.5 million Syrians are refugees in the region, three
quarters of them women and children. The UN expects 4 million refugees

this horrifying backdrop we continue to seek a negotiated settlement to
the conflict, but there is no sign of the Assad regime having any
willingness whatsoever to negotiate the political transition demanded
by the UN Security Council. The second round of Geneva II negotiations
ended on 15 February without agreement on future talks. UN and Arab
League envoy Lakhdar Brahimi had proposed an agenda for a third round
of 
<?notus-xml column=28?>talks focusing on violence and terrorism—the regime’s
stated priority—and a transitional governing body, 
in parallel. The regime refused this. As a result

national coalition, by contrast, approached the negotiations
constructively and in good faith. It published a statement of
principles for the transitional governing body, stating that it would
enable the Syrian people to decide their own future and protect the
rights and freedoms of all Syrians. Those supporting the regime side,
including the Russian and Iranian Governments, need to do far more to
press the regime to take this process seriously and to reach a
political settlement, as we have done with the opposition. We will
continue our support to the national coalition and to civil society in
Syria. We are providing £2.1 million for Syrian civil defence
teams to help local communities deal with attacks, and improve the
capability of local councils to save the lives of those injured and
alleviate humanitarian suffering. This includes training, which is now

regime’s foot-dragging is also clear on the removal of chemical
weapons from Syria. According to the Organisation for the Prohibition
of Chemical Weapons, only 11% of Syria’s declared chemical
stockpile has been removed, and the regime has missed the 5 February
deadline for removing all chemicals. That has delayed the destruction
operation by months, and puts the 30 June final destruction
deadline in jeopardy. This slow rate of progress is unacceptable. The
UN Secretary-General and the OPCW have made it clear that Syria has
all the necessary equipment to enable the movement of the
chemicals. The OPCW’s director general is pressing the
Syrians to accept a plan that would see the removal of all Syrian
chemicals in a considerably shorter period, enabling the deadline to be
met.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402248000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0001.htm#1402248000220">Turning
finally to Iran, the first step agreement with Iran came into force on

exclusively peaceful. The talks were constructive. The E3 plus 3 and
Iran agreed on the issues that need to be resolved as part of a

mid-March in Vienna. The E3 plus 3 and Iran plan to meet monthly in
order to make swift progress on the issues that need to be resolved in
the ambitious time frame we agreed in the Geneva deal in November. The
House should be under no illusion that the challenges

take the process seriously and to reach a political settlement. Will he

Obama was right to say that Ukraine could no longer be seen simply as a
“cold war chessboard”, but will the Foreign Secretary
tell us whether he was aware of any guarantees from Foreign Minister
Lavrov that Russia would not encourage southern and eastern regions of
Ukraine to break away from the rest of the country? Of course
Ukrainians have divergent views on the future of their country,

had much less impact without our ability to amplify our influence

for us to follow up last month’s conference. Ministers from the

doing that all the time, and are pressing for other donations. I do not
rule out the need for further such conferences—indeed, I am sure

periods of six months. If it were renewed, further sanctions relief
would need to be negotiated, but within this six-month period, we must
and will stick to the agreed amount, and will not extend or limit it.
The estimated amount of about $7 billion must be set in the context of
about $60 billion to $100 billion of Iranian assets frozen

important signal of our seriousness, and it will maintain the pressure

He rightly pointed out that I said, months ago, that there were
important conditions to be attached, and I still say that today. It is
vital that such economic assistance, through international financial
institutions, should not be wasted and that it should not indirectly
subsidise Russia. Any such money therefore has to be accompanied by
serious reform in Ukraine. The IMF could put together a package very
quickly; a programme has been almost ready to go for some time, and the

our message about avoiding violence is to all sides. It is also clear,
however, from events over the weekend, when more than 300 Members of

our embassies, we can give the Ukrainian authorities clear advice, as I
have been doing in public today, and shall do in private, about how
matters should be conducted to achieve that free, democratic future
with financial support from international institutions. However, it is
also important to communicate that message more widely across many

countries funding to support democratic development and political

Hague:</Member></B> That analysis is correct. I said earlier that it is
important not to present this as a binary choice for Ukraine.
My hon. Friend’s argument is the reason for that: a binary
choice would always make it difficult for a nation with that
composition to give a 100% clear answer. It is important to leave open
the wider possibilities of co-operation, both with Russia and with the
European Union in future. It is for Ukraine to decide its
constitutional structure. We can support the objectives of territorial
integrity and the workings of a democratic state, but it is for it to
decide the means of doing so.</hs_Para>

Foreign Ministry to this improvement in the bilateral contact we have
been building up over recent months. My hon. Friend understands very
well the complex power structure in Iran. At the time that our embassy
compounds were invaded in 2011, I doubt very much that this was at the
behest of the Iranian Foreign Ministry or with the approval of that
ministry. So it is necessary for us to be confident that the Iranian
system as a whole is ready to let an embassy fulfil the normal
functions of an embassy. Good progress is being made on that, as he has
seen for himself. On trade relations, it is very important to uphold
existing sanctions, not to send a false signal to Iran that it now need
not worry about the economic situation, and the United Kingdom will be
careful not to send such a false
signal<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402248000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0001.htm#1402248000301"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jim Cunningham" PimsId="2803" UID="1402248000674" xid="147" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0001.htm#1402248000674"><B>Mr

force of international law behind it and the world behind it, including
Russia’s agreement. So it is a much more substantial product of

regime feels itself to be in a strong military position, relatively, is
probably behind its intransigence at the Geneva negotiations. In the
long term, of course, that will be an illusion, because it is in that
position in a collapsing country. This conflict has gone backwards and
forwards over three years now, and its tide can easily turn against the
regime in future. I think it is making a great mistake. I would never
comment in the House on intelligence matters, as my hon. Friend

criminal justice Bills as they jumped from one bandwagon to the next,
but that was all to distract us from the real truth that Labour is the
party of soft justice and unsafe streets. Too often, those who broke

right that muggers and rapists get off with a caution, or that those
who abscond on licence can do so safe in the knowledge that, if caught,
they will serve no more than the remainder of their sentence. There are
too many offenders who commit serious crimes but are released

1 of the Bill introduces a firm but fair package of sentencing and

of the aspects of our justice system that causes me most concern is the
concept of automatic early release. As I have said before, I cannot

do not think that early automatic release should be a right. That is
why I am making a start on tackling it in the Bill, which introduces
measures to end automatic early release for anyone given an extended
determinate sentence, or sentenced to custody for the rape of a child
or for serious terrorism offences. No such offenders will be released
before the end of their custodial term, unless the Parole Board judges
that they no longer pose a risk of serious harm to the public. I would
like to do away with automatic early release in one step. In times of
tight resource, I cannot do it in one go, but I can make a start, and
that is what the Bill

a serious threat to our society. Terrorists who commit or try to commit
horrific crimes in this country must face the very toughest

offender regime so that courts can impose the most serious sentences
necessary for such crimes.

a situation in which when courts view somebody as a junior member of a

serious and brutal offences, and those are precisely the people whom we

separated so that 12-year-olds are not mixed with 17-year-olds. Living
on the same site, using the same facilities at different times, and
maximising the effectiveness of the resource we put into creating those
facilities must be a sensible way forward. If the secure college model
works, I do not rule out having women’s units on site as well,
but that does not mean we mix them. At Peterborough prison, a
women’s prison and a male prison adjoin and share many of the
same facilities, although the two sides do not mix. It is about making
the best use of our resources to deliver the highest quality

just the biggest children’s prison in Europe”, but that

with a fence around it on a site that can deliver quality education and
a mix of skills development, in a way that will genuinely help
take young people—while we have them under our
control—through a period of skill building of the kind they
desperately need. That will be a whole lot better than having young

3 introduces a suite of provisions to reduce the burden of

of fines and victims’ charges. The collection of court costs
will come after that. It is worth saying that the repayment of the
charge will, as is normally the case in the courts in relation to fines
and victim surcharges, be set at a rate that offenders can afford, so
there will always be an incentive for them to find a job and to work
hard. Offenders will be able to earn their way out of the charge if
they do not reoffend. We will make provision for the charge, or any
outstanding sums of money, to be written off if the offender does not
reoffend. There will, therefore, be an incentive to go back into work,
get on with it and make regular payments. Then, when they do not
reoffend, an amount of money will be written off. That is a fair and
balanced way to ensure that we secure a contribution from those who can
afford it—there are people in our courts who will be able to
afford this money on the spot—and create a system whereby if
people do the right thing, we will do the right thing by
them and write off any outstanding

review represents a crucial check on public bodies. It rightly allows

publicity or to delay implementation of a decision that has been made

Government have consulted extensively on this package of reform, and we
did so with an open mind. Concerns were raised, both practical and
principled, about proposals to reform “standing”, which
determines who can bring a judicial review, and I have decided not to
pursue those. Judicial review must continue in its role as a check on
the powers that be. It is an important tool for our society which
allows people to challenge genuinely wrong decisions by public
authorities. These reforms do not change that, and I would not want
them to do so. They make it more difficult for pressure groups simply
to use judicial review as a campaigning tool and for those with a
financial vested interest—for example, one developer judicially
reviewing another—to delay a process of investment, to derail a
competitor or to derail a major project that is strategically and
economically in the interests of this country.</hs_Para>

Bill contains a vital set of proposals as we work to deliver a justice
system in which people can have confidence—a justice system that
deals robustly with those who repeatedly commit crimes. The Bill
toughens sentencing for some of the most serious crimes and ensures
that serious offenders will be released only if they can show that they
are no longer a threat to society. The Bill requires offenders to
contribute to the cost of the criminal courts, and allows us to test a
new approach to youth custody and to reduce the delays and expense
involved in unmeritorious judicial reviews. The Bill draws a line under
Labour’s soft justice culture, provides hard-working families
with greater safety and security in their communities, and removes
barriers to economic growth. I commend it to the

from nowhere. If the Government really wanted a new justice Bill, the
obvious place to trail it would be in the imminent Queen’s

old saying that the devil makes work for idle hands. Recent weeks have
certainly shown that to be the case, with the Government suffering a
number of troubling episodes with their own Back Benchers, perhaps in
no small part because the thin legislative programme leaves their own
sides twiddling their thumbs. Nature abhors a vacuum; so too does
Parliament. Disquiet, plotting and rebellions tie the Government in
knots, leading to the absurd situation in which the Opposition had to
step in and vote down a Tory Back-Bench amendment on the
Government’s own Immigration Bill—an amendment that broke
the rule of law—while the Conservative majority in the coalition
sat on their hands. Has anyone heard of anything so pathetic? We have a
governing party that could not even vote in favour of its own Bill, and
a Lord Chancellor who swears an oath to uphold the law but who could
not even bring himself to vote for that rule of law.</hs_Para>

parliamentary schedules and to keep Tory Back Benchers happy and busy.

received Royal Assent, and the Government are having a third bite of

up for the error they made when they abolished indeterminate sentences
for public protection. I know that

and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke), the previous Justice
Secretary, when he removed from judges the power to make IPPs to
protect the public. To be fair to the current Justice Secretary, he
would never have countenanced abolishing that power, but he cannot
admit that because he voted for its abolition. We therefore have clause
3 and schedule 15 eligibility for life sentences and extended
determinant sentences to try to address the mistakes of the Legal Aid,

sentence is no substitute for judges having the power when sentencing
to impose an indeterminate sentence to protect the public. That will
give the Parole Board an extra work load, yet I bet that the Justice
Secretary cannot tell the House what extra resources he will give it to
do its job properly. Silence. The Ministry of Justice’s impact
assessment estimates that there will be at least an extra 1,100 parole
hearings owing to the Bill. If all the supplementary work involved is
added, there will be a huge addition to the Parole Board’s work

even this Justice Secretary understands that a poorly resourced
Parole Board making the wrong decisions about whether to release
someone is as bad as automatic release. Wrong decisions made by the
Parole Board because of an overburdened and stretched staff help no
one; nor do delays in getting a hearing because of a backlog. There are
problems and delays in prisoners getting the courses and treatments
that they need as part of their sentencing plans and delays in getting

the maximum for a handful of offences still leaves many offences

appropriate sentence to protect the public. By the way, although we do
not oppose them, let us be clear that the provisions to increase the
maximum life sentences for certain terrorism-related offences look
tough, but the Ministry of Justice impact assessment confirms that this
is a classic con trick. Do hon. Members know how many offenders were
convicted in 2013 for the offences of either weapons training for
terrorist purposes or training for terrorism? None. What about 2012?
None. This new toughness will affect no one. None of those offences is
being brought before the courts, so there is no one to punish and no
one to deter. I wonder how the Justice Secretary intends to measure the

longer jail sentence

Secretary. That figure applies in prisons such as Oakwood, which are
failing—new purpose-built prisons. In a prison like the one I
visited last week in Winchester the average cost is £42,000; in
a prison like Wandsworth, it is £44,000; in Brixton,
£46,000; and in Pentonville, £48,000. He is just plucking
figures out of thin air and assuming that all 87,000 prisoners have the
same £15,000-a-year cost. That is not the case and he has to be
honest enough to recognise that there are far too many expensive prison
places because of the legacy of his cancelling the new prisons and
closing down too many over the last four years.</hs_Para>

turn to the second part of the Bill, on youth justice. It is worth
pausing to reflect on the dramatic fall over the past 10 years or so in
the number of young people held in custody. The most recent figures
show a drop of more than 60%. I pay tribute to the hard work of the
Youth Justice Board and youth offending teams up and down the country.
I am proud of Labour’s record in setting up the YJB, which led
to these falls. I wish the outgoing chair well and the new chair the
best of luck in his endeavours. The YJB’s innovative ways of
working have delivered enormous economic and social benefits to
society, and I for one am delighted that we were successful in keeping
it doing its important job, rather than it being abolished two weeks
ago, as the Government had
wanted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000006">We
have reached a hard core of young offenders in our youth justice
system, and that brings a different set of challenges. As has been
said, reoffending rates for this hard core remain stubbornly high. The
Government’s preferred solution is secure colleges, and the Bill
paves the way for their introduction. Ministers have announced only one
so far, in Leicestershire. Construction will not start until 2015.
There is no clear idea of where the £85 million that it
will cost will come from, or what will be cut to find the money. It
smacks of another commitment made by this Justice Secretary for which
the next Government will be left to pick up the tab. In Committee, we
will need to get down to the details, but already a number of groups
have expressed concerns about the plans. There will be just one secure
college; either it will be a huge college for the whole
country—a teenage Titan prison, with all the problems that will
entail—or only those in the east midlands will
benefit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000007">There

have the Government made clear their intentions for the network of
secure children’s homes. Granted, those are expensive, but I

will want convincing that forking out £85 million on bricks and
mortar is better than spending the money on improving the amount of
education and rehabilitative work in the existing secure training
centre network. I see that the Chair of the Select Committee on Justice
is here; the Justice Committee recently argued for a
“fundamental shift” of resources from custody to early
intervention with young people at risk of reoffending. It also made the
point that most young offenders would not be in custody long
enough—the average is 79 days—for the secure college to
do any good in improving basic skills and addressing offending
behaviour. A number of experts have also raised concerns, which we
shall explore in Committee.</hs_Para>

part of the Bill proposes changes in our courts. On the face
of it, efforts to speed up court proceedings and make them more
efficient—for example, by ensuring easier and quicker appeals to
the Supreme Court, and by having magistrates courts deal with
lower-level offenders faster—are to be welcomed, but this should
not be to the detriment of proper open justice or due process. The
Civil Justice Council, the Magistrates Association and others have
expressed concerns that we should explore in Committee. Similarly, no
one opposes convicted criminals being made to make amends for their
crimes. The Government now wish to tack a charge on to those found
guilty towards the cost of their trial. There have been difficulties
collecting fines and the victim surcharge from guilty criminals,
sometimes as a result of organisational problems, but sometimes because
criminals simply do not have enough money. There are between
£1.4 billion and £2 billion in uncollected fines, and
only this weekend it was reported that £13 million in
victim surcharge had failed to be collected by the Government. I am
sure that the Justice Secretary did not mean it when he said that that
was because they are all dead, or that outsourcing all of this will
solve all the problems. We will seek guarantees that this will not be
yet another trumpeted announcement that ends in failure down the years
as non-payments rack up and are written
off.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000011">It
is right that the law on jurors and the use of the internet keeps up to
date with the march of technology. I, too, am pleased that the
Government have listened to the recommendations of the Law Commission
in that respect. However, as Members will recall from the high-profile
trial of Vicky Pryce, there are problems with juries not understanding
their role sufficiently, and we shall explore what steps can be taken
to educate and inform the public and jurors about the important civic
function of jury service so that it is less of an alien process to
them. I welcome proposals to raise the juror age limit to 75.</hs_Para>

that the courts find that some Government decisions are wrong. For
example, they might find against plans to expand Heathrow with a third

be able to be challenged by the judiciary. He should accept the

3 allows summary trials for non-imprisonable offences “on the
papers” only and without the defendant being present. This is an
entirely sensible proposal, but it forms just a small part of a wider
debate about which case should be going to which court. Of course, all
criminal cases start in magistrates courts, and the vast majority of
them are disposed of there without ever going to the Crown court. This
is important, first because most of us wholly support the ancient
British tradition of low-level crimes being judged by magistrates, but
secondly because the cases where an election can be made cost about
£3,400 in a Crown court compared with the £900 they would
cost in a magistrates court. There is the further question of what
should be a criminal offence at all. I would be happy to debate, for
instance, whether TV licence evasion is suitable for criminal rather
than civil
trial<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:02:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000035">One
of the main stumbling blocks to those part 3 proposals in the past has
been disagreement between Government Departments, and I congratulate
the Lord Chancellor on knocking the right heads together. The other
problem has been the magistrates, who have been unwilling to lessen
their work load, give that that has already reduced by more than one
third during the last five years or so. Furthermore, the moving of
traffic cases to a single traffic court in each police force area,
which I think is being proposed, will leave some magistrates courts
light-handed and more open to a merger proposal with another local
court. There is significant volume here. For instance, speeding alone
accounts for some 10% of all
convictions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:03:40"></hs_TimeCode>. So
the issues here are slightly more complicated and need to be placed
into context.</hs_Para>

have also felt a bit under attack in recent years owing to the
efficiency changes that really had to be made, and my concern here is
that we could be reducing their work load further, without giving them
the extra quality work that they deserve. Not only do justices of the
peace cost less, but cases go through much faster. Sentencing is not
for longer periods if a case goes to the Crown court, juries are more
likely to acquit than magistrates, and the Crown procedural delays
often mean that witnesses are not available.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:04:08"></hs_TimeCode>There are three
interconnected issues here. The first concerns bulk non-serious cases,
which is handled in the Bill. Secondly, there are the magistrates
courts that these cases are being dealt in, and, thirdly, as we reduce
magistrates input into these bulk areas, there is the
question of how to increase their involvement in other
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:04:36"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000037">On
the first bulk issue, I agree that it is ridiculous that three JPs need
to hear a small traffic case in open court with prosecutors involved in
reading out case details. I appreciate and agree that defendants should
retain the right to a full hearing in open court should they so
require, but let us also appreciate that around half of traffic
proceedings have no plea entered at all, a point that came up
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000038">On
the second issue of magistrates courts being used, will the Minister
please confirm that traffic work will be moved to a single court per
police area? This is sensible, and I hope that a thorough review of
procedure will be undertaken at the same time. I am sure that
significant savings and a better service could be provided through
better IT and procedures, but this could go yet further and be put into
the context of a wider review. Of course, 
<?notus-xml column=69?>I would maintain that the closure of around 140
courts by the Government was correct, not least because as a result
cases are proceeding quicker and at a lower cost. One of the keys to
effective court procedure is to have larger court centres where listing
and delays can be better managed. If we add to this continued use of
technology and more virtual courtrooms in police stations, there is
much more we could do. The bulk processing of non-imprisonable cases is
part of this, but it would be better placed in the context of the wider
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:59:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:06:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:06:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000039"><Member ContinuationText="Mr George Howarth" PimsId="1031" UID="14022421000140" xid="290" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000140"><B>Mr

spills over into what is, in effect, a criminal offence. Does he agree

main possible gap that I see here is on the third issue of wider JP
powers, and we should be reviewing part 3 in the context of new summary
only offences and an increase of maximum JP sentences to 12 months, not
least to give a clear indication to the magistracy of our support. I
had heard of some limited Government proposals to make
shoplifting a summary only offence where the stolen goods are valued at
£200 or less. Perhaps the Minister will advise the House on his
proposals in this regard. The Magistrates Association has been
advocating new summary only offences for some drugs possession, making
off without payment, going equipped for theft, small benefit fraud,
some affray and driving offences, some assault charges and failure to
surrender to bail. I appreciate that this could result in a rise in the
prison population, which the Magistrates Association considers to be
about 1,000 people, but on the other side there would be court savings
of £30 million to £40 million. Again, I would appreciate
the Minister commenting on these
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:08:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000042">My
second point relates to raising the upper age limit for jury service
from 70 to 75. That sounds sensible given the upward age of people in
the UK, but will the Minister say a little more about the research that
has been done to confirm this? Will the change have any negative
implications for younger people not being called? The problem that I
found here was the reluctance by the judiciary to allow research to be
carried out on jurors. My instinct is that fewer people are now willing
to be called than was the case in the past. I would be concerned if the
Bill exacerbated that, on the basis that it could allow working people
to be let off more easily. My suspicions here are not reduced by a
Government note that I saw, mentioning that they expect some savings to
result from a reduction in the number of jurors in employment. I do not
see that as a good objective for our democratic system.</hs_Para>

I did my own jury service, on the first day a man rushed in shouting at
the court staff that he had 2,500 chickens being delivered that day and
who would 
<?notus-xml column=70?>look after them. He was let off service on the spot, despite presumably
having had long notice of his jury date, although perhaps not of his
chicken
delivery<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>. The
point I am making is that jury service is an important part of
citizenship; so much so that I think we should be putting as much
effort into educating the young in school about its benefits to
society, and ensuring that people serve when called, as we are into
pushing up the service age. Perhaps the Minister will comment on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:09:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000044">My
third issue relates to the new contempt of court provisions on jury
misconduct. That is important not only for ensuring a fair trial and
saving costs, but for retaining confidence in the jury system. If a
whole trail needs to be started again because of, say, internet
research carried out by one juror, that is hugely frustrating for the
other jurors on the case, who could be put off doing service again. My
wider point is that access to technology is having such a huge effect
on so many areas of our lives, and across all Departments, that perhaps
we need a cross-departmental review of its impact on existing
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000045">Clauses
29 to 31 relate to criminals paying their own court costs, as was

and after prosecution costs. I would not confuse that with the point

on judicial review, I recall that as a young law student in the 1980s
we had to learn about administrative law, but the striking thing then
was how rarely it was used, and then only for very serious abuses of
power. We have since seen a huge growth industry in which a willing
judiciary has now opened up three or four courts across the country to
hear those applications, which increasingly resemble appeals, rather
than judicial review, or cheaper alternatives to proper cases, often
funded by third-party organisations, some of which stay anonymous. That
must change, and I am pleased, without addressing the detail, to see

Part<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:18:03"></hs_TimeCode> 1 of the
Bill creates a number of offences, many of which are considered
unnecessary at best and, at worst, vindictive provisions that are
likely to increase the prison population considerably. Clause 4
introduces a drastic change to release arrangements for offenders
serving extended determinate sentences, who are currently entitled to
automatic release after they have served two thirds of their sentence.
Instead, they will now be required to appear before the Parole Board so
that it can assess whether they are fit to be released on
licence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000057">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:18:38"></hs_TimeCode>
is important to note that extended determinate sentences were enacted
by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, a
very recent piece of legislation. That is not the only example in the
Bill of the Government seeking to amend provisions introduced by their
own justice Bills. Extended determinate sentences from the outset
increased the minimum tariff a person was required to spend in custody
from half of their sentence to two thirds. By stipulating that
offenders will also have to satisfy the Parole Board before being
considered for release, the amount of time that is available for
supervision and rehabilitation back into the community is further
decreased.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000058">Furthermore<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Government appear to have drastically underestimated the impact
those changes will have on the Parole Board’s resources and the
size of the prison population. In their impact assessment, the
Government predict that the changes introduced in clauses 1 to 5 will
result in an increase of 1,000 prison places and an increase of 1,100
Parole Board hearings per year between implementation and 2030. The
Prison Reform Trust has written to Members of Parliament urging us to
seek clarification from the Government on how they calculate these
figures. After all, the Government of the time underestimated the
impact that IPP sentences—indeterminate sentences for public
protection—would have on the prison population. When those
sentences were first debated in Parliament—I recall the
debates—the Government were insistent that the new sentence
would increase the prison population by 900 places. By June 2013, 5,620
offenders were still in custody serving the now-abolished IPP
sentences, 3,549 of whom were being held beyond their tariff date. The
impact on the operation of the Parole Board has been nothing short of
overwhelming. In August 2013, the backlog of cases still awaiting
hearings by the Parole Board was 1,352, with IPP offenders accounting
for 61% of indeterminate review cases. Yet the Government think it
apposite to increase the workload of the Parole Board yet
again by introducing changes to the automatic release of
offenders—and this at a time when Parole Board staff numbers
have been reduced by nearly one in five.</hs_Para>

release test for recalled prisoners provided for in clauses 7 and 8
will similarly place an extra burden on the beleaguered Parole Board.
At present, recalled offenders serving determinate sentences undergo a
fixed-term recall whereby they serve 28 days in custody and are then
automatically released. Under clauses 7 and 8, however, these offenders
will serve the remainder of their sentence in custody if the Secretary
of State determines that an offender is likely to breach a condition of
their licence. The Parole Board would need to conduct a release test
before certifying that the offender can in fact be released. The Prison
Reform Trust has drawn attention to the fact that this pays scant
regard to the peculiar circumstances 
<?notus-xml column=73?>of offenders with learning disabilities and mental health problems, many
of whom find it difficult to understand the terms of their
licence.</hs_Para>

again, the Government’s estimate of how many offenders will be
affected by this change seems worryingly off the mark. The impact
assessment calculates that the change will result in 75 offenders per
year being affected and an extra 50 prison places being required.
However, this blatantly fails to take into account the likely impact of
the changes being introduced concurrently by the Government’s
Offender Rehabilitation Bill, still being considered by the other
place, which will result in mandatory supervision being
given to all offenders serving sentences of 12 months or less. The
impact assessment for that Bill estimates that 13,000 extra offenders
will be recalled or committed to custody each year, with an increase of
1,600 places in the prison population. I would be grateful if the
Minister clarified how the Ministry of Justice has calculated
that so few offenders will be affected by the combined impact
of this Bill and the Offender Rehabilitation

8 gives the Secretary of State the power to use the affirmative

10 and 11 introduce a new statutory offence of being unlawfully at
large following a recall to custody. This would be triable either way
and could result in a convicted offender being imprisoned for up to two
years. Once again, the Government seem to have omitted any safeguard
for vulnerable offenders with learning disabilities or mental health
problems that would impair their ability to understand the full terms
of their release. It would be beneficial if the Government
inserted such a safeguard ahead of the Bill’s later
stages. For example, it would be useful if the Bill made a distinction
between offenders who abscond wilfully and those who do not report as a
result of a misunderstanding or a miscommunication. According to
research conducted by the Prison Reform Trust in 2007, between 20% and
30% of offenders were estimated to have a learning
disability that affected their ability to cope with the complexities of
the criminal justice system and the co-operation expected of them.
During<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:25:13"></hs_TimeCode> debates
on the Offender Rehabilitation Bill in the other place, the Government
pledged to produce special versions of licence conditions for
individuals with learning difficulties. I would welcome the
Minister’s assurance that they intend to keep true to that
pledge, and indeed any other provisions that they will be making for
vulnerable offenders so that they can understand what actions are
strictly required of
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000063">My

criminalises the possession of pornographic materials depicting rape
and non-consensual sexual penetration. I truly applaud the
Government’s efforts in this regard to minimise the use and
dissemination of extreme pornographic materials, and particularly the
work they are doing to minimise the opportunities for children to come
into contact with this filth. In my view, however, there can be no
benefit to society or to the individuals involved if persons convicted
of sex offences are left languishing in prison without treatment or,
worse, released into the community 
<?notus-xml column=74?>without treatment. I welcome what the Government are doing, but ask them
to go one step further in ensuring that these perpetrators are dealt

the internet sex offender treatment programme is available for

offender treatment programmes which, conversely, are available in
custody, I understand that as of July 2012, 21 prisons offered these
programmes, despite the fact that offenders are serving time in
relation to sex offences in over 100 prisons. This means
that a person convicted of a sex offence has roughly only a one-in-six
chance of being able to access treatment that would address his or her
offending behaviour. I urge the Government to improve their provision
of treatment programmes for these offenders before incarcerating yet
more for similar offences.</hs_Para>

Board, despite no mention being made, at least as yet, of any extra
resources being allocated to deal with this increase. The proposals

wish to make a few remarks about the changes to youth custody
introduced in part 2. The proposal to introduce new secure colleges for
children aged 12 to 17, which would be implemented by the passing of
clauses 17 to 19, was first published in a recent consultation entitled
“Transforming Youth Custody”. I agree with the views
posited by the Howard League for Penal Reform and the Prison Reform
Trust that the introduction of secure colleges may result in an
increase in custodial sentencing for young offenders and longer
sentences being handed out. I am particularly concerned that clause 18
would allow for these secure colleges to be contracted out to private
companies, and that under the terms of schedule 4 those companies will

I wish to make a few remarks about the proposals in part 3, which would
impose court charges on defendants in criminal cases. Clauses 29 and 30
stipulate that, in setting charges, the Lord Chancellor should have
regard to a number of factors, including whether a defendant pleaded
guilty and thus whether they proceeded to trial. As Justice has pointed
out, the imposition of such a charge may perversely incentivise
defendants to plead guilty so as to avoid paying higher charges, and so
undermine the presumption of innocence. That is certainly not fanciful,
because defendants I have come across in my professional career were
more keen on finding out what the cost would be at the end of the day
than anything else. That may seem strange, but it is

is also possible that further charges will be brought against an
individual if he or she pursues an appeal, which would place another
barrier to fair and equal access to justice. As Justice points out,
restricting an individual’s access to a court or tribunal could
well be incompatible with article 6(1) of the European convention on
human rights. A thorough impact assessment should also be made of the

summary, the Bill introduces changes that will increase the already
stretched prison population and place undoubted further burdens on the
Parole Board. It is highly disappointing that instead of working to
encourage rehabilitation, the Government have chosen to introduce new
criminal offences and to curtail the

justice Bill as a vehicle for implementing
ill-considered changes to youth custody, but I

saying that there has been an increase in the number of poor quality
decisions by the Government and other public bodies? If the latter, the
Opposition would be conceding that that happened largely on their

makes sense to make a number of careful changes that will ensure that
the system operates as intended, which is not to provide a vehicle for

that he does not believe that there is a problem, but that view is not
shared on the Government Benches. In our view, the increase in the
extent of judicial review does not just impose a cost—which is a
serious matter in itself—but also means, dangerously, that
decisions by the courts are increasingly substituting for decisions
that should be made by Ministers, which was not the original purpose or

the advance of technology and the use of satellite tracking mean that a
huge and so far largely untapped potential exists to ensure greater
confidence in the criminal justice system and enable the safe and
secure monitoring of offenders. Whether that is for offenders who
receive some kind of curfew as part of their sentence, or whether the

are two particular lessons. The first is that we should question how
quickly the criminal justice system can embrace new technology. The
criminal justice system is very centralised, which does not always make
it easy to have local innovation in its operation, whether in relation
to how certain courts operate—I will come on to that—or
to this use of technology. As the Secretary of State knows, some very
impressive pilot schemes have been conducted by Hertfordshire police in
relation to satellite

is, however, a feeling that we have been slow, perhaps unnecessarily
slow, to ensure that such technology is made available to other police
forces or is used more widely. That is partly because of the
understandable caution that results from a determination to ensure that
technology is used properly and that public safety remains paramount,

innovation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000093">If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:46:31"></hs_TimeCode>
we want a greater use of such technology, we must move towards a system

innovation is encouraged. Through a more decentralised system, we have
such opportunities. For instance, police and crime commissioners, who

alternative is a custodial sentence or, if they are not to be released,
a continuing term in custody. Far from posing any kind of threat to
civil liberties, such technology presents a real opportunity to protect

welcome the changes that the Justice Secretary is proposing to

observers of the criminal justice system have long been concerned that
the growth of out-of-court disposals has led to problems. Her

for concern. I commend the Justice Secretary for acting on that and

the Member for Dartford (Gareth Johnson) mentioned, the use of
administrative disposals peaked in 2007, driven by the unwise target to
bring offences to justice. There was a famous case close to my
constituency in which a police officer found a corpse hanging from a
tree. In the pocket of the corpse was a penknife. The police officer
attempted to record the offence of possession of an offensive weapon.
It was very unlikely that the corpse would have used the knife in a
dangerous manner. That was due to the target culture that drove the
growth of administrative disposals. That culture has fallen away, but
the proportion of disposals that are out-of-court disposals is still
twice as high as it was a decade ago. That is not necessarily a bad
thing, but it is important that such disposals are used
appropriately<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:54:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000104"><Member ContinuationText="David T.

the Member for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly), who, when he was courts

under-utilised magistrates courts. There is no doubt that magistrates
have faced challenges owing to a reduction in business, which was
caused originally by the growth in administrative disposals and has
been partly caused by the reduction in the level of crime and by cases
being taken by professional district judges, rather than by traditional
magistrates courts. All those factors have led to the magistracy

suggestion that I want to make. I wonder whether there is a role for
the magistracy outside the formal setting of the courts in respect of
less controversial offences, so that we can retain the presence of
magistrates in communities. As we move towards the use of justice hubs

similar proposal was made last week in an interesting paper,
“Future Courts”, by the Policy Exchange think-tank. The
paper picked up on proposals that were made in a Government paper that
was published in 2012, “Swift and Sure Justice”, for
which I had responsibility. We were very drawn to the way in which the
criminal justice system had operated rapidly to deal with the offences
that were committed during the riots of the previous year, and we
started to question whether a leaner and more efficient justice system
could be developed. I urge the Government to consider the potential of
involving magistrates in a programme of neighbourhood justice. That
would ensure that they are retained in their local
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:59:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000111">Neighbourhood
justice panels are an interesting development in the area of
restorative justice. Many Members from all parts of the House believe
that they have great potential in dealing with low-level offending.

magistrates should play a formal role in neighbourhood justice panels
and that they should not be a separate tier of
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000112">The
magistracy is an institution that has been with us for six and
a half centuries, and as the late Lord Bingham said, it is a
“democratic jewel beyond price”. If we are moving towards
greater use of technology, the potential for justice to be delivered
remotely, and individuals not having to be in a formal court setting,
we have the opportunity to ensure that justice can be delivered
locally, without having to be delivered administratively. We can still
have confidence that somebody appointed from the community who
exercises a judicial—not 
<?notus-xml column=82?>administrative—function, is dealing with offenders. That is a
potential way to rebuild the magistracy and tackle the growth of
administrative justice and the excessive use of out-of-court disposals,
and a powerful way to rekindle the notion of neighbourhood justice. I
hope that the Government, who welcomed the Policy Exchange report as an
interesting contribution, will take that on
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022421000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0002.htm#14022421000113">In
conclusion, as with so many other areas of public policy, the urge to
centralise and rationalise into ever bigger units is great when it
comes to delivering greater value for money. We see that in policing
with those who urge us to create regional police forces, in health care
with those who urge us to create ever greater units with larger
hospitals and so on, and we face such pressures across our public
services. Such rationalisations need not be a bad thing if innovative
ways are found to deliver services at local level, and technology is an
enabler of that. What undermines confidence in the process, however, is
when a salami-slicing approach results merely in services being
centralised for cost reasons, without any rethinking or redesigning
of how they can be delivered at local level. Let us enable that
innovation, localise, have confidence in the new democratic
institutions we have created at local level that can hold the criminal
justice system to account, and—above all—let us value the
lay magistracy as an institution that has served this country so well
over a long
time.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/EC59D539B0D7F6C2E59519A8EF8C191AB2EAB859" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 February 2014">Monday

which concerns judicial review. The previous Labour Government were

go forward and make judicial review applications, sometimes for the
sheer hell of it. It is right that citizens should use this power

cases. If we were satisfied that decision making was robust and that
entry clearance officers and those who reviewed their decisions always
made the right decision, we would not need a right of appeal. As he
knows, however, having sat through the Committee’s
deliberations, 50% of appeals on immigration cases are won by the
applicant. That does not mean that 
<?notus-xml column=84?>judges are cleverer than entry clearance officers, but it does mean that
decisions have not been looked at carefully enough. If we take away
that right of appeal, all people will have is the ability to challenge

the previous Government suffered because they tried to stop citizens
marrying foreign citizens in our courts. They were taken to court and
judicially reviewed, and the court said, “You cannot do

done—lost a number of such applications. I think we should look
carefully at this issue. On its own it may not seem like a bad idea,
but if we take away the right of appeal in immigration cases, as

certain circumstances, but my understanding is that that Bill will
reduce dramatically the occasions on which the Government can be

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:12:22"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Arundel and South Downs, the former Home Office Minister.
When he was in the Home Office, he led the campaign for new technology.
He is a Twitter person. On one occasion, he tweeted to ask me to go to
the airport to meet him, as I had done with other members of the Select
Committee—I agreed to do so, but he would not tell me his flight
number—so I know that he likes new technology. The fact
is that we need to be careful about allowing Ministers and officials to
make decisions on new technology that they do not understand. He will
remember the e-Borders project, which has so far cost the taxpayer
£750 million. It was agreed without benchmarks and the
litigation is still going on—it is still costing the taxpayer
huge amounts of money.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:13:37"></hs_TimeCode> should have
new technology and we should pursue this programme, but we need to be
very careful and very cautious not to hand everything over to those who
come to us and say that they know everything. That is what happened
under the previous Government in relation to G4S and Serco, and that
has continued under this Government. As we now know, G4S overcharged
the Government by £24.1 million. We will need a more
extensive use of tagging, but if the tagging companies are not
monitored, the contracts will not be properly dealt with and properly
monitored. I hope that, in making better use of technology, we ensure
that we have the accountability that the right hon. Gentleman and I
have been talking about.</hs_Para>

custody since 2000, all occurred in youth offenders institutions and
secure training centres. We need to learn the lessons of the deaths of
those young people before we set up new institutions that are not
capable of proper scrutiny. The Bill will allow a secure
college custody officer to use reasonable force to ensure good order
and discipline. It is important that we look at training and do not
have any unfortunate incidents that result in the death or injury to
young people in custody.

simple police caution, along with the wider issue of out-of-court
disposals of which it is part. The Government’s consultation on
out-of-court disposals ended in January, and I should be interested to
know when they will respond to it. I think that the magistrates were
right to be concerned about the dangers of inconsistency around the
country, and about the fact that people did not really know what was
happening. However, I also think that there is real value in police
officers’ ability to exercise discretion in many circumstances,
and that out-of-court disposals, as a broad group, open up numerous
possibilities, including possibilities for simple restorative
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:23:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000034">Restorative
justice exists in many forms. Obviously it exists in post-sentence
form, but there are simple kinds of restorative justice which I have
experienced in my constituency. In the past, a police sergeant would
say to an offender “The best thing that you can do is go to the
person whose property you have damaged, give that person
money to pay for the damage that you have caused, apologise, and ask
whether there is any way in which you can help to make good what you
have done.” Such measures are worth developing as part of
neighbourhood justice.</hs_Para>

do not want the necessary codifying of the system of cautions to be
seen as in any way discouraging the use of alternatives to traditional
court procedures. As 
<?notus-xml column=88?>was suggested earlier, magistrates can be involved
in the process. The Justice Committee visited Stockport recently, and
observed that magistrates had been involved in a number of developments
in the Greater Manchester probation area. When I asked why they were
not hostile to those developments, the answer was that they had been
involved from the start. I do not want us in any way to undermine the
scope for out-of-traditional-court disposals in matters of this kind,

and to write a letter of apology, which they all did. At least one of
them was planning to go into the Army, and the sergeant pointed out

first problem, which was identified by my Committee, is that the

people going into custody do not do so neatly at the beginning of a
term or an academic year; they go when the courts have sentenced them.
It is difficult to provide a range of basic educational courses for
people who go into custody for relatively short periods and at
different times, and it involves paying a price.
Some of those people will be much further away from their local
communities than 
<?notus-xml column=89?>they would have been if they had been dealt with under the previous

third topic is judicial review. The Public Bill Committee will need to
look closely at the proposed change in the threshold for exclusion of
judicial review from it being “inevitable” to being
“highly likely” that the successful challenge would not
change the outcome. There could be a risk of the argument becoming
about the substance of the case, rather than about process. Judicial
review is supposed to be about process. It is not an appeal mechanism
in which the decision is considered by an alternative decision maker;
it is a review of the process that has been carried out. However, if an
argument had to take place about just how likely it was that the
success of the review would make no difference, that would involve
going quite deeply into the substance of the matter. The wording of
that proposal will therefore have to be looked at carefully.</hs_Para>

generally, judicial review is inconvenient for the Executive. It is a
nuisance, and the initials “JR” strike fear into the
hearts of Ministers and, even more, of the civil servants who are
always reminding Ministers about judicial review. However, it is a
discipline by which we ensure that proper process is followed. It would
be unsatisfactory to strip away that discipline completely and to say,
“It doesn’t matter if you get the process wrong, as long
as you make sure it’s not likely to affect the outcome.”
The wording of this proposal also needs to be looked at, as do some of
the cost attribution issues that have been raised today.</hs_Para>

is a problem when judicial review is used to try to delay a case
sufficiently for the window of opportunity for something to happen to
be closed, but such cases are few and far between. If we leave aside
immigration cases, the increased use of judicial review is nothing like
as big a problem as it was thought to be. The increase was identified
as being primarily a result of immigration cases. I hope that the Bill
Committee will look carefully at the wording of those measures. We must
recognise that we need to maintain the discipline and that, if the law
requires us to go through certain processes, we must go through them.
If we do not, we run the risk of bringing trouble into court.

aspects of the criminal justice system whose primary purposes will be
addressed only if we achieve further long-term reform. I see that
reform as involving primarily what my Committee has called justice
reinvestment—that is, taking resources away from the damaged end
of the system and putting them into the beginning, so that victims do
not become victims in the first place because crimes do not happen. We
must ensure that we direct the resources to the appropriate areas, just
as the Government have sought to do in the transforming families
programme, so that they prevent crimes from happening in the first
place. We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> need
to create a virtuous circle in which we do not need so many prison
places because fewer crimes are happening. We had an opportunity to do
that, and crime levels have been falling, but that opportunity has
unfortunately been compromised by the difficult financial situation in
which the Government have found themselves. That means that it has been
much harder to prime the pump, or to put in extra resources.</hs_Para>

brings us right back to the ultimate purpose of justice reinvestment,
which is to move resources. In order to do that properly, we need to
address a matter that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:35:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Hexham (Guy Opperman) mentioned earlier—that is, something
that the Select Committee calls local commissioning. In such a system,
the decisions about the resources needed to deal with crime are made by
all the agencies that have to handle crime at local level. Many of
those decisions are now made locally, which is a good thing, but one
crucial one is not: the decision on how much money is spent on prisons
and where that money is put. That is still very much a national
decision and it will remain so under the Government’s present
policy.</hs_Para>

Judicial review is not the only thing he attacks—he attacks
human rights. As a lawyer, I find it frustrating to listen to him when
he debates in this House because he seems not to understand the
relationship between the European convention on human rights and the
Human Rights Act 1998: he confuses the two. He is attacking the system.
He has attacked human rights, judicial review, legal aid and no

has been utterly corrosive, and even when people have been prosecuted
the sentencing procedures that have been put in place have been
difficult for lawyers, and impossible for non-lawyers, to understand.
The point has been well made that the idea of someone serving no more
than half a sentence is difficult for people to take on board, but when
somebody reappears after a few days or a few weeks the public simply
cannot comprehend it. A good start is linking the release of serious
offenders to the scrutiny of the Parole Board. It is an important link
and I am glad that it is being reintroduced. I say
“reintroduced” because it worked very well in the 1990s,
but since then we have had indeterminate sentences for public
protection, and judging by some of the comments today it is clear that
the party that introduced them still does not understand the problems
they caused.</hs_Para>

thousands of members and we only have the addresses wrong for half a

with at a preliminary hearing? If it is quite clear that there was no

with 95% of all criminal cases. Clause 50 creates a system for trial,
not for guilty plea, so the idea of guilty plea by post is not what the
clause is about. It creates a system for trial, the determination of
proceedings that are not admitted. These proceedings could involve
criminal damage, assault and public order. They are not matters that
will attract sentences of custody, but they could have implications
that affect people’s livelihoods. They could be determined
behind closed doors, and in a process that involves nobody who has any
legal qualification whatever. It could be a single lay magistrate in a
private room with papers provided by a police officer. I hope the

the Member for Dewsbury (Simon Reevell), who brings a great deal of
expertise in this area. He and the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull
East (Karl Turner) made a number of pertinent points about the
administrative proposals for judicial process that are introduced by
this Bill. They raised their concerns over the idea of single justices
dealing with some of these administrative processes. As someone who was
once a magistrates legal adviser and read out some of the mitigation
statements and dealt with some of the TV licence courts for hours on
end, I can say that having a single justice can be very effective. A
single justice is capable right now of making a bail decision on
someone charged with a very serious offence such as murder. A single
justice of the peace can decide on that. They can adjourn matters and
send them to the Crown court. I am not aware of that causing any
particular difficulties. The proposal that we have a single justice
looking at these measures is far less of a power than some of the
powers that they currently have. I hope that some of the fears that
have been raised today can be allayed with that
information.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000086"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:59:08"></hs_TimeCode>I
welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The Bill covers a
wide range of areas—I will concentrate on just a few of
them—because it has always been necessary for the criminal law
to keep up with society and evolve to meet the modern challenges and
changes in behaviour that we all see. The Bill will help to ensure that
that continues. For example, it will use developments in modern
technology to track offenders more accurately and therefore far more
reliably.</hs_Para>

must be a welcome development to ensure that offenders contribute more
to the cost of their cases when they are convicted of a criminal
offence. That just makes plain sense. We have always had a system of
cost payments on conviction, with the legal test that those cost awards
should be just and reasonable. These measures, however, take that
situation further by matching the total cost incurred by the taxpayer.
A crucial aspect of the Bill is the awarding of costs to be picked up
by the wrongdoer. In other words, the Bill will ensure that the
polluter pays and that the polluter pays for all his pollution. I have
long felt that we have had something of an anomaly in the system, where
the costs created by an offender and incurred by the victim can be
reimbursed, quite rightly, and the costs incurred by the prosecution
can also be reimbursed, quite rightly, but the costs incurred by the
court cannot. That places expense on the taxpayer that has been
incurred owing to the offender’s actions or inactions, yet
nothing has ever been done to tackle this anomaly. Therefore, I am
pleased that this situation will be
rectified<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:01:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000088">I
am also pleased that the Bill seeks to formalise the cautions system.
Cautions can be effective when used in appropriate cases, but they must
command public support. That support can be lacking if people feel that
offenders are receiving cautions for offences that are too serious or
for repeat offending. Clearly, if a first caution has not prevented
reoffending, there is little hope that a second caution will achieve
that objective. There will 
<?notus-xml column=97?>always be exceptional circumstances where they should apply, but the
Bill correctly recognises that situation. Generally, we should not
allow cautions to be given where the public would see that as a
betrayal of justice and basic fair
play<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:02:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Governments have sought to try to tackle reoffending rates. This
Government have sought to do so by assisting short-term prisoners.
Previous Government have tried to work out other ways to reduce
reoffending rates. To the credit of cautions, when they are given at
their best, they have the most successful rates of tacking reoffending.
Reoffending rates are lowest when cautions are given in appropriate
cases. The criminal justice system should ensure that they are given
only for minor, isolated
offending<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:03:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000090">The
same concerns that people have about cautions are also held about
penalty notices for disorder—or the so-called fixed penalty
notices—that are issued at the police station. If they are given
in inappropriate cases, people also rightly feel let down. It is
therefore essential that the issuing of PNDs is not used to get around
the intentions of the Bill. If it is inappropriate to give a
caution—for example, owing to the serious nature of the offence
that the police are dealing with—it should also be inappropriate
to give a fixed penalty notice, and that person should be put before a
court instead of being given a

have alluded to 2007 because that was the year when we saw the highest
number of not just PNDs but cautions given at a police station. I saw
back in that year that, in my constituency, repeat shoplifters were
given PNDs again and again, when that was clearly as inappropriate as
giving cautions again and again. If an out-of-court disposal has shown
itself to be ineffective, we need to have court

Bill effectively places into legislation the guidance that is already
given to the police on the issuing of cautions. It does not, however,
include the necessity to consult the victim wherever, as the current
guideline stipulates, appropriate and possible. I hope therefore that
the Minister will agree that the victim’s views will continue to
be an important factor when the police or the Director of Public
Prosecutions decides to offer a caution, so that the victim’s
views are canvassed before that caution is administered at the police

also welcome the moves to place education at the heart of the youth
offending process. Youth offender institutions have the ability to show
children and young adults in their establishments what can be achieved
through education. Giving young people the confidence that can come
with education is vital if we are to maximise the potential to reduce
reoffending. It gives young offenders the confidence that they very
often lack. These measures have been criticised, but secure colleges
simply make common sense. It must be right to educate young people when
they are in prison, to help to tackle the very high reoffending rates
that we are seeing among those inmates when they leave young offenders
institutions. The programme of secure colleges will take time to roll
out, but they can complement, not simply replace, the efforts that are

time since we have seen a criminal justice Bill taken through the 
<?notus-xml column=98?>House. The Bill will help to bring up to date some of the laws that were
falling behind and close the gaps that offenders have taken advantage
of, so I hope that it will be unopposed today and that it will go
through to the next stage of

want to make three simple points. With regard to secure colleges,
sometimes if we stand still long enough, things come round again. They
will smack very much of the old approved schools if we are not careful.
The proposed £85 million project seems to involve a 320-bed
institution. All the evidence in recent years has demonstrated that
tackling young offenders and rehabilitating youngsters to ensure that
they do not offend in the future is better done in smaller units,
rather than large ones. That is why we moved away from the old approved
schools, so that more intensive work could be done with young offenders
and young potential offenders in smaller units. The proposal flies in
the face of all that evidence and seems to take us back, rather than
forward. However, if the Government are to experiment in this way, it
is important that at least some provision remains in smaller units,
particularly for those young people who are vulnerable. We have had
briefings from the Children’s Rights Alliance and others, and
they have interpreted the Government’s commitment to maintain
small secure children’s homes as somewhat ambiguous. It would be
useful to hear from the Minister tonight about what the future is for
small secure children’s homes under the proposed new structure.
The vulnerable youngsters who are cared for in those units would be
lost within the bigger establishments proposed by the Government today.
There would be anxiety if we were to lose that element of specialism in
the system in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000097">The
second issue relates to the proposal for magistrates to sit alone when
taking decisions. I read the Magistrates Association briefing, and I
share some of its concerns that there is a need to ensure that justice
is seen to be done. Removing cases from the courts into a side room in
a police station or elsewhere with a magistrate sitting solely with a
clerk may not be as open and transparent as in the past. I would
welcome hearing the Government’s view on the magistrates’
recommendation about at least ensuring that lists of cases are
published. Perhaps that should be incorporated into the Bill, so that
we can give the assurance that openness and transparency will continue
for two reasons: first, it is important that people know that justice
is being done and that it is visible; and secondly, some people want to
know that the perpetrators have been prosecuted appropriately and have
received the appropriate sentences. Therefore, listing cases would at
least maintain an element of openness and transparency in the system. I
hope that the Government can take on board the Magistrates Association
recommendation and build it into the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000098"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:10:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:09:37"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>The
third issue, which I am anxious about, is judicial review. In my own
experience, judicial review has largely been used by an individual or
small organisation to 
<?notus-xml column=99?>challenge decisions by state bodies; in my own area, those have largely
been decisions made by local councils. At the moment, judicial review
is incredibly hard to undertake, largely because of the costs involved.
It takes about £10,000 to £15,000 just to get into
court in any form to have a judicial review heard,
which  is beyond the means of most
individual and many organisations, but at least there is the
opportunity to challenge a decision.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022429000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000099"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>In
my area, a judicial review took place recently when the local authority
closed down special needs centres, or undertook the exercise of closing
them down. That decision was challenged by the parents of the
centres’ clients. They won at judicial review, forcing the local
authority to reconsider its decision and to consult properly. That is
the appropriate mechanism for judicial review.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>The
Government’s current proposals will bear heavily on those
individuals or organisations that are challenging decisions by bodies
such as local councils.</hs_Para>

refer back to the debates that we had during the passage of the Local
Audit and Accountability Act 2014, when evidence was brought
forward by Transparency International about the problems with local
government decision making: its closed nature and the use of commercial
interests to drive decisions into part 2 of the cabinet decision-making
processes. In other words, it revealed the secretive nature of decision
making by some local authorities. Again, judicial review becomes the
last resort for many organisations and
individuals—certainly in my community—to try
to get some form of appropriate and reasonable decision
making, or at least some form of supervision of that
decision making by the courts themselves.</hs_Para>

fear that these proposals will restrict the opportunity of the most
vulnerable in our society to hold the powerful to account. I welcome
the Government’s reassurances that there will perhaps be an
opportunity to consider some amendments to the current proposals, which
would allow the current process to be maintained and
improved.</hs_Para>

Government have included a commitment to cost orders within
the process itself. I agree that we should try to ensure a limit on
costs overall. The problem is that the cost orders come too late in the
process, The decision-making process will be more at the permissive
stage, so a lot more work will be required of representatives before a
cost order can even be applied for, which would provide protection from
the heavy burden of costs during the process.</hs_Para>

would like the Government to look again at where the cost
orders can be implemented. Under the Government’s proposals,
just to get to the permissive stage an individual will either have to
fund a considerable amount of work or it will have to be done at risk
by an individual lawyer, before there is even a discussion about the
cost order and cost-sharing.</hs_Para>

is largely about individuals fighting institutions that are
well-resourced. Again, I will give an example from my own area. Many
times, individual councillors have been protected by the
council’s insurance against any legal action that is taken about
their own decision making. So the individual is at risk, but the
individual councillor or the council body is protected, bizarrely
using—most probably—part of that individual’s
council tax payment to enable that protection to be given.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:14:17"></hs_TimeCode> problem in
these proposals is that the cost burden, or the cost deterrent, will
fall more greatly on the individuals 
<?notus-xml column=100?>concerned. I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:14:16"></hs_TimeCode>
would welcome the Government considering, perhaps during the progress
of this Bill, a more effective way of ensuring that the cost burden is
limited—overall, of course, but also as it falls on the
individual concerned.</hs_Para>

issue of interveners was referred to earlier. Every time I have been
involved in a judicial review process in my area, interveners have
played an invaluable role in bringing their expertise to the table and
to the discussions within court itself. I would be wary of restricting
the ability of specialist organisations to intervene in a particular
case. I could give example after example of what is happening with my
own local authority not only of individual housing cases but of
individual health cases, where interveners have helped by bringing
their health expertise to a case, because it then merits a wider debate
about a particular aspect of that case that has a wider public
interest.</hs_Para>

am glad that the environmental issues have been separated from this
process—largely as a result of European conventions, I
see—because in my own area judicial review has been
one of the mechanisms by which we have at least been able to seek to
protect ourselves against adverse planning decisions that have had an
environmental impact on my community. That may well be an issue that we
will want to come back to when we debate the proposals for a third
runway at Heathrow, because we will be looking for a judicial review of
the Government’s decisions at every possible opportunity if they
wish to proceed with those proposals. Therefore, it is good that
environmental matters are excluded from the heavy burden of costs, as
far as I can see.</hs_Para>

will never be appropriate for cases such as shoplifting, because
magistrates have very different ideas about what should happen to
offenders, particularly persistent offenders, in those types of cases.
I hope that the power will not be extended. I sometimes worry that when
a power is granted, it will be the thin end of the wedge and the power
will be rapidly extended to other areas. I hope that will not be the

fine; a victim surcharge; compensation; prosecution costs; and now this
extra courts charge. The victim surcharge, which is basically a tax on
offenders, has been a rather unhelpful development, particularly when
it applies to people who are being sent to prison for long periods of
time. When it was first introduced, for most offences, it was levied in
cases where there was no victim. It seems bizarre that the victim
surcharge was paid by offenders solely in cases where there was no
victim. If the courts charge replaced the victim surcharge, that might
make more sense. I certainly agree with the principle of making
offenders pay; I just have reservations about how these things tend to

sentiment behind the changes to release on licence. I am pleased to see
any proposals that mean that more of the sentence given by the court is
served by offenders. In fact, I have long argued that the sentence
given by the court should be served in full by offenders, and that
people should not be released early for good behaviour—they
should be kept in longer for bad behaviour. At the very least,
offenders should not be released automatically halfway through their
sentence. That was an absolute scandal that was introduced by the
previous Government. I would like to see the Bill go further to rectify
that, but I appreciate the point made by the Secretary of State that
even though he cannot rectify it in full, he wants to make a start in

that many people went out and voted Conservative at the last general
election on the basis that we would restore that honesty to sentencing.
The provision is a small step in that direction, but a welcome one. I

do not make such things possible, but I am bound to say that this does
not go far enough.</hs_Para>

compulsory electronic monitoring. I am a big fan of electronic
monitoring, particularly monitoring that uses tracking technology,

crime and as a means of convicting and punishing those who reoffend
while on licence. Similarly, I welcome the changes to the recall of
prisoners released on licence, but with some reservations, as the
changes do not go nearly far enough. The fixed-term recall, in which
the offender is returned to prison for breaching their licence for just
28 days—not, as most people would expect, the rest of the period
of their original sentence—is a very bad law. It not only means
that offenders are released early but that they are released extremely
early again if they fail to abide by their licence conditions both the
first time round and if they reoffend. That is outrageous, and the
Government need to clamp down on it.</hs_Para>

would not have to deal with the issue of release after the recall of a
life prisoner if we did not release life prisoners in first place. The
issue of prisoners absconding or not returning to custody is something
I have been concerned about for a while. As I mentioned earlier,
anything that increases sentencing or toughens up the current position
is something I shall happily support. The new offence created by the
Bill and the increased penalties for the existing offence are changes

mentioned by the hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull East (Karl Turner),
and I agree with him. For some time, I have highlighted, along with
him, the use of cautions for very serious offences. I am pleased that
the Bill seeks to address the issue. It is worth repeating that a
caution is given only when an individual accepts responsibility for the
crime—they admit that they are guilty—so their use for
serious indictable offences has naturally concerned me and many others.
I welcome the curbing of the use of repeat cautions, which has always
seemed bizarre to me. A person is given a warning for doing something,
they do it again, and instead of being sent to court to face the music,
some people are given yet another warning, and yet another warning, and
even another warning after that. As my right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State has said, recent Ministry of Justice figures apparently showed
that 62,000 offenders given a caution in the 12 months to March 2013
had already received a caution previously. The figures also showed that
8,800 criminals who were handed a caution last year had accepted at
least one caution for the same offence previously. Perhaps more
staggering is the fact that an offender in Northumbria had been given
cautions on 50 occasions, and over 50% of persistent offenders do not
receive immediate custody. This is an absolute scandal and makes a
mockery of the criminal justice system, so I welcome these

need to have confidence in the judicial system, and in the case of an
unduly lenient sentence, if the deadline is missed simply because the
victim was not made aware of it in time and so did not ask for it to be

extremely lengthy extension of time. I pay tribute to Jean Taylor and

the collection of this information should be, but it should be quite
clear to many that there should be consequences for a judge who
consistently allows offenders to avoid prison, if those offenders go on
to make others suffer as a result of their continuing crime sprees. At

the figures on overall recorded crime over the past few years have been
encouraging, it is clear to me and to many of my constituents that the
deterrent for a number of crimes still needs to be increased so that
the courts can be tougher in a variety of cases. As a result of
high-profile cases in the media, as well as the terrorist threat facing
London and other parts of the UK, there seems to be a perception that
crime is increasing, despite what the statistics show. Members of the
public need to be reassured that the courts system is keeping pace with
the challenges it faces, and I believe that the many sensible measures
in the Bill go some way towards achieving
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000153">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:42:06"></hs_TimeCode>

also very much welcome the introduction of life sentences for
terror-related offences, including training and manufacturing weapons
for terrorist activity. Although very serious in themselves, those
offences are also a factor in the wider problem of radicalisation of
young British citizens, which threatens the peaceful future of some of
our communities. That dangerous manipulation of vulnerable young minds
must be addressed with the toughest of sanctions.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:42:51"></hs_TimeCode> case of Abu
Hamza, a long-standing resident in my constituency, aroused
considerable concern that the law as it stood was ineffective in

is vital that those fears are addressed. I believe that the widening of
the enhanced dangerous offenders sentencing scheme will help achieve
that. The sanction 
<?notus-xml column=108?>of a life sentence must be available to the courts when dealing with
those convicted of terrorist offences. I understand that mandatory life
sentences for those convicted of a second terrorist offence and the end
of automatic parole for terrorism offences would affect as many as 30
people a year.</hs_Para>

issues of sentencing for certain serious crimes and the use of cautions
are well covered in the proposed legislation. For too long criminals
have operated in the knowledge that custodial sentences are often half
what the term suggests, in many cases automatically so. I am pleased
that under the proposed changes those guilty of terror offences and
certain sexual offences will no longer be automatically up for parole.
It is quite right that no one serving an extended determinate sentence
should be released without going before a parole
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000157">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:44:07"></hs_TimeCode>
use of police cautions for repeat offenders has resulted in serial
offenders regularly escaping jail sentences and has left many of my
constituents asking whether the law of the land has any serious role to
play in certain crimes. Figures published by the Centre for Crime
Prevention last year show that over a five-year period the number of
offenders with at least 10 or more previous cautions and subsequent
convictions rose by a quarter to 140,000, which suggests that cautions
offer very little deterrent, especially to the hardened repeat
offender. I am also caused to wonder how much police time and resource
is wasted in having to issue cautions time after time to the same
people. Given that cautions are intended to represent a warning for
relatively minor offences, it is appropriate that they will no longer
be used in cases such as rape, possession of an offensive weapon, or
sexual offences against children. In fact, it seems extraordinary that
such crimes could ever be treated so
leniently<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:45:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000158">While
welcoming the tougher sentences, I also support the idea that some
straightforward criminal justice processes need to be streamlined. It
is hard to see why a bench of three magistrates is needed to make
decisions on charges such as evasion of a television licence or road
tax. While not trivialising such offences, the focus of
magistrates’ expertise must surely be on more contentious
issues. The imposition of financial charges on those convicted in the
criminal courts will not only relieve the burden on the
taxpayer but provide an additional deterrent. I welcome the sense of
fairness that such a charge would engender, which is important for the
justice system. The Government must continue to be on the side of those
who stick to the

support the proposed legislation to deal with juror conduct in the
internet age. While there may be an absence of malicious intent, jurors
need to be very clear that researching cases in which they are involved

accusations of inconsistency, and the courts need a clear message.

However, that deal requires trust, and any breakdown in that trust has
serious consequences, as a great previous Conservative Home Secretary,
now Lord Howard, well understood.
At<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:49:30"></hs_TimeCode> this point, I
should add that I am truly delighted that our Court of Appeal 
<?notus-xml column=109?>has rejected attempts by the European Court of Human Rights to prohibit

Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan), back in his place. With respect, his
was very much a speech of two parts. When I listened to the first part,
I thought, “Well, he clearly wants to stand for Mayor of London
because he is doing a south London knockabout comic turn.” I was
glad that he turned serious in the second part, although I do not agree
with all of his analysis. I gently say this to him: keep the day job
going because potential Mayors of London are now expected to be various
turns, comic or otherwise, from north of the river rather than south.
Leaving aside our political disagreement, I say with respect that the
one thing that did trouble me—I hope it was perhaps a slip of
the tongue—was his saying, as it certainly appeared to a number
of Government Members, that judicial review should be capable of

Friend the Secretary of State on introducing it.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:49:35"></hs_TimeCode> will not touch
on all parts of the Bill, but I want to discuss some areas that remind
me of my past life—although that may be a dangerous thing to
talk about at too much length in this House—and
professional experience, namely the 25 years or more that I spent at
the criminal Bar. I am delighted with some of the changes to make
sentencing more realistic. I do not take the view that sentencing must
always be draconian and that all those convicted in the courts are
beyond a degree of redemption. That is clearly not the case. It is
important, however, that sentencing has the confidence 
<?notus-xml column=110?>of the public, the victims and the majority
law-abiding community. It is also worth remembering that sometimes the
families of offenders are themselves victims to a degree. It is very
important to have confidence in sentencing, so the greater transparency
proposed by the Bill with regard to the amount of time served and the
consequences of bad behaviour is a valuable step
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:50:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000167">The
same applies to the use of cautions. I have sympathy with the point
made by my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:50:53"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Shipley (Philip Davies) and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:51:02"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull East (Karl Turner), who is another former
practising barrister and to whom I apologise because I was not present
to hear his speech. It degrades the value of cautions to use them for
serious offences for which any ordinary, right-thinking member of the
public—in other words, to use the famous lawyer’s test,
any man or woman on the Clapham omnibus—will conclude that they
were never intended to be used. Cautions were intended to be used for
trivial matters, so using them for more serious offences degrades their
value in those areas where they have a legitimate role. I hope there
will be no suggestion that there has been any pressure in terms of
targets or
resources<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:51:40"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government have taken a step in the right

logical step on from that is recognising the importance of making best
use, at all levels, of the available judicial resources. Just as it is
important to use such resources to prosecute really serious crimes
before the court, rather than use cautions, it is entirely sensible for
the Bill to free up resources to deal with what are not regulatory, but
essentially non-contentious—in so far as anything can be in the
criminal justice system—matters. Many of us with experience of
the criminal Bar will have been instructed as young, junior advocates
on behalf of the prosecution—no doubt happily for us and our
fortunately moderate bank balances—to read through and prove a
whole list of traffic offences, even in instances of non-appearance.
The empty courtroom could have been used for other cases, but time and
again we would read out section 9 statements and produce various
certificates of conviction that the traffic lights were working
properly and heaven knows what, just to prove a case that nobody was
arguing about. Removing that anomaly is an important, valuable and
major step
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:53:21"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
not repeat the point that there are sensible safeguards built into the
system for those who want to argue their

way of digression, once upon a time there was—I think there
still is—an offence of failing to provide a statutory statement
of ownership. In those days, my earnings at the Bar were greatly
boosted by being standing counsel to Croydon council and invariably
turning up to prosecute such matters without anyone turning up to
contest them. That is an extreme example, because sometimes cases got
appealed and nobody turned up at the Crown court to prosecute the
appeal either. Removing that sort of nonsense from the system has to be
in everybody’s
interest.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000170">Ensuring<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:54:41"></hs_TimeCode>
that there is an open and publicly accessible record of the system is
sensible, because it means that we need not clog up a fully equipped
courtroom with witness facilities and other valuable resources that
could be used for a contested hearing. It could be done in an anteroom

entirely sensible and proportionate response, for which the Government
are to be commended.</hs_Para>

am pleased about the arrangements for costs. I was very often
instructed to apply for costs against a convicted defendant. That was
fine as far as it went—effectively, only the prosecution costs
could be awarded, and whatever legal aid contribution was
made—but it is legitimate to go further. After all, we are
talking about only those who have been convicted. It is currently
regarded as a legitimate and proper means of sentencing to give a
discount for a guilty plea to reflect, first, remorse; secondly, the
potential avoidance of trauma for witnesses; and thirdly, the saving to
court time. Those are all legitimate factors, and if we regard the
saving of court time as a legitimate factor in the equation for a
penalty in the broadest sense, it is not unreasonable to calculate
costs more realistically in terms of the totality of court time, rather
than just of prosecution costs or an amount towards legal aid. The very
sensible change will add to the transparency of the
arrangements being put in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000173">The

Friend the Member for Shipley is that there is a difference between the

relation to the judiciary—I suspect that such matters could be

Appeal, as they perhaps did before they retired, while sparing them the
burden of presiding over their home courts as resident judges. That
might be a very modest first step in maintaining a degree of judicial
independence, particularly in the criminal system, because by no means
all High Court judges will have the degree of experience of criminal
cases at first instance and of regularly sentencing heavy crime that
those recently retired circuit judges have. I commend that thought to
the Minister as a means of building on the welcome proposals about

proposed to abolish judicial review, but, equally, it must be
approached with a degree of proportion. One difficulty has been a lack
of balance and proportion in its use. That is a shame, because there is
a risk that a valuable tool, which can be a safeguard for individuals,

the Member for Huntingdon (Mr Djanogly), who talked about being a young
Bar student in the ’80s and learning about administrative law.
When I did my law exams in the 1970s, judicial review was a very recent
concept. It was coming back into existence, thanks largely to Lord
Denning. Nowadays, we do not consider him to have been a judge with the
most liberal of sentiments, but he was seen as rather radical in those
days.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000177">Until<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:01:30"></hs_TimeCode>
the late ’60s and early ’70s, there was virtually no
administrative law in this country. It is therefore slightly
over-egging the case for judicial review to say, as even some
distinguished judges do, that it has been an inherent part of our
system since Magna Carta. That is not correct. It has grown up from a
root that was in the common law. Through the various prerogative
orders, such as mandamus and certiorari, it was constructed by judges
into a judicial tool as society and government action became more
complex in the ’50s and ’60s. It is a fairly
recent feature of our system and it fulfils a valuable
role.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000178">Judicial

fashion. If the system needed to be flexible at that time, it is
equally reasonable to say now, when the industry that has grown up
around judicial review has become so oppressive that it has

of the proposals are sensible and straightforward. I do not think that
anyone disputes that it is sensible to have the same time limit for a

limit, because anybody who has dealt with planning matters knows that,
particularly now that there has to be so much pre-application

are issues with clause 50, although I do not share the criticism of it.
I approach it from a slightly different angle. It seems to me that it
is not unreasonable to move from the current inevitability test to a
test of whether the outcome is likely to have been affected.
Ironically, the current inevitability test seems to import something
rather like the criminal burden of proof of reasonable doubt—or
perhaps an even greater burden 
<?notus-xml column=113?>of proof—into what is essentially a civil
procedure. It is not unreasonable to move to
something that is closer to the normal test in civil proceedings of the
balance of

is argued that we must act almost punitively to be a constraint on bad
decision makers. However, I would have thought that clause 50 contained
enough flexibility to provide a more balanced approach, to prevent
judicial review from falling into disrepute when somebody wins on a
purely technical error by a decision maker that was under no
circumstances taken in malice or made negligently, and that would under
no circumstances make any difference to the outcome. It is not
unreasonable to say that the costs of a judicial review should not be
fully provided in those
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:04:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022429000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0003.htm#14022429000183">We
generally expect much more transparency in decision making in this
country. In relation to clause 51, I think that that ought to apply, to
a degree, to judicial decision making and to the judicial process
generally. Because more and more judicial reviews are, in reality,
supported and funded by groups—sometimes lobby groups, sometimes
commercial groups that may have an interest—it is legitimate for
the taxpayer and law-abiding citizens to have an idea about the source
of that funding and, to some degree, the real motive behind the
judicial review. Clause 51 is a proportionate means for dealing with
that. Similarly, interveners must be aware that a considerably greater
cost will occur through a legitimate intervention, especially
when—as we have all seen in some cases—the intervener may
become the principal driver of the judicial review, and do much more to
extend the length of the hearing than the initial parties. Under those
circumstances, it is not unreasonable that they should bear the bulk of
the risk, since they have driven the bulk of court time as a
consequence of the way they pursued their intervention. I would argue
that the Bill contains a balanced package on judicial review that
should commend itself to the House.</hs_Para>

dwell on what might have been in the Bill as I think what it contains
is good and valuable. I am, however, a little tempted by the comments
of my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley on the accountability of
judges. I do not think the Bill is necessarily the right vehicle for
that, but we are talking generally about improving the accountability
of decision making, and about accountability and transparency within
the system. Given that judicial decisions—in judicial review or
otherwise —sometimes affect not only large bodies or the state

professionalism in the judiciary are adequate.</hs_Para>

strong case for saying that Parliament must be wary of trespassing on
the independence of the judiciary. However, I had in my casework a
constituent who was seriously aggrieved in the national press because
of an inaccurate judgment. In the obiter dicta of the case, the judge
quoted wrongly from the papers before him, but released the judgment to
the press, with considerable adverse publicity for the person
concerned. There is, therefore, an argument for saying that when the
Office for Judicial Complaints says, “Unfortunately that is not
within our powers because he turned up and he wasn’t drunk and
he wasn’t abusive in these terms. There is nothing we can do
about this”, we might think that is not really fair. Would we
not expect a professional judge to get the facts right and to have read
the papers properly? That is an interesting area to consider.</hs_Para>

brings me to my final point, which is that, ultimately, the court
system is about transparency and balance. Sometimes balance shifts one
way or another, and it is the job of this House, and Parliament as a
legislature, to decide on the appropriate balance in the circumstances
in which we find it. I agree with the Secretary of State that the
balance has moved too far one way, and the Bill seeks to redress that.
I therefore commend it to the

Speaker, for calling me in this important debate. For far too many
years we have had a tradition of Governments—Conservative and
Labour—trying to talk tough on crime and repeatedly
aiming for the tabloid commentary, rather than dealing with the
underlying causes of crime. That is why I am pleased that we are taking
a different approach now, ensuring that we work on rehabilitation and
reducing reoffending and initial offending, and tackling the causes of
crime together with other Departments. That is an important process and

good and functioning society is low prison numbers and low crime, not
how many people we can fit into prison. In 1980, the prison population
was 44,000. The then Home Secretary, Willie Whitelaw, described that as
“dangerously high”, yet we saw numbers continue to rise
year after year, helped of course by the previous Government’s
3,600 new criminal offences. We saw a huge 54% increase in the prison
population under the previous Government, who wanted to increase
capacity to 96,000—almost two and a half times the number
described by Willie Whitelaw as “dangerously high”. That
is deeply alarming.</hs_Para>

have serious concerns about other parts of the Bill. As they stand, the
plans for secure colleges may prove damaging to thousands of young
offenders in our criminal justice system. The Bill leaves a question
mark over the future of secure children’s homes, which cater for
the most vulnerable young people. Such homes typically house small
numbers of children, provide intensive support and are staffed by
highly qualified specialists in social care. The homes have good
educational outcomes and are recognised as the preferred model of youth
custody, but they look set to lose out to the Lord Chancellor’s
new and untested pet project. It is untested according to the
Government’s own impact assessment, but still £85 million
is needed to build just one secure college.</hs_Para>

Why will college custody officers be empowered to use

regards part 3 of the Bill, we support the use of single justices,
given that their jurisdiction will apply only to summary,
non-imprisonable offences where an adult defendant pleads guilty.
However, we object strongly to taking these cases out of the courtroom

principle of British justice that cases are heard and the results made
known in public. This Government are too fond of secret courts, and
even in minor cases the principle of open justice should be rarely
departed from. We agree in principle that convicted criminals could
contribute to the costs of trial, but the substantial amount of
uncollected fines from criminals already totals more than £1
billion and it is likely that this proposal will just add to the total
of uncollected moneys from criminals. We have no objection in principle
to leapfrog appeals, for example, on issues of national importance,
though they are most likely to be used by government trying to hurry
the process up. The danger is that this simply overloads the Supreme
Court and that the issues it has to deal with are insufficiently
refined by earlier hearings.</hs_Para>

proposed offers the same level of public protection. The
Government’s own impact assessment states that the sentencing
changes will require 1,050 additional prison places, but there are
fewer than half that currently available. It also states that the costs
of additional custody are not quantified. We noted with concern the
Lord Chancellor’s inability to answer any of the questions about
his Department’s budgets. Proposals in part 1 will also see a
greater work load for the Parole Board, with an additional 1,100 Parole
Board hearings a year, according to the Government’s impact
assessment. However, no additional resources are being made available,

of force, and that issue was also raised by a number of hon. Members on
both sides of the House. I will just point out that the Bill sets up
secure colleges but it does not speak of using force. That issue needs
to be addressed later, when it comes to dealing with the rules for
secure colleges. I recognise that it is an important issue, which needs
to be dealt with sensitively, and I am sure that when those rules are
drawn up, that is how it will be dealt with.</hs_Para>

by left-wing campaign groups, but it is a fact that some claims have
been or are made by such groups. The hon. Lady herself admitted, in one

hon. Friend mentioned the magistrates courts; I assure him that
our intention is to ensure that the proposals are confined to low-level
offences. He also asked an important question: why can the maximum age
of jurors be raised from 70 to 75, when a similar age increase is not
allowed for magistrates and judges? One of the reasons is that jurors
will work on one trial, and then return to their daily, routine lives,
whereas magistrates 
<?notus-xml column=125?>and judges have to play their role day in, day out,
and of course that is completely different from jurors sitting on odd
cases.</hs_Para>

Friend will be aware that there are transitional arrangements in place.
When the rule about the age of 70 came in for the judiciary, those
judges who were still in place could opt to work until they were 75. He
also spoke of judges being held to account. All I would say to that is
that we have to be mindful that the judiciary is an independent section
of our constitution.</hs_Para>

wants young children to reoffend. He is absolutely correct when he says
that we have to give them education, and the skills and discipline to
ensure that they can lead productive lives. Like others, he referred to

Sarah Wollaston</B> (Totnes) (Con):</Member> I am proud to represent a
constituency that extends from the hill farms of Dartmoor to the coast,
encompassing some of the loveliest areas of outstanding natural beauty.
I am proud, too, to say that we are very much open for
business, despite the recent battering from the storms.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022436000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0004.htm#14022436000122">I am
fortunate to have lived and worked in rural Dartmoor for 21 years. I
have no conflict of interest in this debate, but I have real concerns
about the unintended consequences if we proceed with permitted
development rights without the need for planning permission to convert
up to three dwellings or to replace existing farm buildings across
rural Dartmoor and areas of outstanding natural beauty. I commend the
Minister for his comments and entirely agree about the need to address
the inter- generational unfairness that exists within housing. We
should allow people to aspire to affordable housing. I absolutely agree
that we need to build more homes, but we need to build homes that
people can afford to live in. That is my concern.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022436000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0004.htm#14022436000123">Permitted
development rights would allow buildings of up to 150 square
metres—nearly twice the guideline amount for affordable
housing—so we will see development of larger properties. Within
AONBs and the national parks—the measure will affect all 10
national parks—I fear that that will lead to the creation of
more second homes and luxury homes, rather than the affordable housing
that we need to breathe life into our rural communities. I hope that
the Minister will also look at the unintended consequences. As he will
know, one of the chief ways to lever in exception sites is deployed
when landowners know that there is no other mechanism to obtain
planning permission. That is a genuine concern, and we have already
seen a chilling effect on land prices and the availability of
affordable land for development.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022436000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0004.htm#14022436000124">There is a
further concern. The historic farmstead survey of Dartmoor looks at
pre-1914 farmsteads, of which there are 1,100 across Dartmoor. Each of
those has three to four outbuildings. Clearly, not all of those would
be suitable for development, but it is estimated that around 2,000
would be suitable for conversion, and that is within Dartmoor alone.
That does not include the 1,500 to 2,000 properties that are
non-heritage buildings. So we are potentially looking at up to 4,000
properties, each of which could be converted to three dwellings. On top
of that is all the accompanying infrastructure in terms of driveways
and parking.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022436000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0004.htm#14022436000125">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:55:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>
is a real concern in our national parks about the impact that such
development could have on our landscapes, but even more important is
what will happen when we lose 4,000 farm buildings from the moor. If
there are 4,000 fewer farm buildings, there is less agriculture on the
moor. Having lived for two decades on Dartmoor, I have seen the changes
that there have been to grazing. If cattle and sheep are lost from
moorland, there is a degradation from heather towards gorse. It is
important that we keep farming on the moor. In lower lying areas, we
are already seeing more pony paddocks and we are losing the unique
environment that is part of the reason 
<?notus-xml column=130?>why tourists come to Dartmoor in the first place. The landscape that we
see across the moor is critical to our

Herbert</B> (Arundel and South Downs) (Con):</Member> As the name of my

creating national parks that protection of the landscape should have
primacy wherever there is a conflict with economic development? We are
at risk of losing that if we allow the creation of a suburbia within
the national parks and inappropriate development, new haciendas and gin

Wollaston:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. We do not
want to kill the goose that lays the golden egg—the very reason
why people come to Dartmoor. The creation of the national parks was
described as the people’s charter for fresh air. These are
crucially important landscapes for us to protect. Overdevelopment would
destroy that. This is not about saying that we should stop all
development within national parks. All of us recognise the need to
support hill farmers. They may be asset rich but they survive on very

have been over-negative in the past in not allowing reasonable and

Wollaston:</Member></B> I entirely agree. A lot of this is about
streamlining the processes. But I know that the national parks want to
support affordable housing. Within the national park the average house
price is in excess of £270,000. That is nine times the median

Wollaston:</Member></B> My hon. Friend adds to the point that we are
not asking to see no development across our national parks, but rather
for them to have discretion on a case-by-case basis. Absolutely, they
must support farmers. We want farmers to have the ability to diversify,
but we do not want a wholesale shift towards development, with farmers
losing agriculture and moving entirely towards running holiday
businesses and letting properties. It is a matter of degree. Yes, I
would like to join him in encouraging national parks to support
development, but to do so in a sustainable way that recognises the
importance of keeping agriculture and sustaining our 
<?notus-xml column=131?>most precious and fragile ecosystems across the country for all our
national parks. That applies not only to national parks, but to areas

saying that there should be no development; it is about allowing
controlled development on a case-by-case basis, rather than having an
automatic permitted development right, which I think could lead to
something altogether different and entirely unintended by the
Minister.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022436000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0004.htm#14022436000139"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T22:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>Councillor
Elizabeth Bennett, a parish councillor in South Pool, has made an
important point about the effect on localism, which I know the Minister
feels very passionate about. He has made the point that localism does
not mean that we should see no development at all, because communities
have to take responsibility for supplying housing for local people. It
is about deciding where and how that takes place. The current
arrangements deny parish councils the ability to comment on planning
proposals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022436000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/debtext/140224-0004.htm#14022436000140"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T22:02:48"></hs_TimeCode>Councillor
Elizabeth Bennett also raised the concern about communities such as
South Pool never being able to attain access to exception sites because
they are not on a bus route and do not have the amenities of a village
school. Nevertheless, those communities are desperately short of
housing for local people. In fact, South Pool 
<?notus-xml column=132?>has some of the highest property values in the country. The ratios
between earnings and property value are in excess
of 10, so any access to local housing is entirely beyond the means of
local people. Will the Minister look at extending that access so that
projects such as the wonderful village housing initiative can be
encouraged to bring in more exception sites within areas of outstanding
natural beauty.</hs_Para>

is not about asking for no development; it is about asking for the
right development, and for homes that people actually live in. I would
not wish the Minister to think that I am saying that all second homes
are bad. As he knows, many second home owners become permanent
residents within a few years. They bring in a huge amount of income to
local communities, particularly when they let out their properties when
they are not using them. However, it is a matter of degree and scale,
and he will know that there are many parts of our AONBs and national
parks where the balance has shifted too far in the direction of second
home owners. That can lead to dormitory communities where the lights
are hardly ever on, except in season and at the

entirely legitimate to ask whether it would be appropriate to extend
that right to national parks and areas of outstanding natural
beauty—or, in the planning jargon, section 15 land. We have
undertaken a genuine consultation on the issue; it is not an issue on
which the Government had a firm view and were just pretending to

directly within my ministerial brief, but it is a serious point. I
simply venture to suggest that in relation to keeping old barns as old
barns—if they are not currently used in modern
agriculture—it would be relatively rare that a new farmer could
start up a business from one of those buildings in a way that they
could not do elsewhere. My hon. Friend’s concern is absolutely
valid, and I would be very happy to talk to Ministers in the

excellent community land trust projects, not in her constituency but in
other parts of my home county of Devon, where I was born and grew up.
It is important that we support great projects such as those and
make it easier for them to persuade landowners to provide land
for affordable housing development, perhaps in exchange for the right
to undertake more profitable development. I am happy to look at

guidance, may I caution him against using the guidance to give national
park authorities a nudge in the direction of saying that buildings
should be converted, as he suggested? We should allow national park
authorities to exercise their judgment on these matters and allow the
Sandford principle to apply. That principle states quite clearly that,
in the event of a conflict, conservation trumps economic development.
These are often sensitive matters. In my constituency, a beautiful old
barn is being considered for development. The national park authority
is weighing that up carefully. A push in one direction would not be

set

concerns about unintended consequences, but he is unnecessarily worried
about that particular point. I did not say that the guidance should
tell national park authorities that they should approve applications; I
said that they should view applications in a positive manner. He knows
how guidance works. It does not require anybody to do anything; it
simply says, “You should take this into account as a material
consideration in your decision making.” Nothing in guidance can
undermine the much more important established legal duties that are
unique to national parks. This is simply a question of

others. All we are saying is that before they immediately say no
because they think that the best way to preserve the beauty of their
national park is for a particular building to stay exactly as it is,
unused by modern agriculture, we would like them to think creatively
about whether it could be used in a more positive way. I do not think

may sometimes be a situation where conservation has to trump economic

in various settings—including a Westminster Hall debate that was
almost equally lively—but I have not yet been persuaded by his
argument. What is the point of a national park if conservation is not
the prime duty? On the other hand, I do not think that that duty always
trumps other arguments. Of course there are other responsibilities, and
every national park authority that I have spoken to takes those other
responsibilities seriously. It is reasonable, however, that in national
parks a greater weight is placed on that fundamental duty to conserve
the landscape than is true in the rest of the English

important point made by my hon. Friend the Member for High Peak (Andrew
Bingham). The Minister is expressing eloquently the need for balance in
this discussion, and it is also important to achieve balance across the
different needs and characters of different national parks. In some,
buildings are often very isolated—in the peaks, for
example—but not so isolated elsewhere. Building and constructing

why it might well be appropriate for national parks to retain the
ability to decide on a case-by-case basis whether such development is
possible. I hope that I have explained that the intention behind the
proposed permitted developed right is to bring forward more housing on
land that is already developed, and to make maximum use of the

is interesting that the tensions that have arisen beyond the initial
problem of high prices during the holidays are the result of the new
regulations, passed in statutory instrument 2013 No. 756. For those
interested in procedural issues, as I am, I should say that the
regulations went through Parliament under a negative
resolution—that is, they would pass as long as Parliament did
not vote against them. Parliament would have had an opportunity to
discuss the regulations had anyone tabled an early-day motion praying
against them, but no one did. There was no
discussion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402247000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#1402247000022">The
regulations were laid before Parliament on 4 April 2013.
There was no request to debate them on the Floor of the House of Lords
either. That House differs from the House of Commons in that it has a
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee, which looked at the
regulations and decided not to comment on them. However, we have heard
from our constituents that there are considerable problems across the
country. That shows the strength of the e-petitioning process.
Something went through Parliament on the nod, but constituents had a
mechanism to express concerns. The issue has been raised and
now everyone present is here to debate
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402247000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#1402247000023">I
must disagree with the point made by my hon. Friend the Member for
Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey). The Department for Education website
states that the regulations were changed from allowing up to 10 school
days—not 10 school sessions—per year for holidays to
allowing children to leave school only in exceptional circumstances. As
I said, I will come to specific examples. Although there was some form
of consultation on changes to the regulations, that did not get across
to people and Parliament was not aware of constituents’ concerns
when the changes were made. However, that has now
changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402247000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#1402247000024">How
do we deal with the issue? Obviously, many of our constituents face a
serious problem; that is evidenced by the number of people in the
Chamber. Concerns have been expressed about the extent to which
companies can be forced to charge the same price throughout the year. I
do not think that that is a practical solution, particularly given that
the market includes people visiting this country—we could end up
with holiday touts and all sorts of things.</hs_Para>

solutions for dealing with demand. First, we could have flexibility in
holiday periods: we could stagger holidays. Secondly, we could have
more flexibility—moving back towards how things were previously,
although not necessarily all the way—and allow people to take
their children out of school in term time, in the right circumstances.
I think that would be reasonable in some
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402247000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#1402247000026">Looking
further at how the issue is regulated, we already have Ofcom, Ofwat and
Ofgem; I do not think we can have Offonholiday—that would not
work. A reduction in air passenger duty has been proposed, but there
would be problems with that. First, it would not benefit UK holiday
makers. Paul Cookson, who I referred to earlier, was worried about the
doubling of prices at Center Parcs. As Center Parcs is in the UK, a
reduction in air passenger duty would not have an effect on people
going there. If the APD proposal reached the Treasury, it would go into
a nosedive; we would find that it was not a

we did not have the early action. That was in 1963. In 1964,
the heads of Germany’s regional governments, which
are responsible for state education, were called together to stagger
the summer holidays in such a way as to prevent all the region’s
leisure seekers from leaving for and returning from their holidays at
the same time, with the corresponding detrimental effect on traffic and
demand for accommodation in tourist areas. They divided the country
into five roughly equal population blocks, which were all to have
different holiday periods that moved around. It is interesting that
Germany managed to do something. In fact, I understand that the
Republic of Ireland, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, Finland and
France also have such a

schedule 14 of the Deregulation Bill, currently being discussed, allows
head teachers to decide when holidays are. The general secretary of the
National Association of Head Teachers, Russell Hobby, said recently
that the NAHT has been saying for some time that there is an argument
for more flexibility over term times, to relieve the pressures that
drive up holiday costs. However, it is important for schools to
co-ordinate timings across a town or region; parents with children at
different schools would not welcome the inconvenience and child care
costs of different term dates. That is obviously sensible. We must also
think of the teachers; those with children would not like their
children’s holidays to be at a different time from
theirs.</hs_Para>

holiday dates can definitely be done, but it will need co-ordination;
it will not be something to wash our hands of. It may be for the Select
Committee on Education to consider, in conjunction with other people,
how we might stagger holidays across the country so that we do not end

it as an example of using a massive hammer to crack a nut. Everything
is with good intentions. We all want the best education for our
children. We all know that the less time a child spends at school, the
worse its outcomes will be, and there are lots of different reasons for
that. There are children from chaotic families and children who truant,
but we are talking about looking at an individual child and the
family’s circumstances and seeing whether it would be possible,
not to have a week a year taken out of school time, but to have a week
occasionally to make sure that that family can spend some quality time
together. I am so glad that we are having this debate, and I am looking

that we have one national policy that is supposed to apply to

police officers, and the armed forces. There are lots of individual
professions that will have problems. However, the head teachers that I
have met know the parents and their children. We do not want a
situation in which it becomes too easy to take children out of
school—there would be abuses of that—but in the case of
families with the lowest incomes and the greatest pressures on family

for a child than simply missing a couple of days of its education

good examples of people going on holidays during school holidays and
during term time. However, some parents said that they felt that was a
bit of a red herring: it probably reflects supply and demand, because
if a firm cannot sell the more expensive holidays, it would be forced
to drop those prices. For example, Center Parcs relies on something

they do not like being in the firing line and having discretion,

are the ones who are blamed. Sometimes there are reasons why that

was discretion about 10 days or 10 sessions, some parents felt that it
was an automatic right to have that every year, even if the child was
struggling. There was never a case of a parent saying,
“You’re absolutely right. I’ll now withdraw that
request.” It would create heated

am a big fan of flexibility in this regard. One big suggestion is
flexible term times. About a year ago I was contacted by a resident,
Nicki Mitchell, on this issue. I suggested flexible term times and was
asked, “What happens if you have a child in a primary school and
another at a secondary school, and they have different term times? That
will make it even
harder<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:05:23"></hs_TimeCode>.”
A number of residents have contacted me and said that such flexibility
exists in Europe and that it is done by county or region. We might
decide that the south-east goes a couple of weeks earlier and
the south-west goes a couple of weeks later. However, in Europe it is
done in rotation, so it is not always the south-west or south-east
first<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:05:50"></hs_TimeCode>. Not only
would that help parents and children, but it would probably help the
tourism industry, because almost regardless of what it charges it can
fill up at peak time, but the rest of year it faces a real
challenge<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:05:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
Spreading that across the year would be

we cannot manage flexible term times, another suggestion is extending
the school year by two weeks and allowing everybody automatically two

little Google research this morning revealed that for holidays on which
presumably no children are involved, and therefore school holidays are

between June and August. As you will recall from when we were there

Hinds:</Member></B> Yes, it is my fault. I worked mostly in the hotel
business, but the same principle applies to airlines and most of the
travel business’s wide range of products—basically
anything with high fixed-cost assets, a perishable product and fixed or
semi-fixed capacity. Hotels are also suppliers to holiday companies.
Package operators buy in capacity from airlines, hotels, bus companies
and so on. It is also worth bearing in mind that there is an
international market, especially in foreign travel. Packagers are to
some extent price takers. No one in this country decides the market
rate of a hotel room in Spain in the high season. Even if we believed
that British companies set the prices for holidays, no one would
suggest that Spanish hoteliers are within the control of Her
Majesty’s Government. Resort-based travel is international in
nature. People have already mentioned the timing of German and French
holidays, which are already factored into the price. If people from
different countries are going to a resort, the demand is an amalgam of

rises coincide with school holidays. To some extent, the existence of
those holidays creates those spikes, but the holidays themselves
coincide with the high season. As I outlined earlier, the prices for
holidays marketed to couples, older people, singles, groups and
clubbers typically go up in late July and August because that is the
most popular time of the year, particularly to visit European,
sun-based resort
destinations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022411000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000018">This
debate is no place to start deconstructing the profit and loss accounts
of holiday companies, but contribution to profit is a key concept. I
will talk about hotels, but the same logic applies to airlines and
other travel products. The direct marginal cost of someone staying in a
hotel room is rather low. Globally, the figure is somewhere between $15
and $20. That is the cost of laundering towels and sheets, issuing soap
and providing heat, light and power, and so on. On one level, a hotel
will make a profit if it charges anything over $20. The problem is that
there are other, fixed costs. For an airline or hotel, the biggest
fixed cost is the building or aircraft—loan repayments do not go
up and down. Taken together, the cost per night goes up from $20 to,
say, $100, which is a big difference. In the off-season, a hotel room
might be sold for $80, $70, $60 or $50 a night. In other
words, a hotel might deliberately make a loss. Why would a hotel do
that? It does it because as long as it charges more than $20 a night,
which is the direct marginal cost, it is contributing to profit. If a
hotel tried to charge the $100 profitable rate, it would not sell the
room<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:15:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022411000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000019"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Julian Lewis" PimsId="1486" UID="14022411000075" xid="358" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000075">Dr

The short answer is that such a measure would be welcomed by the travel
business because it would extend the season, which would be good for
capacity utilisation. There would be an effect, but the effect would
not be nearly as big as many people anticipate. The season might be
extended by a week or two, but those would still be shoulder periods.

responsibility of the tourism industry as a whole to ensure that it

there was a concern that many hoteliers in London increased their
prices too much, which put people off. Does he have any thoughts on
whether that should be rationalised for one-off events such as the
Olympics? I recall wanting to stay in Manchester during the party
conference, but as soon as hoteliers found out that the party
conference might be held in the city, the prices suddenly shot

gouging as a problem. From a regulatory perspective, most countries
have laws against price gouging, but 
<?notus-xml column=14?>brand owners and companies have an interest in not doing such things.
Even worse than the Olympics, price gouging can occur when there has
been a natural disaster. People absolutely have to stay in a hotel, so
they are ripped off. That is a bad thing, which is why rack rates
exist. Rack rates appear on the back of a hotel door, and it is the
maximum amount that may be charged in law. Most European countries, the
United States and most advanced economies have that system in hotels,
but price gouging remains a
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022411000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000023">In
summary, leisure travel companies have to make more money in peak
periods to cover the marginal cost losses incurred during the
off-season. The definition of a peak period is when most people want to

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:18:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Chesterfield (Toby Perkins), but it is inconceivable that a British
Government of any political persuasion would impose price controls on
the British-based travel business. If such price controls were imposed,
firms would go out of business—plenty of holiday companies go
out of business anyway because margins can be thin across the
year—and capacity in foreign resorts would not be made available
to British tourists. Instead, capacity would be sold to people from
other countries, which would have the disastrous consequence of more
German towels on loungers, and we can all unite around wanting to avoid

are the alternatives? I have spoken for too long, but I want briefly to
address the debate on taking children out of school outside school
holidays. I recognise the argument that times are tough and that people
are struggling to go on holiday so want to take their kids out of
school. One thing that has not yet come up in the debate is that
education in this country is free, but that does not mean that
education has no cost. The average cost of educating a child is some
£4,500 a year, which covers 190 school days or 38 weeks. By my
basic maths that works out at about £120-worth of value per
child per week. If someone takes both their children out of school for
a fortnight to go on holiday, £480-worth of value is forgone in
the education of those children. That value cannot be transferred to
the education of another child; it is value forgone for ever. The
salary of the teacher and all the other things that go into running the
school remain and the children miss
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022411000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000025">Children
fall behind if they miss part of their education. In the context of a
school term, even a week or two weeks is a reasonably big chunk of
time. Multiplied over a lifetime, a child taking a fortnight out from
school every year from year R to year 13 would be off for 28 weeks,
which is three quarters of an academic year. To put that in physical
terms, it is the equivalent of saying to that child, “You will
do your GCSEs at the beginning of year 11 rather than at the
end.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022411000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000026">What

counter-cyclical travel. If people go to places in the summer that have

of year in Europe—and Christmas is Christmas. There might be a
little flexibility on whether the Easter holiday takes places at
Easter, but a teacher will not want the first half of term to represent
40% and the second half to be 60%, because that has a number of
implications for education. Varying could be done to some extent, but
my recommendation is not to do it over big areas. Some of the other
advantages of staggered holidays, such as changes to road capacity
usage and train capacity usage, would be lost if everyone in a massive
area had the same holiday. Varying could be done at a sub-regional
level.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022411000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022411000029">I
am not sure that holidays need a big national plan, because schools
increasingly have the freedom and ability to vary them under the
Government’s reforms. There is nothing to stop schools getting
together—there is, for example, the education improvement
partnership in my area—and saying, “We are going to do it
slightly differently to give parents in our area a bit more
room.” That will not, however, solve the whole problem or make
holidays in August cost the same as holidays in April. There is a
limited amount of movement and, at the end of the day, we just cannot
change when the sun

other problems were forcing their way to this place. What on earth has
happened? The person in this room who I feel most sorry for is the poor
Minister from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. It

unhappy, so I accept the petition, but I do not accept the remedy. I
hope the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley will forgive me for saying

since I married her. Every family holiday that we have taken has been
at the most expensive time. We were both salaried, so we could afford
it, but I understand what happens to families on the breadline or
families struggling with their mortgage or short-term unemployment. If
they have children and want to take a holiday—the figures show
that it does not matter whether it is abroad or in this

There are offshoots to the issue, because with railways, we have the

not have an exceptional case, but might have relatives living in a

State has made the action a criminal offence. Not only will parents get
fined for taking the chance to bond with their kids on a beach
somewhere, they can get a criminal record because of it. It is not just
a case of what happens with picking chewing gum up off the floor, and
neighbourhood wardens giving people a £60 fine: there is a
criminal record.

frightened stiff of Ofsted—and see all the records. They can go
through every one and look at whether the parents of a child with an
exemplary attendance record will be fined because, to go away together,
they must take the time during term. Ofsted has attendance and
performance figures. All the necessary machinery is available to enable
a responsible head to take the decisions in the full knowledge of what
happens in the school and, most importantly, to be answerable to Ofsted

my parents ever taking me out of school, and I never took my children

to take them on holiday. It was generally just for a week, but we had
that benefit. Taking children

the market will stand. We may disapprove of their charges, and there
are great disparities between the amounts by which companies hike up
their prices in school holidays, but we cannot order them to restrict
their charges. Those are matters to do with competition rules. However,
restricting the number of children who can go on holiday outside normal
times leads to a rise in demand in the school holidays, and that is an
excuse for companies to hike the prices even further, which is
regrettable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000005"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>Perhaps

mistaken in what I said earlier about 10 days, because the power is

teachers could make up the time, with the children given special
projects. I am not sure that that is necessarily acceptable behaviour.
I fully understand the issue about cost, but I have no idea why
“special” versus “exceptional” makes a
difference for the head teacher in assessing such a
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:56:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000024">In
my time, I have been involved in children’s education as a
school governor in two different schools. I will not say which school,
because it would be unfair on the head teacher, but in one we discussed
the issue in lengthy detail. Parents had almost come to see it as a
right to request the time off, and the head teacher would be given a
hard time by the parents unless up to 10 days of leave were given. We
felt that that was wrong, because it put pressure on the head teacher,
as well as on the classroom teacher, who had to cope with the child
missing 10 days of
schooling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000025">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:57:28"></hs_TimeCode>

records and attainment at the school. That cannot, of course, be proved
for every single child, but it is fair to say that, in the schools in
my constituency where attendance rates are significantly below the
average, I see a significant difference in the attainment of the
children. We need to stand up for that consistently: it is not
necessarily simply about the individual child—although that
child’s education is important—but about all the children
in the classes. We need to remember
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:57:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000026">I
had not planned to speak and I do not wish to extend the debate unduly,
but the regulations introduced last year still leave the head teacher
with appropriate discretion. In cases of children with military
parents, or those whose parents wish them to attend a funeral, the
situation remains the same. There is no automatic right for parents to
remove a child in such a case, unless they wish to go down the
unauthorised absence route, but by changing the focus and putting in
regulation that circumstances must be exceptional, the right
expectations are set for parents. It is not therefore a right to take a
child out of school for up to 10 days of holiday, as referred to in
regulation. What is allowed is exactly what is said: if there is no
other opportunity for a particular situation to happen, head teachers
may use their
discretion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:58:44"></hs_TimeCode>.

under your chairmanship, Dr McCrea. You have only just joined us; I

congratulate the hon. Member for Birmingham, Yardley (John Hemming) on
bringing the issue for debate and on the way in which he presented it.
The strength of opinion that has been articulated in the debate, the
size of the petition and the testimony we have heard from hon. Members
clearly show how important the matter is and how right he
was.</hs_Para>

hon. Members have reflected on the fact that the Minister is from the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills and I am responding as a
shadow BIS Minister. The initial petition looked very much at the
business aspect of the matter, but the hon. Member for Birmingham,
Yardley was right to say that the whole aspect of the debate has
changed since the initial petition first went on to the e-petition
system. That was reflected in the debate, which did not dwell much on
the business aspect but focused much more on educational policy. That
perhaps leaves me at a slight disadvantage.</hs_Para>

of great concern for my constituents, many of whom have taken the
opportunity to raise it with me at my weekly surgeries, by e-mail and
at the school gate. I did a summer survey in which I raised questions
about the changes, which demonstrated powerfully to me how strongly
people feel about the matter. We all know how desperately difficult it
is to get that balance between the fact that we want our children to be
in school at all the right times and the huge increase in the cost of
holidays during the school breaks. It was therefore no surprise to me
that 150,000 people across the country took action by signing the
online petition and demanding that MPs discuss the issue. That is why
we have had so many valuable contributions from Members on both sides
of the House. I will touch on those in a moment.</hs_Para>

has been created in which many families who have not previously faced
the dilemma of how to afford an annual summer holiday now find
themselves financially squeezed and wondering how to do so. All of us
know how important holidays together can be for a family. We are an
incredibly time-poor nation, and, often, many people are stretched. We
struggle to have time with our families given the huge number of
pressures on us, so family holidays are incredibly important. It is
tremendously difficult for people when they feel that their opportunity
to go on those holidays has been removed. We all recognise how
important the issue is.</hs_Para>

Member for Birmingham, Yardley was right to say that this is another
demonstration of how powerful e-petitions can be. It has shown how
issues that we do not immediately see as significant can have their
significance powerfully demonstrated to us by our constituents. The
response of people to the e-petition demonstrated the importance of
this issue.</hs_Para>

Gentleman also raised the issue of staggering holidays, something to
which many hon. Members referred. That is an important part of the
whole equation. Colleagues in the Department for Education have been
looking at that issue and exploring how greater flexibility can be
given to schools. The point was made powerfully that we do not want a
parent such as myself, with one child in secondary school and one in
primary school, to find that their children’s schools have
holidays at different times. Perhaps we can try to stretch out the
holiday season on a more systematic basis, recognising that although we
are not blessed with sunshine all year round in this country, as some
areas are, we could none the less stagger holidays to take a bit of
pressure off.</hs_Para>

Gentleman also referred to the fact that this issue has been debated in
this place since the mid-1960s. It is interesting to question why
people feel so strongly about it now. The broader pinch that people are
feeling at the moment and how the holiday market has changed in recent
years, as well as the recent changes to Government education policy,
are perhaps some reasons why what has been to an extent a hoary old
chestnut for 40-odd years is now being raised powerfully.</hs_Para>

Member for Portsmouth North (Penny Mordaunt) suggested that discretion
does exist—a point repeated a moment ago—and the hon.
Member for Solihull (Lorely Burt) raised the important question of what
constitutes exceptional circumstances. We heard examples of
circumstances that have not been considered exceptional. My hon. Friend
the Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern) spoke about a child with
autism whose parents might have specific reasons for not wanting to be
on holiday when resorts are most crowded, and asked whether such a case

Friend the Member for North East Derbyshire (Natascha Engel)
highlighted the case of someone whose child had a brain tumour; that
was not considered by the head teacher to be an exceptional

school holidays because of the kind of business they ran, but their
circumstances were not considered exceptional.</hs_Para>

that there has been a change of policy. The Government have
communicated that quite deliberately, and it is their right to do so.
However, exercising that right has had an impact because of how the
policy has been implemented. One aspect of today’s debate that I
have found interesting was that no contributions have been made by any
hon. Members from Scotland—unless we count Corby as
representative of that nation. That is not entirely surprising, because
Scottish schools have holidays at a different time of year and Scottish
people probably benefit quite nicely from the fact that they all go on
holiday in July, when prices are cheaper than they are for us in
England. That is an interesting observation.</hs_Para>

reflect on some of the other contributions to what I think has been an
excellent debate. My hon. Friend the Member for North East Derbyshire
said 
<?notus-xml column=26?>something that was repeated by many colleagues: across the House we all
agree about the importance of children being in school, and recognise
the disadvantage there is to children when they are out of school, for
whatever reason, for any sustained period. None of us is saying that we
think it is good for children to miss huge amounts of their
schooling. We are all always conscious of our responsibility in this
place to ensure that our children have the best opportunity to be
successful at school. However, we also have to recognise that there is
a cost of living crisis, with families feeling the pinch, and that we
need to do what we can to support them in those circumstances. My hon.
Friend powerfully highlighted the reality faced by time-poor,
financially stretched families at this time, and the difficult
circumstances that they face.</hs_Para>

Member for North Swindon (Justin Tomlinson) spoke about the strength of
feeling and support on this matter, and he was right to do so. He also
raised the issue of whether there will be a greater amount of
discretion for a child who is going to a funeral than for someone who
wants a holiday without educational benefits; how the policy is being
applied shows that there is a difference between such cases. He also
touched on one of the devilishly difficult parts of the judgment call
on the matter when he called for clear guidelines but more discretion.
That is what we all want to an extent, but we should recognise the
central contradiction in that.</hs_Para>

Member for Bournemouth East (Mr Ellwood) spoke up for the tourism
industry, as we would expect. He spoke about the escalation in cost for
popular events, referring to the London Olympics and the fact that in
attempting to maximise their opportunities some people potentially
priced themselves out of business and ended up falling victim to what
they thought would be good times, as they had been too ambitious about
what they could charge. I do not know whether he has turned his
attention to the frankly extortionate cost to hon. Members of bed and
breakfast accommodation in Manchester at the time of the Labour party
conference. I have recently tried to make a booking and discovered that
Manchester in September is far more expensive that one would

the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:10:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Yardley did not talk about: the tourism industry. An
important point that some colleagues mentioned is that holiday
accommodation is available for 52 weeks a year, or slightly less, and
there is pressure to push the customer base into a shorter and shorter
period. The petition refers to profiteering holiday companies
exploiting people, but that is not the reality. If a crude cap were
introduced, they might retain the current price in August but they 
<?notus-xml column=27?>would be unable to reduce the price in April. The important question is
whether people would be better off or whether those who can go away at

hon. Member for East Hampshire (Damian Hinds) confessed his

he did not quite ask for forgiveness, he at least offered mitigating
circumstances. The debate involves the many people who cannot go away
during school holidays, as well as the many who can go away only during
school holidays—for example, teachers and anyone who works in
the education sector and so on. If we increase the pressure, we will
push up the cost of their holidays too. The debate started
18 months ago, or 40-odd years ago, depending on how people
look at it, but certainly prior to the proposed changes, which, if
anything, will push prices up further. What was a problem 18 months ago

two.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000050">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:12:51"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Member for Suffolk Coastal (Dr Coffey) focused on the semantics of
“special” and “exceptional” and seemed to
question whether there has been a change in policy. The previous
Government introduced fines for people who took their children out of
school without authorisation. The Secretary of State was clear that he
wanted his direction following the statutory instrument to be seen as a
change of policy. Head teachers saw it as that, and many in my
constituency wrote to parents saying that the policy had changed and
that there would be no discretion other than in narrow and exceptional
circumstances. That was clearly the intention of the Secretary of
State’s
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000052">The
debate has been consensual and sensible. It has shown that we all
believe strongly and passionately that it is vital for our children to
be in school for the maximum amount of time, that standards should be
resilient and that parents should recognise their responsibility. We
recognise that the present situation is desperate because prices have
risen faster than wages in 41 of the last 42 months, and families are
feeling the pinch. We are discussing another aspect of that
cost-of-living crisis. I intended to give some examples of how prices
have increased, but many hon. Members have alluded to that so I need
not do so. However, the extent of price differences during the high and
low seasons is huge and the success of the e-petition calling for swift
action is not
surprising.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022419000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022419000053">The

not have a price control policy at a macro level, but that does not

properly functioning competitive market. I will touch on
that.</hs_Para>

believe that they are exploited by the holiday industry, which uses the
tight limits on when they can travel to overcharge them, and the huge
cost differentials reflect that. However, there have been no thorough
studies of the issue in recent years, so it is hard to get to the
bottom of the problem and the extent of exploitation. The lack of such

omission because it does not give consumers or consumer groups any
power to access the information they need to check whether that is the

has driven change very much over the years. It is not so long
ago—only a few decades—that only the wealthy could
contemplate having a holiday abroad, and even holidaying in the UK,
which was more popular and much more affordable, was certainly not the
norm for many people. That was the situation not that long ago. With
the development of cheaper package holidays and so on, far more people
have found that they can afford a foreign holiday, but the sector has

respects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000005">An

charged across the year reflect demand, availability and the need to
attract consumers in a competitive market. It is common to all
competitive markets—it is especially acute in fluctuating
markets, such as the travel sector—that prices rise and fall
according to demand and supply. That is the way in which markets work
in general. When demand is high and supply is limited, prices
invariably increase to the point at which demand moderates. It is the
level of demand that dictates the prices in a competitive market, so if
demand increases, so do
prices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000007">Demand
appears to remain high in the travel and holiday market, despite the
economic difficulties that many people are facing—it has been a
very difficult time for many across the economy over recent years. The
industry reports that the holiday market is buoyant and consumers are
prepared to pay the prices being asked for the services on offer. If
people were not prepared to pay the prices being asked, demand would
drop and prices would come down, so it is being driven by the fact that
people are prepared to pay the prices that holiday companies are
demanding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000008"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:29:17"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="John Hemming" PimsId="4735" UID="14022424000055" xid="804" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000055">John

During<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:29:58"></hs_TimeCode> peak
periods, the UK industry is in fierce competition with those of other
countries, whose consumers want to go on holiday to the same
destinations. That competition for limited facilities means that costs
rise—it is not all being driven by consumers in the
UK—and those costs are reflected in the price put to the
consumer. As this is a Europe-wide market, consumers are similarly
affected in other countries across Europe. As a result, Governments
across Europe have decided that protection is needed for consumers in

consumer protection
law.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000011">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:39:32"></hs_TimeCode>

directive is the requirement that those arranging and selling package
holidays and package tours have in place protection for consumers
against their insolvency. That additional protection is an area in
which we in the UK were leaders. The air travel organisers’
license—ATOL—system was brought 
<?notus-xml column=32?>in before the European regime as a result of the huge growth in the UK
of the package holiday market in the 1970s and

extra protection is considered necessary because those operating in the
package travel market are deemed to be more at risk of insolvency than
businesses in other sectors. That is because the business model in the
holiday industry is based on predicting demand and committing to those
predictions in advance. I mention that because it is further evidence
of the extent and level of competition in that market—the
industry is forced by those pressures to price as competitively as it
can. There is considered to be a higher risk of insolvency in that
sector because the margins are thin and because the market is so

said that, I am very sympathetic to those who struggle to afford a
holiday in peak season. I appreciate that the difference in price
between off season and high season can be very significant. If people
have children, 
<?notus-xml column=33?>it becomes increasingly expensive and difficult to take holidays, and I
appreciate that the problem places an extra burden on families. I also
completely agree that family holidays are enormously important. They
give children opportunities to relax and unwind and create lasting
memories, as well as building family relationships and broadening the
experiences of children. I have very fond memories of taking holidays
as a child with my grandparents and parents and I am sure that everyone
in the room would say the same. It is important that children are able
to have those experiences and benefit from
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000018"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:35:34"></hs_TimeCode>Clearly,
in all of this, the dates of the school holidays are critical. It has
been suggested that pressures on the industry might be alleviated by
extending the periods during which families can take a holiday, thereby
spreading the demand over a longer period. We have heard that idea
mentioned today, and it is put forward not only by those who want
cheaper family holidays; it is also supported by many in the industry.
We have also heard it said a lot today that the rules on school
attendance are too strict. Almost every hon. Member who spoke discussed
that. People have suggested that schools should be able to approve
families going on holiday during term time. Others believe that it
would help if schools had different term dates. I shall come back to
that point, but, on the issue of absence, despite the clear value that
a family holiday can have for children and also for parents, the
Government’s view is that a good education is more valuable for
pupils in the long run and that getting a good education depends on
regular school attendance throughout the school
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000019">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:36:39"></hs_TimeCode>

summary of the legal framework. I found it quite illuminating and am
sure that a number of other colleagues did as well. What the Government
did in 2013 was remove the misconception held by some parents that
pupils were entitled to 10 days’ absence for holidays per year.
There was actually no entitlement in the previous
regulations—that was not what they said. We have clarified that

turned down by head teachers. Many of them are very distressing, but I
clearly cannot comment on individual cases, not knowing the full
details. Let me make it clear that the Government have not said that
any absence is not possible. We have given head teachers the discretion
to make that call. In addition, we have not specified what constitutes
exceptional circumstances, as we believe that cases need to be
considered individually. A number of hon. Members mentioned the need to
trust head teachers, and that is exactly what the Government are trying
to do—we want to ensure that head teachers have the power and

Hemming:</Member></B> A number of participants in the debate think that
head teachers are making the wrong decisions. If Ofsted is putting
pressure on numbers, guidance would help us to analyse that in more
depth. Prior to the changes, less than 10% of parents took advantage of
the process in primary schools and less than 3% in secondary schools,
so it did not affect many people. Those were clearly special
circumstances, but for some reason they were deemed not to be
acceptable. Guidance would give head teachers strength to argue with
Ofsted<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:41:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Gentleman’s. My hon. Friend the Member for Solihull (Lorely
Burt<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:42:07"></hs_TimeCode>) also said
that most parents do not take their children out of school for
holidays, and my figures show that in 2011-12, some 90% of secondary
school pupils and 80% of primary school pupils did not miss school for
a family holiday. Although the overwhelming majority of pupils are not
missing school to go on holiday, therefore, a significant
number of pupils are. The Department for Education was sufficiently
concerned about the matter to want to tighten up the rules.
I understand 
<?notus-xml column=35?>that in some areas, parents thought that they were entitled to 10
days’ absence a year for holidays, which was not the intention
of the original regulations. The regulations introduced last year were
designed to correct that misconception and clarify that schools should
authorise absence only in exceptional
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Hemming" PimsId="4735" UID="14022424000065" xid="804" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000065">John

Willott:</Member></B> That may well be the case, but it does not
undermine the argument that we must ensure that parents do not take
their children out of school for holidays unless there are exceptional
reasons for doing so. As the
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:44:09"></hs_TimeCode>right hon.
Member for Knowsley (Mr Howarth) said, family holidays taken during
term time disrupt the education not only of the individual student but
of other pupils. The hon. Member for Leeds East, whose wife is a head
teacher, said the same thing. Such absences create additional work for
teachers who have to try to help pupils catch up on their return while
looking after the other students in the class and ensuring that their
progress is not disrupted. Removing a child from school has significant
implications for other pupils in the class and for teachers.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:45:02"></hs_TimeCode> Government
do not want to change the rules on permitted absences, because the
effects on a child’s education and a school’s ability to
teach pupils effectively are significant.</hs_Para>

suggestion has been to introduce more flexibility into school term
dates. The holiday industry argues that making the peak period longer
would spread consumer demand, and because holiday companies could make
the same amount of money over a longer period of time, they would be
able to reduce prices a little for families. The spreading of demand
would also reduce competition for facilities and allow them to be used
more efficiently. Although there would still be competition with
organisers of holidays from other countries, it would be spread over a
longer period of

Willott:</Member></B> The staggering of school holiday periods may well
lengthen the period of peak demand and help to lower prices. I
completely understand the suggestion that the Government should arrange
for holiday periods to be spread, but currently local authorities, not
the Government, set the term and holiday dates for community and
voluntary-controlled schools. Academies, free schools and
voluntary-aided schools—including some church schools—set
their own dates. The Deregulation Bill, which is currently before the
House, will extend the power to set term dates to all schools by 2015.
The Government believe that term dates should be dealt with locally,
through negotiation and co-operation across an area, to take into
account the educational needs of students and the practicalities of
varying the school year. I cannot remember which hon. Member raised the

<?notus-xml column=36?>fact that someone with a child in a primary school and a child in a

Tomlinson:</Member></B> I raised that point. I accept that schools can
lead locally, but the reason why the system works so successfully in
Germany is because the dates are set by regions, which ensures that
children in primary school are not off at a different time from those
in a nearby secondary school. Although I accept that the decision

Education Committee or Ministers to determine schools’ term
dates. We really should leave such decisions to be made locally.
Schools currently manage to cope quite well. Different parts of the
country already have different holiday dates for different
traditions—for example, places such as Leicestershire and Wigan.
We should allow local authorities to work with schools to recognise
what is best for their
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000040"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jenny Willott" PimsId="4848" UID="14022424000076" xid="818" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000076">Jenny
Willott:</Member></B> I must confess that as an MP representing a Welsh
constituency, I benefited significantly last week when Parliament was
in recess because it was half term in England. When I went home to
Cardiff, all the places I took my small children were mercifully empty
because half term in Wales is this week. There is already a difference
between some areas, and it is possible to enable that on a broader
basis in order to extend the peak period, which would hopefully bring
down prices across the
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000041">To
conclude, the Government are not convinced that higher prices in school
holiday periods are the result of market abuse by the holiday industry.
Rather, they reflect market forces in a very competitive sector, and
are made worse by the fact that there is international competition as
well. I recognise the fact that family holidays can be incredibly
valuable, but they should not be at the expense of a child’s
education. School attendance throughout the school year remains
critical—we know that pupils who stay at school for longer do
much better in their final
exams.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000042"><Member ContinuationText="Steve Brine" PimsId="5594" UID="14022424000077" xid="1154" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000077"><B>Steve
Brine</B> (Winchester) (Con):</Member> I absolutely agree with the
Minister, but although we know that school attendance is important, we
also know that parents are not daft. A constituent of mine who is a
governor at a primary school in Winchester said to me that the changes
to the rules are an insult to his intelligence and discretion—he
would never dream of taking a child out of school at a crucial time. I
find it perplexing that a Conservative Government are meddling in this
area full stop, but we should think especially about the early
years—reception and year 1. Does the Minister have a view on
whether there should be more discretion during 
<?notus-xml column=38?>a child’s early years in primary school? Do we really need to
come down on head teachers and question their integrity in the way that
we appear to be
doing?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000043"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jenny Willott" PimsId="4848" UID="14022424000078" xid="818" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000078">Jenny
Willott:</Member></B> I completely disagree with the hon. Gentleman.
The Government are actually ensuring that head teachers have the
discretion to make a decision in exceptional circumstances. Clearly,
the decision that a head teacher makes will involve looking at the
child’s age, the circumstances under which the parent has
applied and so on. The point of the regulations that the Government
have put in place is that we are leaving it to the discretion of head
teachers to take into account individual circumstances and make a
judgment. That is exactly the reverse of Government meddling. However,
the issue is not just the effect on a child’s education. As I
and a number of other Members have already said, when a child is taken
out of school in term time, that does not just affect that
child’s education; it has a broader impact on the school, the
teacher and other pupils in the class. We must take that into account
as well, and I am sure that head teachers will consider that when
making
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022424000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/halltext/140224h0001.htm#14022424000044">Finally,

UK oil and gas industry is of national importance; it makes a
substantial contribution to the economy, supporting around 450,000
jobs, and had record capital expenditure in 2013 of around £14
billion. Oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy mix
as we transition to a low-carbon economy, with indigenous oil and gas
production supplying the equivalent of about half of the UK’s
primary energy demand. It is vital, therefore, that we continue to
maximise economic recovery of our indigenous hydrocarbon reserves,
thereby boosting growth, energy security, and
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022432000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/wmstext/140224m0001.htm#14022432000065">I
commissioned the review in June 2013 because, while investment levels
are rising and near-term prospects are strong, there are new challenges
for exploration and production, and the environment is very different
to when production peaked approximately15 years ago. Production and
exploration levels have fallen, and production efficiency has declined.
The review recognises the positive steps already taken by the
Government to incentivise recovery, such as the allowances for
brownfield and small fields. The report recommends that industry commit
to working with Government to implement the UK oil and gas industrial
strategy, and to develop new industry strategies in areas such as
exploration and decommissioning cost
reduction.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022432000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/wmstext/140224m0001.htm#14022432000066">The
Government accept Sir Ian’s key recommendation that Government
should work with industry to adopt a cohesive tripartite approach
between industry, HM Treasury and the UKCS stewardship body to a new
shared strategy of maximising economic recovery for the UK
(MER UK). Sir Ian Wood has identified some key
recommendations for industry, including that industry commit to making
the most of production facilities, does more to promote
third party access to infrastructure, develops new infrastructure
business models, improves collaboration, improves asset stewardship and
reduces the legal and commercial burden of working in the
UKCS.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022432000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/wmstext/140224m0001.htm#14022432000067">The
report also recommends that stewardship of the UKCS should be under a
new arm’s-length body, funded by industry and better resourced.
The review heard consistent praise for the staff working in the current
stewardship unit within DECC, but the review concludes that it needs to
be strengthened and focused around a new MER UK strategy if it is to
support industry in successfully meeting the challenges in the
UKCS.</hs_Para>

and subject to further detailed work to support the business case, we
shall proceed with taking the stewardship of the UKCS into the next
phase, with a new arm’s-length body, funded by industry, with
new resources and any necessary statutory powers to meet that
challenge. We will develop plans for a new arm’s-length body,
and will introduce legislation in the Fourth Session to bring the new
body into effect. The next step will be to appoint a chief executive
officer, with the aim of having that person in post in the summer 2014,
so that they can steer the work to design and build the new body, which
could begin operating in shadow form in the autumn. Stakeholders are
being invited to participate in an interim advisory panel on
implementation, which Sir Ian Wood has agreed to chair. I will publish

the recommendations will require Government and industry to adopt a
new, more collaborative, approach to stewardship of the UKCS. It is

against terrorism. I welcomed the proposed additional protections
proposed for non-US citizens in President Obama’s recent speech.
The US set out its plans to tighten controls on access to bulk data,

greater protection given to safeguarding the rights of non-US citizens.

by foreign fighters in the Syria conflict and stressed the need for
international co-operation to tackle this issue. I further set out the
need to focus on co-operation with Turkey as a priority, given that it
represents the key entry point for many European nationals travelling

the User Pays Visa Application Centre service overseas should be

Minister of State, Department for Work and Pensions (Steve
Webb):</Member></B> I am pleased to announce the Government will be
introducing new measures to require transparency for transaction
charges in pension schemes. Later today we intend to table an amendment
to the Pensions Bill 2013 to introduce this latest step in the
Government’s wider plans to ensure consumers receive value for
money from their pension savings.</hs_Para>

of costs and charges is fundamental for good scheme
governance and to enabling comparison between schemes. Our amendment,
which is intended for debate at the Report stage of the Pensions Bill
2013 in the House of Lords this Wednesday, will place a duty
on the Secretary of State to make regulations requiring
greater transparency around the transaction costs incurred by
work-based defined contribution 
schemes.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14022432000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/wmstext/140224m0001.htm#14022432000120">Requiring
increased transparency is the latest step in the wider Government
programme to see fair charges for people who are automatically enrolled
into workplace pensions. Last year, we consulted on whether to cap
charges in the default funds of schemes used for automatic enrolment,
and the Government remain committed to seeing
this policy through during the life of this Parliament. Accordingly,
our response to the consultation on charges, and further
proposals on quality and transparency in workplace pension schemes,
will be published
soon.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Petitions" ColStart="1"><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/68404A0E3917D7AA24BF85FDA106BA372C5E1DBF" __version__="1.1"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 February 2014">Monday

in the number of employment and support allowance (ESA) appeals in the

April 2011 more decisions have been made on ESA as the Department
processed new claims, converted more claimants from old style
incapacity benefits to ESA and reassessed existing awards. From October
2013 claimants who wish to dispute a decision must request a Mandatory
Reconsideration process before they can appeal. This allows the
opportunity to provide any additional evidence, and for the Department
to establish if the decision is right. While the Department is
confident that this process will be effective in changing decisions, it
is nevertheless anticipated that there will still be rise in the number
of appeals overall. The Ministry of Justice regularly publishes
statistics on the numbers of social security appeals, including those
against ESA and PIP decisions, which have been received and

Gauke:</Member></B> The UK has a diverse tax base. Any assessment of
the international competitiveness of UK manufacturing firms would need
to take into account the entirety of the UK tax base and the wider
support given to UK businesses. No assessment has been made of the
effect of business rates alone on the international competitiveness of
UK manufacturing firms. The Government's ambition is for the UK to be
the best place in Europe to start, finance and grow a
business.</hs_Para>

Gauke:</Member></B> A multi-agency group across Government, Project
Bloom, was set up in 2012 to tackle the issue of pensions liberation.
This group comprises the National Crime Agency, Department for Work and
Pensions, the Pensions Regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, HM
Revenue and Customs and the Serious Fraud Office. Each agency has
already taken a number of steps to combat the issue. HM Treasury have
been closely involved in the work and will continue to consider further
steps to combat pensions liberation alongside other relevant agencies,
making pensions liberation in all its forms harder to carry
out.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1402254000024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0002.htm#1402254000024">Railways:

relating to police and judicial co-operation in criminal matters
(except hot pursuit), to narcotic drugs, and to carriers' liability.
The UK is also working to join the second generation of the Schengen
Information System (SISII). However, the UK is not part of Schengen
arrangements on visas and border controls. The Government believes that
the retention of frontier controls at ports and airports in the UK is
the most effective means of controlling immigration and combating
organised and cross-border crime. This is particularly so given our
island geography and the high volume of people travelling in and out of
the UK, and transiting the UK to travel to other parts of the world.
Any future application to join those parts of the Schengen Protocol
that would remove any UK border control would require an Act of
Parliament and referendum under the terms of the EU Act

habitation rights on Ascension Island, which has always been a place of
work rather than one of permanent residence. To do so would change the
nature of the Territory and lead to considerable infrastructure and
development costs which would place an excessive burden on the UK
taxpayer, and which would create contingent liabilities for an
indefinite period into the future. Ascension Island has a functioning
democratic process which operates in keeping with its Constitution,
revised in 2009. A successful general election took place in October
2013, when a full seven person Council was returned. This Council

how to access legal and other support services. In the second project,
community leaders and local government staff in 40 target villages will
participate in workshops and receive psychosocial training to gain a
better understanding of their role in preventing sexual violence in
their communities. These projects will be implemented by Action Aid in
several conflict-affected areas: Kachin state, Kayah state, Rakhine

However, there is growing evidence that predation by foxes can

environmental land management scheme we are currently considering new

insurance policies are often bespoke and already priced to risk, as

England estimated that less than 1% of them had experienced difficulty
getting property insurance in the last year due to the risk of flooding

of flooding. This view was supported in the consultation on Flood Re

of food law is undertaken by local authority trading standards and

David Jones:</Member></B> Flood defences and road infrastructure
expenditure in Wales are matters for the Welsh Government. The funding
the UK Government is providing to improve flood defences in England for
road repairs following flooding, and for the provision of council tax
refunds for flooded homes in England, is being found from within
existing departmental budgets. The Barnett formula has already
previously been applied to these budgets and therefore the Welsh
Government has already received its allocation of funding through the
application of the formula. As such, there will be no Barnett
consequentials for this
expenditure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022514000820" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0004.htm#14022514000820">The
UK Government is also taking a range of actions to help homes and
businesses across the UK following recent flooding, such as extra time
for businesses to file accounts without penalties, access to a Business
Support Line, and meeting with the insurance industry to discuss how
they can help those people
affected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022514000821" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0004.htm#14022514000821">Should
the Welsh Government wish to reallocate their existing budgets towards
flood repair or protection work, as has been done in England, that is a
decision for them to make. In the event of an official request from the
Welsh Government for additional assistance, the UK Government would be
willing to consider the request. In the meantime, the UK Government
stands ready to provide support to Wales in the event of further
extreme weather, through the mobilisation of the military as has
already been seen in parts of
England.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/E12EDEB21E8A5658657A9E17E84B50C28AD97FC2" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="24 February 2014">Monday

targeted building disposals. This has seen the Department surrender six
leasehold office properties through a combination of lease breaks and

million per annum. The Department has also successfully sub-let surplus
space across its leasehold office estate during the same period,
reducing the overall property costs by around £6.5 million per

Eland House and is scheduled to relocate to 2 Marsham street. This move
will reduce my Department's running costs by £9 million a year

only a temporary means of flood protection to be used in an emergency
but they are important in this context. We are grateful for the way
that local authorities across the country have supported their
neighbours facing flooding by making their own stocks available for
their use to protect their communities. But this is a short term
measure, which is why we are making available £5,000 to every
household and business flooded in recent events to make the more long
term resilient repairs recommended by the National Flood Forum and the
Environment Agency. This funding was announced on 18 February and the
detail of how it will be paid is being

clear that openness and permanence are essential characteristics of
Green Belt, and that inappropriate development in Green Belt should not
be approved except in very special circumstances. A Green Belt boundary
may be adjusted only in exceptional circumstances, using the Local Plan

facilities, such as blocks of flats. It was introduced in 2004 by Part

that there may be types of business premise which are not included and

cinemas will still benefit from the 2% cap in the increase in the

smaller venues, and the new right for ratepayers to pay their yearly

councils can also offer further discretionary rate relief, should they

overstated—London rents have increased by 1.6% in the 12 months
to December 2013, compared with a 2.0% rise in the Consumer Prices
Index. Rents have thus fallen in real
terms.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022514001330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0005.htm#14022514001330">Working
with the Mayor of London, the Government believes the most effective
way of managing rental costs in London, and across the UK, is to expand
the provision of high quality, new build rented accommodation. That is
why in September 2012 the Secretary of State for Communities and Local
Government announced the £10 billion Housing Guarantees schemes,
the Build to Rent Fund, which was increased to £1 billion in
Budget 2013, and the Private Rented Sector Taskforce. Collectively
these measures will help create a professionally managed institutional
Private Rented Sector and contribute to economic
growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022514001331" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0005.htm#14022514001331">We

the reform of the Housing Revenue Account and introduction of
self-financing of council housing in April 2012, all stock-holding
local authorities have a stable source of funding with which to make
long-term business plans, which can include the provision of new
affordable homes. The Government will also be making available an
additional £300 million Housing Revenue Account borrowing,
across 2015-16 and 2016-17, to support about 10,000 new affordable
homes. In addition, local authorities can bid for a share of the
£3.3 billion of Government funding to support delivery of
165,000 affordable homes between 2015 and 2018. An independent review,
led by Natalie Elphicke and Keith House, will review the role that all
local authorities can play in housing supply, which is due to report by
end
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022514001342" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0005.htm#14022514001342">More

Library, including their regional branches. Decisions on how to invest
grant-in-aid are made by those ALUs, independently of Government,
however, within their settlements, I expect the national museums to
work in partnership with other museums in the UK, through loans,
exchanges of expertise, education programmes, conservation and
community projects. Since 2002, a joint Fund between DCMS and the
Wolfson Foundation has also made £26 million available for

best from a diverse work force in its day to day activity. While there
are individuals who have particular responsibility for promoting
equality and diversity, this is in addition to their other duties. The
Department is unable to break down figures to show how much was spent
on the equality and diversity aspect of their role. On 1 April 2013,
The Government Equalities Office (GEO) joined DCMS under a Machinery of
Government transfer. The Government Equalities Office works to take
action on the Government's commitment to remove barriers to equality
and help to build a fairer society, leading on issues relating to
women, sexual orientation and transgender equalities. In this broader
sense the whole of the staff of GEO and its programme spend is devoted
to promoting equality and
diversity.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14022524000034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0006.htm#14022524000034">Human

there is one row of data for each A&amp;E attendance with many

only been available since 2007-08. There are known issues with data
completeness within A&amp;E HES, with not all Emergency departments,
particularly smaller minor injuries units and walk in centres, being
able to submit data electronically to SUS. The first year's figures in
the series only comprise 60% of the total A&amp;E admissions, improving
significantly over time by an estimated 20% in recent years, meaning it
is impossible to identify reliable national trends over the whole

Lamb:</Member></B> As required by the Autism Act 2009, the Department
is currently leading a review of the Adult Autism Strategy published in
2010. The issues raised by these linked questions are all being
actively considered as part of that review which provides an
opportunity for a cross-Government assessment of the objectives of the
strategy to determine if they remain the right ones, to assess what
progress has been made in implementing the measures in the strategy and
consider what should happen to continue to make progress in improving
outcomes for people with autism. The review has included substantial
and wide-ranging engagement with people with autism and their families
and with those who commission and provide support
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022524000451" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0006.htm#14022524000451">The
National Audit Office (NAO), in a memorandum to the Public Accounts
Committee in July 2012, stated that considerable progress had been made
across central Government, local authorities and the national health
service since the launch of the strategy, but that there is still some
way to go. The NAO’s findings have helped inform the current
review of the strategy. As part of the review, local authorities and
their partners took part in a self-evaluation exercise on progress made
in implementing the strategy. We expect local responses to be discussed
by health and wellbeing boards as evidence of local planning and health
needs assessment strategy development. A full report of information
from across the country will be published by Public Health England in

order to help improve the care and management of autism and to enable
health and social care services to support people with autism more
effectively, the Department commissioned the National Institute for

the commissioning of autism services for children, young people and

publication of statutory guidance for health and local authority
