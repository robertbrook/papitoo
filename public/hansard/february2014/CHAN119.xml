In 2009-10, the spend for Yorkshire and the Humber was £283 per

Government transport spending in the north has gone up from 38% to 45%.
It is important to make the point that the Kings Cross station
development and the Alexandra Palace to Finsbury Park six-tracking are
allocated to London spending, but the benefits will be enjoyed by all

I am sure the whole House will want to join me in expressing sympathy

urgent priority is the railway at Dawlish. Colleagues will have seen
the images of the devastating impact the weather has had on the railway
there. I met members of all parties of Devon and Cornwall yesterday
evening alongside Network Rail. The immediate priority is to assess the
damage and develop a plan for getting the line back into service as
soon as possible, but I am acutely conscious of the need to develop a
long-term solution to the resilience of the railway network in the

that, for example, at the start of a Parliament, or sometimes for

waste from prepared dishes in the House of Commons catering outlets, as
measured as a percentage against sales, is 3%. This is well below the
national average for the catering industry, which is 5%. The
Sustainable Restaurant Association has rated the House of Commons as a
good-practice organisation in respect of food waste. We take a variety
of measures to monitor and reduce the amount of food waste from
catering outlets. There are plans to extend composting of food waste,

but her principal comment was that no Government business is being
brought forward. I have looked again at the business that I have just
announced, and three of the five days in the Chamber involve Government
business: consideration of Lords amendments to the Children and
Families Bill, the Second Reading of the Criminal Justice and Courts
Bill—a further Bill introduced just yesterday—and debates
on the police grant and local government finance reports. I cannot see

to reiterate what the shadow Leader of the House and other hon. Members
are perhaps ignoring, the time allocation for debates to the Opposition
and the Backbench Business Committee is a proper use of the time of
this House; it is not simply that this House debates only Government
legislation and that that is all that matters, which would be absurd.
If we listened to the shadow Leader of the House, all those days would
be taken away and allocated to Government business. That is not what
this House has decided to do. When my right hon. Friend the Patronage
Secretary was Leader of the House earlier in this Parliament, he
brought in a measure, with the agreement of the House, to allocate
substantial time to the Backbench Business Committee, and rightly

term of office is expiring. I do not understand what the question is

all about. To relate it to the business, I am sure that she will have
noted that whatever films she wants people to see, whether as analogies
for Cabinet Ministers or anybody else, they will have enhanced

economic plan. Almost daily, there is further evidence of the success
of that plan, whether it is exports going up, news on manufacturing
confidence or the increased number of jobs. The news today about
Bombardier is clearly very welcome. We are cutting the deficit, cutting
income tax and freezing fuel duty. We are seeing more jobs in the
economy. We are capping welfare, reducing immigration and promoting
better schools and skills for the future. All those things will give

that it is my party that had the first sitting woman Member of

I hope one may come forward soon. As I have already made clear to the
House, the e-petition system run by the Government has been a great
success and is linked to the Backbench Business Committee and the
timetabling of debates. In the business I just announced we saw how an
e-petition rapidly hit the 100,000 mark on the subject of extra
charging for holidays during the school holidays, and that will be
debated in Westminster Hall. There is, however, much wider scope and an
opportunity for the House to consider and respond to petitions and
allocate time for debate if the current e-petition system can be owned
by both the Government and Parliament working together. I hope we can
secure consensus on that soon, and give the House an opportunity to
give its stamp of approval to that.</hs_Para>

to boil those down and present them to the House, which will give
Members only 14 days, possibly, to look at them before the Second

an important point. The pupil premium is an important part of the
allocation of resources to support disadvantaged pupils. To support a
more efficient system the Department has developed an award-winning
free school meals eligibility checking system. This system enables
local authorities very quickly to determine whether a parent can claim
free school meals by linking benefits information from the Department

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:39:11"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

of the defining characteristics of Britain is the weather, but in
recent months it has been particularly savage. Part of the country has
been subject to flooding by the sea, rivers, surface water and ground
water. In December, we saw the highest surge on the east coast for 60
years and this January has been the wettest since George III was on the
throne. We will continue to face severe weather well into next
week<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:40:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000356">I
want to put on the record my utmost sympathy for those affected. I know
from my constituency the effects of flooding, and once the floodwaters
go down there is the smell, the sludge and the enormous time it takes
to dry a building out. Flooding has devastating effects on communities.
I know it has been especially difficult for those families that have
been flooded for many weeks and for those that have been flooded on
more than one occasion in recent months. I think we have all been
struck by the stark images of the stranded residents on the Somerset
levels and their brave resolve to continue their daily lives, be it by
boat or
tractor<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:40:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000357">I
also want to pay tribute to the hard work of councils, the Environment
Agency’s staff on the ground and our emergency services, who
have supported communities 24 hours a day, literally going through hell
and high water. Britain’s flood defences have protected more
than 1.2 million properties since 5 December and the Thames barrier has
protected £200 billion-worth of property. None the less, it is
evident that those defences are taking a pounding. There is damage to
transport infrastructure and sea defences, including the railway line
at Dawlish, as well as to power
networks<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000358">More
than 5,000 properties have been flooded, including 40 in Somerset.
There are two severe flood warnings in the west country, 61 flood

the Prime Minister’s statement yesterday, I can now report to
the House the Government’s plans for further funding for flood
and coastal erosion risk management. In the short term, I can announce
that the Government will provide an additional £130 million for
emergency repairs and maintenance, £30 million in the current
year and £100 million next year. That will cover costs incurred
during the current emergency response and recovery, as well as
essential repairs to ensure that defences are

work on repairs started during December’s coastal surge.
However, the full picture of the damage caused to flood defences has

addition, I am putting before the House today details of how my
Department is enhancing the terms of the Bellwin scheme, which helps
local authorities in England to meet the exceptional and unexpected
costs associated with protecting lives and properties. The changes I am
announcing today include paying Bellwin grant at 100% above the
threshold instead of the normal default 85%; allowing upper-tier
authorities with responsibility for fire to claim on a comparable basis
to stand-alone fire authorities; reducing Bellwin thresholds for all
county councils and unitary authorities; and extending the eligible
period until the end of March
2014.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000362" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000362">No
council has yet made a formal claim under the Bellwin scheme, so no
council has lost out as a result of these new announcements. Indeed,
far more councils will be eligible to claim. The enhanced scheme terms
reflect the exceptional nature of the recent weather events and the
challenges facing local authorities in their roles as first responders.
However, it is clear that the Bellwin scheme needs further reform, an
opportunity that was sadly missed under the last Administration. We
will be undertaking a full review of the Bellwin scheme in due course,
while ensuring that councils continue to have the right incentives to
stop flooding happening in the first
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T11:45:12"></hs_TimeCode>. I can
also tell the House that immediately after this statement, Ministers
will be holding a teleconference with council leaders from across the

course, flood prevention is as important as flood recovery. The
additional funding that we have outlined today will allow the
Government programme of capital investment to continue, fulfilling our
commitment to improve defences throughout England. We have already put
in place investment plans to improve the protection of at least 465,000
houses by the end of the decade. In addition, we are today announcing
42 new flood defence schemes for 2014-15. Together with other projects
beginning construction in 2014-15, this will protect more than 42,000
households. This includes schemes in Salford, which will improve
protection for more than 2,000 homes and businesses;
Clacton, where more than 3,000 homes are currently at risk; and
Willerby in the east riding of Yorkshire, where more than 8,000
properties will be better protected. There are also smaller, but no
less important, schemes in Lincoln, Stockton and Todmorden.</hs_Para>

in real terms each year, rising to over £400 million by the end
of this decade. By the autumn statement, we will have published a
six-year programme of work running right up to 2021,
including a new long-term investment strategy on flood defences. We

the dark skies clear, there will be lessons to be learned, from the way
in which we help local authorities to the role of quangos and the need
for their local accountability, the influence of man-made policies on
dredging, the effect of tree planting on our landscape and rivers, and

we respond to emergencies is well set out through local resilience

across local authorities, including to the health authority and the

pegged or free floating, they could create a currency board or they
could join the euro. All these options are available. But the

rules, would fail, and that their failure would trigger the need for
bail-outs? I do not think that such arrangements would be acceptable to

currency union created in such circumstances would, sooner or later, be
tested by the markets. Either the rules would be tough enough to bite,
or, if they were not tight enough, there might be a bail-out.

enough attention has been paid to the political consequences of
botching these currency arrangements. Whatever the economics of trying
to create a currency 
<?notus-xml column=462?>union, I think that it is bad politics for these islands at this point.
The eurozone has provided a reminder not just of the economic
difficulties of creating durable currency unions, but of the political
damage and fall-out that come with flawed arrangements. We need, above
all, to put what Lord Lang, in the other place, described as
“the politics of grievance” behind us as we make our
efforts to renew the relationship between Scotland and the rest of the
UK. But it seems to me that a currency union would risk the opposite.
As its full implications became clear, it would create the conditions
for lasting resentment on both sides of the border, and it is just such
resentment that we must do everything possible to avoid in the search
for a stable economic and political relationship between those on the

£1 or £2 an hour, it was the Labour party that thought

that, and I do not believe that most people in Scotland do either. Of
course we face challenges, on health, inequality, infrastructure, and
transitioning and transforming our economy, but I simply believe that
if we use the powers we already have and the new powers that are
coming, if we sensibly discuss further powers that might be added to
them, on tax, borrowing and employment support, and if we work together
across parties, across Scotland and with the rest of the UK, we have a
very positive future. We should channel our energies into that, not
seek division or separation. I am proud to be Scottish, I am proud to

wish to make a few points in the four minutes or so remaining to me.
First, I wish to discuss membership of the European Union. I was the
Chairman of the Select Committee on European Legislation from 1992 to
1998, and of its successor, the European Scrutiny Committee, from 1998
to 2006. For 14 years, I was the Chairman of the Select Committee
dealing with European legislation and, in particular during that term
of office, enlargement. Along with my Committee colleagues, I
scrutinised the applications of Finland, Sweden and Austria, and then
the big bang of the accession of the three Baltic states and the seven
central European states. I also began the process of dealing with the
Romanian and Bulgarian accession—that was six years ago and they
have only just joined the European Union fully. So although I have
never claimed to be an expert on anything, I do know a little about
European legislation.</hs_Para>

Minister from the Scottish Government had legal opinion to back up

proved to be a lie, and it is distasteful that this important debate is
wasted by that sort of atmosphere. This place is about debating and
democracy, and has been for centuries. Surely this is a debate on the
merits of what the proposition is, and not a debate based on the
quality of propaganda. Propaganda is not about political debate; it is

nine hundred years ago, Rome divided Britain with a wall. Britain is an
island whose natural boundaries are the sea, and this wall split
families and split tribes. Ever since that moment we have been debating
this issue. These two fundamental principles for Britain are what we
are debating today. They are in competition: are we divided nation
against nation, or are we unified by culture and language? There is
only one answer to that question, and it cannot be simply economics. If
a relationship is going wrong—if a marriage is going
wrong—the answer cannot simply be to say, ‘You
can’t afford to break up because you are going to lose the
house.” The answer has to be only one thing, which is, “I
love you.” We in this House are struggling to express the nature
of our love for Scotland. We are not very good, as politicians, at
talking about emotions. We have become very bad at it, but we need to
learn to do it, because otherwise a party that is trying to reduce, to
shrink, to vanish will win.</hs_Para>

do we mean when we say, “I, as a Member of Parliament for an
English constituency, love Scotland”?
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:02:21"></hs_TimeCode>It would be
personal to every single one of us. It could be that we love
intellectual seriousness. I was paddling along in a canoe with the hon.

would really miss him from that canoe. People in the United Kingdom
would miss Scotland for different personal

Stewart:</Member></B> There are two answers to that question. First,
Scotland must of course embrace the potential of being part of the
United Kingdom in foreign affairs. 
<?notus-xml column=469?>Secondly, the hon. Gentleman himself represents what is good about
our political settlement. He sits on the Foreign
Affairs Committee, so there is a Scottish voice on that Committee
raising Scottish issues again and again, forcing us to focus on
Scottish issues when we think about foreign policy, and that is
something that we would deeply miss.</hs_Para>

great appeal to Scottish nationalism. We all feel it in our gut, and it
is because the world is bewildering. People are angry. Some 85% of
people in this country feel that politics is broken and 87% feel that
society is broken. Our voters feel that Westminster is out of touch and
that their lives have never been so complicated. Those are real
feelings that we have to acknowledge and accept. But the answer to
those problems is not to get smaller. When we face complexity and
things that are bewildering in our everyday lives—when we feel
angry or disappointed—the answer is not to get smaller, shut the
door and pretend that we can shut those things out. The answer is to
expand.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000542">I
have three suggestions on the lessons that we need to learn from
Scottish nationalism. The first lesson is that it is not that
Westminster is too far away: it is also that Edinburgh is too far away.
The answer to the problems of our communities is to represent the
issues of Argyll separately to the issues of Perthshire and the issues
of the Borders. They are not the same issues. One of the great
weaknesses in England, Ireland, Wales and Scotland is the lack of real
localism. Whether talking to someone in Muthill struggling with
planning or someone in Kelso worried about economic development in
their area, we need to learn from Mitterrand in France in
1983—hyper-localism and mayors at a local level—and not
try to fool the Scottish people by pretending that transferring power
from Westminster to Holyrood will solve those human
problems.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000543">The
second thing that we need to do—and this is true for the north
of England as much as for Scotland—is not to pretend that London
and the south of England do not exist. We need to accept that they
exist, that they are a challenge, that they have huge potential, and
that we need to make them work for us, not pretend that they are not
there.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000544" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000544">The
third thing is cultural links. It is a tragedy that the educational
policy of the Scottish National party has made it more difficult for
English students to study in Scottish universities and for Scottish
students to study in English universities. We must reinforce the
cultural
links.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020652000545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0002.htm#14020652000545">Finally,
what we need is the human expression. On  19 July this year, I
hope that 100,000 people will gather along that old Roman
wall—English, Welsh, Irish and Scots—holding hands and
linking arms across the border. Because in the end what matters is not
the wall that divides us but the human ties that bind us in the name of
love.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/322FEDC56EE8149A326FF0310856DC4D2DB88683" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="6 February 2014">Thursday

he helped build trade unionism in Scotland and in Britain. He was an
internationalist in outlook, and an MP for a Welsh and then an English
constituency. Look at the Scots who followed in his footsteps, like
John Wheatley, Tom Johnston and Willie Ross—another of
Ayrshire’s own. They all made a tremendous contribution to

this debate, but I notice that people of the level of Bob Dudley, who
is high up the pecking order, are less easily bullied. That is an
important point,
however<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:26:21"></hs_TimeCode>, and I

their work force, but they can put their concerns in a way that says,
in effect, “It’s up to you how you vote, but we have this

the following implications for our business, and you need to take that
into

that must go out to the people of Scotland is that if they vote yes it
is for life, so they need to be very confident and certain about their

part of the United Kingdom, with the best of both worlds. We are better

September this year we can make the choice to become a self-governing
nation once again—to walk tall in the world with national
self-respect and dignity like all other normal independent nations do,
being responsible for ourselves and blaming no one else for our
setbacks. The most exciting thing for me is that our independence will
release and ignite a tsunami of energy, creativity and imagination as

Wishart:</Member></B> I am not giving way. I do not like where the UK
is going at all. I do not have much time, so I will mention just two
examples. The first was last week’s appalling Immigration Bill,
which would charge visitors to our country fees for health care and
turn those who rent houses in the private-rented sector into
immigration officers. It is a nasty, pernicious and rotten Bill that is
designed to counter the threat of the UK Independence party. We do not
do UKIP in Scotland; we barely do Tory. We have a national treasure on
the Front Benches; our one and only Tory Member. None the less, we will
get that Bill, because this Government took it through on a Labour
abstention. I object to my country being dragged into this monstrous
race to the bottom between this Government and UKIP about who can be
the hardest on those who might want to come and live in my country.
Scotland is better than that, yet the Bill was passed. It was passed on
the same day as the House of Lords debated our country. I do not know
whether you saw that, Mr Deputy Speaker. That bloated, unelected
Chamber stuffed full of party placement cronies and donors had the
audacity to tell our nation what it should do. Then it also had the
effrontery to defile the memory of our war dead and insult the many
brave veterans who have served this country with distinction just
because they happened to support independence for our nation. One thing
we will get with independence is the ability to wipe away that
ermine-wearing unelected Chamber from the face of Scottish public life,
and our nation will be much better for that. Scotland is so much better

Members to listen to the other side of the debate. I do not know why
this place thinks that that is attractive. It is a choice between
negativity and positivity. No European country has done what we are
about to do. As an exercise in democracy, this is huge. This is
Scotland’s great choice, because it is a choice between two very
different and distinct futures. We can decide that this is as good as
it gets, or we can decide to do something much better—to take
control of ourselves and to put the nation in the hands of the Scottish
people. If we get this chance, this once-in-a-generation chance, we
will vote for the positive, because positive beats negative. What a
prize there will be when we vote yes in overwhelming numbers. When we

have more than 300 years of a forged special identity. That does not
diminish the importance, the history or the culture of the constituent
parts of the United Kingdom. Initially, it is like a marriage, in which
two separate families come together. Over the centuries, those two
families forge something unique together, and a shared identity comes
about. Something special is created whether it is through triumph,
disaster, adversity or opportunity. We dismantle that at our

second point is what I see as a fundamental flaw at the heart of the
Scottish National party’s position. It is not a proposal I agree
with, but there is a logical coherence to the argument that Scotland,
as a separate nation, should become independent and a master of its own
destiny with the ability to shape its own future, as the hon. Gentleman
has set out. Quite apart from the huge emotional costs that would have
to be paid, there are many uncertainties and other costs that would
flow. None the less, I understand the emotional appeal and the logic
that goes behind it. What is not logical is to go through all that
pain, cost and uncertainty only to argue that nothing would change for
this new separate, independent sovereign country. The hon. Gentleman
admitted it himself. He said that the day after would be the same. Why
go through all that, particularly on the point of currency union, which
has been the subject of much discussion? I do not often agree with Jim
Sillars, a former Member of this House, former deputy leader of the SNP

is a dynamic process and I think that was always the intention when the
Scotland Act 1998 was passed. In 2012 we passed a further Scotland Act,
which contains a substantial transfer of powers, principally fiscal
powers, from this place to Holyrood. That transfer has huge
implications, particularly for businesses in Scotland as they adjust to
the new fiscal arrangements. I support that, as it makes Holyrood
responsible for more of the money it spends. It finds as much of a
welcome in my constituency in England as I know it does in Scotland.
Surely the sensible thing to do is let that major change happen and bed
down before we see whether there are further practical changes that can
be introduced so that we have the optimal arrangement between Scotland,
England and the rest of the United Kingdom, rather than gambling on the
one-way ticket to uncertainty that a yes vote on 18 September would

September. I do not want to swap my country for dual citizenship or

want to talk about the reasons why Scotland is stronger when we pool
and share our resources as a United Kingdom, but let me start by
outlining what I believe to be the three main elements of the debate on
the streets of Scotland. First, it is about the things that we know
will change. Secondly, it is about the things that would not change.
Thirdly, it is about the issues that would require negotiation. It has
become apparent that there is a nationalist plan to move as many items
as possible from the negotiation box into the box for things that would
not change: the pound, membership of the European Union and membership
of NATO, to name just three. It is pretty clear that the motivation for
that move is to create an atmosphere in which people in Scotland feel
that separation is not a
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:44:00"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
that the yes campaign will change its strategy and tactics because a
victory based on a deceit would be no victory at all.</hs_Para>

also know that many people have stepped in to make their views known,
most notably and recently the Governor of the Bank of England. I hope
that people will continue to do so without fear and will make positive
contributions to the argument on both sides, but I must place on record
my concern that the apparatus of the state is being abused by those in
power. The White Paper, which I have in my hand—Members will be
delighted to know that it is not my speech—was 
<?notus-xml column=478?>billed as the document that would answer all the questions on
independence, but it does not. Sir Peter Housden, the
permanent secretary to the Scottish Government,
must explain why taxpayers’ money was used to create and issue
that document. The Secretary of State, the Cabinet Office and the head
of the civil service should explain why they have maintained their
silence while the impartiality of the civil service has been

matters of the heart. My father was born in Lancashire, but my mother
was a Douglas, the daughter of a Scottish border farmer, himself a
border reiver. I am a product of the Union and I am intensely proud of
it. I do care about Scotland, even if I do not have a Scottish accent.
My closest relatives have farmed that magnificent rolling border
country for centuries, and are doing so today as we debate this issue.
My uncles, together with MOD representatives from the Northumberland
side, defined the border between England and Scotland along the Cheviot
in the 1950s. My uncle played flanker for Hawick, two of my cousins
played for Jedforest, and my second cousin, the late W. I. D. Elliot,
was hailed by <I>The Daily Telegraph </I>as the greatest post-war
Scottish rugby player, with 29 caps for Scotland. This is no foreign
country; this is where a large part of my soul resides. When I cross

2011 we have been told that the answer to every question the Scottish
people have ever asked about independence would be in the Scottish
Government’s White Paper. Given Alex Salmond’s recent

appear in its pages, too. The Scottish people were promised the New
Testament but instead had to settle for the SNP’s next election
manifesto. The truth is that Alex Salmond simply cannot guarantee many
of the White Paper’s promises and has completely failed to
answer many of the legitimate questions that have been asked of the yes

start in Gaelic, the oldest language of these islands of Britain and
Ireland, to say that it is a great pleasure to speak in this debate
about the day Scotland will be independent. It is tremendous that this
House has taken this opportunity to debate the vital topic of how
Scotland can join the world as an independent nation—how it can
be a full part of the United Nations and a full and proper member of
the Commonwealth, not kept apart and separate as a region of another
state, and certainly not knowing its place in the Union.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:10:59"></hs_TimeCode> ever a debate
had a title with the hangover of imperialism, it is this one.
Scotland’s place, like that of New Zealand, Canada, Norway,
Denmark and Ireland, is in the world. No country in the
developed world has voted against their independence, and I am sure
that Scotland will not be the first. It is an odd insult to Scotland
that here in Westminster every other nation is seen as independent but
Scotland is insulted by the word “separate” or
“separatism”. We will be independent like the others,

message is one of hope. Parents in the UK pay the highest child care

Scotland will dramatically improve child care. But we need the
necessary powers, and we cannot have financial leakage of fiscal
benefits to those in Westminster who choose not to fund this. It
happens in Sweden and it will happen in Scotland. Independence must
happen. We cannot have families looking at £9,000 tuition fees

£36,000 per child, with a family of three paying a staggering

the argument before giving my conclusion as to why I preferred to stay
in the Union. Like the hon. Gentleman, I started by giving a bit of
history. I did not quite go back to the Romans, but I did point out
that it was not until, I think, 1468 —it was certainly around
that part of the 15th century—that the northern isles came into
the Scotland we now know. The administrative construct of modern

is important to put that in context, because we are so often given a

millennia to some distant point in history and are told that if we do
not give Scotland its independence we will be denying it its destiny.

need to assess the risks as well as the benefits, and I hope the debate
will be calm and rational. When I first joined the Treasury Committee,
we looked at globalisation, and that is what we need to consider in
order to understand what is happening in business. When we talk about
what might happen to business, we have to consider where companies
would be best regulated. The financial services industry in Scotland
may well think that business would be better off regulated in a
different jurisdiction. We have 
<?notus-xml column=489?>to think about companies that have treaties with
other sovereign nations and may not continue to build things in
Scotland if it becomes a separate country. We also have to think about
whether people who wish to invest in the United Kingdom would go to
Scotland or elsewhere in the UK. I would suggest that the simple,
practical commercial decision for most of them would be to go elsewhere
in the UK<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:22:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The
benefits cannot be marginal and nor can they be uncertain. If Scotland

40 nations under that allied banner. I am particularly thinking of
Norway, with the likes of Joachim Rønneberg, the Telemark hero,
who made sure that Hitler did not get heavy water, and so prevented the
flattening of this city. It was not just about one nation, but about

do nationalists, whose philosophy is based on a belief in difference,
come to that conclusion? The answer is that 300 years of shared history
cannot be washed away or forgone. When Alex Salmond says, as he
recently did to James Naughtie, that he has a Scottish identity but
also a British one, it is testimony to that, whether Mr Salmond

Member for Penrith and The Border (Rory Stewart). If economic and
social union is to endure, as shown by the SNP’s White Paper,
the question becomes one about how Scotland’s political
interests are to be represented. The answer that Scots came up with
300, 400 or even 500 years ago was a Union. With John Mair of
Haddington in the lead, they came up, in diabolically clever Scottish
fashion, with a way to create a partnership between two countries of
very unequal size. When we celebrate Robert the Bruce and William
Wallace, we are saying that because Scotland entered the Union freely,
we created a partnership and were not

very Scottish way of putting it: the nationalists want us to have our

that by

and gain a good neighbour—that is important, because it
illuminates the nationalists’ view of the world—my
response is very straightforward: how can you be a lodger in your own

700,000 Scots served in the first world war, with about 150,000 losing
their lives. The Highlanders earned their nicknames—the devils
in skirts or the ladies from hell—at a battle in
1916, when the 51st Highland Division crossed a battlefield littered
with the fallen to storm German positions with such force that
thousands of prisoners were taken. At the end of the first world war,
the 51st Highland Division was widely reckoned to be the best fighting

me, there is nothing more stirring in a fight than the sound of
bagpipes. As the British United Nations commander in Bosnia in 1992-93,
I used my two pipers frequently. For instance, I asked them to play at
line crossings because all of us needed courage to advance through no
man’s land, especially as Staff Sergeant Steve Bristow had
previously been wounded beside me by a sniper. The sound of bagpipes
wafting through the air was an incredible encouragement to those of us
who were frightened. My mainly English soldiers loved the skirling,
thrilling and impossible to miss sound of the pipes. Once, there was
intense fighting all around my base at Vitez. I asked my piper, Lance
Corporal Cleary, to stand on the roof and make an impact. He did just
that. The fighting and the shooting died down quite quickly as that
tremendously emotive and martial sound echoed down the
valley.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000077">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:43:46"></hs_TimeCode>

identity, economics and vision. I may not have much

like everyone else who has spoken today from across the House, I am
proud of my cultural identity as a Scot. I would describe myself as

Ayrshire, Scotland, UK, Europe, the world, the
universe.”—<I>[</I><I>Laughter.</I><I>]</I> I recognise
that other hon. Members have done the same thing. That signified how I
have always seen myself, and how the majority of Scots see themselves.
We are passionately proud to be Scottish, but we also see ourselves as

6.5% in 2014, and 6.2% in 2015—but oh no it will not. It has
been told that under eurozone rules it must reduce the deficit to 4.6%
in 2013, 3.5% in 2015, and 2.7% in 2016. It will have to slash almost
3% off its budget. Consider what happened to Lithuania in those
circumstances: a 15% collapse in its economy, a 40% cut in all public
sector pay, and now it is struggling. We were there recently during its
presidency, and were told that 40% of all transactions now take place
under the counter without paying tax. That is the effect of the
discipline of the eurozone.</hs_Para>

those of us in the Labour movement, devolution is about so much more
than political accountability. I, along with 74% of voters, said yes in
September 1997. I had seen how our councils in Scotland had battled to
protect our people from the worst excesses of Thatcher’s
Government. Her plan, and we now know it was her plan to close the pits
and escalate the dispute, devastated my constituency. I wanted greater
protection from any future Tory Government. Just yesterday in the
Scottish 
<?notus-xml column=499?>Parliament, we have seen how that can happen.
Despite John Swinney saying that he did not want to let Westminster off
the hook and Nicola Sturgeon preferring a scrap with Westminster to
scrapping the bedroom tax, thanks to the efforts of Jackie Baillie,
Iain Gray and the Govan Law Centre, people in my constituency and
across Scotland are now protected from this inhumane measure. I also
want to give credit to my own local housing association, which has
found a legal way to protect its tenants. This is the success and the

explained to me that this was what happened to Scotland’s

sweetie papers since then, but what it cannot challenge today—no

civil service for its political ends and however much it seeks to

Europe and the sixth largest in the world. I believe that separation
from the rest of the UK would give Scottish businesses an unnecessary
barrier to trading with our biggest market. We know, without doubt,
that the rest of the UK is Scotland’s biggest market.
Independence would turn our border into a barrier for existing and
future trade. What sense would that make? The open border between
Scotland and the UK brings significant economic, trade and employment
opportunities. As part of the UK, Scotland has access to a
single market of approximately 70 million people.</hs_Para>

Treasury<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:03:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The UK
Treasury used £37 billion to bail out Scottish-based banks
during the world financial crisis, saving more than 400 RBS jobs in
Inverclyde. The evidence is that, economically and socially, the
Scottish people are better off being part of a Union that pools risks
and rewards. There is, of course, also significant UK public sector
employment in Scotland. Two thirds of all civil servants in Scotland
work for the UK Government. UK defence contracts are also essential to
Scottish industry. The Ministry of Defence has some 700 direct
contracts in Scotland, supporting thousands of jobs. We also have
cross-border private sector trading. Ease of doing business and
contract tendering are essential for bringing success to Scottish firms

Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:04:32"></hs_TimeCode>,
Scotland has an important economic relationship with the rest of the

facts speak for themselves: Scottish business buys and sells more
products and services from the UK than any other country in the world
combined. In 2010, 70% of Scotland’s exported goods went to
other parts of the UK and 70% of imports are estimated to have come
from the UK. That clearly demonstrates that Scotland’s economic
performance is stronger because it is part of a larger integrated UK
economy. Exit the UK and our border becomes a barrier: a barrier that
will impede and restrict ease of trade.</hs_Para>

where free trade agreements exist alongside controlled borders,
neighbouring countries with similar economies are affected by the
presence of that border. Analysis finds, for example, that trade
between the US and Canada is thought to be 44% lower than it could be
as a result of the border between them. It is not just business that
will be disadvantaged. Labour migration between Scotland and the rest
of the UK is also estimated to be as much as 75% higher in an
integrated UK, allowing the sharing of skills and knowledge. Leave the
UK, and we create an unnecessary barrier to trade with the rest of the
UK. That is why Labour’s vision for Scotland is about working

never hear from the Scottish Government about the fact that the
Scotland Act 2012, which was passed in this place, is coming into force

already has? In my city, people are desperate for affordable housing.
Why are we not using some of the powers we already have to increase

not thriving. We know that, at present, Scotland gets back from the UK
more than it pays in. In 2010-11, Scotland contributed 
<?notus-xml column=503?>£56.9 billion to the shared UK pot, and got
back £64.5 billion. What does that mean for Scottish

approach to the referendum is very simple. When we look at the great

see what kind of a future we can have with those great strengths. We
face enormous challenges too—we need to fight the poverty that
is still so deeply embedded, and we need to tackle ill
health—but the way in which to meet those challenges and
maximise that resource is to exploit the values that have built the
great achievements of the past, from the NHS to the welfare state. With
those enduring values, we can work together in partnership for a new

Let me begin by congratulating
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:17:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Glasgow North East (Mr Bain) on securing the debate and expressing
my gratitude to the Backbench Business Committee for selecting

is one of Scotland’s two Parliaments, and it is right that we
should take the opportunity to discuss Scotland’s future at a
crucial moment in our history. This Parliament makes key decisions for
Scotland as part of the United Kingdom in many areas: the economy,
defence, international relations and pensions, to list but a few. As an
integral part of the United Kingdom, this Parliament, and those within
it who represent constituents throughout the UK, make decisions on
behalf of the whole of the United Kingdom. However, this Parliament
also recognised in 1997 that some decisions are better taken closer to
the people, and it was through this House that the Scotland Act 1998
was delivered, providing real devolution of power within a strong
United Kingdom. That decision was revisited by the work of the Calman
commission in 2008, and implemented in the Scotland Act 2012.</hs_Para>

balance of powers between this Parliament and the Scottish Parliament
is a dynamic settlement, and will rightly continue to be so. The debate
on where that balance is struck is a debate that presupposes our
continued membership of the United Kingdom family, but the question
that will face us on 18 September is quite different: should we remain
part of that family, or should we become an independent
country?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000140">Choosing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:20:40"></hs_TimeCode>
to leave the United Kingdom would be a fundamental and irreversible
step. As part of the UK family, we have a shared history and share many
common values. As part of the United Kingdom, those of us in
Scotland—like people living in England, Wales and Northern
Ireland—benefit from the UK’s size and scale. We also
benefit from the UK’s international influence, and from its
economic strength.
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:20:17"></hs_TimeCode>, like
the rest of the UK, contributes to those benefits. We contribute 
<?notus-xml column=504?>in all manner of ways: economically, culturally and socially. As the
hon. Member for Carlisle (John Stevenson) put it:
together<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:20:31"></hs_TimeCode>, we are
truly greater than the sum of our constituent
parts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:20:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000141">If
we vote for independence, however, we walk away from those benefits.
Scotland’s future would be based on a series of protracted
negotiations with dozens of different states and organisations. Which
currency would Scotland use? How would Scotland join the EU, and what
terms of membership would it be able to secure? Would Scotland have to
join the euro or become part of the Schengen arrangements? These are
all questions to which the people of Scotland want answers. The
nationalists owe them answers, but so far they have failed to deliver
them. The truth is that all these issues would require detailed
negotiations to pull Scotland out of the United Kingdom family of which
it has been an integral part for over 300 years and to establish a new
set of international relationships. Independence is a 20th
century—or maybe even a 19th century—solution in search
of a 21st century problem. Across a world in which change comes at a
breathtaking pace, the prevailing trend is to pull down barriers and
borders, not to put them up.</hs_Para>

The hon. Gentleman gives me the opportunity to remind the

however, the issue on which we are all focusing is whether Scotland
will remain part of the Union. Let me turn to the question of currency.
It has featured strongly in this debate, and little wonder. The
currency that we use is vital to all of us. It is vital for individuals
buying food and paying off loans; for businesses paying employees, and
trading with one another and across borders; for our banks and
financial institutions; and, of course, for Scotland’s economy
as a whole. Last week, the Governor of the Bank of England, Mark
Carney, set out his views on currency unions in very measured and, as
he described it, “technocratic” terms. Governor Carney
highlighted the principal difficulties of entering a currency union:
losing national sovereignty; the practical risks of financial
instability; and having to provide fiscal support to bail out another
country. A currency union would involve giving up some national
sovereignty over economic policy. Why would it be in an independent
Scotland’s interest to join a currency

would expose the continuing UK to the risk of bailing out banks in an
independent Scotland if they were to get into difficulties
again—these would be banks over which it would have no control,
their being regulated under a different system in a foreign country.
That is why we have consistently said it is highly unlikely that a
currency union could be agreed, because it is highly unlikely that a
currency union could be made to work. No one should vote for an
independent Scotland on the basis that they will get to keep the UK
pound sterling. Independence means leaving the UK’s monetary
union; the only way for Scotland to be sure of keeping the UK pound as
it is now is to stay in the UK. Nothing the Scottish Government have

The poaching is undoubtedly driven by the illegal trade in wild animal

catastrophic for wild animal populations, some of which are now at real

our planet—elephants, tigers and rhinos—all of which have
seen disastrous declines in numbers in recent years. Three of the nine

may be just 3,200 left in the world. At least 10,000 are needed to
secure the tiger’s long-term future, but that is impossible
while they are killed for their organs and hides and their habitats
continue to be damaged. Some 1,000 rhinos were killed illegally last
year in South Africa alone, up from just 13 in 2007. Rhinos had been a
big conservation success story in recent years, but poaching on that
scale is putting their future in jeopardy. In 1979, there were
estimated to be 1.3 million wild elephants in Africa: now, there are
fewer than 400,000. In the last three years, elephant poaching levels
in Africa have exceeded 5% of the total population, and that is

communities at the mercy of criminal gangs. The impact of poaching can
be as damaging to fragile communities as disease. New evidence has
shown that countries with the highest incidences of child mortality
also have the highest incidences of elephant poaching. Poverty and poor
governance are the enabling factors for poaching. As MIKE—
Monitoring the Illegal Killing of Elephants—the United

some, the idea of placing an economic value on wildlife is anathema.
When I spoke to the Wildlife Trust of India, one member of the audience

As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:37:58"></hs_TimeCode> the Foreign

in ivory is funding terrorism. Al-Shabaab, whose attack on the Westgate
shopping centre in Nairobi led to the death of 62 people, may have
funded that operation with illegally obtained ivory sold on the black
market to buy arms, and with the price of rhino horn on the black
market now estimated at $100,000 a kilo, which is more than the price
of gold or platinum, it is no surprise that the most serious criminal

The Chinese Government’s destruction of six tonnes last month

provide protection for them—there is a sad truth here. Although
the population of elephants in the Democratic Republic of Congo, for
example, was once more than 100,000 it might now be as low as 2,500.
Every 15 minutes, only three times the time we have in which to speak
today, an elephant is brutally killed and butchered for its ivory
tusks. In 2013 alone, 40,000
died<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:47:17"></hs_TimeCode>. The global
population of tigers numbers between 3,000 and 4,000.</hs_Para>

aware of only a few days ago about two crippled old circus elephants,
Jenny and Shirley. It is worth looking it up on the internet; it has
been written about all over the place. The elephants met 30 years ago
in a circus. Jenny was a little baby, and the older elephant became
something of a surrogate mother for her. Jenny was eventually sent off
to a different circus, but 20 years later they were reunited—old
and damaged from the activities in which they had engaged in the
circus—in a lovely sanctuary in Tennessee. There are simply no
words to describe the obvious intensity of the love they had for each
other for their remaining 10 years. I am not even going to try to
describe it, but I encourage anyone watching this debate please to look
it up. Watch it yourself, Madam Deputy Speaker, and
weep<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:03:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

we should remember that these animals are being butchered for trinkets
such as toothpicks and chopsticks—nothing more noble, special or
important 
<?notus-xml column=516?>than that. We should remember, too, that between the
wilds of Africa and the mantelpiece, where these things often end up,
there is a vortex of violent organised crime, with much of the proceeds
funding terrorism. The truth is that when a consumer buys a piece of
ivory, they might as well be putting money in a collection tin for
al-Qaeda, or buying guns for Joseph Kony’s slave children or for
Sudan’s vicious Janjaweed. We have already heard about
al-Shabaab, which was responsible for the atrocities in
Nairobi—a massacre funded by blood ivory.

tempted to imagine that this is not an issue for us, let them at least

week we can take a giant step towards resolving this issue, or at least
beginning to resolve it. We know that it is possible. As we have heard,
the world nearly put an end to the international ivory trade when it
was banned in 1989. Poaching did not end, but it dropped off
dramatically and the black market ivory prices slumped. Then, of
course, we had the one-off sales and the black market roared back into
action. It was stimulated by the existence of the legitimate market and
was able to flourish under the disguise of the legal trade. According
to the formidable Will Travers, who has already been cited three times
today and is sitting up in the Gallery with his daughter, more elephant
tusks were seized in 2011 than in any year since the
ban<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:05:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000222">As
world leaders convene in London next week, we know what needs to be
done: an international ban on all forms of ivory trade, and that cannot
be achieved without China. The good news is that things are beginning
to happen. The country’s largest online marketplace,
Taobao—the equivalent of eBay—has banned a very wide
range of wildlife products, including ivory. That suggests a change in
the culture of Chinese consumers, with a bit of help from the
magnificent International Fund for Animal Welfare, which has been
campaigning there. The Chinese Government also destroyed 33 tonnes of
ivory, but the state itself still owns 30 ivory carving factories. The
simple fact remains that unless they turn their attention to the legal
trade, the extinction of elephants will be assured. That has to be a
prime focus at the
summit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:06:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000223">My
final point relates to the African elephant action plan, which has
already been discussed at some length, so I will be brief. It is
supported by all 38 African elephant range states, which I think is a
first. I am pleased to see that the Minister for Government Policy will
be responding to the debate, and I ask him to note that 126 Members
have signed an early-day motion calling on the Government to use
Department for International Development funds to ramp up support for
the plan. It requires £200 million over 10
years— £20 million per year—and, in the
context of our aid budget and that of other countries, that is a
reasonable price to pay, given the benefits it would bring to people
and, as we have heard, to nature. I am not suggesting that we go it
alone, but we can take the lead, as we are already doing. The condition
would be unanimous support for at least a 10-year

have spoken passionately about the ivory trade—it is a real
issue—but I want to highlight briefly some lesser known, but
equally important, areas of wildlife crime. Vultures in southern Africa
are on the brink of extinction because of the use of carbofuran, a
poison that poachers use when they have slaughtered an elephant or
rhino in order to expressly kill vultures whose presence gives away
their
crime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000230">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>
birds around the world are threatened by the use of illegal poisons, as
well as by shooting, and we should remember that this country also has
a problem with wildlife crime against raptors. In particular, I make no
apology for reminding the House about the fate of the hen harrier in
our own uplands. Last year, the Law Commission recognised that the
liability for bird of prey persecution needs to be extended, through a
legal concept known as vicarious liability, to landowners who allow
their gamekeepers to use illegal techniques. I hope our Government are
at least looking carefully at that
recommendation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:09:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
Bird of prey persecution is a serious organised crime and I think that
the responsibility for leading the enforcement responses should lie
with the National Crime Agency, with the national wildlife crime unit
providing intelligence
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000231">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>
want to draw the House’s attention to the poaching of saiga
antelopes for their horns. Saiga antelopes are unusual and rather
enigmatic creatures. For those who do not know what they are, they look
like antelopes with huge swollen snouts, and only the males grow horns.
After the ban on rhino horn in 1993, saiga horn became a substitute in
traditional Chinese medicine, and their numbers in their native central
Asian steppes declined alarmingly—down by 95% by 2000. There has
since been a slight increase in their numbers, but they need protection
as they again face
pressure<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:10:21"></hs_TimeCode> from
poaching. We all know about the threat to the tiger population, and
that iconic species is pretty near the top of my priorities, but we
have to remember the less glamorous but no less important species

is our duty, as it was that of previous generations, to preserve the
natural world and all its wonders for our children and
grandchildren who will follow us, but given how disastrous a
year 2013 was for rhino populations—the number of animals
poached in South Africa was the highest for some years—it has
become clear that such a legacy is under threat. Like other hon.

unassuming—they just get on with their lives.
According<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:12:14"></hs_TimeCode> to
reports from the Wildlife Conservation Society, more than 1,600 rhinos
have been poached for their horns during the past two years, and it is
estimated that only 5,000 black rhinos are alive in the
wild.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000236" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000236">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:12:06"></hs_TimeCode>
the toll taken by poaching on animal populations and biodiversity is
undoubtedly its worst effect, many other aspects of the crime affect
the human population, both internationally and locally.

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:12:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) mentioned, the terrible
assault in the Nairobi mall last year, in which 67 people were killed,
was carried out by the militant terrorist group al-Shabaab. The charity
the Elephant Action League estimates that 40% of al-Shabaab’s
funds come directly from the ivory trade. It therefore follows that the
illegal trade in rhino horn contributes to some of its revenue. The UN
Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, has recently highlighted the link
between poaching and terrorism, alleging that even al-Qaeda benefits
from the
trade.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000237">More<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:13:18"></hs_TimeCode>
generally, the increase in poaching is of concern from the perspective
of international development. It is well documented that guerrilla
organisations, such as the Lord’s Resistance Army, have
supported themselves financially by poaching. We are all aware of the
horrendous practices that Joseph Kony and his army have wreaked on the
people of central African states, taking children from their families
and abducting, raping and disfiguring countless women. It is therefore
reasonable to assume that if there was better wildlife policing in such
areas, poaching could be reduced and such atrocities might become less
frequent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000238">I
believe that
poaching<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:13:59"></hs_TimeCode> is a
surmountable social evil. Nevertheless, given that the number of rhinos
killed by poachers is 1,000% higher than it was at the start of the
century, it seems that measures other than policing strategies and
surveillance are needed to prevent poaching. The high value of rhino
horns, elephant tusks and other 
<?notus-xml column=519?>animal parts means that poachers now use helicopters
to get in and out very quickly, before gamekeepers can find them. The
fact that they can get in and out so easily is a major problem, because
the money they make from poaching represents what they might earn in
six years in a normal job, if indeed they have one. The value of the
horn is a huge problem. We will not stop the demand for it, but we must
tackle the root of the problem, which is poverty. We could mitigate the
impact of rhino poaching not only on the species itself, but on the
human population in the areas that are
affected<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:15:07"></hs_TimeCode>.
Misinformation about the medicinal properties of rhino horn does not
help. I think that it was the President of Sri Lanka who said that the
powder from the horn had cured his cancer. That is not only wrong, but
it perpetrates the
myth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000239">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:15:23"></hs_TimeCode>
must not be complacent and think that poaching is confined to far-away
countries. I was shocked to learn that rhinos in British zoos have been
threatened by poaching when I met Damian Aspinall, the chairman of the
Aspinall Foundation and the owner of Port Lympne wild animal park. The
Aspinall Foundation does wonderful conservation work. In 2012, it
collaborated with DHL, the logistics company, to introduce three of
Lympne park’s black rhinos into the protected environment on the
reserve of Tony Fitzjohn in Tanzania. Eventually, they will be released
into the
wild<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:16:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000240">I
was shocked to learn that in March last year, staff at Lympne park were
notified that an attempt would be made on the rhinos in the park.
Although it may seem perplexing and even slightly ridiculous that such
an attempt would be made in this country, it is sadly not as unlikely
or rare as it sounds. In 2012, the national wildlife crime unit issued
a warning to all British zoos, encouraging them to increase security
measures to prevent such
crimes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000241" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000241">Mr<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:16:33"></hs_TimeCode>
Aspinall discussed with me the extreme lengths to which some game
reserves are going to protect their rhinos. In 2013, the Sabi Sand game
reserve in South Africa began injecting its rhinos’ horns with
parasites. That has no effect on the rhinos, but when the rhino horn is
ingested in medicine, it can cause serious illness to the consumer. Mr
Aspinall rightly thinks that there must be a better way to tackle the
problem, because the consumer buys the product in good
faith—stupidly, perhaps, but in good faith—and the poison
might unintentionally have a more serious
effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000242" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0003.htm#14020668000242">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:17:20"></hs_TimeCode>
is important that pressure is brought to bear on countries that import
rhino horn to stop the trade and for Governments to assist zoos in
their countries to keep the animals
safe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:17:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
delighted that Prince William is helping to raise awareness of the
plight of rhinos by joining a charity. His interest will make even

security and anti-terrorism efforts, and because of the effects that
this awful trade has on communities in the affected

linked almost exactly with the collapse of the country’s fish
stocks, and the same now seems to be happening in Senegal,
where 50,000 fishermen have warned their Government that if foreign
vessels continue to deplete their oceans, they will adapt as the Somali

beautifully in the speeches made, but one did not emerge and everyone
in the Chamber is conscious of it: the appendix II countries are
prohibited from further sale only up to 2017 and, as we saw from the

participation in trying to solve this problem, an issue that has come

for the first time, established the right kind of machinery, with the

just any old ministerial group; it is chaired by the Foreign Secretary,
and relevant Secretaries of State serve on it. We are systematically
going through all the issues that emerge, and it is out of that group
that the idea of the international conference was carried forward by
the Government. Many hon. Members have rightly paid tribute to His

return to the issue of the international conference towards the end of
my remarks. The great bulk of the Environmental Audit
Committee’s recommendations have already been responded to
positively. That is the case, above all, on the funding for the unit in
the Home Office and, indeed, the recreation of an internet monitoring
post within that unit. I take the point made by several of my hon.
Friends, the Chairman of the Committee and the Opposition spokesman,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:47:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brent North (Barry Gardiner), that the unit needs to be a permanent
feature of the scene. I am personally committed to that view, although
I cannot commit the next Chancellor of the
Exchequer to it. I do not know who that is going to
be, although I very much hope it will be the current one, but I cannot
commit 
<?notus-xml column=528?>whoever that is to what happens post-2016, nor can
anybody else in this House yet. However, I can certainly say that
wherever I am sitting in this House and whatever I am doing at that
time, I shall be arguing for a continuation of that unit. I rather
suspect, having listened to the remarks made by hon. Members from
across the House, that that is a matter of some consensus, so I guess
that whoever is in the next Government will continue that unit, and I
certainly think they need to do so.</hs_Para>

great many questions have been asked about the consolidation of the

everybody in the House will be aware, the Law Commission intends to
complete its work by the summer, and it would be an impertinence for me
to say anything further than that that is what we have been told. I can
certainly give the Opposition spokesman the undertaking that once it

good deal of attention to that, and it is part of the red tape

the red tape challenge, and one part of that is the consolidation of
these regulations. We intend to pursue that. I am applying some gentle
pressure on my colleagues in DEFRA to proceed with that at pace and I
hope that we will be able to issue a consultation paper in the spring.
I fully intend that we should complete the process by Christmas. I can
therefore give the undertaking that the Opposition spokesman
seeks—that we will seek to complete the process by the end of
this
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000300" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0004.htm#14020668000300">It
is also strikingly important that we continue to work on these issues
of domestic enforcement and regulation across all Departments. As my
hon. Friends and Opposition Members have said, every Department of
state has to participate in that effort in different ways. The point of
the inter-ministerial group is to ensure that
happens.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000301" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0004.htm#14020668000301">I
turn now to the international conference, the international leadership
that this country is demonstrating and the question of what we hope to
achieve. My hon. Friend the Member for Richmond Park, in a
characteristically charming and vivid presentation, rightly
said—echoed by others—that we should not assume that a
conference is enough. Of course it is not, and nor would be a series of
conferences, although incidentally I hope that the conference will
become an institution and happen year after year, in parallel with the
CITES conferences of parties. Nevertheless, the conference can, if we
are both lucky and active, become a major watershed. We can achieve
things by ending the conference with some clear statements of ambition
and intention on the part of the very wide set of countries attending.
It is not a conference of a few countries—many are coming and at
very senior levels.</hs_Para>

seeking to achieve? As several hon. Members have said, there are three
parts to this and I shall dwell briefly on each. The first is better
enforcement, 
<?notus-xml column=529?>which has to be done on a global scale. We are contributing
significantly to what I might call the war effort. My hon. Friend the
Member for North Thanet described the extraordinary courage of some of
the people involved in enforcement. It is not an easy thing to
do—I think someone mentioned that around 1,000 law enforcement
officers in this area have been killed. It is not a pleasant kind of
policing. It requires money, political will and activity on the ground.
We very much hope that the conference will bring together all those
elements and take us forward into a better, more permanent enforcement,
which should also include the permanency of limitations or bans on
trade. That is what we want to
see.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0004.htm#14020668000303">To
make that work, the two other elements have to be in place. I was
gratified that I was unable to discern any disagreement between hon.
Members on either side on this point. We have simultaneously to achieve
some significant and lasting reduction on the pull
side—demand—and a serious-minded, sustainable alternative
for indigenous populations that rely at present on this trade, in one
way or another, for a large part of their income, with all the ghastly
consequences that have been so well sketched by many hon. Members
today.</hs_Para>

of demand reduction is extraordinarily sensitive, especially for us,
because it is not in the UK that the demand exists. It is not for us to
lecture other countries about how to conduct their affairs, as that
would not be right or productive, but we do have to show some
leadership. We hope to work with other countries that are demonstrating
increasing concern in this field and come up with solutions acceptable
to countries where the demands are greatest and that therefore can be
sustainable. I certainly do not want to prejudge how that will
look—we are not in a position to do so—and I am sure that
this conference will not be the end, but will be the beginning of a
process that leads us there. I am very hopeful that over the course of
the next few years we will get to the point where, by one means or
another, demand reduction is baked into the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:55:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0004.htm#14020668000305">That
brings us to the most difficult and most important thing of all: the
provision of sustainable alternatives. Many years ago
my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:55:40"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Richmond Park and I found ourselves in Brazil talking
about the Amazon with the amazing Mr Unger, then Minister for
the Amazon, who I think rejoices in being the only Minister for the
Amazon who was also a leading Harvard political theorist—and, I
may say, a leading Harvard political theorist who would be a delight to
the father of the current Leader of the Opposition and who disagrees
with me on just about every aspect of political philosophy I have ever
come across. Nevertheless, the Brazilians were serious in this pursuit
and my hon. Friend and I were there to work with them on that question,
and to understand better what they were up to. The point Mr
Unger made repeatedly and very effectively to us was that it is all
very well telling the population in the Amazon that they cannot cut
down so many trees, but the truth is that that is how they feed
themselves and unless we offer an alternative route to their feeding
themselves and leading a halfway decent life, we cannot expect them to
stop. The same is true in other
contexts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0004.htm#14020668000306">There
are two routes to the achievement of what we seek. One is the route of
trying to find alternatives—other

right hon. Friend the Member for Arundel and South Downs, is to find a
way of placing a value on the living animals and offering an economic
prospect for those who help the living animals to live rather than
causing them to die. We need to go through both those routes and we
need to try to forge an international consensus about how to carry
those goals forward, which also will involve money, which is why I so
welcome the fact that this Government have upped the ante by giving a
total of, I think, £18 million in this domain. It is part of the
Darwin initiative, and because of our immense commitment through a very
large and growing DFID budget we can participate and show leadership in
raising money around the world to deal with this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020668000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/debtext/140206-0004.htm#14020668000307">The
elements are all in place, therefore, and the last comment I want to
make is that it seems to me that we have an extraordinary opportunity
as a country. We are leading the charge in having this conference. We
are a country that has had a long tradition of involvement in this
area. We have the greatest stars globally that we can offer, namely the
royal family, up front. We have a clear vision of what we are trying to
achieve and we have budgets that can support the activity as well as a
co-ordinated approach from Government. It would therefore be a terrible
shame if we were not over the next two, three, four or five years to
make use of all of that and build on it to lead the world in solving a

excellent contributions from concerned Members of this House. I think

It is about what did or did not happen at the request of the
Information Commissioner. My reading of the situation is that it could
have been managed and handled by the health service ombudsman and
compensation could have been paid. In my view, the ombudsman sat back,
possibly because of the history to which the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=538?>has just referred, and thought, “It’s got to go to
litigation and that’s it.” When other avenues were closed
off, the ombudsman’s office could have managed the situation,

the case of Mrs Barnes and said that it had to go to litigation. I

Clive Betts</B> (Sheffield South East) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure
to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Sheridan, and to introduce this
debate on the third report this session by the Select Committee on
Communities and Local Government, on community budgets, an important
subject. To set the context, the Committee supports the concept of
community budgets and how they work in practice where pilots have been
established. It is fair to say that, as well as supporting what has
been done on community budgets, the Government were generally
supportive of the Committee’s recommendations. We all saw the
potential, in this economically difficult climate, both to save money
and to improve services. Not many initiatives have the opportunity or
potential to do both.
</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000010">I
will briefly sketch the Committee’s overall view and then put
some specific questions about remaining issues of concern, some of
which were raised in the report and some of which the Government might
not have answered as fully as we would have liked. I appreciate that I
might ask a lot of specific questions; if the Minister feels that some
of them are more appropriately responded to in writing after the
debate, I understand.</hs_Para>

budgets are not matters of great political contention. It is merely a
matter of exploring how we can make the ideas work in practice,
considering the obstacles to the successful further development of the
community budget approach, learning lessons from what has happened on
the pilots, and seeing how community budgets can relate to and work
more widely with local growth funds and city deals. I flag up the fact
that the Committee is now considering the London Finance Commission and
its recommendations for financial devolution to cities. Maybe that is
another element that will come into the devolutionary equation in due
course.</hs_Para>

the Committee’s findings, we felt that the pilots demonstrated a
clear potential for delivering cheaper yet more integrated services
that are better related to the specific needs of both areas and
individuals living in those areas. We recognised that to be successful,
they need strong leadership at the local level and from central
Government. We had one little worry: pilots tend to be in areas where
individuals are committed to making something happen, and strong
leadership tends to go with that. Will the leadership naturally be as
strong, and will it be the right sort of leadership, in other areas as
the scheme is rolled out across the country?</hs_Para>

acknowledge that there are barriers, often cultural barriers,
particularly in Whitehall, and the important role that secondees from
Departments have played  in helping to break them down. We
recognise the need 
<?notus-xml column=146?>for a clear framework, so that the costs incurred and  the
benefits, which do not always come to the same organisations, are
clearly identified and systems for accountability are in
place.</hs_Para>

troubled families programme, about which I will say a few more words at
the end of my comments, we recognise generally that progress has been
made. The Minister might like to update us further on the present
position and how many families the programme is now dealing with. We
had a few concerns about the future—the additional families
coming on stream in 2016 and what will happen
thereafter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000015">Generally,
the Government response was positive and recognised the need for a
wider roll-out of the principles behind community budgets—strong
leadership, support systems and accountability mechanisms—but it
used some new vocabulary that we had to deal with. Something called the
transformation network was referred to many times, and we are
interested to find out more about that organisation, body or network,
as it seems key to how the Government intend to take the scheme
forward. Another interesting organisation was the Treasury technical
advisory group, undoubtedly lurking somewhere in the Treasury across
the road, which will be important in helping move the scheme
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000016">On
specific matters, the Committee could see merit in having more pilots,
but ultimately we wanted a nationwide roll-out of community budgets. We
thought that that was important and that they have that much potential.
We want them to happen everywhere. The Government response supported
increased integrated delivery and gave a lot of examples of initiatives
and freedoms given to local authorities, such as the reforms of the
housing revenue account, which are not directly
linked to community budgets but illustrated
the resulting freedoms that authorities could
have—particularly if the cap were taken off borrowing, but I
make that point in passing before moving on to issues more relevant to
the report—and other forms of assistance that the Government
will give to help the principal approach of community budgets spread
more widely.</hs_Para>

it is about encouraging service transformation, if not through formal
roll-out of more measures that we would immediately recognise as
whole-place community budgets. What does a successful roll-out of the
principles actually look like in practice? How will they be embodied in
the delivery of services in our communities throughout the country?
Central Government support for the process is clearly key, because much
of what we want is about central Government services delivered locally,
in a more joined-up way, and by working in conjunction with local
authorities, police and other local services.</hs_Para>

that secondments have been important in the pilots to breaking down the
barriers that had often existed in Departments and finding a way in to
those Departments to make them respond more positively. We accepted in
our report that the idea of secondments could not be rolled out to
every part of the country—that probably is not
feasible—but we asked for at least a named official in each
Department to whom local authorities could go if they were experiencing
problems, delays or barriers, for help finding a way through those
obstacles.</hs_Para>

Government response discussed the public service transformation network
established as a way to deal with that issue: its role in disseminating
lessons learned 
<?notus-xml column=147?>from the pilots, its help with plans to transform services in different
parts of the country, and the appointment within it of account
managers. I presume that those account managers are very much the sort
of named officer or official that the Committee asked
for—someone in a Department with the responsibility to help make
the scheme work and to whom local authorities could go if they found
barriers being put up.</hs_Para>

questions about the transformation network, because it appears in many
of the Government’s responses. What precisely is it? What staff
are involved in it, and how many? What is its budget, and to whom is it
accountable? Those are important questions to answer if we are to
understand how it works. There is also a reference to its dealing with
22% of service provision across the country; what happens to the other
78%? How will it be dealt with? That seems fairly fundamental if we are
looking for a national roll-out. Will we have any more pilots like the
whole-place pilots or the neighbourhood pilots, or will there just be a
more diffuse dissemination of the principles of community
budgets?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020653000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000021">Co-production
is important. Community budgets clearly have financial incentives to
make savings and deliver better services for the same money. It is an
important catalyst for pushing service providers to better and more
integrated working relationships, but if that is to happen, central
Government Departments must let go and give their officials at local
level the freedom to engage properly with local authorities and deliver
things in different ways in different parts of the country. I cannot
help but throw in a little one by saying that the Department for
Communities and Local Government should be taking the lead, but when
the Secretary of State starts to direct authorities on how often they
should empty their bins—he will say that he does not direct, so
let us say encourage or persuade them, or comment on how they should do
it—or tell them how they should deal with their parking
arrangements, that does not create the best of atmospheres and is not
the best way to promote letting go and allowing local officials to
engage at local level with local authorities and to respond to local
needs. Is not it really the job of the Department for Communities and
Local Government to take the lead in a very positive, localist way and
to help other Departments to roll out best
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000022">Economic
growth is a key issue in relation to community budgets. We can see
community budgets, together with the city deal arrangements and the
local growth fund, unlocking the potential for real, clear public
service transformation to promote economic growth at local level. A key
element, in addition to improved public services, is the idea of being
able to work positively  at local level to deliver higher
economic growth. The  Select Committee will look at that when
we look at  the work of the London Finance Commission and its
recommendations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:40:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000023">Very
clearly in our report, we drew attention to the comments that Essex
county council made to the effect that in trying to work with the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, it had simply hit a
brick wall: BIS was not willing to co-operate. We raised that issue
with the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government when
he gave evidence and, to be fair, he 
<?notus-xml column=148?>said, “I’m not aware of this, but I will go back and look
into it,” and we had a very long response from the Government on
this point. What they did not do was answer the following questions.
Has BIS reformed? Has the brick wall been knocked down? Is BIS now
co-operating properly? That is what we want it to do. It is one thing
to list a load of initiatives; it is another thing to say, “Is
that Department really signed up to the process, or is it going through
the motions?” Community budgets will not work in the end unless
there is real enthusiasm, and not merely within the Department for
Communities and Local Government. Despite my little aside about the
Secretary of State a few minutes ago, I accept that Ministers in that
Department want this to work, but I am not always sure that all their
colleagues or, indeed, all the civil servants in other Departments
necessarily want it to
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000024">Joining

mentioned in their response the better care fund and the important role
that health and wellbeing boards will have to play in trying to join up
and integrate services. Do we see any evidence in delivery on the
ground that the health and wellbeing boards and the new public health
role of local government are starting to shift the approach from
reactive to proactive? On the better care fund, do we have evidence
that the NHS trusts really mean to co-operate to make things happen, or
will they sit there and say, “This is health money. We want to
spend it in a way that we

leads me on to data and information sharing. I remember when the Select
Committee did our inquiry into the transfer of public health to local
government. We were very supportive, considering it to be one of the
very positive localist things that the Government had done. When
Baroness Hanham gave evidence to the Committee, we noted the honesty
with which she said, “These two Departments”—CLG
and Health—“have different cultures and information
systems, and there are real challenges and problems in breaking those
barriers down and getting proper and full co-operation.” In
their response, the Government pointed out that to access the money
available through the better care fund, there had to be clear
indications at local level that data and information sharing had been
properly addressed. As we approach the beginning of the next financial
year, does the Minister have any information on whether progress has
been
made?<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:44:08"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000026">I
was pleased that the Government seemed to recognise that data and
information sharing is a potential problem. The Secretary of State was
quite open in saying to the Committee that he thought that, very often,
there were no real legal obstacles to data and information sharing;
there was just a presumption that people could not do it. It was more a
matter of culture and belief than a  real obstacle, so the
development of the network of What Works centres, the work of the
transformation network and the efforts to get local authorities and
central Government Departments to set up a centre of excellence for
information and data sharing are all very welcome, because they do seem
to show the Government taking this matter very seriously. There is also
the Treasury technical advisory group and its role in exerting pressure
to ensure that those barriers are removed where  they
exist<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T13:45:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

brief reference to the Cabinet Office exploring whether legislation
might be needed, whether the problems of data sharing are not just
about cultural barriers and perceptions about what the position might
be, and whether there could be some real legal obstacles to data

progress the Cabinet Office has made with regard to data

accountability is also very important. The Government response was very
much that, as we integrate services in a more specific way across a
number of different initiatives, the existing system of accountability
will be satisfactory. However, there was recognition, I think, that if
we move to pooled budgets, which I think the Government were saying was
still a little way away, we would need to have a fresh look at the
whole question of accountability, given that pooling local authority
resources with local police resources and Department of Health
resources will involve dealing with all the different systems of
accountability for that spending. We have asked the Public Accounts
Committee to have a look at this. Given that the Government have
recognised that a fresh look will be needed at some point, can the
Minister enlighten us on his vision of how a new system of
accountability would

on community budgets, there is the issue of wider financial concerns.

identified the problem that the body that makes the savings under
community budgets may not be the body that spends the money. Local
authorities can put a lot of work into youth services, but the costs
are saved in the justice system. Very often, of course, central
Government make the savings and local government spends the money. The
Government talked about the transformation network working to develop
locally based investment agreements, but the Committee said—the
Government did not really respond to this—that we thought that
Departments would have to provide some money up front if they were to
benefit down the line. There was not really a clear indication that
that message had got across and that the Government recognised that if
community budgets were to work—if we were to roll them
out—they would have to do some pump-priming. Indeed, we talked
about all Departments, not just the Department for Communities and
Local Government, recognising that and about having a cross-Whitehall
system for incentivising that process—perhaps a top-slice of
departmental budgets. I think that Lord Heseltine suggested that in his
“No Stone Unturned” report when he talked about nearly
£50 billion being put into local growth funds.
In the end, we got £2 billion from
Government —slightly less than Lord Heseltine had

rumours that went round—I do not always believe rumours, but my
sense is that there might be some truth in this one—was that
Departments were simply pulling up the drawbridge
and saying, “We’re not going to give any of our budgets
up to this process. These are our budgets and we’re going to
spend them as we want.” Despite the helpful responses to a
number of the recommendations in our report, not much was said about
the need for pump-priming and whether there needed to be a systematic

shall say a few words about the troubled families programme. The Select
Committee was supportive of that and we could see what the Government
were achieving. It might be helpful, as I have said previously, to have
an update on what progress has been made. We welcomed the expansion of
the programme, with 400,000 extra families being brought into it, but
questioned whether the increase in the number of families being dealt
with was being matched by a proportionate increase in the resources
made available. I am not sure that we got a full answer to that

there be any sort of follow-up system to monitor those families and
ensure that they do not slip back into difficulty? The Select Committee

does he believe that in the longer term, initiatives such as community
budgets, city deals—the Committee has been very supportive of
those—the local growth fund and proposals from the London
Finance Commission might together become a springboard for widespread
localism and the decentralisation and devolution of powers and
responsibilities to local government and local communities? Might those
initiatives, of which community budgets are a key part, come together
to form a brave new world—a rebirth of truly independent local

putting the matter in context. I believe there is a broad political
consensus around the community budget approach. The previous Labour
Government introduced the Total Place initiative in 2009 with several
pilots, and the Treasury produced a report in March 2010 that
stated:</hs_Para>

will work with consistently high performing places to develop a

places a range of freedoms (freedoms from central performance and

codesign services and arrangements to deliver greater transparency,
efficiency and value for the citizen and the public
purse.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14020653000039" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000039">The
previous Labour Government did some great things during their 13 years
in power. In the later years, however, there was a growing realisation
that although performance management had successfully improved
performance standards across local government, we had begun to see its
limits. A new approach was required in which local authorities could
take on a community leadership role and more effectively bring public
services together.</hs_Para>

merely a criticism of the limitations of performance management under
the previous Government, but a reflection on how society has changed.
When the welfare state was established, the Government of the day were
building services from scratch for many people around the country, and
they had to bring services together. There were lively arguments when
the national health service was founded, and some argued that local
authorities could provide those services, particularly in London, where
the local authority already provided a substantial number of health
beds. Central Government had to inject some real impetus behind
Beveridge’s proposals for the founding of the welfare state, and
they did so successfully, whether in health services, social care,
transport infrastructure or, notably, the building of
housing.</hs_Para>

changed, however, and local government is in a different position, not
least as a result of 13 years of increased resources and support, which
my right hon. Friend the Member for Greenwich and Woolwich (Mr
Raynsford) was particularly responsible for. The capacity of local
government grew over that period, so it was right to set out an
ambitious plan for Total Place. It is clear, and disappointing, that
the Government’s ambition for the community budgets programme
does not match the previous Government’s ambition and enthusiasm
for the Total Place ideas. There has been a particular focus on
troubled families, and I will address that in a moment.</hs_Para>

at some of the Select Committee’s evidence sessions, and I have
read the transcripts of others. The report demonstrates a clear
consensus that community budgets offer a viable model for public

second phase of the community budget pilots the Government have
announced, and it rightly warns—in the spirit of the remarks of
the Select Committee Chair—that the second phase of testing must
not be allowed to slow the momentum towards wider implementation. Many
areas of the country are already developing integrated models of

acceptance of the fact that local government needs more financial
certainty. It has been given a kind of certainty by the current
Government—principally, it has known that its funding is going
to be massively reduced. Local authorities with the greatest need in

more a year than the 10 least deprived local authorities, compared with

NAO report questions whether the achievement of the criteria for
success really means that a family is turned around. The families in
question have, by definition, complex and long-term problems. To claim
that they have been turned around by fulfilling just one criterion in a

Government in their understanding the nature of the families, the
experience of 30 years of very significant investment in some of these
families around the country, and the difficulty of genuinely turning
lives around. The single criterion could be having come off out-of-work
benefits into a job in the past six months. Families obviously must
have improved on a number of levels to make that a possibility, but
what is still unknown is the families’ longer-term fate and

to see how local value-for-money work, for example, could be a driver
of local public services working together. They also failed to see that
although we support combined authorities, city deals and other
initiatives that bring local authorities together with local public
service providers—initiatives that are at the forefront of the
community budgeting approaches of authorities such as Greater
Manchester—we need a system that follows value for money and

programmes, such as the major reform of probation that is now being
pushed through, and the Work programme, which was commissioned across
nine areas of the country. Also, following the abolition of regional

the debate—community budgets—and went into asides on
local government finance and other issues. I suspect that he had little
to say about community budget pilots because he believes we are doing

hon. Gentleman raised an issue in respect of which I must put something
on the record. I think he said that there had been increased resources
for local government under the last Government. I will put to one side
the question whether that indicates that he shares the shadow
Chancellor’s view that more borrowing and more debt is the way
forward for this country, even though that was what got the economy
into difficulties in the first place; I would not tout that as a good
approach. However, he was somewhat remiss in not reminding us that
council tax basically doubled under the last Government, hitting
hard-working people hardest.</hs_Para>

the country from this Government after being left with a black hole

come now to the serious and key point of the debate. There are some
issues on which we disagree—I will come to those
later—but on many we agree, as the Chairman of the Select
Committee said himself. Crucially, we agree about what we want to
achieve, which is a transformation of public services for, and better
outcomes for, residents. Our constituents deserve better and more
cost-effective services that are designed to meet their needs. As I
think the Chairman of the Select Committee said, we should be able to
get more for less. I agree, but at the moment not all organisations are
delivering in that regard.</hs_Para>

cannot be right that our elderly residents should find themselves in
hospital because of a lack of support to live independently at home.
Not only would they rather be at home, but supporting them in the
community and thereby reducing hospital admissions will save the
taxpayer money—exactly fitting the point made by the Chairman of
the Select Committee.</hs_Para>

by countless different public sector organisations, all acting
independently of one
another<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:16:56"></hs_TimeCode>. This
confused approach does not help family members to get work, stay in
school or stay away from crime, and nor does it help them to achieve
the right outcomes. It means that the costs of antisocial behaviour,
crime and unemployment continue to fall on the
taxpayer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:17:16"></hs_TimeCode>. The
family, and taxpayers, would be far better served if those

the Committee’s report highlighted, the pioneering work of the
community budget pilots proved that that is possible and is already
happening. Cheshire West and 
<?notus-xml column=158?>Chester’s early support team brings together social services,
police, probation, health and other services. Let me give just one
example. A young mother—let us call her Emma—visited a
children’s centre to ask for help with benefits and some family
support. Separately, she had called the police after her partner,
following an all-day drinking session, had violently attacked her. Both
these incidents were picked up by the early support team, and following
a 360-degree profile of the family, they discovered that Emma’s
partner had a history of domestic violence and that probation had
previously judged him to be a risk to children. By working together,
these agencies were able to identify quickly that Emma’s
children might be at risk.
Under<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:18:16"></hs_TimeCode> the old
way of working, the children’s centre would have known only what
Emma had told them, and she had not told them about her violent
partner. Under the old system, it might have been weeks, even months,
before family workers realised how at risk Emma and her children were.
That is not helpful and it is not right, and it is what none of us
wants to see.</hs_Para>

Historic breakthroughs have been made in data sharing by the Troubled

Barriers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:22:03"></hs_TimeCode> to data
sharing are as much to do with people’s perception of
legislation as the legislation itself. For example, the “Data
Sharing Act” might have been a better name for the Data
Protection Act 1998. In
working<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:20:27"></hs_TimeCode> with
fire and rescue authorities, which do great work in their communities,
we often find that we need to weed out mythical understanding of

In relation to long-term certainty, working together and sharing
budgets, does the Minister agree that there is a need for much greater
investment  in social care? Is thinking about that being done
in Departments? Investing in that would save spending further down the
track, by preventing people from going into much more expensive
hospital care or long-term nursing

about that being his last intervention; I would not want to curtail any
further insights. He does not make an unreasonable point. I will
mention the important issue of social care and where it may lead in a
moment; it is linked in respect of the better care fund, for example.
However, as I said in opening, it is true that if we can have a better
service up front, people might not necessarily need emergency and
hospital care. That would be better for them and mean lower costs for
their areas. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:27:39"></hs_TimeCode>The

areas are picking up themes similar to the ones the pilots picked up.
Each area has its own focus, depending on its circumstances and the
needs of its local residents: localism in its true sense. In
Bournemouth, Poole and Dorset, the focus is on integrating and
improving services for elderly residents and for those with mental

Lewisham and Southwark, and for the six boroughs within the West London

agree completely with members of the Select Committee that local areas
should not be held back or discouraged from proceeding with service
transformation. Much of that can be done without any assistance from
central Government, because it simply requires local partners to sit
down, forget their differences and focus on the outcomes for residents.
Partners in Staffordshire, Leeds city region, Blackpool, Tyneside,
Cornwall and Suffolk are getting on with plans to improve services for
residents, and others can do the same. Much can be learned from the
excellent work in Suffolk, where the county council is working with
district councils to share management and services. If there are
barriers, gather evidence and let us know. We have already shown that

the support they need to stay at home and out of hospital. We have also
established a network of 14 integrated care pioneers that will, like

welcome today’s thoughtful debate. We can all agree on the
critical need for public services to work together in the interest of

pleasure to see you in the Chair this afternoon, Mr

sprinklers have a role to play in our economy, our environment and our
social policy. I am secretary of the all-party group on fire safety and
rescue. Our chair, the hon. Member for Southend West (Mr Amess) is
here, as is our treasurer, the hon. Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous).
Other distinguished members of the all-party group are here too, as are
others. I place on record our appreciation for the Business Sprinkler
Alliance, which sponsored an event in Westminster last week to launch
the latest evidence on the value of sprinklers from the Building
Research Establishment and the Centre for Economic and Business
Research. I give special mention to Iain Cox, the chair of the BSA,
Andrew Turner, who is a great advocate for the BSA, Ben Ansell, who is
the Chief Fire Officers Association’s lead on sprinklers,
Celestine Cheong of Ogilvy and Ronnie King, who is a founding member of
the BSA and is the admin secretary of the all-party
group.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000121">I
will start by debunking some of the myths on sprinklers that are
perpetrated mostly by television, film and other media. Anyone watching
a television drama, an advert or a movie will recognise the comedy
value of all the fire sprinklers in a building going off and everyone
getting drenched. That is good slapstick fun, but it is just not true.
People have a misapprehension that that is what sprinklers do, when, as
most of us in the Chamber know, the heads of sprinklers all work
independently and will only actuate above a fire when the temperature
is above 68°. In the media, people just do not get to see the
value of
sprinklers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000122">The
second myth is that water damage from sprinklers is as bad as that from
hoses. Sprinklers use about 5% of the water used by
firefighters’ hose lines. As an ex-firefighter, I have seen the
water damage that firefighting operations can cause. Sprinklers totally
minimise that damage. There is a famous quote from a senior Minister
who, on visiting the scene of the Windsor castle fire, remarked,
“Thank goodness the building was not sprinklered,”
indicating the level of misunderstanding about sprinklers at the
highest levels of Government. In fact, as a result of that building not
being sprinklered, perhaps because of its historic value, we lost
£6 million-worth of national treasures. The third myth is of the
potential for accidental actuation, which could cause damage, but it is
calculated that the chances of accidental actuation are something like
16 million to one. The final myth is that sprinklers are expensive, but
anyone who has examined the cost-benefit analysis can quickly conclude
that that is simply not the
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000123">Government
have been nudging towards sprinklers for years. Wales has introduced
new legislation, Scotland has different measuring perspectives in
policy, and Governments have issued clearer guidance and stronger
advice, particularly in relation to schools—but all have 
<?notus-xml column=166?>stopped short of fully embracing sprinklers. Last week’s
evidence, which only relates to warehouses, made the case clearer and
stronger. The Centre for Economic and Business Research launched a
report last week that shows avoidable losses from fire running at
£1 billion every five years and 1,000 jobs lost every year
because of fire, most of which could be avoided. The research from the
CEBR and the Building Research Establishment shows that 135,000 tonnes
of carbon dioxide are released into the air annually from major
fires—equivalent to the emissions from the annual domestic
electricity supply for a city the size of Portsmouth.</hs_Para>

economic and environmental reasons for supporting sprinklers, but there
are also social reasons. Sprinklers minimise the risks to firefighters.
We have seen firefighters killed in buildings, particularly big
warehouses. Sprinklers protect the staff within buildings and provide
business resilience and continuity against buildings shutting down
because of a major fire. I know that colleagues here have experienced
in their local economies the trauma and difficulty fire causes.
Sprinklers minimise the transport disruption and local closures that
major fires cause. The protection they offer enables larger
compartments, higher occupancy and higher packing density in buildings.
They can lower fire insurance premiums for warehouses by up to
50%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000125">It
is worth comparing the regulations on sprinkler coverage in the UK with
those of other countries. In the UK, business premises and warehouses
of more than 20,000 square metres are required to be sprinklered. In
many European Union competitor countries, such as Germany, that figure
is 2,000 square metres, and in Scotland it is 14,000 square metres. Big
questions have been asked about fires in schools, care homes and tower
blocks, as well as the height of tower blocks. We saw the awful fire in
a nursing home in Canada last week, where I understand 35 senior
citizens died. Anyone involved in fire knows that the majority of
people who die in fires are the old, the ill, the disabled, those with
dependency problems and the poor. Those people deserve greater
protection. The fascinating thing about the Canada care home fire was
that part of the building was sprinklered and part was not, and the
part that was sprinklered is still standing, whereas the part that was
not is not. Most<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:44:49"></hs_TimeCode>
deaths from fire occur in ordinary homes, so it is good to see some
local authorities and housing associations taking action. In my
constituency, Tower Hamlets Community Housing is looking to install
sprinkler systems, in one form or another, to protect vulnerable
residents.</hs_Para>

on Government and I have a number of points to put to the Minister. I
would be grateful if he responded to them, and surprised if he were
unable to, because most of them have been around for some time and are
predictable, so he probably has the answers on the notes in front of
him.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020653000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000127">First<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:44:49"></hs_TimeCode>,
we should remove sprinklers from being classified as plant and
machinery for the purposes of business rates. If there is one thing
that the present Government want to be famous for, it is deregulation,
and as this is a deregulatory issue, it should be attractive to them.
It is anomalous that companies that invest in protection for their
businesses and employees are charged higher business rates than those
that do not. A fair comparison would be a local authority penalising
someone for putting in a burglar alarm. Removing sprinklers from that
classification and equalising business rates would be a good start. I 
<?notus-xml column=167?>am sure the Minister is looking at that, because for
every new regulation that he proposes, there is pressure on him to
demonstrate that there is one he can repeal. This one is a freebie: he
can take it and use it to argue for whatever favourite piece of
legislation he wants to
introduce.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000128">We
recommend that the Government review approved document B on fire safety
in the building regulations and that its locus should be expanded so
that the cost-benefit analysis considers the economic, societal and
environmental costs of fire, alongside current life-safety
considerations. That would move the goalposts considerably and would
ensure that the onus was on building occupiers and owners to invest in
sprinklers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:50:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000129">The
Department for Communities and Local Government should partner with the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills with the Business
Sprinkler Alliance to create an open dialogue with the business
community to promote sprinklers through enhanced understanding of the
benefits and acceptance of the technology. This is a matter not of
regulation but culture, and such a move would create the mood music.
The Association of British Insurers calculates that
£639 million in fire losses was paid out in the first
half of 2009 and £1.36 billion in 2008. The change would save
money for the UK economy, promote business and promote best practice.
If DCLG and BIS were to engage more effectively with BSA, they could
create an atmosphere in which sprinklers are more likely to be
understood and
accepted<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:50:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000130">We
also want the Government to amend the Water Bill, which is in the House
of Lords. Members of the all-party group, including me,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:51:05"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Waveney and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:51:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams), another of our joint
chairs, recently visited the hon. Member for North Cornwall (Dan
Rogerson), who is the
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:51:12"></hs_TimeCode> with
responsibility for water, at the Department for Environment, Food and
Rural Affairs after the Water Bill moved to the House of Lords. One
obstacle to the wider use of sprinklers, particularly in domestic
property, is that water legislation classifies the supply of water for
sprinklers as non-domestic, so water companies can attach conditions
that can increase the cost of connection to a prohibitive extent. The
water liaison group, which is a voluntary body composed of
representatives of water companies and from the sprinkler sector,
reached a voluntary protocol agreement in 2004 on dealing with issues
surrounding installations. The agreement was recently revised, and
implicit in it is that a small change is needed to section 57 of the
Water Industry Act 1991 to make water supplied for sprinklers and other
firefighting equipment connected to the mains a legitimate use of
water. That change can be made during the passage of the Water Bill. I
am pleased to say that the Minister with responsibility for water
accepted the logic of the argument and agreed to examine the matter. I
hope that the Minister here, the Under-Secretary of State for
Communities and Local Government, the hon. Member for Great Yarmouth
(Brandon Lewis),
will<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T14:59:12"></hs_TimeCode> reinforce

centre, a restaurant in Spitalfields and a superstore in Poole. I
have 10 pages of similar examples from the BSA of
businesses that had the common sense to invest in sprinkler systems and
therefore ensured that their buildings survived either an arson attack,
accident or failure in the electrics, and were able to carry on trading
because the fire was dealt with and the fire service only had to mop up
the situation and ensure that the premises were

am unsure whether the Minister has had the chance to visit Scottsdale,
Arizona, but it is a trip well worth making—perhaps he and the
shadow Minister could arrange one. When I first joined the House,
Scottsdale was the sprinkler capital of the world. It was the first
local authority to create a city ordinance that every building must
have sprinklers. The last time that I checked, only one person had died
in a fire in Scottsdale in over 30 years. Scottsdale is a community of
more than 200,000 people and is one of Phoenix’s five districts.
It is a big community where people smoke, cook and use candles; they
drink, and do all manner of other things—I am unsure whether
Arizona is one of the states that has legalised cannabis—and
fires do take place. Sprinklers have protected that community for
decades. If the Minister wants to see sprinklers in action for
residential purposes—the BSA’s big push this year is on
warehouses—Scottsdale provides overwhelming evidence for
sprinkler use in both residential and business
premises.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020653000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020653000133">As
I said earlier, Westminster Government, the devolved Assemblies,
competitor countries in Europe and others around the world are starting
to endorse, embrace and legislate for sprinklers. The evidence is
getting clearer, stronger and more compelling, but we need leadership.

the business community to ensure that the spread of sprinklers, which

importance of installing fire sprinklers was made apparent just last
week, on 29 January, in a small warehouse fire in Earby, Lancashire.
The four-storey plastics factory was set ablaze and eight firefighters
were called to the scene. Thanks to the factory’s sprinkler
system, however, most of the worst damage was mitigated and the fire
was stopped from spreading, even though the system was installed over
40 years ago and the sprinkler heads were 20 metres above the fire. The

small fire can cause a huge amount of damage to a property. Smoke

those housing providers to invest in sprinklers. We all appreciate the
burden of additional regulation on businesses and on those building our
care facilities, schools and housing, so we are not asking for more
regulation. I encourage my hon. Friend, however, to take the lead by

want to illustrate the importance of fire sprinkler systems with a sad
story about a factory in my constituency. The Findus food factory in
Longbenton, North Tyneside, was officially opened by the late Princess
of Wales in the 1980s. By 1995 it was providing jobs for 1,500 local
people. Over subsequent years, the business changed hands several times
and, sadly, the number of workers reduced by two thirds. None the less,
it remained an important employer in the constituency.</hs_Para>

2009, the factory had become Longbenton Foods, and the owners were
providing much-needed employment for 420 local people. The factory
remained busy, still producing frozen meals under the Findus
label—in particular, the famous Findus crispy pancakes. It was
one of the few businesses to continue to have a licence to produce
them. I can see that I have brought some memories back for a number of

a huge fire broke out in the main food production area. It took six
fire engines and 34 firefighters more than three hours to bring it

because of the fire alarm system, and no one was hurt in the blaze. In

others to minimise the social and economic consequences for the local
community. Longbenton Foods secured a grant of £3.4 million from
the regional development agency One North East to rebuild and reopen
the business. The factory reopened in 2010, and in June that year,
confident in its future, I paid tribute in my maiden speech to the
efforts of all involved in saving the business. However, by December
the business was in trouble. I worked with the owner to try to save
Longbenton Foods, but despite valiant efforts by the administrator, the
business could not be sold as a viable enterprise, and this time the

ultimate failure of the business could not be directly attributed to
the fire, it could be said that its negative influence in disrupting

its worst, the upset can lead to loss of life; at the very least it can

impact. Only 100,000 litres of water were used to fight the Longbenton
Foods fire, although often many millions of litres are used to douse a
single fire, according to a study carried out by Bureau Veritas on
behalf of the Business Sprinkler Alliance. That report showed that the

worst thing is that had the Longbenton Foods factory been fitted with
sprinklers, the fire would have been doused or controlled before the

lost, thank goodness, but hundreds of livelihoods were ruined. Another

to spread. It is important to pay tribute to our firefighters, who do
such a great job in hazardous and dangerous circumstances. We owe it to
them to reduce the risks associated with the work that they do in the
communities they serve. With fire authority budgets and resources
coming under increasing pressure, it is important to focus on
preventing and restricting fires, and making firefighters’ jobs
safer and easier. Fire chiefs and fire authorities up and down the

nearby residents, environmental impacts, problems with pest control and

size and use, the Wessex Foods building was not fitted with sprinklers.
Had it been, the outcome would have been completely different. The fire
would have started in much the same way, but a short time later the
sprinkler head closest to the fire would have operated and suppressed
or extinguished the flame. At the same time, the operation of the
sprinkler would have set off the fire alarm and led to a call to the
fire service. Firefighters would have arrived at the scene within a few
minutes, and would have entered the building either to extinguish the
small fire fully or to confirm that it had been extinguished by the
sprinklers. They would have been back at their fire station within an 
<?notus-xml column=174?>hour. The fire at Wessex Foods is just one of many examples that
reinforce the case for sprinklers to be fitted more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000016">Over
the years, many myths have grown up about sprinklers, and it is
important to dispel them. Myth No. 1 is that sprinklers are
always going off accidentally. That is untrue. There is a one in
500,000 chance of accidental operation through damage, and the chance
of accidental discharge of water due to manufacturing defects is one in
14 million. Myth No. 2 is that sprinklers operate when a smoke detector
goes off—again, that is untrue. Sprinklers are not triggered by
smoke; they operate as a result of high temperatures that can be
produced only by a genuine fire. Myth No. 3, that all sprinkler heads
operate together, is untrue. Most fires cause only one sprinkler head
to operate. If more  than one operates, that is due to the size
of the fire and the need for more heads to operate to suppress and
control it.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020669000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000017">Myth No. 4 is
that sprinkler systems use more water than firefighters. Once more,
that is untrue. A fire in a building protected by a sprinkler system
will be extinguished at an earlier stage due to the automatic operation
of the sprinklers, which will suppress and control the fire; in some
cases, the fire may even be extinguished before the firefighters
arrive. A single sprinkler head uses approximately 60 litres of water
per minute, whereas fires that develop and require the fire service to
respond will often result in 10,000 times more water being
used.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020669000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000018">Myth No. 5,
that sprinklers cause more damage than the fire, is also untrue. Not
only is less water used, but the early operation of an automatic fire
sprinkler system dramatically reduces fire, heat and smoke damage. Myth
No. 6 is that once a sprinkler system has operated, the occupants of
the home or business will need to leave for an extended period for
repairs to take place. Again, that is untrue. A building protected by
sprinklers will likely be returned to normal use far sooner, because
the fire will be smaller and less water will be used to extinguish it;
businesses are often up and running the following
day.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000019">Myth
No. 7 is that sprinklers are unsightly. Again, that is untrue. Modern
domestic and non-industrial sprinkler heads are fitted so that only a
small disc is visible on the ceiling, and plastic pipe work is
concealed in ceiling voids. Myth No. 8, that sprinklers are expensive,
is untrue. A full British standard-compliant system can be supplied and
installed in a new home for between 1% and 2% of the cost of the
building; that is less than the cost of fitting carpets.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020669000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000020">Myth<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>
No. 9 is that sprinklers cannot be retrofitted. That is untrue. Modern
sprinkler systems can be cost-effectively retrofitted, and that has
happened many times. Myth No. 10, that they are difficult and expensive
to maintain, is untrue. They are relatively simple automatic systems,
and have few moving parts. They require little maintenance.
Finally—I am grateful to hon. Members for bearing with
me—I come to myth No. 11. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I>
There is a whole football or cricket team of myths. It is untrue that
sprinkler systems are often subject to vandalism. Far more damage is
caused by starting a fire or by flooding a building through leaving
taps running and drains blocked.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=175?>standard for the intended

likelihood of a sprinkler going off accidentally is estimated to be

the myths that have grown up about fire sprinklers can be attributed to
Hollywood. Sprinklers all going off at once, and dramatic fires, make
good box office. “Die Hard” is the movie that gives the
worst false impressions. Surprise, surprise—it grossed more than
$140 million while “Backdraft” grossed more than
$152 million. Yes, the characters played by Kurt Russell and
William Baldwin in the latter film were real heroes, but we need a
system that would remove the need to send such men into dangerous
buildings.</hs_Para>

main benefit of sprinklers is that they are the most effective way to
get further reductions in fire deaths. Research shows that 80% of fire
deaths happen in the home, and that an automatic fire sprinkler system
in the home, along with fire detection, reduces the risk of death or
serious injury by more than 80%. Other benefits include protecting
buildings—fire suppression by sprinklers reduces fire, heat and
smoke damage; improving the safety of firefighters, through the
containment, suppression and, often, extinguishing of a fire, without
the need for them to go into the building; and an increased chance of
keeping a business in production after a fire has started.</hs_Para>

can also give flexibility to developers, architects and builders, by
making it possible to comply with building regulations in a

sprinklers are fitted, a business will usually be fully functioning
again within hours of a fire starting, and a sequence of undesirable
events will be prevented: business closure, with the consequent loss of
jobs, and the knock-on impact to the firm’s supply chain and
local businesses. Other businesses are often affected when there is a
fire—surrounding businesses must stop work during a major fire,

hon. Friend the Member for Southend West (Mr Amess) did. We
need to keep demographic change in mind. People live longer, and older
people are particularly vulnerable to the ravages of fire. They cannot
get out of buildings as quickly as young people, and those who suffer
from dementia face added challenges. The nation is encouraging older
people to continue living in their own homes, and that is right; but we

where at least 35 people lost their lives. In 2011, as we have heard,
11 people were murdered when a fire was started deliberately at the
Quakers Hill nursing home in Sydney in New South Wales. The New South
Wales Government subsequently stated that their objective is for all
care homes for the elderly to be fitted with sprinklers by March

do we want to come out of the debate, and what do we want the Minister
to say and the Government to think about? As we have heard, there are
three requests. First, the Government should generate a dialogue with
the business community, to promote increased acceptance of wider
sprinkler use. Secondly, fire sprinklers should be removed from the
classification of plant and machinery fixtures for rating purposes. I
understand that including them generates very little revenue, and it
creates a disincentive to protect commercial building stock, the
environment and society from fire.</hs_Para>

making the economy more resilient, and preventing unnecessary damage to
the environment. We need to promote their wider use in the context of
protecting and making better use of resources that are becoming scarcer

achievement not just for fire safety, but in legislative terms. Ann is
the only Assembly Member to have steered a private Member’s Bill

have her Bill passed by the Assembly. Mercifully, that provision of

sprinklers are valuable for many reasons. They stop the spread of fire,
limit the amount of damage, and often contain the fire to one room,
instead of allowing it to rip through a house or engulf a room. They
are good for the environment because they use far less water. On
average, when a fire is put out by a fire brigade, 20 times more water
is used than in a sprinkler system and there is no drenching of the
house. A sprinkler system works at the source of the fire and is far
more targeted, so that a fire is often put out by the activation of one
sprinkler.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000054">We
have heard that the current regulations requiring smoke detectors
should be sufficient. Many fire detection and alarm systems in both
domestic and commercial premises produce many unwanted false alarms.
That is usually because their design and installation do not comply
with the requirements of the Chief Fire Officers Association’s
policy on the reduction of false alarms. As a result, many fire
brigades will not attend premises that have had many false alarms until
a responsible person has confirmed that the premises are under threat
from a real fire, but that cannot always be verified, and valuable time
may be lost that could make the difference between premises and lives
being saved or lost. By comparison, false alarms created by sprinkler
systems are so rare that the CFOA has not even considered the need to
implement a similar policy for the sprinkler

About 13 years ago, there was a very large fire at a school in my
constituency and we ended up with 40 temporary classrooms. It took a
long time for replacements to be built and—would you believe it,
Mr Brady?—sprinklers were not installed. There was another fire
at the school in 2012. It was caused by lightning, so people could not
say, “I told you so,” but even after that second fire,
sprinklers were resisted for the new buildings. It is absolutely
incredible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000063">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:43:59"></hs_TimeCode>

education and was on hand to witness the trauma to the head teacher,
the staff, and to the pupils, who lost coursework, and particularly
such things as artwork, which cannot be replaced. That school was
rebuilt, again without sprinklers. It has just had a massive investment

myths that my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:44:02"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Waveney (Peter Aldous) outlined, which is
incredible. They were told that sprinklers could be set off and that
having them could be more expensive. Those reasons were reported to
council members to encourage them not to support 
<?notus-xml column=181?>the extra cost of sprinklers. I understand that the school was finally
designated as low risk, so it does not have
sprinklers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000064">Dorset<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>

flagship school in my constituency has sprinklers—the school had
about £50 million spent on it, and was a Building Schools for
the Future project, so I am very pleased with Lord Knight’s
recommendation—but this situation is not very helpful to the
fire service. It is important that people listen to specialist advice

is commercial property, and it has been shown that commercial property
of more than 2,000 square metres is—in financial terms, if

not having one. However, we have been told that one difficulty
encountered by commercial property developers is that water companies
have no duty to connect to a sprinkler system, which seems a bit
strange. We have been told that some water companies are much happier
to connect to sprinkler systems than others, and some put large

Water about its approach to the problem, and I was rather sad to find

meter leads to a reduction in water pressure, which makes the operation
of sprinklers less effective, but Welsh Water has found—this is
a sad comment on human nature—that connecting without a meter
leads people to steal the water from that supply. That is one reason
why Welsh Water was unhappy about going down that route. It suggested
that anybody who wants to build a commercial property and install
sprinklers could set up quite an expensive system involving a large
water store, a pump and goodness knows what. However, I still believe
that the safety of people and property would be best served by a duty

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:53:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Poplar and Limehouse have done so well, debunking the

is welcome that the trend in the incidence of fire fatalities has been
downward and has now been stable for some time. I congratulate the
current and previous Governments on that trend, as well as the fire and
rescue authorities that provide vital services. It ought to go without
saying, although I am pleased to say it, that it is the commitment and
courage of firefighters on the front line that save lives, minimise
harm, protect property and promote safety in our communities on a daily
basis. As other Members have done, I pay sincere and grateful tribute
to them for their

facts about the incidence of fire deaths and injuries and damage to
property resulting from fire are well documented and have been
thoroughly referenced by hon. Members in this debate. I will touch
briefly on some facts that I see as particularly relevant to fire
sprinkler week. I thank the Chief Fire Officers Association and others
for drawing them to my attention. In 2011-12, 380 people lost their
lives in fire-related incidents in Great Britain, 287 of them in
dwelling fires. It strikes me as apposite to remark that no lives were
lost in the UK due to fire in homes fitted with domestic sprinklers,
that fire injuries were 80% lower in sprinklered premises, and that
there is a more than 90% chance that a sprinkler system that is
correctly designed, installed, maintained and supplied with water will
control or extinguish a
fire.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000077">How
many of those 380 lives lost in 2011-12 could have been saved? How much
of the trauma of bereavement and tragedy we have discussed today could
have been avoided if sprinklers had been fitted? Without wanting to be
mercenary when talking about people’s lives, I am conscious of
the economic impact of lives lost, as my hon. Friend the Member for
Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane) highlighted exceptionally well.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:56:14"></hs_TimeCode> cost of each
fatality in a road traffic accident is estimated at
£1.65 million and each serious injury at
£185,000. As the hon. Member for Waveney pointed out,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:56:32"></hs_TimeCode> cost of
fire-related deaths and injuries cannot be that
dissimilar.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000078">Further,
sprinklers fitted in commercial and industrial premises can save
British business, as my hon. Friend the Member for North Tyneside (Mrs
Glindon) pointed out when she mentioned Findus Foods. I must admit that
I remember those pancakes. I am not saying I ate many, but I remember
them well. Sprinklers fitted in commercial and industrial premises can
save British businesses and
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:56:44"></hs_TimeCode>the British
economy millions of pounds of losses from entirely preventable fires.
Research undertaken by the Centre for Economics and Business Research
states that fires cause a direct financial loss to businesses of
£230 million per year. If that is combined with the job and tax
losses that follow a fire, we must clearly look seriously at the
business case for
sprinklers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000079">The
figures put a practical slant on any financial deliberations we make
about introducing precautions such as sprinkler systems. As a
relatively new holder of 
<?notus-xml column=184?>the shadow fire brief, I am still learning my way around the job, so I
have been travelling the country meeting councillors, fire officers and
firefighters, who have been universally keen to share their views and
enthusiasms with me. I have seen more fire engines in the last couple
of months than in my entire life previously. Sprinklers have been on
almost every agenda prepared for me, regardless of whether I have
visited a county, combined or metropolitan
authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000080">That
there is a case for sprinklers is undeniable, given the evidence about
reducing deaths and business losses from fire. However, as my hon.
Friend the Member for Vale of Clwyd said,
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T15:58:28"></hs_TimeCode> were
strong objections and opposition to the regulations introduced by the
Welsh Government requiring the installation of sprinklers in a wide
range of dwellings. The Home Builders Federation, the Federation of

expressed concerns about the cost of installation and the impact that
it will have on
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000081">Clearly,

Brown:</Member></B> I am certainly hoping to be constructive in my
contribution today and not to make party political points or to take an
easy option. I, too, suggest that we work together to see whether we
can overcome the obstacles and objections that are being placed in our
way. We need to talk about whether we need to ensure that sprinklers
are provided in all care homes, in children’s homes, in new
schools, in new and purpose-built student accommodation and, perhaps,
in all new social rented
accommodation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:00:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000084">Let
us talk about the role of sprinklers in the domestic
setting—whether we should expect in the future that more homes
will be built with sprinklers and they will become commonplace and
expected. Let us talk about whether the costs to builders and
developers could hold back the building of much-needed homes. Let us
learn from the experiences of other countries in introducing new
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:00:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
The starting point for that dialogue should be

know what the risk factors are and we have figures for fire fatalities
that illustrate the impact of that risk most graphically. For example,
those over the age of 65 accounted for 40% of fire fatalities in
2011-12—a period when that age group accounted for 16.6% of the
population. The figure of 40% for 2011-12 is up from the 2005-06 figure
of 35.6%, showing perhaps the impact of an ageing population, as well
as being a side effect  of more people being able to live
longer in their own 
<?notus-xml column=185?>homes. We know who the vulnerable groups who are more at risk of death,
injury and loss from fire are: they are in homes, in the lower income
bands and in more deprived
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:01:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000086">We
can implement our response to risk differentially, which may be one way
of achieving the balance between cost and benefit and getting the best
outcomes for the money spent. Requiring sprinkler systems in some
categories of new build may well be part of an answer, especially where
the installation of sprinklers allows cost savings elsewhere—for
example, through less costly conventional fire precautions and
insurance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:02:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000087">I
thought that it was important today to press this point, despite the
fact that I could not easily find a place to put it in my speech. There
are already very interesting and imaginative solutions to keep
high-risk individuals safe. When I visited Lincolnshire fire and rescue
service on Monday, I learnt how local partners are working together to
provide vulnerable adults with appropriate fire suppression devices,
such as portable misting devices. They told me about the success in
Humberside, where misting devices had saved lives—more than
once, a misting device had extinguished a fire for a vulnerable older
person.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0001.htm#14020669000088">As
a Parliament, we may not wish to make an assumption that the answer is
sprinklers always and everywhere, but I cannot conceive of a holder of
this brief, whether in opposition or in government, who would not
advocate practices that would save lives, save businesses and protect
economic capacity. In my closing remarks, I want to offer the Minister
cross-party co-operation and, indeed, cross-party talks to try to get
consensus on the way forward on sprinklers and to consider the
Government action necessary for both domestic and business properties,
because I think that lives can be saved, injuries minimised, damage to
property avoided and money saved if we have the will to co-operate and
the motivation to
succeed.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-06?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_06_PT_1/833926B3AB678603DF4DC791DBC0C33D111CF577" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="6 February 2014">Thursday

have been talking for many years about new firefighting techniques, and
it is great that we are now starting to see them really develop. The
coldcut technique has been around for a while, and is now being used.
Many services can learn from what is being done in areas such as
Manchester and Hertfordshire, where the technique is being used to
fight fires in a different, transformational way: not just to cut
through building materials but to bring down the temperature quickly
and deal with the fire before a firefighter has to go in. It is one of
the things that can lead to the figures continuing to fall, and that
can keep our firefighters

us be clear: in 2012-13 we saw the lowest number of fire deaths ever.
That is good, but we all want to see the number go down even further.
The number of fire deaths is down by one third compared with 10 years
ago. The latest figures, for April to September 2013, show that fire
casualties are down by a further 7% compared with the same period in

attendance at incidents overall has fallen by
46<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>%. That is in
no small part because of the safer environments in which we are all now

number of incidents and casualties has continued to fall in the first
two quarters of 2013-14. Many in the fire sector have at times argued
for more regulation to require sprinklers in domestic properties and
more commercial buildings. I note that many Members have stressed that
today’s debate is not about that ongoing discussion across the
sector. The Government’s position has been made clear a number
of times. Since taking 
<?notus-xml column=187?>office in 2010, the coalition Government have been very clear about
their policy on sprinklers, but I want to put it on
the record again. Sprinklers work. We know that. No one can deny it.
The myths around sprinklers have been well explained and debunked here
today. They are an effective way of controlling fires and of protecting
lives and property. That is why they are required, as hon. Members
know, in certain higher-risk premises, under building regulations, and
why all guidance that we make available to support compliance with the
fire safety order highlights sprinklers as an effective risk-mitigation
measure. It is right that it does
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020669000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/halltext/140206h0002.htm#14020669000096">However,
not all buildings carry the same level of risk. Those with
responsibility for ensuring fire safety in their businesses, in their

sprinklers—the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:09:43"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Member for Poplar and Limehouse mentioned business rates for plant
and machinery, and that the way in which sprinklers are assessed might
act as a disincentive to installing them. Special rules to remove
sprinklers from the rating system, outside the general principles
relating to plant machinery, might raise issues of fairness and
competition for all ratepayers concerning other building fire
prevention measures, so it is difficult to see how we might take that
idea forward. In addition, the Valuation Office Agency assesses
rateable values independently of Ministers, and it is answerable to the
courts. However, I take on board the hon. Gentleman’s comments
about sprinklers and building protection mechanisms, and I will take
that idea away and have a look at it. On cross-party working, which the
hon. Member for West Ham mentioned,
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-06T16:11:28"></hs_TimeCode> am happy to
discuss that and my response can be fed back to the all-party
group.</hs_Para>

are always calls for Government to change building regulations, and
that is often the default position of those who see regulation as an
easy answer. As Members have noted today, however, it is not the only
answer. We should intervene only if it is entirely necessary, and only
as a last resort. As many Members have said, the core aim of
today’s debate was not to call for regulation but to highlight
fire sprinkler week. Although we have not carried out a fundamental
review of building regulations for fire safety, we recognise that it is
important to maintain and update standards. That is why we have
commissioned the Building Research Establishment to look at a number of
issues and to provide the evidence 
<?notus-xml column=188?>that we will need in future. No doubt, the use of sprinklers will form
part of that work. We will ensure that experts from across industry and
the wider fire sector, including organisations such as the Chief Fire
Officers Association and the business sprinkler alliance, feed into
those discussions.</hs_Para>

tell us that someone is more likely to die in a fire if they do not
have a working smoking alarm. That is why the Department continues to
fund and support the “Fire Kills” campaign, which is
designed and delivered in partnership with fire and rescue authorities.
It is an excellent example of how awareness and education have
influenced fire safety behaviour by providing basic fire safety
information to households, in order to help them alter their behaviour
and think more about fire safety as an important issue that may affect
them and their families. I am pleased to see that the sector is
adopting a similar approach to promoting fire safety benefits, with the
creation of the first fire sprinkler week.</hs_Para>

all agree that a fire, whether small or large, can bring tragic
devastation and loss to a business, affecting its employees, its
contribution to the local economy and its ability to recover and to
continue trading in the aftermath of such an incident. Members have
given clear examples of that today. I welcome the recent publication of
the two research reports sponsored by the business sprinkler alliance,
which were undertaken by the Building Research Establishment and the
Centre for Economics and Business Research. Those reports considered
the environmental impact and carried out a cost-benefit analysis of
fire sprinklers in warehouse buildings, which is the key focus of
today’s debate. The principal conclusion of the research was
that sprinklers are, on average, a cost-effective investment for
warehouses that have a floor area greater than 2,000 square metres.
Businesses must determine how best to comply with their statutory
responsibilities in the knowledge of such information. Building owners,
housing providers or home owners must be aware that other equally
effective measures may be available, and such information may feed into
their decisions.</hs_Para>

believe that it is the responsibility of the fire industry, rather than
the Government, to market fire sprinkler systems effectively and to
encourage their wider installation. It is clear that fire sprinklers
work, and I am happy that the Government continue to emphasise that; I
do not think there is any disagreement about that. Fire sprinkler week
is an important part of the education process, which I hope will make
industry, businesses and individuals more aware of what is
possible.</hs_Para>

appreciate that there are differences of opinion about the costs of
sprinkler systems. I spoke to Nick Ross, whose view is that a sprinkler
system can be installed in a new-build house for as little as
£600, and the industry will be keen to make a similar case to
debunk some of the myths about cost. Research held by the Department
shows that the cost per house is still in the thousands of pounds. I
appreciate the argument that has been made about Wales, although no
houses have yet been built under the new regulation. The cost of
fitting a fire sprinkler system may affect house
building—something we want to encourage—so we must wait
to see what impact that regulation has.</hs_Para>

welcome the creation of fire sprinkler week, which is a good step by

undeniable benefits of sprinklers. 
<?notus-xml column=189?>They enable householders, housing providers and building owners to make
informed decisions about the fire safety measures that are appropriate
for their circumstances. That extends beyond personal safety to
property protection. The fire sector has a key role to play in helping
building owners to make informed decisions about the fire safety
measures that are appropriate for their circumstances. I urge the
sector to continue to engage proactively with representative bodies for
industry, commerce and housing providers, and to make the case for
effective and proportionate fire protection. I encourage passive and
active interventions in all areas of business and housing stock in
England. I wish fire sprinkler week every

updated its tidal flood risk mapping for the whole of the Cumbrian
coastline. This included mapping the risk from a flood with a 0.5%
chance of happening each year. Additional mapping was then created by
looking at the impact of projected sea level rise for the year 2115 as
a result of climate change. The resulting maps show the areas
considered to be at risk from a 0.5% chance of flooding each year now
and in 2115. These maps are available on request from the Environment

whereby a child, having expended all domestic remedies, would be able
to make a complaint to the UN Committee if they felt that their rights
under the UN convention on the rights of a child had been violated. The
UK Government believes that strong and effective laws are already in
place under which individuals may seek enforceable remedies in the
courts or tribunals if they feel that their rights have been breached.
Nonetheless, the Government recognises that ratifying the Optional
Protocol may add further protection for children in respect of their
rights and will continue to keep this under review in light of emerging
information on its implementation.</hs_Para>

company is within the scope of the Act depends on its ownership, which
can change over time. Therefore we do not at present hold a

Education. However, I am keen for girls in secondary schools to be
offered a wide variety of sport, including cricket. There are 135
cricket satellite clubs in England, offering young people the chance to
play cricket nine of which are exclusively for girls. Sport England has
also invested £7.5 million in the Cricket Foundation's 'Chance
to Shine' programme which helps to keep young people playing cricket as
they move from primary to secondary school. 191,500 girls were involved
in Chance to Shine in 2013 and 27,000 of these were in the

replacements for a number of powers available to deal with antisocial
behaviour. A total of 340 local and community bodies responded to the
consultation. Overall, 42% thought the civil injunction would be more
effective in tackling antisocial behaviour, with only 13% thinking it
would be less effective. We are continuing to work with the
professionals who will use the new powers, so that they can shape the
proposals so that we get the reforms right first time.</hs_Para>

Green:</Member></B> The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA)
does not hold this information. There are several reasons for this.
Before 2012 CICA did not record the specific crime of which their
applicants had been a victim. This was because payments are based
primarily on the injuries someone sustains rather than the crime of
which they were a victim. While an applicant had to be the victim of a
crime of violence, the specific crime generally had no bearing on the
compensation claim. Since November 2012 CICA has recorded broad
categories of crime but human trafficking is only currently recorded
where it is for the purposes of sexual

that where there has been a record of persistent under delivery of

competition in the market for land. The 20% buffer is intended to

Soubry:</Member></B> The redundancies for the RAF in Tranche 4 are not
driven by the need for financial savings; they flow from the Defence
Medical Services 2020 project (DMS 20) which has been designed to
comprehensively review the existing manpower requirement and ensure the
armed forces have the medical operational capability to support the
armed forces structures under Future Force
2020.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020676001459" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676001459">In
order to meet the DMS 20 requirement by April 2018, the RAF has
identified a total of up to 69 dental and medical personnel in this
fourth, and final, tranche of the armed forces redundancy scheme. For
details of these posts, including the maximum numbers to be drawn from
each specialism, I refer the hon. Member to the document which was
placed in the Library of the House on 23 January 2014

redundancy selection process in the RAF has yet to take place, and no
further information on the qualifications and/or responsibilities of
those who will be made redundant is therefore available. Neither would
it be appropriate to release personal data relating to qualifications
held. However, I am clear that we will retain the medical and dental
skills necessary to support our service personnel. The upper limit of
69 personnel represents the maximum possible number of redundees from
an overall eligible field of around 155
personnel.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020676001461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676001461">More
generally, we have made no estimate of the savings accruing
specifically from the redundancy and early release programmes
themselves, since they are part of broader work force reductions. We
estimate, however, that by 2021-22 we will have achieved cumulative
savings of some £23 billion as a result of reductions in service
and civilian personnel, and greater efficiency in the conduct of
non-front line activities.</hs_Para>

armed forces redundancy scheme, the recently announced redundancies in
this fourth, and final, tranche will be compulsory. However, eligible
personnel (by rank, branch or trade) will be able to apply for
selection for compulsory redundancy. Applicants formed 62% of those
made redundant in Tranche 1, 72% in Tranche 2 and 84% in Tranche 3,
although we anticipate that this percentage will be lower in Tranche 4
due to the historically low level of volunteers among Gurkhas, and the
fact that a number of specialist fields will face 100% selection,
meaning there is little or no incentive to
volunteer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020676001467" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676001467">The

we do not know which personnel will be selected, and it is therefore
not possible to forecast with any certainty the numbers of personnel
who may be made redundant within one year of reaching their Immediate
Pension Point (IPP). However, given the nature of the fields (ranks and
length of service) we are looking at in this tranche, we expect the

plutonium route to a nuclear weapon. Iran has not clarified how it
would use the plutonium produced as a result of operating the reactor.

Swire:</Member></B> We continue to consistently call for progress on
human rights, reconciliation and accountability in Sri Lanka, both
privately and publicly. During his visit to Sri Lanka to attend the
Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in November 2013, the
Prime Minister raised our concerns directly with President Rajapaksa.
The Prime Minister called for a credible and transparent independent
investigation into allegations of violations of humanitarian and human
rights law during the military conflict, a meaningful political
settlement with the North, including demilitarisation and full
implementation of Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC)
recommendations. We judge all of these to be important steps towards
reconciliation and lasting peace between communities in Sri
Lanka.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020676001564" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676001564">As
a result of our continued concerns, the UK co-sponsored the UN Human
Rights Council resolution on promoting reconciliation and
accountability in Sri Lanka in March 2013. We have made clear the
ongoing importance that the international community attaches to lasting
peace and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. The Prime Minister has been
clear that if credible domestic accountability processes have not begun
properly by March 2014, the UK will use our position on the United
Nations Human Rights Council to call for an international
investigation.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14020676000143" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676000143">Ukraine</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="14020676001565" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676001565"><B><Member PimsId="4836" UID="14020676002797" xid="898" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140206/text/140206w0002.htm#14020676002797">Mark

There was a change in the QOF business rules for the depression

unresolved depression at any point in their GP patient record were

of unresolved depression since April 2006 were included. As a result,
fewer patients are now included, thus reducing the reported prevalence

McVey:</Member></B> The policy recommendations in ‘The
Jobseeker's Allowance Skills Conditionality Pilot Evaluation
Report’ (DWP Research Report 768) informed the national roll-out
and mainstreaming of skills conditionality in 2011. Jobcentre advisers
identify and discuss with claimants their needs and then mandate to
what is appropriate. In England the Department for Business Innovation
and Skills funds the majority of training to which the claimants are
referred. To understand how the policy was being mainstreamed the
Department commissioned in 2012 a joint piece of research with the
Department for Business Innovation and Skills to assess how skills
conditionality and other skills-related policies were being delivered.
The resulting report, ‘Employment, Partnership and
Skills’ (DWP Research Report 830), was published March
2013.</hs_Para>

skills gaps or other barriers is key to ensuring that the support
offered to benefit claimants is based on individual needs. The
introduction of skills conditionality has boosted the number of
referrals to the National Careers Service, with over 300,000 interviews
taking place between August 2011 and August 2013. In the same period,
there were nearly 240,000 starts to training by benefit claimants
referred under this same policy.</hs_Para>

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI)
data sourced from the 2011-12 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses
disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD
equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income
measure as a proxy for standard of
living.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. Figures for the United
Kingdom are not available before 1998-99. Estimates for Northern
Ireland are imputed for the years 1998-99 through 2001-02, and included
in the survey thereafter.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>3. Net
disposable incomes have been used to answer this question. This
includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support,
income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and
other sources. Income tax payments, national insurance contributions,
council tax / domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from
incomes.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>4. Figures have been rounded
to the nearest 100,000 and percentages to the nearest whole percentage
point.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>5. Measures for pensioners are
generally presented on an After Housing Costs basis. This is because
pensioners are far more likely to own their homes outright and so
receive value from housing, without having to pay for rent or mortgage
payments out of their current income. So for assessing pensioner
poverty a before housing costs basis does not provide a good comparison
of living standards.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>6. All estimates
are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a degree of
uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these
will be affected by sampling error and variability in
non-response.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>7. The reference period
for HBAI figures is the financial year. For regional figures three year
averages have been used to overcome
volatility.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>8. In Households Below
Average Income, a household is defined as a single person or group of
people living at the same address as their only or main residence, who
either share one meal together or share the living accommodation. This
differs from a benefit unit (family), which is defined as a single
adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any dependent children.
From January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners and cohabitees) are
also included in the same benefit unit. A household will consist of one
or more benefit units. The figures above are based on
households.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter><I>Source</I>:</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>HBAI

to pensioners, some on the basis of age and low income, and others via
the pension credit means test. The table "Principal Passported
Benefits" gives details of what benefits are available, the relevant
administrative authorities and the qualifying conditions. I will place
a copy in the Library. (The Single Tier reforms reduce reliance on
pension credit in the system for future cohorts. Most of the benefits
in the table can be accessed without first satisfying the pension
credit means test. With respect to cold weather payments, the
Government has no plans to change the qualifying conditions for current

responsible for regulating the nuclear sector. I am advised by the ONR
that the increased radiation  
<?notus-xml column=390?>was due to naturally occurring radon arising from construction
activities at the Sellafield site. The increase in activity was
extremely small and within normal fluctuations in background levels of
radiation that would be routinely expected within the parameters of the
approved safety case. It was detected on this occasion because of the
sensitivity of the detectors. ONR are continuing their investigation as
to whether recent maintenance has affected the performance of the
detectors as part of their normal routine inspection activities. ONR
was satisfied that Sellafield Ltd acted in an appropriate manner
throughout the event.</hs_Para>

Sellafield Ltd of any financial implications attributable to the
reduced staffing levels on the Sellafield site as a result of an
