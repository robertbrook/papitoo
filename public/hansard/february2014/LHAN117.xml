into the issue, it is not as difficult as he imagines and that there
could be change. Does he not agree that equality has to start in this
House and that the use of the title “Lady” by the wives
of knights and noble Lords is discriminatory unless a title of some
sort is also accorded to the husbands of noble Baronesses and dames?
Either the title should be used only by those to whom it was awarded,

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I think the statement that
equality must start in this House is one which will be received with
surprise by a number of those outside. I thank the noble Baroness for
encouraging me to read Debrett’s for the first time. Having read
Debrett’s for the first time, I know this is a highly complex
issue. I recognise that the use of courtesy titles and titles for the
spouses of Peers—which are apparently legal titles, not courtesy
titles—has grown up over the past 500 to 600 years. The rapid
changes in the relationship between the sexes and in marriage over the
past 50 years have, of course, left us with a number of anomalies, of
which the Government are well aware, but we are not persuaded that it
is urgent to adjust them now.</hs_para>

within the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. I
understand that exceptions have been made for this in that Act and in
the earlier Marriage Act. The coalition Government and, I am sure, all
parties are much concerned about the weakness of social mobility in
Britain. I am not sure that we should spend too much time concerning
ourselves with the subtle finesse of social

that their husbands not only do not care but positively do not wish to
have them. I am aware that a number of wives of Members of this House

extremely complex. If we attempted to redesign it on a rational basis
this House would certainly not exist. Whether or not the monarchy would
exist is another question. We live with odd elements of tradition and

evolve. I doubt whether very many children of newly appointed life

Government gave detailed evidence to the Science and Technology
Committee on the issue of data provision in respect of clinical trials.
The committee made a number of helpful recommendations on the removal
of barriers to transparency. In our formal response, we set out how we
would work to achieve the aims of greater transparency. In the light of
that response, the Government are looking into the recommendations of
the PAC report on the stockpiling of Tamiflu and access to clinical
trials data, published in January. We will give our formal response to

a complete trial being published are roughly 50%. The recent EU
clinical trials draft directive will require all trials to be
registered before they start, and full results to be published within a
year. However, the regulation will be applicable only to trials
starting from this year. How do the Government plan to ensure that

Howe:</Member></B> My noble friend raises a topical question. The
industry’s trade body, the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry made clear, in its code of practice in 2012,
that companies are obliged to publish all clinical trial results within
a year of marketing authorisation and publicly register new clinical
trials within 21 days of the first patient being enrolled. That, of
course, is a forward-looking exhortation, but we are encouraged by the
fact that the industry is taking an increasingly responsible view in
this area by publishing data voluntarily, as demonstrated by companies
such as GSK, AstraZeneca and Johnson &amp; Johnson. We want to
encourage more companies to do the

Walton of Detchant (CB):</Member></B> The noble Earl has made very
clear the legal background to the present situation. He is fully aware
that if a drug that has been fully tested and shown to be highly
effective, and NICE has recommended that it should be prescribed to
patients, the authorities have the legal responsibility to prescribe
it. If, on the other hand, NICE has been given evidence to indicate
that a particular remedy is ineffective as a result of negative
clinical trials, is it equally incumbent on health authorities to
recommend that that drug should not be
prescribed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T14:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

perhaps the issue here is not the legal framework but the issue of

Government are committed to transparency in the area of clinical
trials. Transparency is important for patients, the public, researchers
and the NHS, and it can be achieved through ensuring trial registration
and outcome publication, as well as making data available through the
appropriate channels. I think that the new EU regulation will be
extremely helpful in promoting transparency, and the availability of
summaries of all trials and clinical study reports will be a part of
that regulation. However, I take my noble friend’s point about a
simple guide for the public and I will gladly consider

question raised by the noble Baroness,
Lady<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T14:51:06"></hs_TimeCode> Brinton.
Once a medicine goes off patent it can, through generic production,
remain available to members of the public for many years. The evidence
seems to be that trials that give a favourable verdict are twice as
likely to be published as trials giving unfavourable results. Could the
noble Earl focus a little more on whether the industry can be
encouraged to produce evidence around those trials in relation to
current medicines as well as future ones? I also refer noble Lords to
my health interest in the

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, it is important to point out that the MHRA
does not have evidence that there is systematic or large-scale
withholding of data. However, it has investigated cases in the past
where clinical trials and safety data were not properly reported. The
Government believe that the proposals included in the new EU clinical
trials regulation will, as I said, contribute 
<?notus-xml column=706?>to greater transparency in the area of clinical trials. It must be
remembered that any company infringing even the current rules can lay
itself open to some very severe
penalties.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/1A1B4000627284B23D24A941679933E9011625E7" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 February 2014">Monday,

necessary to avoid folate levels exceeding recommended limits and to

In reply to my question, he just said that I was a bit premature in
asking whether it could be put in brown bread as well as white. Really,
the facts have been established that in order to have an overdose you

and Immunisation, the independent expert committee that advises the
Government on immunisation matters, has not yet made a final
recommendation about the use of the meningococcal B vaccine, Bexsero.
The JCVI is due to report in March 2014, having reviewed additional

Turnberg (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for that response. Meningococcus B causes a very nasty form of
meningitis. It affects about 1,000 cases a year, mostly in children. It
kills about one in 10 and causes severe and lasting
disability in one in three. It is no wonder that it is a
parent’s worst nightmare. Yet the safe and licensed vaccine that
can prevent most cases was turned down by the JCVI after what seems to
have been rather a doubtful cost-benefit analysis. Will the Minister
make sure that when the JCVI comes to look at it again, as it is doing,
it uses a more relevant discount value for the quantity and quality of
a child’s life; and that once the Government have received the
committee’s advice, they will make a rapid decision to make the
vaccine

Question asked by my noble friend, if the committee sticks to the view
that a vaccine would have a huge impact on an estimated 1,000 young

surely it calls into question the methodology that it is using. Will

diseases of high severity should be best assessed; and, secondly,
whether there were aspects of cost-effectiveness in relation

medical matters—talked about are developed through a new kind of
science, which does not involve the use of eggs or any other animal
material, and therefore is not only more effective but produces fewer
side-effects, particularly in children. The vaccine that we are talking
about is for a particular type of meningitis. The new vaccine may not
be considered as cost-effective as a conventional vaccine. However, if
you take into account clinical side-effects, the new vaccine may be
considered cost-effective, so a different kind of assessment must be

where are we? From 2016 you will need 35 years’ worth of credits

caring for a child whose mother works or are on disability benefits or
carer’s allowance, you are rightly credited in for free. Your
Lordships have over the years been at the forefront of pressing all
Governments to bring such groups rightly into the national insurance
system. If you earn above the lower earnings limit, or LEL, at
£5,700 a year you come into the national insurance system for
free. If you earn more than £7,500 in a single job you come into
the NI system but pay. If, however, you work 30 hours a week and earn
£11,000 a year but in several, splintered jobs, you cannot add

seeks an entirely permissive way in which to future-proof our state
pension structure for those in the new flexible economy who work in and
combine mini-jobs, by allowing them to combine the earnings from
several jobs for a pension if that takes them over the LEL
at £5,700. In the past, perhaps 50,000 people, mostly
women, were affected, especially in rural areas, as they stitched
together a patchwork of cleaning, fruit picking, bar work and so on,
and they relied instead on their husband through the married
women’s dependency pension. That pension, which would have
protected her, is being abolished. She—or you, or we—is
on her own and will not get any state pension from her patchwork of
mini-jobs. From now on she gets nothing at all. The reason is that the
labour market has changed dramatically in the past decade or so with
the growth of zero-hours and short-hours

guarantee part-time work for three, 13 or maybe 23 hours. Zero-hours

find at the beginning of your shift, 10 minutes before you are due to

I understand that every Domino’s Pizza worker is on a zero-hours

people are affected? Labour force statistics show 250,000—from a
very small sample—but everyone, including the ONS itself, thinks
that this is a severe underestimate. The chartered institute of
personnel directors polled 2,000 employers and believes that about a
million people are on zero-hours contracts alone, excluding other
short-hours contracts. The research of the Resolution
Foundation and the Work Foundation works with these figures. The
independent research by Mass1 of 5,000 union members for Unite includes
all types of short-hours contracts, including zero-hours contracts, and
estimates that they affect 5.5 million people. Some
zero-hours contracts are in better paid IT or FE and above the lower
earnings limit. Some may offer regular work; some may go to people who
are in their 60s and are happy to amplify an existing pension. But how
many who do need to build a pension are earning below the lower
earnings limit of £5,700 in one job? Of these, how many are
running alongside it another job, also below £5,700, which,
added together, would bring them into the NI system and give them a
pension? Of those, how long may they work in this way, outside the NI
system, so that over the years ahead they cannot make good their
shortfall? Finally, of those in several mini-jobs, how many may none

existing research that I am aware of. With the different sample sets

honestly as I can—I can only make an estimate, so I apologise
that the data do not allow more precision. Half of those under the age
of 30—3.75 million, the Mass1 survey suggests—are on
short-hours contracts of some form or another. Usually, they will not
get credits, not even for children, or qualify for UC if they are
single people, which they usually are, and living at home, as often
they are. From the personnel directors’ survey of zero-hours
contracts, nearly 40% work under 16 hours a week, in other words, below
the LEL. Of all part-time workers in April 2013, 30% earned below the
LEL, the entry point to NI, according to Unite. A third of those run
other part-time work alongside their first short-hours jobs and
two-thirds of those second jobs are at minimum wage or also below the

temporary, for students who will soon be in full-time jobs. Such
patterns may continue for many years. The chartered institute of
personnel directors’ polling of employers shows that 40% of
zero-hours workers have been with their employers for five years or
more and 20% for 10 years or more. In that time, most of
them will not be building up a state pension. If in that period they
cannot earn above £5,700 in any one job, they will not qualify
for an adequate state pension, whatever their total wage. I calculate
as best I can—it is a guesstimate—that perhaps 250,000
people, very often in their 20s, are working in two or even three
part-time jobs, each of which is below the threshold but which,
aggregated, could bring them into the NI pension system. Most want but
cannot get more hours in any one job. They might earn £11,000
from two jobs and may even pay tax, but they cannot build a state
pension for the simple reason that their wage comes from two jobs, not
one, and they are not allowed to put them

the figure to be some 250,000, and it is growing. Given the real-time
information built into UC, we now know who gets what without burdening
employers. In other words, the old obstacles to aggregation have gone.
In any case, do we actually need an employer’s contribution?

Drake (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, a sustainable welfare system needs
to be affordable, but it also has to be inclusive and responsive to the
realities of the contemporary labour market. For a long time, the
national insurance and state pension system has been exclusive, indeed
unfair, in its application to a particular group of workers, mainly
women—a community which the department estimates to be about
50,000 and consisting of people who undertake mini-jobs. Each job
delivers earnings below the lower earnings limit of £5,668, the
access point for the national insurance and state pension system, but
there is no provision for people with these mini-jobs to aggregate
their earnings 
<?notus-xml column=715?>in a way that would allow them to enter the national insurance system.
For example, a woman with two part-time jobs, earning £100 a
week from each, will not accrue national insurance and pension rights
unless she is covered by some alternative crediting arrangements.
Someone earning £110 from one job would accrue.
Yet<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:25:17"></hs_TimeCode> £100
equals about 16 hours on the national minimum wage, so a person with
more than one such mini-job could be working a significant number of
hours<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:25:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000084">Mini-jobs
may be driven by caring responsibilities, work availability and, more
recently, the increasingly common phenomenon of the zero-hours
contract. Some of these women could gain state pension through their
husband’s entitlement, but from 2016 they will not be able to
build up an entitlement through their spouse because the new
single-tier pension allows women to accrue pensions only in their own
right. My noble friend Lady Hollis demonstrated the example of women in
households who no longer have young children and whose spouse’s
income floats them off universal credit being locked out of the pension
system. The Bill makes the default position of entitlement through
their spouse for many women disappear, which gives the problem fresh

noble friend Lady Hollis has long campaigned to have this unfairness
addressed and lists the rebuttals she has faced over the years: that it
is not reasonable to try to share employers’ national insurance

contributions; that there are not very many of them; that their
situation is temporary; that they have time to make up missing years;

the scale of the problem have increased exponentially since my noble
friend started her campaign and those rebuttals are no longer valid. A
much larger number of people with mini-jobs are affected as a result of
the growing use of zero and short-hours contracts, where workers have
little or no control over the hours they may be offered in any one
week. The Office for National Statistics estimates that 250,000 people
worked on zero-hours contracts between October and December 2012.
However, its survey relied on people understanding that they were on
zero-hours contracts, and the ONS has conceded that that may well have
resulted in the true figure being substantially understated and that it
may be much higher. The ONS is now running a survey

Universal credit may be a work in progress but meanwhile many people
will be disadvantaged. A solution is needed so that those in mini-jobs
and on zero-hours contracts are not excluded from the pension system.
The noble Lord the Minister in Committee argued that the new
systems—universal credit, real-time information and single-tier
pensions—may provide a new opportunity to address this problem
and to find a way of dealing with it. He said that the department
intended to look more broadly at crediting arrangements to examine the
possibilities of modernising and simplifying the arrangements. He was,
however, reluctant to offer a timetable, implying it could take
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000090">Universal
credit may or may not be available to help some of these workers in due
course, but given the delays in rolling it out, realistically it may be
several years beyond April 2016. We cannot wait that long. We need a
solution that will work sooner. In April 2016 women will lose their
default protection of building a pension entitlement on their
spouse’s NI record; and those trapped in mini-jobs, including
zero-hours contracts, are growing in number and will be excluded. A key
criterion for the reform of the state system, often referred to by the
Prime Minister, is that it must work for women. In this instance, it
clearly does not. As my noble friend has clearly pointed out, there
will still be young and single people in mini-jobs denied access to the
pension system which the universal credit system does not
resolve.</hs_para>

interaction between variable hours of work and the tax credit system

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:34:05"></hs_TimeCode>My Lords, in
supporting this amendment I am pleased to follow my noble friend Lady
Hollis. I know that she has marshalled the arguments and found the
evidence, which she has advanced with authority and passion.
Nevertheless, in this debate I seek to reinforce two points that I feel
strongly about. First, all the evidence tells us that many people will
be adversely affected by not having national insurance credits, not
only while they are in work but, most importantly for this Bill, when
they move into retirement. Secondly, for too long we have known that
this situation is occurring, but we have made the excuse that not many
people are in mini-jobs. That argument no longer holds good. We are
told that they are here today and gone tomorrow, so we have avoided
tackling the problem.</hs_para>

must remind ourselves that the economy is changing. It is more
demanding and is now a truly 24/7 economy which has to be serviced, so
those who are affected by the Government’s lack of effort to
find a solution to the problem are hard-working people who deserve not
just our praise, but our recognition that they, too, should enjoy the
same rights and security as others. The answer we have received so far
is that they are only part-timers, although it is recognised that many
are earning less than the lower earnings limit. The evidence tell us
that many are on low pay and that people have not just one mini-job,
but two or even three of them under so-called variable contracts spread
over five, six or seven days a week. More than that, although they are
in work, they are insecure and many have no knowledge of what they will
be expected to do next week or the week after. They suffer the
inconvenience of not being able to plan their lives and look after
their families. People in mini-jobs are doing what the Government have
asked us all to do—to be flexible—but of course
flexibility in this instance does 
<?notus-xml column=718?>not provide the security of universal credit or jobseeker’s
arrangements. In fact, these people are being penalised for doing
exactly what is required to maintain a stable and robust
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:37:50"></hs_TimeCode>. In
reality, this group of people should enjoy a system of deferred credits

have not tackled this problem because we believe that not many workers
are involved, but the numbers have been played down. The DWP states
that 50,000 people are affected, and this figure has been widely cited
by Ministers in both Houses. However, as my noble friend Lady Hollis
set out so clearly in her evidence, that figure of 50,000 is a gross
underestimate of the number of people in so-called mini-jobs. I suggest
that anyone who doubts the number of people involved visits the
interchange at Bank DLR at around 5 pm on any working day. Thousands of
financial sector workers flow off the DLR only to be replaced by
thousands of cleaners and maintenance workers flowing back to service
the offices of Canary Wharf and elsewhere in east London. However, that
is not the end of their day. Many return later at night to clean hotels
and shops. This can be seen wherever there are offices, factories,
shops and restaurants in the towns or cities of the United Kingdom. It
is a universal pattern of work that has evolved in the past half
decade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000098">I
understand that it has been said that providing fairness to people in

trapped in these so-called mini-jobs. The DWP and HMRC can resolve this
problem. All that is needed is some joined-up thinking. They can
resolve it, because we are talking about the lives of thousands of
people and about fairness. If they are not provided for today while at

seeking to tackle in-work poverty, the Government are rightly proud of
raising the tax threshold incrementally to those earning
£10,000. However, what is the point of seeking to tackle the
scourge of in-work poverty through the tax threshold system by creating
poverty in old age through the Pensions Bill? There is not much point
at all. In the past, Ministers have argued that this problem of
crediting people with multi-jobs may place a burden on employers. The
price of not placing a burden on employers is the price of placing a
burden on the whole of society in the years ahead, as some of these
workers become pensioners. With part-time working and zero-hour
contracts on the increase, this is a reasonable expectation for any
civilised society to place on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000100">In the

a reward package can and should be made, to ensure that we provide not 
<?notus-xml column=719?>just for today’s but for tomorrow’s pensioners. At the
very heart of this must be the transferability of national insurance
credit. It is simple. All we need are the two major departments of

these
mini-jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000101">I

German (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the issues raised by this amendment
are important, and I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on
her dedication to the issue over many years. She kindly told us in
Committee how she was rebuffed by her own Government and today she
repeated the argument that they used against her: one could not
reasonably divvy up an employer’s national insurance—she
used those words today again—if there were two or more such
jobs. She further told us that women would not want to pay class 1
contributions. For that reason, this is an important issue. We are
looking at people being able to contribute to their own pension and get
the credits that they need to win a full pension in under 35
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000103">Much<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:49:36"></hs_TimeCode>
of the discussion that noble Lords have heard today and in Committee

response to the issues in front of them and about how people’s
live are dealt with. The problem that we face is that there are no
reliable statistics or evidence that show how individuals’
behaviour works. It is clearly possible—I heard it both in
Committee and here today—to illustrate that in a way that works
to the best of the argument that says that we need to move on this

category<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:45:24"></hs_TimeCode>. I do
not mind people making contributions about the way people behave, will

are bound to hear more and more about zero-hours contracts. They are
not a new phenomenon. Over the past 70 years, the notion of a job for
life has all but disappeared. More and more people are spending time in
self-employment, many people have more than one job and more people
have part-time jobs. The single-tier pension itself is designed in such
a way that an individual with a more varied work history will be able
to build up their national insurance records to achieve the maximum
state pension outcome, provided of course they get credited for their
national insurance
contributions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:46:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000105">The
crucial issue, therefore, is whether universal credit will pick up and
deal with this issue. I suspect that the answer given to the noble
Baroness, Lady Hollis, when she raised this issue with her own
Government, was that this is a very typically difficult issue for HMRC,
given the range of information that 
<?notus-xml column=720?>it would require from every company in the land about who
they employed and that it would have to combine the results and put
them into a single file. That is of course precisely the process that
is taking place, and will take place, through universal credit, which
will pick up levels of flexible income including, by implication, that
relating to zero-hours contracts. It is interesting that the
lower earnings level, below which you do not have to pay or get credit
for national insurance contributions, is £5,772 per annum at
present. The Labour Force Survey figures show that those on
zero-hours contracts work, on average, 20 hours a week at
£9 an hour, which is enough to exceed the lower earnings limit.
If the figures we have before us are to be believed, most people will
be receiving enough income to receive the national insurance
contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:48:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000106">The
other issue about universal credit is that it will look very carefully
at how it credits people and bring, as we have heard, another 800,000
people into the crediting system. For example, a single person without
savings, earning below that £5,772 per annum level, will be
eligible for universal credit and thereby eligible for the national
insurance contribution. The question that I have to ask my noble friend
is about the delivery of universal credit. In Committee, the Minister
said it would be delivered in 2016-17 and the noble Baroness, Lady
Hollis, said in 2019-20, although she hoped it might be earlier than
that. I apologise if it was somebody else on her Benches but those are
the sorts of span. If we believe my noble friend, and it is 2016-17,
will this problem be dealt with from the outset by those who are then
brought into the universal credit system? If that is the timetable, I
ask noble Lords to consider how long it would take to put in the
interim solution. In effect, what is being asked for is an interim
solution between now and when universal credit comes in for a pensions
system that comes into play in
2016.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000107">What is
the interim position? Do we need to ask HMRC to invent a system for
itself? When the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, asked the Labour
Government for one in their time, they rejected it. I believe they said
that it would be cumbersome and expensive. Do we need to have that in
place or could we be reassured that, almost within the very short
period of the implementation of the single-tier pension, universal
credit will be in place in a sufficient and timely position so that the
vast majority of people who are occupying two or more jobs that produce
an income over a year of less than £5,772 at the current rates
will be able to be credited? That is the key

support of the arguments that I set out in my own contribution in Grand
Committee, I simply want to make three points today. First, the
phenomenon of people working in two or more low-earning jobs is not a
limited one. They are often on zero-hours contracts but certainly on
short hours, with each job under the level at which national insurance
contributions are made, and are therefore not building up a
contributions record towards the state pension. Nor indeed is it a
temporary phenomenon, as has been argued, often coming at the end of a
working life. Nor is it an experience limited to rural communities,
although it is very prevalent there.</hs_para>

content of my overheard conversation on the Transport for London

meet in this city and back home in Scotland how many of them are

this short anecdote, I will repeat it. A few days before we debated
this matter in Committee, I overheard a conversation among three young
people on an overground train as I was making my way home from your
Lordships’ House. It was very clear to me that they had all been
working together in what I suppose we would call a mini-job and that
they each had two other
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000114">What<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T14:52:31"></hs_TimeCode>

surprising, but it caused me to inquire the same of other young people,
and I have come to the view that this is the norm for thousands of
young people in the first phase of their employed life, even for
graduates. It is a significant feature of a flexible labour market and,
along with zero-hours contracts, it is part of the reason that
politicians, particularly Ministers, and employers celebrate its
flexibility. Undoubtedly the number of people in this situation is
growing, not declining.</hs_para>

leads me to repeat a point I made in Grand Committee, which has already
been made by my noble friends. The Government assert that there are
about 50,000 people in this category. I am not convinced by their
estimate of the scale of the problem. That is based not on my
experience but on evidence that has already been referred to. We await
the outcome of the—I think still anticipated—BIS
consultation on zero-hours contracts, which was promised in October and
is due to report by the end of March, but I have not seen a lot of
evidence of it. We should reflect on the fact that in the fourth
quarter of 2012, the ONS estimated that there were 250,000 people on
zero-hours contracts. However, a contemporaneous survey of employers by
the CIPD estimated that in fact the figure was around 1
million<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T14:52:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

union Unite estimates that as many as 5.5 million people are employed
on such contracts up and down the UK. Following the CIPD estimate, the
ONS conceded that the Labour Force Survey, which is based on responses

Government’s responses appear complacent. Steve Webb, the
Pensions Minister, suggested in the Commons that there was only a
tenuous link between having multiple jobs below the LEL and being
unable to build up the required 35 years’ contributions, and
referred to this problem as a temporary phenomenon. In our debates in
Grand Committee, the Minister promised that universal credit would
resolve the issue. The noble Lord, Lord German, has already gone
through the pros and cons of that in some detail, and my noble friend
Lady Hollis significantly undermined that argument by pointing out the
categories of people who are in these jobs who would be denied
universal credit in the first place and therefore the consequent

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
thank the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, for the amendment which gives an
opportunity to debate again a most important issue which is close to
her heart and with which I am sympathetic. Over the years we have had
quite a few discussions on how the issue is best
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:01:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

strengthen the contributory principle and reduce disparities in
outcomes between individuals. They are designed to fit with the working
lives of today’s young people, who should find it much easier to
plan for the future, counting on a full single-tier pension. At first
glance, it may appear that the national insurance treatment of those in
low-paying mini-jobs is at odds with these principles. However, I would
like to explain why we think mini-jobs are not the problem they might
seem to be and why, looking at how to adjust the national insurance
system to combat this perceived problem, we may end up with solutions
which create more problems and knock-on impacts than they
solve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000123">The
noble Baroness has been as assiduous as always in exploring all the
sources to illustrate her case for change. Her central estimate was
that 250,000 people would be affected. I continue to be confident in
the department’s estimate of the number who—if we were to
aggregate their earnings in the way proposed—would gain that
extra qualifying year. That number is some 50,000 at any one time,
which is fewer than one in 500 workers. This number makes
perfect sense when you look at the opportunities the national insurance
system provides for gaining state pension qualifying years. The entry
point for workers is through the lower earnings limit, which is set at
£109 a week. This is £40 below the primary
threshold which is when national insurance starts to be paid. At the
national minimum wage, this is just 18 hours a week for a year or six 
<?notus-xml column=724?>months of full-time work. There is also a comprehensive crediting system
that recognises caring responsibilities and those unable to
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000124">The
50,000 figure is a snapshot from 2012-13 and individuals may gain a
qualifying year in other years. In the single-tier system, full pension
entitlement is achieved after someone has built up 35 qualifying years.
People can therefore spend a third of their working lives outside the
national insurance system and still gain the full single-tier amount.
This was a deliberate part of our design, to recognise that people have
increasingly varied careers and working lives, and yet can still
reasonably count on a full single-tier pension in their retirement

German inquired about the timetable for the introduction of universal
credit. We are planning to pull that in for the bulk of people,
virtually everyone, in 2016 and 2017. That would certainly include
everyone in the workforce. The numbers beyond that are some of the
people who are currently on ESA on a long-term basis in the support

were to take a similar snapshot to that of the 50,000 in 2012-13 but in
2017, we would find that individuals with the same characteristics may
well be getting a credit through universal credit. This will bring at
least a further 800,000 people into national insurance credits. For
instance, the partner of the claimant or those on very low
earnings—below the lower earnings limit—will be brought
into universal credit because the Government believe that it should pay
to work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000127">We

source of concern around the Chamber today. There is concern at one
level from the employment practices perspective. As noble Lords are
fully aware, BIS is consulting on this issue. There is also a degree of
uncertainty around the prevalence of this practice and whether it is
increasing; as noble Lords have pointed out, the ONS is looking closely
at evidence for this. However, we know that the proportion of women
with two or more jobs is similar to the proportion of 10 years ago; in
other words, around 5% of all workers. We are not talking about using
the word “exponential”, which I have heard around the

Lady Drake, that I did not indicate in Committee, nor have I indicated,
that the number of individuals on those contracts was small or in some

a very high evidence base. For instance, if we introduced a system

system. Some will contrive to avoid employers’ national
insurance but without disturbing their employees’ national
insurance position. The noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, suggested that the
employer need not pay national insurance. However, even if that were
the case there is still a significant burden on the employer. We also
could not verify the wages without disproportionate cost. This would
incentivise people to underreport earnings to get into the system on
the cheap.</hs_para>

would mean that she is likely to be employed and could have a number of
jobs with different households. Under aggregation, each of those

need to contact HMRC to open such a scheme. They would then need to

employers who would otherwise not have to have a PAYE scheme to open
one up on an ad hoc basis. The point discussed by the noble Baroness,
Lady Hollis, which would allow people to class themselves as
self-employed, seems slightly odd given the concern about job security

shall address first the comments of the noble Lord, Lord German, many
of whose points were dealt with very effectively by my noble friend
Lord Browne from the Front Bench. Basically, he ran two arguments.
First, he said that most of the people concerned would be on UC, and he
pressed the Minister instead on UC. Secondly, he commented on the
problems for HMRC in combining possible jobs. On the first argument, on
UC—and I am very much in favour of universal credit—we
agree the stats are that another 800,000 should come into the NI system
as a result of crediting arrangements. That is great, but the point is
that UC is income-based and that income is surprisingly low. No one has
mentioned that today.
For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:17:56"></hs_TimeCode>
example<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:16:33"></hs_TimeCode>, if you
are a single person and you earn more than £4,000 a year in any
job, well below the lower earnings limit, you are above the level for
universal credit so you do not get credited in. If you are a married
woman, your husband is in work and you have two children—I am
aiming for a generic family, if you like—and if he is earning
more than £12,000 a year, that family is not entitled to UC,
apart from housing
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>. She may
be earning £4,000 or £5,000, but that will not give her a
credit through him. Those two groups of single people and married
women, which my noble friend identified and I seek to identify, are
both outside the reach of UC. What is worse—and neither the
Minister nor the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=727?>Lord German, mentioned this—is that it is happening at the same
time as we are withdrawing the married woman’s dependency
pension of 60% that she would have had as an alternative and could have
relied on. That is what is new. If she cannot get into the pensions
system through universal credit, she cannot get in at all, and that has

broadly in line, but I do not know about that. His stats are
based on labour force statistics offered by the ONS, which
the ONS now says are unreliable; that therefore means that
his stats are unreliable. My stats of 250,000 are the best that I can

subsets. I accept that, but I am as confident as I can be on the

did not quote this—says that 40% of the 1 million people who are
employed work below 16 hours per week. We know that the majority of
those are on, or on around, the minimum wage: for example, in jobs in
domiciliary care, hotels, waiting, driving or security. A mean average
is no use in this, because the figures are skewed hugely upwards by
people in IT, who may be very well paid—perhaps at £50
per hour—and come within zero-hour contracts. We need to see how
many people are below the LEL in one job and work in a second job that
is also below the LEL, which together would bring them into the NI

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like first to say a
word about procedure. I am glad to see the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay,
in her place; that is helpful. This is a paving amendment that the
Public Bill Office assures me is appropriate. Amendment 21 in this
group—and only Amendment 21—is consequential on Amendment
2. Therefore, any vote on the first amendment is, in the words of the
<I>Companion</I>, also a vote on its directly consequential
amendment—although it does not, of course, determine any other
amendments in the group. If it were not directly consequential there
would be no point in a paving amendment. As I have carefully taken the
clerk’s advice on this, I hope that the Minister and the House
will agree with my statements. If the Minister does not agree that
Amendment 21 is consequential, perhaps he could indicate so now because
I would not wish to waste the House’s
time.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord, as
this allows us to have a substantive discussion on
bereavement—which I know concerns many of your
Lordships—in good time and not in the late hours this evening. I
know that the Minister is sympathetic to the situation of distressed
children and widowed parents. I hope that I can refer generally to

amendment that seeks to help widowed persons avoid additional pressure
in the most stressful and distressing period of their lives.
Three-fifths of bereaved parents are in work at the time of
bereavement—virtually all fathers and around half or so of
mothers. Most fathers with a terminally ill wife continue, or
continued, to work. Most mothers, however, give up their jobs to care
for their husband. Fathers would normally go back to work after a
couple of weeks; indeed, they are often anxious to do so. Some mothers
may feel able to do so as well, depending on the age of their children
and the nature of their job. However, many widowed mothers were not in
work, because they had younger children, or they had stopped working to
become carers and—this is key—many mothers who were in
work when their husband died drop out of work for some time while they
support their children. If they return to work later, it may be to a
different job, to one that is part-time or less demanding. Whereas work
seems to be essential and continuous for fathers, it becomes secondary
and broken for bereaved
mothers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:37:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

reconstructing bereavement benefits, with more money paid as an
up-front lump sum and less as a monthly payment—which, at
£400 a month, will be paid only for 12 months and topped up by
universal credit while the claimant is out of work. After 12 months,
bereavement support payments stop and, if the parent does not return to
work, she may draw her full income from UC. Being on UC normally
entails work conditionality—entering or re-entering the labour
market. The Minister has agreed—for which I am
delighted—for kinship carers, work conditionality associated
with claiming UC should not apply for 12 months after they
have taken on the care of children. But—and this is the point of
my amendment—work conditionality for widowed parents, unlike for
kinship carers, will kick in after six months, not 12 months, while
they are still on bereavement benefit. That benefit runs for 12 months
precisely because the Minister, in all decency—and I respect him
for it—recognises that they need that support for 12 months.
Surely work conditionality should be aligned with those 12
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000147">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>

what little control she has in handling her family life. Instead, that
power is transferred to the DWP—perhaps to a 23 year-old young
man in a local benefit office who, I expect, will be well intentioned
until the pressure of targets bears down on him. He is probably a young
man without children and without any experience of bereavement. It is

I must point out that bereaved children express emotions differently
from adults. Indeed, the most distressed children often appear almost
blunted to the death of the parent and are simply quiet, withdrawn and
can even appear disinterested. I hope that there will be no attempt to
assess an individual child’s distress because I can foresee the
problem of some families blaming that child for not caring enough, and
therefore blaming that child for somehow not falling into a group that
could have had more benefit. Sadly, transference occurs in bereavement
and sometimes bereaved parents project their anger at the death on to
the way in which the bereaved child is behaving and are on a very short
fuse with the child, which compounds that child’s isolation.

sequelae<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T16:47:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

support that the state offers must be easy to understand. It must

enormous pressure on the rest of the family. The surviving parent has
to both provide stability to children and adjust to life as the sole
carer and earner while dealing with their own grief as well as that of
their children. Quite often they have had no time to begin to adjust to
impending widowhood—for example, in any sudden death, whether it
is through a road accident, manslaughter, murder, suicide or
whatever—and yet their children’s need for stability
following the death of a parent makes it vital that the surviving

time that is already very emotionally difficult when they often relive
the acute episode surrounding the bereavement. Many families report
that the second and subsequent years following bereavement are even
harder than the first because support from friends and family tends to
disappear and children can experience late effects of dealing with
grief and bereavement.</hs_para>

to reduce this to a period of just one year is a dramatic change. Data

Most families would therefore receive payments under this Bill for a

That does not surprise me given that his great-aunt, Anna Freud, set up

provided them with much needed care. She also made forensic
observations of what happens when a child is separated from the parent,
looking at the different sequelae of those changes. What she discovered
was that while she could feed the children well and provide exercise so
that they were healthier, the emotional damage done to them as a result
of being separated from their parents was simply huge. The concern must
be that if widowed parents are not well supported and given all
necessary consideration they may emotionally withdraw from their

people will know, a review has little relevance if it does not result
in concrete outcomes. My discussions so far with my noble friend have
given me considerable confidence that we will see a changed regime at
the end of the review. There is a second issue, which relates to speed.
We need to make sure that the regulations, associated not really with
this Bill but with universal credit, are in place and that there is a
chance for people to put their views on record to that review. Quite
clearly, a normal government review of this kind would not give a swift
response, but we need to get that response in place before people are
brought into the universal credit
fold.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000172">Therefore
I have a number of questions about my noble friend’s review. The
first is about scope. So far today, the amendments have been about
specific parts of the conditionality regime. Will my noble friend
confirm that his review will not just be about the children of married
parents, but also of those in a partnership where one is bereaved and
the children find themselves in forms of distress? Will it also include
situations where a child loses a brother or sister, or those who flee
from violence? Violence is often a cause of people fleeing, and of
great distress to those children, yet distress to children is a
difficult thing to define—as the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay,
described. Is it not 
<?notus-xml column=738?>rather about the situations in which children find themselves in
distress? Is that the purpose of this review? Is it about where and how
we see that distress occurring, so we describe the circumstances,
rather than the actual distress itself? That would be crucial in
ensuring that we get a powerful
outcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000173">Does
my noble friend have the powers to bring in new regulations without
putting them in the Bill? Does he have the power to make sure that the
results can be put into regulation and guidance, and would any new
powers be required for whatever circumstance might be the outcome of
his review? What is the timetable for implementing the review’s
recommendations, in particular so that any family brought into the
universal credit fold can be brought into the new proposed
conditionality arrangements which might come out of the review? Some
outcome timetable would be very useful to understanding, especially as
we have a need for
speed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000174">What
assurance of independence and impartiality does my noble friend have
within his review? Would he consider appointing an external expert
adviser to accompany him on this review? It might be sensible to
consider someone who has first-hand, practical experience of distress
situations in which children find themselves. How will the Minister
conduct evidence gathering? It is important that stakeholders and
Members have views and can express them to the ministerial review. Who
will the Minister conduct his evidence gathering with, and will he
include evidence gathering from a research base, which we heard about
today and which I referred to in
Committee?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000175">Finally,
how will the review’s findings be reported to this House and
Parliament in general? In particular, how will Parliament have an

may see before us a real opportunity for a concrete examination of
these issues and, more importantly, some specific concrete outcomes

Hollis to make a judgment on this but I do not think that that in any
way precludes the need for this amendment, which is about a very
specific category of person—people who are bereaved and who may

Government’s case throughout this debate has been that these
bereavement reforms are not really about money. From 2016 to 2020, they
estimate the changes will cost an extra £110 million, because
they will protect payments under the current system, but that
thereafter, in total, there will be small savings. The argument is that
these are reforms not cuts. The Government have said throughout that
they want to simplify the system and put resources where, in their
view, they are most needed: as a short-term intervention to allow a
bereaved spouse or civil partner to deal with the immediate costs of
the death of a partner. If support is needed in the longer term, that
is what universal credit is
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000180">Amendments

specifically seek to relax the work conditionality requirement for
those in receipt of bereavement support payment. This is particularly
important for widowed parents. There is a difference between those who
do not want to work and those who would like to work, or go back to
work, but who have been forced to recognise that the reality of the
state that their children are in is such that they have to
choose—of course they will choose their children and not work,
unless they have literally no choice. Some parents will need a longer
period, both to adjust to their own grief and shock and to deal with
the grief and shock faced by their
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000182">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>
has already been pointed out that the regulations for universal credit
mean that kinship carers are exempt from work conditionality for a year
from the time that they assume the care of the child. This was agreed
by the Minister—under the persuasive pressure of my noble friend
Lady Drake and others—in recognition of the fact that adults
need time to adjust to being, effectively, a single parent. Why should
the same principle not apply to bereavement? I would be very interested
if the Minister could answer one question about his review:
does<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:08:49"></hs_TimeCode> he intend
to change the regulations to 
<?notus-xml column=740?>allow bereaved parents specifically to be exempt from conditionality? In
Committee, he said that he was reviewing this and that he wanted to
change the guidance given to decision-makers in jobcentres. But that is
a very different question altogether. I can see why that might be the
way forward for distress in general—after all, distress comes in
very different forms and some judgment would have to be made about when
the family was distressed. The awful thing about bereavement is that it
is horribly clear: one is either bereaved or one is not, and I
therefore do not think there is a need for the kind of flexibility that
might be needed in other
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1402245000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000183">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:09:39"></hs_TimeCode>
also worry because I have heard many cases, as I am sure other noble
Lords have, where young jobcentre officials, with the best of
intentions, ended up making bad decisions because they did not properly
understand what it was like to be a single parent trying to juggle more
than one child and a part-time job. That person could of course simply
say, “I am sorry but despite whatever you say, I am not going
back to work because I have to prioritise my children”. If that
happens, their benefits get sanctioned. They can appeal, but do we
really want them to have to go through that six months after losing
their husband, wife or civil partner? When 58% of appeals against
sanctions on jobseeker’s allowance are successful, how much are
we willing to bet the farm on the effectiveness of decisions by
individuals in jobcentres? In my case, it would be not very
much.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1402245000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000184">At
Second Reading the noble Lord, Lord German, used words such as
“harsh” and “cruel” to describe the
decision to force widowed parents back to work after six months. I
believe that he was right. He cited the research, which he touched on
again today, showing that outcomes for children very much depend on the
effectiveness of the remaining parent in coping. That is partly about
their availability to children. All that this amendment from my noble
friend Lady Hollis does is to ask that those widowed parents who need
to claim universal credit alongside bereavement support payment to make
ends meet should not be required to go back to work for 12 months.
After all, the Government have decided to focus their support on that
first 12 months, so surely they should be willing simply to
stretch this for the same period.</hs_para>

that that so many parents end up giving up their jobs when they lose

much to cope with. Universal credit is meant to be the safety net for
those very parents, and it must be here. This amendment specifically
recognises that the Government are planning to recycle all the
resources spent on bereavement to be able to create this new system.
All it does is to give them the power to recycle that money in whatever
way they want, such that that reform should include this small
change—that for 12 months after losing one’s husband,
wife or civil partner a parent should not be forced back to

childhood is a life-changing event: one never gets over it. We cannot

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, losing a spouse is one of the most tragic
circumstances that a person will have to endure and, as such, it has
been recognised since the outset of the welfare system that the
bereaved need some financial assistance. Bereavement benefits form a
crucial part of state support but limited reforms over the years have
led to a complex system, which has not kept pace with changes in the
benefit system or wider changes in society. This legislation will
address this. With a simple payment structure focusing support on the
period immediately after the bereavement and a single contribution
condition, the new bereavement support payment will be far more easily
understood and claimed. It will mean that more people will benefit,
particularly younger widows.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1402245000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#1402245000188">A claim to the new
bereavement support payment is made by the surviving spouse or civil
partner. The noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, raised those extremely tragic
cases where not only is there one bereavement but the surviving spouse
dies shortly afterwards. She is of course right that there can be no
expectation that a claim is made by the surviving spouse in such
circumstances. I take this opportunity to make it absolutely clear
that, as with the current benefits, there will be arrangements in place
for claims to be made posthumously. Every year, the Department for Work
and Pensions receives around 10 posthumous claims to bereavement
benefits made on behalf of a bereaved spouse who has subsequently died.
There are regulations to ensure that appropriate payment can be made in
respect of these claims.</hs_para>

a person who would have had an entitlement to a bereavement benefit
themselves dies, regulations allow the DWP to appoint a third party to
act on their behalf and make a claim. Once a person has been appointed
to act on behalf of the deceased they have six months from the date
they were appointed to make a claim. The amount awarded following a
posthumous claim would match the entitlement the deceased would have
had if they had made a claim. I can assure the noble Baroness that the
regulations will be updated so that this practice will continue under
bereavement support payment. With regard to guardian’s allowance
and child benefit, the payment of these benefits is not affected by the
award of current bereavement benefits, and this relationship will
remain unchanged under bereavement support payment. It is worth saying
that, due to the design of new bereavement support payment, such
posthumous awards will be higher than under the current system because
the new benefit is made up of a higher initial lump sum and monthly
instalments.</hs_para>

time explaining exactly why we have decided to design the benefit as a
higher lump sum and 12 subsequent monthly instalments. This is an issue
that the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, and the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of Wakefield raised. The counterargument is that bereavement
has long-term implications for families. I understand this, and I
realise that after a single year bereaved families will still be
suffering and will be in need of support.</hs_para>

hope it does not sound too counterintuitive—is that, looking at
the welfare system as a whole, I am convinced that the best way to
provide this support is through a shorter-term payment of bereavement
support payment and a longer-term income replacement benefit in the
shape of universal credit. If we pay the bereavement support payment
for a longer period—for example, for three years—it could
be done in a cost-neutral way only by reducing our proposed payment and
spreading it over a longer period. This would mean providing less money
in the period directly following bereavement. From the responses to the
public consultation and the findings from the independent social
research, it is clear that, regardless of household income, the death
of a spouse has a significant financial impact which is acute in the
initial months following bereavement. That is why we have decided to
focus the benefit on the shorter term when the need is greatest. Let me
be clear that this shift is not about saving money. In fact, we will be
spending £110 million more over the first four years after
implementation than if the current system had rolled forward.</hs_para>

about extending the duration of the bereavement support payment is when
you consider the welfare system as a whole. The fundamental design
principle of the new benefit is that, as a short-term payment designed
to address the additional costs of bereavement rather than everyday
living costs, it is clearly distinct from income replacement benefits
or pensions. This means that we can fully disregard the payments from
universal credit and benefit cap calculations, and this will clearly
benefit the less well-off. For example, an unemployed single parent
with one child who is entitled to bereavement support payment could
receive £9,800 in the first year. In addition, they could
receive the standard allowance and the child element of universal
credit, which is more than £7,000 a year. On top of this, they
may also be able to access other support such as help with housing
costs. By extending the duration of the payment, the benefit would
resemble an income replacement benefit and would need to be treated as
such in the calculation of the benefit cap and universal credit. If we
assume that we carried on paying the instalments at the rate of
£400 per month, universal credit recipients in the poorest
income quartile could lose around £4,800 per year and up to
£15,000 by the third year. Our analysis shows that any increase
in duration accompanied by removal of the bereavement support payment
disregard from UC and taxation of instalments is effectively a transfer
of money from poorer to richer recipients.</hs_para>

that a longer payment would be likely to be classified as a
survivor’s pension under EU social security co-ordination rules.
This would impact on the cost of other benefits, notably healthcare, 
<?notus-xml column=743?>sickness and family benefits. Analysis shows that if bereavement support
payment is treated as a survivor’s pension and is paid over a
three-year period, the costs of the bereavement benefit could increase
by £400 million, which is four times higher than our

long-lasting effect on families. We should never lose sight of the fact

bereaved to adjust to their situation and regain control of their

individual; in particular, bereaved parents draw on a wide range of
support mechanisms to get themselves and their children through. For
those who are not in work or who have stopped working, part of this
process of adjustment is looking to return to work. We know that long
periods out of the labour market can have a negative effect on a

agree that supporting children should be every parent’s first
priority. This is why universal credit ensures that bereaved parents
are never subject to conditionality for the first six months. After
this initial period, universal credit offers tailored support. Parents
or lead carers of children under five are not expected to work and
therefore will not be required to look for and apply for jobs. For
those parents with children over five, work- related requirements are
still tailored. Parents of children under 13 will be required to look
only for work that is compatible with school hours. Parents of older

childcare responsibilities to take jobs that do not take into account
their children’s needs. This engagement is intended to be
supportive—for example, supporting with confidence-building or
training where a bereaved parent is entering the labour market for the
first time or changing career path. Claimants’ individual
circumstances are always considered before conditionality is applied
and the current legislation allows for some to continue without any
conditionality. A move to a fixed, 12-month conditionality exemption,

Freud:</Member></B> The point I am trying to make is that it is far
better to recognise that individual responses to grief vary. As a
number of noble Lords have said, grief often does not manifest in
behavioural and emotional challenges until months or even years down
the line, as a child matures. That is why, under universal credit,
advisers have the flexibility to personalise requirements at any point,
responding as circumstances arise. Where parents are facing
difficulties with school, childcare arrangements or other extenuating
circumstances, advisers can limit or even lift requirements.</hs_para>

application of that flexibility depends on the ability of those
advisers. While I feel that our advisers are able, it is important to
ensure that they have the best guidance and training to deal with such
difficult cases. That is why we are currently working with experts in
the field including the Childhood Bereavement Network, the
Children’s Society, Cruse Bereavement Care, WAY and Gingerbread,
to ensure that guidance and learning clearly articulate how advisers
can identify and support parents in these circumstances, including the
particular circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to apply
conditionality. Our advisory services are also being repositioned as a
profession with a clear career path, accredited learning and ongoing
professional development. The learning programme will ensure that
advisers have up-to-date skills to deal with any claimant interaction
and support them in making relevant and appropriate decisions on an
individual
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022417000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#14022417000004">That is
the standing position. I now move to the more specific response that I
wish to make following our discussions in Grand Committee, particularly
in answer to the points raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay. I
recognise that there are circumstances in which children could be in
considerable distress and in which it is clear that conditionality
should not be applied and flexibility is essential. I do not, however,
see such cases as being limited to bereavement. There may be other
circumstances in which children need additional care—for
instance, where a family is fleeing domestic
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:28:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022417000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0001.htm#14022417000005">I
assure the noble Baroness that we are not looking for a measure to
define “distress”. Indeed, we need to establish exactly
what the expression means; we are using it as a shorthand and there may
be a much better way of capturing the concept, which is one of the
things that a review should do. We are looking to identify specific
circumstances in which we could expect a child to be distressed, and in
which they will therefore have additional needs that need to be
recognised. Claimants would need to demonstrate only the circumstances
they are in, not the fact of distress, which is, as the noble Baroness
has pointed out, extraordinarily difficult to establish.</hs_para>

example, which I was thinking of as the Minister spoke. He was going to
extend this to the distress of cohabiting parents when one of them
dies. It is not too far fetched to suggest to the House a situation
where a woman was with the father of her child or children in a
cohabiting relationship but they then separated. She then had a period
of perhaps five or seven years with someone else, to whom the children
really connected and related. Then she moved on to a new
boyfriend—a new stepfather—for perhaps the past year.
Could the Minister tell me which of those three would have to
die—forgive the language—for her to be entitled to
bereavement benefit under the proposal of distress? Is it the recent
stepfather, over whom the children are not especially distressed but
the mother is highly distressed; the long-term stepfather, who has
helped to bring them up, to whom the children were committed and over
whom they are distressed while she is less so; or their natural father,
who is giving them financial support and they see regularly?

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness for
making the point for me. If we do these things piecemeal, we will not
get the right answer. That is why my response to what the noble
Baroness, Lady Finlay, said to me in Grand Committee was to think that
we need to look at this comprehensively. We need to get this issue
right across the piece and understand how to incorporate it as a whole
into our conditionality regime. That is the response that I am looking
to do, not to sort it out on the Floor of the House where we simply do
not have enough information to do it properly at this

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I make two points. First, we
are not seeking to sort it out on the Floor of the House. I am seeking
the consent of the House, if it is so minded to give it, to a
permissive amendment, which does not commit the Government to anything
they subsequently decide is inappropriate in the light of further
research. The second point is that the Minister’s definition of
distress is so wide that I genuinely believe, from my limited
experience in Parliament, that he will find it very difficult indeed to

<?notus-xml column=747?>turn it into deliverable policy. I am sure he is as aware as I am that
it will end up depending on the discretion—he made this point
himself—of local people in local benefits offices, such as the
23 year-old who will be interviewing the widowed parent. Is she numb?
If so, does that mean she is coping or not caring sufficiently?
Alternatively, is she voluble? Does that mean she is coping or not
caring? He will have to peer into her soul and we should not go
there.</hs_para>

dependant, reliant on his judgment as to what she should do and what is
best for her family. That is inappropriate and improper. You are making
the adult back into a child and adding to her stress and distress. The
Minister should not be going down that path. He will not be able to do
it by clear policy; he will depend on discretion. Neither of those
routes is satisfactory for a small and coherent group that we can

put on the back burner for a review that may or may not deliver what I
hope the House will think is the right path to take. If the review goes
ahead and the Minister does not need the amendment, as it is

regime’s foot-dragging is also clear on the removal of chemical
weapons from Syria. According to the Organisation for the Prevention of
Chemical Weapons, only 11% of Syria’s declared chemical
stockpile has so far been removed, and the regime has missed the 5
February deadline for removing all chemicals. This has delayed the
destruction operation by months and puts the 30 June final destruction
deadline in jeopardy. This slow rate of progress is clearly
unacceptable. The UN Secretary-General and the OPCW have made it clear
that Syria has all the necessary equipment to enable the movement of
the chemicals. The OPCW’s Director-General is pressing the
Syrians to accept a plan that would see the removal of all Syrian
chemicals in a considerably shorter period, enabling the 30 June
deadline to be

see no evidence at all that warrants the denunciation of the opposition
by Yanukovych’s supporters or, indeed, by the Russian state
media, in terms of an uprising of fascism in the country, as they have
described it. Using the language of 1941 may be useful to opponents of

systematic constitutional reform. What are needed are democratic
institutions supported by popular elections to those institutions. What
is needed is a willingness to determine democratically the balances
between the different peoples in different parts of the country and the
platform for reconciliation that only they can construct. What is
decidedly not needed is any Russian statement about the potential need
for what it has called “fraternal intervention”. That
very phrase has a history, not least from the Czechoslovakian
intervention of 1968. It is fundamentally unhelpful to hear that
language because it leaves serious 
<?notus-xml column=756?>ambiguities as to what might happen next. No military intervention would
be tolerable, and President Obama is surely right: Ukraine is not a
piece on a Cold War chessboard. I assume that Her Majesty’s

choices between the European Union and Russia for the people of the

essential that Mr Lavrov understands the goals of greater
democracy in that country and a new generation potentially taking up
the mantle. The global consequences of any military intervention are
unthinkable. Ukraine is, whatever its financial difficulties—to
which I must return in a moment—after the European part of
Russia, the largest nation in Europe. It is rich in agriculture and
many other resources, and in its culture. It stands at a key strategic
frontier. Nothing could make a fraught situation worse than if there

observation after talking with Ukrainian diplomats in the past couple
of days. For the most part, they have said that they want to turn
towards Europe and the EU. These are matters of choice for them, not
me, but that is what they have expressed. They see it as a great
economic opportunity, which sadly they need greatly, but just as much
as a bulwark against corruption and a foundation for a reliable system
of rule of law. However, you will find that if you speak to them they
also think that the United Kingdom has far too little or possibly even
nothing to add to the argument that they want to advance. They will
tell you, without much diplomatic small talk, that the United
Kingdom’s attitude to Europe is, at best, one of weak
co-operation with that body that they aspire to join. At worst, the
attitude is one of somewhat bloody-minded hostility likely
to be seized on by those who are hostile, for nationalistic reasons, to
a Ukrainian future that is more closely bound with Europe. Those
diplomats take this matter seriously. Least of all can they
understand—and they made this point to me with some
strength—how the main party of government here in the United
Kingdom left the centre-right Christian democrat bloc, to which many
Ukrainians see themselves as fairly naturally aligned, to gravitate
towards a more extreme right alignment that they abhor and think is a
risk to their country. That risk is being seized upon by the

want to know what the United Kingdom can contribute to a peaceful
outcome. I suggest that it could start by appointing a dedicated
special envoy. This is a problem that is not going to go away overnight
and will need to be addressed over a period of time. Ukraine’s
economy is, as we have heard in the Statement, despite the fundamentals
that should augur well, close to being wrecked. Is Russia still willing
to contribute the financial support that it has hitherto offered to the
Yanukovyck regime, or has that offer been withdrawn? I hope that the
Minister will be in a position to tell us.</hs_para>

The Foreign Secretary has been talking to Mr Lavrov, as was said in the

horrifying. He is quite right. Nevertheless, the humanitarian appeal is
in desperate straits. We have called for a new donor conference to
build funds that are desperately needed. Will the noble Lord, Lord
Wallace, back this call this afternoon? What proposals do the
Government have to encourage the regime’s supporters, especially
Russia and Iran, to press Syria for a political settlement? There is
every reason to think, as the Statement says, that the Syrian regime is
not addressing the negotiations with any degree of seriousness. Assad
is not serious. What are the Government’s objections to
establishing a Syria contact group to encourage negotiations? As the

congratulations offered to the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton.
She probably feels burdened by congratulations these days but,
goodness knows, nobody deserves them more. We welcome the

sticking to the agreements it made last November. The number of

was set in November. What steps do Her Majesty’s Government
advocate to bring Iran into line with the deal that it itself has
agreed? How will the Government here review the sanctions regime? I
make none of these final points in order to be negative about what can
be achieved or, indeed, about what has been achieved, but I know that
these are conditions in which, if pressure is not continued in the
right direction, the opportunities for backsliding are profound, and
the dangers that come with them are still more profound.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for
his support for the Government’s approach. Perhaps I may simply
say that the British Government do not presume that they do anything on
their own in any of these circumstances. On Iran, we are working as
part of the E3+3, which, as the noble Lord said, the noble Baroness,
Lady Ashton, chairs so well. We are working on Syria with the Syrian
core group, which consists of European countries, the United States and
a number of Arab countries. The group continues to meet regularly as a
means of pulling together those most concerned about the future of
Syria. As the noble Lord said, the Foreign Secretary talks to his
opposite number in Russia on a very regular
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:18:56"></hs_TimeCode>. On
Ukraine, we gave active support to the Polish, German and French
Foreign Ministers in their efforts to help in Kiev. The Poles, after
all, have a common border with Ukraine—and, to some extent, a
common history—and we are part of a group of European countries
that are of course actively engaged. However, in none of these,
whatever Ukrainian diplomats may think, do we think that we operate
separately from our partners and allies in Europe, across the Atlantic
and across the Middle East.</hs_para>

Russians not to do anything to encourage parts of Ukraine to split off,
Crimea may in some ways be more of an immediate danger than south-east
Ukraine. It may be one of the impacts of what has been shown on
Ukrainian television in the past two or three days—in terms of
the depths of personal corruption of the Yanukovych regime—that
eastern Ukraine will be less prepared to resist the changes than it
might otherwise have been. The Yanukovych regime, which was most
strongly supported in the Donetsk region, as the noble Lord knows, has
been more thoroughly discredited that we anticipated three or four days
ago. Of course, what is happening in Ukraine is moving very rapidly and
it is unclear what will emerge. We are working with others; I take the
noble Lord’s point about whether we intend to appoint a special
UK envoy, but I suspect that my right honourable friend the Foreign
Secretary would say that we are working with others—we are part
of the international community on this—and we intend to go on
working with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

compliment made to the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton, we should also
recognise that, of the women doing extremely valuable work in

also doing a certain amount of very valuable and quite dangerous work

to which British women—Members of this House—are

a number of Governments, including our own, have said that the Vilnius
association agreement remains on the table for Ukraine, but I again
stress that we are not trying to make Ukrainians make a definitive
choice between joining the European Union and leaving the Russians
behind or the reverse. Clearly we have to find a solution through which
Ukraine can adopt a more open form of government and a much 
<?notus-xml column=759?>stronger sense of the rule of law, begin to rebuild its very battered
economy and restructure its enormous debts to a range of other
countries. That, however, requires a new Government to emerge and we

elections now set for May, to assist the interim Government in moving
in those

Falkner of Margravine (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I say to my noble
friend that I am extremely relieved to hear that the Foreign Secretary
is travelling to Washington to have discussions with the US
Administration but, more importantly, to have discussions with the
International Monetary Fund. Can he tell the House how much leverage we
have with the IMF? We know, of course, of its exasperation that
€300 billion was expended on very necessary eurozone bailouts
but that only €610 million was pledged to Ukraine before the
crisis started in November. Perhaps there has been a lack of urgency on
the part of the IMF-EU relationship with Ukraine that has led us to
where we are
now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022417000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022417000068">I
also congratulate the Foreign Secretary on the very measured tone that
he has taken in terms of Russia. We need to co-operate with Russia and
Ukraine and we also need Russia on Syria. However, on Syria—I do
not wish to detain the House, I will be brief—surely we need to
be tougher with Russia because we have wasted, some might say, two
opportunities now in Geneva without seeing any progress whatever. To
what extent might we help the Free Syrian Army to gain access to
weapons so that it can defend wives and

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> On Russia and Syria, I remind the
noble Baroness that the resolution passed on Saturday in the UN
Security Council was passed unanimously. This demonstrates, to an
extent, that the Russians are beginning to lose patience with the
regime, which is bombing, starving and besieging its own people
throughout much of the country. That is at least some step forward. Of
course we engage with the Russians as actively as we can on these and a
number of other
subjects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022417000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022417000070">On
the question of help to the Syrian National Council and the moderate

the House of Commons showed its unwillingness to provide

happen at some time but, at present, we are providing
non-lethal assistance to the Syrian opposition and will continue to do

relations with Iran. The more difficult and more complex our
relationships are with countries, the more important it is to have a
well plugged-in embassy in place and I hope very much that we will have
normal diplomatic relations with Iran as soon as may

echoes what the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, was saying, it seems that
the link between these three countries—Ukraine, Syria and
Iran—is the role of Russia. I was glad to hear that the Foreign

confirm that the strengthening of our engagement with Russia, both
bilaterally and through the EU and other international organisations to

conversations with the Foreign Secretary that he has been working
extremely hard over the past months and more to engage the Russians on
a wide range of issues; as the noble Lord will know from long
experience, this is not always easy. It has been something that we have
needed to do. Whether one calls the negotiating group on Iran the E3+3
or the P5+1, some of the members of that group are easier to work with
than others but we do try to hold them all

Crosby, as very shortly after Ukraine began emerging from the regional
history the two of us were invited to form part of a multinational

much background and without assistance. It is important that we

answer in some ways because, as the noble Lord well knows, there is a
very large variety of fighting groups. Indeed, in north-eastern Syria
in the past week or two the moderate forces in the opposition have been
fighting radical jihadis to expel them from ground otherwise occupied
by the opposition. However, my experience of the Geneva II talks so far
is that the representatives of the Syrian National Council have been
more coherent and more constructive than some had predicted in advance.
We are doing all we can to support the Syrian National Council in being
an inclusive body, including Kurdish and Christian representatives,
women and so on, and in strengthening its links with the moderate
fighting forces on the ground. Of course, the picture remains extremely
unclear. It is currently very difficult to get around inside Syria for
obvious reasons, but we are a little more confident than we were that

Russian Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol with the Ukrainian Black Sea
fleet, such as it is, not far away. I recall that someone for whom I
used to work, Admiral Sir James Eberle, was invited in the early 1990s
to advise the Russians and the Ukrainians on how the Black Sea fleet
should be divided between the two. His recommendation was that the best
thing was to scrap the entire fleet. Unfortunately, the advice was not

question on Ukraine. It seems to me that there are some
senses—not exactly repetitions—in which we are seeing
replayed some of the things that were not resolved in the early 1990s
with the collapse of the Soviet Union. I remember that at that time I
was working at Lambeth as the archbishop’s foreign secretary, as
it were, and on one occasion the telephone was brought to me in the
bath. There was a call from the gatekeeper telling me that Mr Gorbachev
was in captivity in the Crimea and he thought that I ought to know so
that I could do something about it. Some very good and quite low-key,
and low-cost, initiatives were taken by Her Majesty’s Government
at that time to support the development of democracy in the various
republics that resulted from the collapse of the Soviet Union,
including Ukraine. Can we be reassured that, once things become a
little more stable, those sorts of initiatives might be looked at
again? I am suggesting not carbon copies but that sort of
thing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:35:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

only the churches never recognised the division of Europe. The
Conference of European Churches always worked across Europe. There are
very serious divisions in the churches in the Ukraine, often reflecting
some of the fragmentations that exist in the country as a whole. Again,
that is another area where Her Majesty’s Government might work

close church links can be across national boundaries. I was in Armenia
some months ago and was met by a very chatty archbishop, who seemed to
know almost every bishop I had ever met in this country. However, we
all know that the Orthodox Church in and across the former Soviet Union
is a very complex and divided entity, and not all its branches are
committed to anything that we would recognise as a liberal approach to
organised religion. Sadly, the different branches of the church in

a much stronger and more helpful relationship with Ukraine than we have
done without putting at risk its relationship with Russia? I fully

I have to say to the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, that I think I can
beat her to help the new Ukrainian Government. The John F Kennedy

discussing UNSCR 2139, the Minister made the point that it was passed
unanimously, which is very much to be welcomed. However, did the
British Government press for it to be a chapter 7 resolution? As the
Statement rightly said, the passing of the resolution is an important
achievement but it will only make a practical difference if it is
implemented in full. As it is not a chapter 7 resolution, what
sanctions can be invoked if the siege of the 240,000 people continues;
if there continue to be 5,000 deaths every month in Syria; and if the
chemical weapons are not dismantled by 30 June this year? Without a

unspeakable suffering was being experienced by the children in Syria,
with some 10,000 of those killed so far being children. In the Foreign
Secretary’s Statement we heard about the barrel bombs that are
continuing to rain down on Aleppo; the sieges being undertaken in
places such as Homs, where people are being starved to death; and, in
previous times, the use of Sarin gas and the fact that only 11% of
chemical weapons have been removed thus far. Surely it is time for us

raised some significant questions and I look forward to hearing the
Minister’s answers. This amendment follows an ultimately rather
unsatisfactory discussion we had in Committee during which my noble
friends Lord McKenzie and Lady Hollis, along with the noble Baroness,
Lady Greengross, and others tried valiantly to get the Minister to
explain exactly when somebody would receive a communication from DWP to
warn them that the state pension they would get in future would not be
the same as what they might have expected. I went back and reread the
record. I think the answer we got was that they would get a statement
if or when they asked for it and then normally only digitally. The
Minister kindly arranged for officials to explain their communications
strategy to Peers, and I am genuinely grateful for that. However I
think it is fair to say that the exercise did not entirely allay our
fears or perhaps fill out all the gaps in our knowledge. I hope the
Minister is looking forward to finding a consultancy fee for my noble

last point is one made by my noble friend Lady Turner. The Association
of British Insurers had also stressed that adequate communication was
essential because it was important that people did not feel unclear
about how much they would receive, and it should be clear that they
would need to save. That is a crucial drive behind all of these reforms
and the Labour reforms that preceded them. People need to understand

£144 now that they would lose that in future. The committee

opportunity since then to reflect on them. First, how and when do the
Government propose to contact people to tell them of the changes to

people who have previously requested and received a pension statement

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:56:18"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, the
single-tier pension reforms are designed to simplify the current state
pension system, to make it easier for people to understand what they
will get from the state in retirement. More so than for other reforms,
therefore, communication is critical to success, so I
certainly share the interest that noble Lords have shown in
this issue. Effective communication requires both the right message and
the right channel for delivering that message. This forms the basis for
our communication strategy to support these reforms, a summary of which
I circulated to noble Lords this morning and which will be placed in
the
Library.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000018">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:57:04"></hs_TimeCode>

pension statements will remain a key communication with future
pensioners and will be an important vehicle for helping
individuals understand how they are affected by the reforms.
The introduction of these reforms gives us the opportunity to radically
transform the way we currently provide this statement service. Our
ultimate vision is to provide an online system that is integrated with
HMRC’s national insurance data, enabling people to access this
information at a time to suit them and in a way that allows them to
model the impact of gaining further qualifying years.</hs_para>

that we would provide statements that reflect the single-tier rules

those affected by the reforms. However, we believe there is trade-off
in terms of providing information we have available based on current
system amounts while trying to minimise the
distribution of information that is potentially
misleading or simply begs further questions.
Noble Lords may wish to note that we are therefore currently
reviewing the information we can provide to customers prior to April
2016 to ensure that it is as accurate and helpful as possible. We will

specifics of the amendment. It sets out an approach for issuing
periodic notifications to all citizens over the age of 45 advising them
of the state pension statement service. The department has previously
undertaken various forms of direct mailing to people in relation to
state pensions. Indeed, between 2003 and 2006 the department issued
many millions of unsolicited automatic pension forecasts across the
working age population. Unfortunately, independent research found no
real evidence of any significant response to these mailings. Only 33%
of recipients could recall without prompting having received the
forecast, and only 31% actually read the mailing. More importantly, the
research showed that there was no significant difference in the
retirement planning actions undertaken by recipients of the forecasts
when compared with non-recipients. This, combined with the operational
costs, resulted in the termination of unsolicited pension
forecasts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

something that they have not asked for, it is most likely to be
forgotten or ignored. However, when people ask for information, they
are ready to get it and do something with it. Our communications
approach will sow the seeds of the change, setting out the store in the
channels that people read and hear every day, providing them with
reasons to seek further information for themselves at the right time
for them. It may or may not be that the draft provided by the noble
Baroness is exactly what turns people towards wanting to investigate,
but we will do the research to find out what actually works. The noble
Baroness referred to nudge approaches and the use of behavioural
insights. We are absolutely committed to testing such approaches. We
believe that there is merit in getting messages to people through the
newspapers they read and the magazines they buy. We have already seen
the success of such approaches and we can see that they do prompt or
nudge people to consider their plans for
retirement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:03:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

not proof that direct mail will never be an effective method of
communicating with members of the public, particularly given the
behavioural change we are witnessing as automatic enrolment is rolled
out. However, undertaking direct mailings comes at a cost, and an
initiative such as that proposed in the amendment could cost in excess
of £5 million in the first year of implementation
alone. Before committing to such expenditure, we think it is essential
to test different approaches to raising awareness 
<?notus-xml column=770?>of the statement service to understand their effectiveness. Noble Lords
will already be aware that I am committed to this type of approach,
such as in the support provided for the introduction of universal
credit. During 2014-15 we will be undertaking trials of direct mailing
alongside other communication approaches. This will allow us to
identify how the right balance of timing, message, channel and
environment can lead to greater awareness among individuals and
encourage them to take action as appropriate. Depending on the outcome
of these trials, we will decide which communication approaches are most
effective as part of our ongoing communications

baseline across all our audience group to measure awareness and
understanding. This will be remeasured every six months and will be
published, which will inform our approach as we refine and improve it.
I can assure noble Lords that following Royal Assent we will track
levels of awareness about state pensions and the reforms across the
population on a regular basis. The research findings will enable us to
identify specific groups that our messages are not reaching, or where
the messages are not easily understood, so that we can take action
accordingly. Our communications strategy is designed to cater for the
needs of different audiences. We recognise the need to test our
approach as we go, and as part of this we will undertake the trials
that I have mentioned. It is right to do this before committing to
undertaking full-scale direct mailings, or indeed any other form of
communication, which may not deliver any significant increase in
awareness or action. In the light of this, I urge the noble Baroness to

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to thank my
noble friends Lady Turner and Lady Sherlock for their contributions. I
understand that the Minister is as committed as could reasonably be
expected to trying to ensure that people are aware of and fully
knowledgeable about their entitlements. I accept and absolutely
understand that there is considerable virtue in having an
evidence-based policy by building it up on the results of research into
the most effective lines of communication. I also agree that a variety
of responses may be wanted, including press, mailings and online, but I
have to say that I would worry if it was largely dependent on online
information, given what we know about many people’s
recalcitrance over using online facilities as UC is rolled out. It may
be that it is a generational thing and that over the next decade to
20 years the recalcitrance begins to disappear, particularly
if places such as Norfolk end up actually having access to
broadband<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:06:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000027">My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:08:09"></hs_TimeCode>
difficulty is that the Minister has a policy premised on the fact that
those who know that they do not know will make the inquiry. The problem
is around those who do not know that they do not know, and I am not
confident that he has in place a strategy to make them aware of it. In
the past, the people who were most vulnerable would have been married
women who had been in and out of the labour market according to their
caring responsibilities. They had a very straightforward safety net by
the fact that they could have 60% of the husband’s pension as a
baseline, and only if their own contributions exceeded that, as 
<?notus-xml column=771?>increasingly they have begun to do, would they draw on their own
contributions. That is no longer the case. So the 60% married
women’s pension is being withdrawn without, as far as I can see,
ensuring that those women know, first, that they are losing what they
would have counted on in the past and which is common knowledge, and
secondly, what other benefits—or credits, I should
say—they may be entitled to claim because that information is
not being sent out to them in
lieu<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:08:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022426000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000028">I think that the
Minister has a problem here. We are on the same side and I fully accept
that he wants to make sure that people are aware of this, but I do not
think he really understands what happens when the safety net of the
married women’s dependency pension which has existed for 50-odd
years is pulled away and women are told that they are on their own. He
does not actually know, understand or appreciate what it may be like to
find the headspace, resources and capacity to change behaviour in order
to build up a pension. I am sure that this is not a gender point, but I
really do not think that the Minister understands where women like that
may be coming from. In the past, as the Minister will know, we had
deficiency notices under NIRS 2. They told you whether you had
incomplete NI records. When the computer, on which the Minister is
relying so heavily, toppled over in the late 1990s or thereabouts and
we could not get it back on its feet for several years, we increasingly
lengthened the period during which someone could buy back their NICs or
make contributions accordingly to cover the lack of deficiency notices.
We were willing to do it then for everybody on an annual basis, as far
as I recall, before the computer toppled over, yet the Minister is
reluctant to go back to that. I understand the point about mailings and
so on, but at the very least I press the Minister to identify in his
research the at-risk group. For my money, the at-risk group are women,
particularly married women, who had relied on the 60% married
women’s pension, who were perhaps unaware in the past of the
credits they could have claimed, including carer’s credits, and
they are not on the
list.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000029">I would
like some assurance from the Minister—it could just be a nod if
he likes—that the at-risk group in particular can be identified.
At 65 or 66, they could find themselves on their own with an incomplete
state pension and it is too late to do anything about it because we
have failed to keep nudging them. If the Minister could give me that
assurance, I would be

Freud:</Member></B> I would be very comfortable giving the noble
Baroness that assurance. Clearly, a generalised mailing out is exactly
what we are concerned about. The evidence is that people will get
official-looking letters which they do not look at. We have to find a
way of getting to the most vulnerable groups, who may take a
Rumsfeldian attitude—they do not know what they do not
know—and we have to find a way through that. Therefore, I can
give the noble Baroness that assurance. I think we are basically agreed
around this Chamber about the need to get the communication right, but
we need to do the research. There is no point in us making it up

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, we move to a new subject:
deferred pension and how it may be taken, whether as income or lump
sum. Over the past 15 years, most pensioners have for the first time
been lifted out of poverty. In 1997 nearly half of pensioners were
below the poverty line. It is now about one in seven: 14%, compared to
nearly 50%. Pensions have risen three times faster than earnings,
pension credit has topped up their income and now, we are pleased to
say, pensioners are no more likely to be poor than any other group in
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000044">With
pension credit for most future pensioners being absorbed into the new,
more generous state pension, together with the guarantee of the triple
lock, that journey out of poverty continues. Pensioners’
incomes, especially for those with no occupational pension, will be
stronger and more stable than ever before. It is good news and I am
delighted. I congratulate the Government on it, I really
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000045">We know,
in any case, that most pensioners are very careful and spend up to
their income and no more. They cope and they avoid debt like the devil.
However, the growing problem is that those pensioners dependent on the
state system, who may in future have a more adequate state pension, are
also less and less likely to go into retirement with some modest
savings as a cushion against rainy days or as a resource to meet lumpy
expenditure. Currently, 21% of pensioners—one in
five—have no savings whatever; 37%, more than a third, have less
than £3,000 in savings; and half have less than £8,000.
If the Minister gives us any mean averages, they are frankly a waste of
time, as they were in a previous debate about
hours.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000046">Pensioners<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:20:40"></hs_TimeCode>

Lords, like me, have been slightly shocked in the past week or two to
receive an energy bill rather larger than anticipated. The roof may
need substantial work, especially after the gales, and may

If they live in rural Norfolk, they may need to replace their old car

an outstanding mortgage and want to pay it off. What do the one in five

have, understandably, concentrated on building up pensioners’
incomes, and rightly so. However, we have largely ignored the issue of
accessible pensioner savings for those of modest income. You can always
turn capital into income—you just draw it down as you need it

£400 or more to pay the winter quarter energy bill from state
pension income alone if you have no savings on which to draw. In other
words, pensioners need savings, just as we all do, and too often they

recognised this when we did the deal with what was then Age Concern as
we introduced pension credit in, I think, about 2002. The first
£10,000 of savings would be disregarded for pension credit,
although thereafter there was a high notional tariff rate. We
recognised this need for savings when my noble friend Lord McKenzie
made means-testing far more light-touch as pensioners became older.
That is why, incidentally, I am seriously bothered about the new class
3A contributions, which encourage pensioners to use up capital to buy a
year of S2P, taking an unwise gamble on their life expectancy,
increasing their income by a bit but heavily reducing their capital.
That is very

all, we recognised this when, back in 2005, we allowed pensioners who
had deferred drawing their state pension to take that saved-up pension
either as an income addition to their future pension—which is
what most did—or as a lump sum to give them some savings. The
Government propose to abolish the choice of taking that saved-up
pension as a lump sum; it will be available to people only as an
addition to the state pension. They are removing the choice of a
savings sum from future pensioners. Currently, of the 1.2
million who defer their pensions, 63,000 take the lump sum, which was,
on average, just under £14,000. In future, that option will be
scrapped. Why? The Minister for Pensions, Steve Webb, is absolutely
clear that he is doing it to “simplify the system”. It is
not about costs at all, he says, just about simplicity. What is so
difficult to understand about a lump sum of your two years or so
deferred pension? It is complex, the Minister says, because DWP needs a
64-page leaflet to explain the choice. The Minister in your
Lordships’ House, the noble Lord, Lord Freud, says the
same.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000050">As<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:24:24"></hs_TimeCode>
the Minister would expect, I have that 64-page leaflet. It is well
written—well done to the DWP—simple to understand and
straightforward. I have worked through it. I calculate that if, in the
name of simplicity, you removed the choice of a lump sum and allowed
only an increase in the pension, you would remove precisely 11 pages in
total—I will give him the references if he wishes—so that
the 64 pages would come down to 53. The rest of the pamphlet would
remain unchanged 
<?notus-xml column=776?>apart from occasionally deleting the words “or lump sum”
from, for example: what happens when I die, if I get divorced or if I
am widowed; can I combine them; what if I live abroad; what are the
effects on my benefits or on my tax; where can I find out more; what
organisations may help me; and so on. That is what the 53 pages are
largely about. All that applies to any deferred state pension, whether
it is taken as an increment or as a lump sum—the argument of
simplicity does not wash at all. It is a complete myth, and if anybody
worked through that pamphlet, they would see it for themselves. I am
confident that the Minister has worked through that pamphlet and I am
therefore confident that he will agree with my assertion that it
removes only 11 pages out of 64 in the name of simplicity, thus denying
choice to people who want to exercise that choice. Taking out that
choice in the name of alleged simplicity is, frankly,
laughable—it is absurd. I have never seen such a trivial
justification. It takes 11 out of 64 pages and thereby denies the
choice of a savings lump sum to 65,000 people. I presume the Minister
thinks people can understand 53 pages but that 64 pages is just too
much. Really? Because he thinks, without any evidence, that they cannot
manage those extra 11 pages, he will take the decision out of their
hands and make it himself. He knows better than pensioners what they
should do with their money. He cannot trust people who have been
working and scrimping for 50 years not to waste any
savings—their money—that they may
accrue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000051">Mind
you, if you have a private occupational pension and get a 25% lump sum
tax-free, that is fine. You can do what you want with it. If you simply
defer your S2P element, your additional pension, for two years you can
take that as a lump sum. The Minister will not tell you how to spend
that either. However, on a state pension, he is taking away the
possibility of a lump sum—your money—that you have saved
for, because, frankly, he does not trust you with it and is calling it
simplicity if he takes 11 pages out of a 64-page
pamphlet.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000052">Some
people, after two years’ deferral, may want that £14,000
of their money rather than the alternative of £14 a week. I
would. They would be better off taking the £14 per week instead
of a lump sum only if they live, I calculate, a further 20 years until
they are aged 87. Those without savings are also poorer and least
likely even to reach 80, let alone 87. Who are we talking about? They
may be husbands working longer until their younger wife also reaches
state pension age. They may both work longer, and one takes the income
and the other the lump sum. They may have a somewhat impaired life
expectancy; perhaps one is a smoker and they want the lump sum up front
just in case that person does not survive to 87. The unspent portion of
the lump sum can be inherited by the surviving spouse and would help
cushion her—but if taken as increased income it dies with
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022426000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022426000053">We
rightly spend hours trying to encourage people of working age to work
longer. We rightly spend hours trying to get them to save. We know we
need to build a savings culture. In a low-paid job, perhaps the only
way they may be able to build savings is to defer their state pensions
for a year or two, work a bit longer and take it as a lump sum. That
may subsequently save them needing to get loans at huge interest rates
because 
<?notus-xml column=777?>they have a lumpy bill, perhaps an energy bill, to meet. It allows them
to make choices, which each one of us in this House takes for granted.
Having just that extra margin in savings means that they can decide to
help a grandchild, buy a washing machine that works, replace the
carpet, celebrate a golden wedding anniversary, turn up the heating
when it freezes or give a donation to their local church. They cannot
do that out of income. They need savings. It is their choice, not ours.
Pensioners, as they enter pension age, are moral adults and we should
respect that and respect them. They have earned the right to that
choice and we—and the Government—have absolutely no right
at all to take that choice away. I beg to

airing in Committee, I confess that I do not yet feel that I properly
understand the nature of the Government’s objections to the
taking of lump sums. My noble friend Lady Hollis explained her case for
this, and there is no doubt that we have a crisis of savings in this
country. Too many people do not have a safety net for a rainy day, and
British households generally do not have enough money in savings. That
amount has been falling in recent years—unsurprisingly, given
the pressures on the cost of living. The case made by my noble friend

did not get answers to some of the questions which I put to the

have worked through who will be affected by this, what the impact will
be and what the alternatives are? Secondly, can they explain clearly
why they are doing it? On the first point—and I did ask

to confirm whether that is why they are deferring, or are they
deferring because they are still working and have not saved enough to

deferring their pensions? These questions matter because they would go
to the points made by my noble friend Lady Hollis about whether people

of all, I would like to understand what the Government’s

simplicity was made and has been pretty well dispatched, so I will not
revisit it. Another argument raised was that significant numbers of

we know from the data given to us that more than three-quarters of
those people are living in the UK, so that is probably not the issue.
Is it the administrative burden? Perhaps the Minister could tell us

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, in designing the single-tier reforms our
overriding aim has been to deliver a flat-rate pension above the basic
level of the means test without increasing spending, and to do so in a
way that recognises people’s contributions under the current
system. This is not easy to do and it involves difficult trade-offs.
Some elements of the transition necessarily generate costs in the early
years, particularly the “better of” calculation, which
means that people with low amounts of additional state pension, such as
carers, receive a boost. There is also the fact that those with high
amounts of additional state pension, which take them over the full
amount of the single-tier pension, are able to keep the surplus as a
protected payment. Nevertheless, we have been able to stay within 1% of
projected expenditure until 2040, which is fair to current pensioners
and to future taxpayers.</hs_para>

question of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, removal of the lump sum
option for those who defer their state pension has played a key role in
flattening expenditure. The early-year savings that this delivers have
been ploughed back into the single-tier design. We are, however, still
keen to preserve some flexibility for single-tier pensioners who, by
choice or accident, claim after they reach state pension age, so people
will still be able to build up an increase to their state pension that
is paid on top of their single-tier entitlement for the rest of their
lives. As discussed in Grand Committee, there remains the option of
backdating a claim for a single-tier pension. By backdating their claim
to a state pension, someone who has delayed claiming for whatever
reason—either unintentionally or as part of a planned
retirement—will be able to get up to 12 months’ arrears
when they make their claim for a pension. This would provide someone
who has qualified for the maximum weekly amount of

take the example of someone who delays claiming the maximum amount for
two years and wants to backdate their claim for the 12 months. If we
take the £144 example, they would get an increment of around
£7.50 to £8 a week, depending on the value of the
uprating, which would be added to their weekly entitlement. It would
also include the calculation of arrears due to them for the backdated

may sound like a technical concern, but the timing of expenditure is
vital. Without making offsetting savings elsewhere in the single-tier
package, Governments in the early years of single tier would be forced
to divert more spending towards the state pension system than under the
current scheme, which means more government borrowing for future
generations to shoulder, or less to spend on today’s priorities.
We simply do not believe it is right to make this trade-off to enhance
the personal financial management options for a relatively small group

That is very interesting. I had a discussion with his right honourable

confirm the conversation, and there were witnesses—that this had
nothing to do with cost but was only about simplicity. May I at least
suggest that the Minister talks to his right honourable friend and
agrees a common line on this? At the moment, one says it is all about
cost and the other says it is nothing to do with cost but is all about
simplicity. I suspect that the Minister in our House is probably

to the point about simplicity, frankly, it is absurd. I checked my

those, on taxing the lump sum, would be regarded as any form of
challenge beyond a reading age of seven and a quarter—so the

Resolution 2106 notes that rape and other forms of sexual violence in
armed conflict are war crimes and calls upon member states to comply
with their obligations by investigating and prosecuting those who are
subject to their jurisdiction who are responsible for such crimes.
Further, the resolution recognises the need for accurate information

protection advisers. A second resolution, UN Security Council
Resolution 2122, unanimously agreed in October 2013, looks at the
UN’s own responsibilities by, for example, strengthening the
Security Council’s commitment to deliver this agenda by ensuring
UN departments provide effective reporting and increase women’s
participation in conflict resolution and peacebuilding processes. It
also reiterates the Security Council’s decision to hold a

Now here comes the “but”. With any such complicated
initiative with far-reaching implications, both across and between
Governments, nationally and globally, there will always be room for
improvement, both by better co-ordination and clearer resourcing. This
is, therefore, a two-stage process with immediate and longer-term
objectives. The need to focus, in the first instance, on keeping women
and girls safe is absolutely understood. However, this is a problem
based on power and women and girls will not be safe while they remain
powerless. Plans which build on women’s involvement and
participation in the decision-making processes in their neighbourhoods,
regions and countries will contribute towards shifting the power away
from men and towards women and will help to bring about the cultural
shifts which are so badly needed.</hs_para>

action plan. What is meant by participation? I would argue that
participation must be seen in its deepest and widest sense: at local,
regional and national level; in policy development around access to
education, healthcare, employment, finance, et cetera; in the drafting
of relevant legislation; in constitutional change and in access to
democratic processes which enable women to become involved in all

women’s organisations. That way, national action plans can best
be developed and implemented and progress monitored to ensure the
delivery of the NAP objectives. This work must also ensure that
women’s NGOs are invited to participate in official meetings,
particularly when those meetings are attended by Ministers or other
decision-makers, where local voices can well make the decisions taken
more relevant and more easily implemented. Involvement of local
women’s organisations also informs and guides priorities;
changes to so-called social norms can best be led by these

to the question of funding, there needs to be the political will to
allocate ring-fenced resources for this particular work, and there
needs to be exemplar interdepartmental co-operation to make sure we get
the biggest bang for our buck. Although significant sums have been
allocated to various programmes, some run by DfID, some by the FCO and
others through the MoD, there have never been any dedicated or
ring-fenced moneys allocated to the national action plan. This can
cause uncertainty and can also lead to a less than strategic approach.
For example, women, peace and security criteria have been included in
Strengthening Alliances and Partnerships within the Conflict Pool as
part of the Building Stability Overseas strategy but it does not
ring-fence funding for thematic priorities such as women, peace and
security. Also, the Conflict Pool does not have a centrally driven
approach and, although local influences are invaluable, an overarching
strategy must surely be key to achieving the best delivery outcomes.

However, as I was just discussing with the noble Baroness, Lady
Prosser, in the Prince’s Chamber, these matters are so crucial

the rest of the world to know how much we in this Chamber care and

back to basics with a reminder of what the NAP actually is. The UK
national action plan provides a framework to ensure that the provisions
of UNSCR 1325 and associated resolutions are incorporated into the
Government’s work on violent conflict. The creation of a new UK
cross-government plan provides an opportunity to outline how UNSCR 1325
can be integrated into wider defence, diplomacy and development
measures, and adopted in armed conflict and post-conflict situations.
It helps the Government to identify priorities, determine
responsibilities and develop measurements against which progress can be
measured at the national
level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000012">Why do
we need such a plan? The horrendous impact of conflict on women around
the world has long been underestimated and, in many cases, brushed
under the carpet. More than half of armed conflicts reignite within a
decade of peace. At the heart of this problem lie flawed peacebuilding
efforts which have often excluded 50% of the affected population:
women. Over the past 50 years, the nature of conflict has changed;
almost all modern conflicts are intra-state, although external dynamics
still influence conflict realities. This means that it is more
dangerous than ever to be a civilian in today’s
conflicts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000013">As
wars shift from the battlefields to communities, civilians now suffer
more than ever. In World War I, approximately 10% of all deaths were of
non-combatants; in Iraq, since 2003, civilians account for around 90%
of all fatalities. These changes have impacted enormously on women and
modern peacebuilding and security agendas must address this challenge.

do not suppose I will be the only person using that quote today. It is
time for the UK and the international community to recognise this and
move forward to an era where women are free from impunity. The UN
Security Council’s renewed determination to bring women into the

I think that one would expect that. However, the five remaining

instructive about the absence of sign-up to national action plans is
south Asia, as a region. Of the five countries in south Asia,
four—India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka—have
persistent, ongoing and long conflicts, yet not a single one of them

role of civil society and cross-learning, upon which both the UN
Secretary-General in his report and, indeed, we, have put quite a lot
of emphasis. It is not clear to me how much of our funding supports
cross-learning. As an example, I draw the House’s attention to a
Zambian programme supported by Oxfam, called “I Care About
Her”. The programme is an illustration of where they have given
up on trying to educate men through the conventional
methodologies—the church, educational programmes, leaflets and
so on—and have decided to educate men in a rather different way:
by asking them which women were important in their lives. The answer
came back quite clearly that men in Zambia considered mothers, sisters
and daughters to be the important women in their lives, not their
wives. The greater extent of the violence against women was against
wives. The re-education focused on showing that the women who were the
subjects of violence were somebody else’s mother, daughter or
sister. It has been a hugely successful programme, and Oxfam should be
commended for it. I hope my noble friend will be able to tell us if
they are funding cross-learning of that sort from one country to
another<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:07:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

role in preventing conflict, preventing violence against women,
protection of women, and women’s social, economic and political

commit to an ambitious plan to take this

has called for 15% of peacebuilding funding to be allocated to women,
peace and security. However, when the NAP was discussed in the other
place, the Minister, Mark Simmonds, refused to make such a commitment,
saying that the Government do not want to be restricted to any
percentage amount. In view of this, will the Minister tell the House
how we can be confident that women, peace and security is integrated
into all funding in conflict-affected countries, and how funding is
likely to be monitored, such as through a gender marker? Further, could
we have clarification on whether the conflict, stability and security
fund will include a focus on women, peace and security? Can we have an
assurance that women’s protection and participation and the
prevention of violence against women and girls will ensure that women,
peace and security is a priority for the

leadership and participation, UN Resolution 1325 makes it very clear
that there must be women’s participation and leadership in
domestic and international peace, security and justice issues. The
facts are, however, that since 2010 only one in five ambassadors has
been a women; there has been very little representation of women in
leadership positions in the Armed Forces and MoD; and there are no
women as chairs or deputy chairs of the Cabinet committee. Against that
rather discouraging background, how does the Minister consider that in
the new NAP the issue of women’s 
<?notus-xml column=790?>leadership in the UK will be addressed? In addition, how will we fulfil
commitments made to UN Resolution 1325? Women’s participation
must feature as a priority across diplomatic, military and development

Tonge (Ind LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble
Baroness on introducing this debate, looking forward as it does to the
publication of 
<?notus-xml column=791?>the new action plan. Of course, I am very pleased that the UK is leading
on this issue, but I want to widen the debate a little. We talk
constantly of the empowerment of women, which is a very noble debate,
but empowerment is hindered by two main factors. The power of men, of
course, is the number one factor and very important. I remember in
South Sudan years ago being asked to talk to the women of a certain
area about their problems and possible ways of engaging them in
decision-making. It took me all morning to persuade the men that we did
not want them present at the discussions. A compromise was eventually
reached in the end and the men encircled us, but at a distance where I
thought that if we talked quietly they would not hear our conversation.
I hope the women did not get beaten that evening, but they probably
did<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:20:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000045">The
other factor holding women back is our own physiology. Women cannot be
empowered if they have too many children and too much work to do. They
have not the time to sit on councils and engage in decision-making at
any level. As chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Population,
Development and Reproductive Health, I must impress on Ministers over
and again that the most useful intervention that we can make to empower
women is to ensure that family planning supplies are available to
control their fertility voluntarily. Some 220 million women are still
without access to contraceptive supplies, with 250,000 women dying in
childbirth and millions more suffering chronic ill heath and injury as
a result of there being no healthcare when their babies are born. There
is no empowerment for them or for the women raped in conflict with no
access to emergency contraception or safe abortion in conflict
situations, even though humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions
decree that it should be
available<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:21:55"></hs_TimeCode>. No
empowerment either for the girls who leave education at puberty to be
married and start having babies far too early for their immature
bodies. Empowerment is but a dream. Therefore, engagement in any of
these decision-making processes is
impossible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:22:18"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:20:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000046">Look
at our own history. Our less well-off grandmothers took little part in
society or decision-making, even if they had accessed higher education,
because of the burdens of unplanned pregnancies. Contraception freely
available will also help to prevent overpopulation and diminishing
resources, especially water. There is more and more evidence showing
this. This is another and major cause of conflict—the battle for
scarce resources. Too many youths in particular, with little hope of
jobs, are fighting for scanty food and water, which means more
conflict, more suffering for women and less chance of their
empowerment<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:23:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000047">This

Northover (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the noble
Baroness, Lady Prosser, for securing this important debate and for her
tireless work in this area. I thank her and other speakers for the
tributes they paid to the Government on the work that has been done,
and note the comments about progress that is yet to
come<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:34:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000063">The
noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, is right to say that the powerlessness of
women is at the root of this problem, which is why the education of
women, ensuring that they are independent, have bank accounts and
participate at all levels of society is key. As she said that, I found
myself thinking about groups that I met in India over the past few
days. I could see that DfID’s support for women and girls was
transformational, but also how far we have to go. It is in the light of
this that we need to assess what is happening in terms of women, peace
and
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000064">We
firmly share the view so powerfully expressed in this debate that women
must be at the heart of peace and security. They are central to efforts
to prevent violent conflict overseas and to build strong societies yet
too often, as speakers have said, women and girls are excluded from
peace processes and continue to be especially vulnerable to violence,
with dreadful
consequences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000065">The
UN estimates that at least one out of every three women around the
world has been beaten, coerced into sex, or otherwise abused in their
lifetime. Although women and children represent 90% of casualties of
conflict, only 8% of participants in peace negotiations have been
women. Of nearly 600 peace agreements signed between 1990 and 2010,
only 16% contained references to women. Looking more widely, women are
too often marginalised in society generally. For example, they account
for only 21% of parliamentarians globally, and would not be at that
level but for
quotas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000066">There
is international consensus on what needs to be done. The UN Security
Council set this out in 2000, in its Resolution 1325, and in the six
resolutions since mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser. The
council called for action under four pillars: women’s
participation in building peace; preventing conflict and preventing
violence against women and girls; protecting them; and making them
central to the provision of humanitarian relief and a society’s
recovery from
conflict.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000067">The
UK can be pleased with how far we have come across government to put
women and girls at the centre of policy. As my noble friend Lady Jenkin
mentioned, my right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary is leading
an international effort to shatter a culture of impunity for sexual
violence in conflict, building global momentum and taking practical
action on the ground, including deploying experts to help in countries
ranging from the DRC to Syria, and from Bosnia to Mali. The Global
Summit to End Sexual Violence in Conflict, to which noble Lords
referred, will take place in June, and 140 countries, international
organisations and members of civil society will come together to
discuss and agree what more we can do to 
<?notus-xml column=795?>tackle these terrible crimes. I will take back my noble friend Lady

noble friend Lady Falkner flagged up those countries that do not have
national action plans. I assure her that we are working bilaterally
with such countries on security and justice reform, preventing violence

International Development, as many noble Lords will know, works very
hard to try to prevent violence against women and girls. Its strategic
vision for girls and women promotes women and girls’ health and
rights, and their access to economic resources and
education—very much building upon the ideas that the noble
Baroness, Lady Prosser, outlined. It builds women’s political
and civil participation and puts women’s and girls’ needs
at the centre of our humanitarian response. It makes the policy
arguments, including at the UN Commission on the Status of Women and in
the debate about what follows the 2015 millennium development goals.
Noble Lords will know that the United Kingdom is pushing hard
for<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:36:40"></hs_TimeCode> a
stand-alone goal on gender. My honourable friend Lynne Featherstone is
the Government’s champion on tackling violence against women and

mentioned the Ministry of Defence. Its goals cover personnel, training
and operations, as noble Lords will know. It regularly reviews the
employability of women in the Armed Forces and aims to ensure that
gender is understood in all that the MoD does. The noble Baronesses,
Lady Kinnock and Lady Thornton, flagged up this area in particular. The
MoD constantly reviews training and includes sexual violence scenarios
in pre-deployment. Operational planning for new theatres will take into
consideration tackling sexual
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>. NATO
has carried out a lot of work towards integrating UN Security Council
Resolution 1325 and gender perspectives into its command structure.
This is a template that the Ministry of Defence can apply. We are also
looking at the example set by Canada in terms of training overseas, and
are seeking to see whether that can be brought into the way in which we
do things through the Ministry of Defence. In terms of senior
leadership, which the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, mentioned, we have,
according to this note here, two female air vice-marshals in the
Ministry of Defence, so we are making some progress but are acutely
aware of the challenges that the MoD faces. I am sure that her comments
will be taken note

equally important, whether through the Home Office’s work to end
violence against women and girls or the Government’s agenda to

UN Security Council calls for member states to deliver on all four
pillars through national action plans. The UK adopted its first such
plan in 2006 and we will soon, as noble Lords mentioned, launch our
third plan, for the next three years. My noble friend Lady Hodgson is
right that this needs to be strategic and joined up across government
for it to have its best effect. I read with enormous interest the
independent review of the previous national action plan, which makes
this point very
clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0002.htm#14022433000075">The
challenge for the next plan is to bring together all the work that we
do—we recognise that—and to ensure that we deliver both
globally and on the ground and test our plans against what those in
this field are saying to us. We will bring under one framework our work
on the Preventing Sexual Violence Initiative, the strategic vision for
girls and women and the call to action on protecting women in
emergencies, as well as our work at the UN Security Council and at the
Commission on the Status of Women. I hope that this reassures noble
Lords, including the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock, that that is the
approach that we are
taking<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T20:40:36"></hs_TimeCode>. My noble
friend Lady Hodgson asked about the review of the national action plan
and whether it will continue to be reviewed annually and reported to

hold frequent meetings about it.</hs_para>

are also learning from what appears to be working. DfID has a fund of,
I think, £25 million—I do not have the exact figure in
front of me—which is a research and innovation fund. My noble
friend Lady Falkner asked about what we were learning; that fund is
seeking to analyse what works and, therefore, what should be taken
forward further. We are seeking to bring all this together; I think
that that is vital. We will deliver multilaterally, through the United
Nations, NATO and the European Union and now also in partnership with
the African Union. We will put in place stringent monitoring and
evaluation to assess the impact and outcomes of our actions and to
capture the changes that our national action plan will make for girls
and women on the ground. We will integrate women, peace and security
issues into the work of the new Conflict, Stability and Security Fund.
I hope that that reassures the noble Baroness, Lady Kinnock.</hs_para>

can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, that there will be
central guidance from the fund on women, peace and security, although
our conclusion is that a ring-fenced allocation would in fact encourage
programme designers to take a compartmentalised approach to women. We
think that it is extremely important, as that review indicates, to look
at this strategically and make sure that it runs right through all the
various programmes, but I understand people’s concern and the
necessity to make sure that is does indeed run though every

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, with Clause 24 and Schedule 14 we
deal with the impact of the ending of contracting out on existing
occupational, or work-based, pension schemes. The impact is pretty
severe, being up to 5% of the income of those schemes. The Government
have provided some measures in Schedule 14 and Clause 24 that allow
employers effectively either to increase the contributions of employees
but not of employers or to cut back on the benefits of those schemes. I
do not approve of that way of dealing with the situation for either the
public or the private sectors. Of course, ending contracting out
impacts on both sectors. Although Clause 24 is primarily about the
private sector, there are a couple of related questions on the public
sector that I should like to put to the Minister.</hs_para>

seen, I am not 
<?notus-xml column=799?>clear as to the Government’s position on follow-up to that
meeting in relation to the Local Government Pension Scheme. Of course,
the Local Government Pension Scheme affects a large number of
employers, not only local authorities but others in the public, private
and third sectors. It is therefore important that some understanding of
the stability of those schemes in future public expenditure allocations
is established. It would be useful to hear of any progress on that or

to some of the schemes which are now in the private sector, Amendment
14 goes some way to meeting the concerns expressed on behalf of the
post-privatisation schemes where guarantees were given that there would
not be any diminution in the benefits from such schemes at the point of
privatisation. So anyone who was in a scheme before that point should
have been covered. I welcome that. However, I have a concern about the
definition of “protected person”. The amendment refers to
it being defined in regulations, whereas the schemes to which the
Government have referred in their statements on electricity, railways,
nuclear decommissioning and coal do not cover all the people who were
given guarantees post-privatisation. For example, the guarantees for
gas workers were written into the deeds of the scheme but were
nevertheless promises backed by the Government. I should therefore like
to know how far into the area of protected persons the regulations are
likely to go. If the noble Lord wishes to write to me on that front I
would be grateful but, in any case, out of equity, it ought to be
addressed in the same way for every group of workers affected during
that period of major privatisation of the utilities and other
nationalised

Government have provided in Clause 24 and Schedule 14 a way
out for others who are in private sector schemes. The way out is hugely
detrimental to the members of those schemes in that it gives the right
of override to employers—not to the scheme—to alter the
terms of that scheme in order to make up the effects of the ending of
contracting out, which can be up to a 5% deficit in such schemes. As
the Bill stands, that ability to override is without reference to
trustees, without invoking any consultation with members and without
negotiations with trade unions or other worker representatives.
Amendment 11 seeks to ensure that the rights of trustees are protected
and that their legal responsibilities are recognised; that the trustees
will be involved in any alteration of the scheme; and that consultation
will be conducted in accordance with the terms of the scheme. Amendment
13, tabled by my noble friend Lady Turner, goes further and requires a
ballot of members of such schemes. Unless we do that, we are seriously
undermining the whole system of trusteeship of private sector

generally accepted that it was the law post the Maxwell scandal and the
reforms that led to the requirement that schemes could not at any point
retrospectively change the accrued benefit of members

need clarity from the Government on this and we need their vision for
the future of occupational work-based schemes because there is a
contradiction in the Government’s position. On the one hand, we
are engaged in a system of auto-enrolment to increase the coverage for
workers who hitherto have been outside occupational schemes, and in
principle we welcome all that. On the other hand, the effects of the
Bill, without mitigation of the kind I am suggesting in Amendments 11
and 12, will undermine and even destroy the viability of many existing
schemes. It is not just the final salary schemes that we are talking
about here, or career average schemes or simply defined benefit
schemes. It will also apply to or have implications for all
occupational pension schemes, partly because of the financial effect
but also because the viability of pension schemes depends not only on
the funding arrangements and the rigour with which those schemes are
managed, but on the mutuality between the members, the employers and
the funders under which those schemes are set up. That is reflected in
the trustee arrangements; expectations are based on that mutuality
continuing and on that trustee protection. If that goes, then
members’ and potential members’ trust in such schemes
goes too. We need to hear clearly from the Government what their
intentions are for this

level of opt-out from such schemes will increase. Pension schemes will
be seen as non-viable. Some pension schemes will fail and the workers
and the employers who have hitherto seen their pension contributions as
part of deferred pay may no longer regard them in that light.
Therefore, pressure might grow for them to be paid immediately. Pension
schemes are the most effective form of savings but they will not appear
that way if trust in such schemes disappears. That is bad for future
pensioners but it is also bad for the economy if that element of
relatively automatic saving is undermined. To maintain the trust, the
role of trustees is vital. I would therefore like the Government to
accept Amendment 11 and to indicate that the role of trustees, and
therefore the trust in such schemes, would be maintained. That is not
to say that alterations could not be made, but they would be made
through the way in which the role of the trustees and the consultation
is laid down in such schemes.</hs_para>

that the Government can accept Amendment 11, confirm my understanding
that Amendment 12 is indeed the law as it stands and clarify the
situation of protected persons in the post-privatisation schemes. I
would also like them at least to consider accepting the amendment
tabled by my noble friend Lady Turner, which would delete
Schedule 14 entirely, because the idea behind this whole way
of overriding long-standing schemes is pernicious. Amendment 11 gives a
way of doing it in effect, but doing it by consent, which is far
preferable and will preserve a very significant part of the

Bill employers are given a new power to change the provisions of a
scheme in order to cover the NI costs to which they will be subjected.
They may apparently do so without having to seek the agreement of staff
or their unions. As my noble friend has pointed out, this is an
overriding power to which a number of us objected at earlier stages
when discussing the Bill. Schedule 11 sets out the provisions in some
detail<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:00:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

referred to the development of what we now call defined benefit
schemes, and what used to be called final salary schemes, as a result
of which generations of pensioners have enjoyed excellent retirement
provision. There was a move some years ago to change such schemes to
money purchase schemes or schemes with less generous protection. Where
the workforce was strong enough, probably with active union
involvement, such schemes have been maintained. There is now, as a
result of this Bill, concern among those who have not yet reached
retirement age that these schemes will not continue and that employers
will utilise the provisions in Schedule 11 to undermine or change them.
Hence my amendment, which stipulates that an employer may not change
these benefits without the agreement of the current scheme members,
which under my amendment could be ascertained through a poll. I hope
that the Government will agree that it is reasonable for the members of
the scheme to have the final say. If an employer wants to change the
existing arrangements, it must be by negotiation with the staff and
their representatives and by
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:02:14"></hs_TimeCode>.
Again, I hope the Government will agree that that is reasonable. If
they do not, I would like to oppose the whole clause and the

point about so-called protected persons. This was raised during earlier
discussions and referred to again by my noble friend today. The

where this protection has been agreed by statute, it will continue. I
welcome that, and would like to see an endorsement of the point by the
Minister. There are others who believe that they are covered not by
statute but because their own private scheme gives them cover. Because
of a change of ownership that might happen, they are concerned about
their position in the future. Their position is not protected by
statute, only by their own scheme. These people have concerns about
what might happen to their DB scheme. My amendment would provide some
cover because of the necessity to get the agreement of scheme members

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, under the current system it is possible
for defined benefit schemes to contract out of the additional state
pension, giving up entitlement for additional state pension in return
for a broadly similar occupational pension and payment of a lower
national insurance rate for both employer and employee. When single
tier is introduced, there will no longer be an additional state pension
for defined benefit schemes to contract out of. Employers with such
schemes will therefore no longer receive a national insurance rebate in
respect of contracted-out
members.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000104">Employers
will need to find ways to recoup the costs that the loss of the rebate
brings. Unless they are able to do that, many employers will be forced
to close their schemes. Clearly, members are not served by their
pension schemes closing and the Government are committed to supporting
the continuation of defined benefit pension provision. To that end, we
are providing a statutory override to allow private sector employers to
make limited changes to their schemes to adjust for the additional cost
due to the end of contracting out. This is part of our wider state
pension reforms. The majority of contracted-out workers in the private
sector who reach state pension age in the first two decades of single
tier will get enough extra state pension to offset the increase in
national insurance they will pay over the rest of their working lives
and any potential adjustments to their occupational pension
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000105">Noble
Lords have made clear their concerns that the override is not abused by
employers and that trustees and members are properly consulted about
any changes. I fully recognise those concerns. The override allows for
limited changes to future accruals and/or future contributions where
the scheme rules would otherwise prevent that. I make it absolutely
clear that the override does not permit the employer to ignore other
rules about how the scheme operates. For example, it does not mean that
an employer can avoid notifying trustees or members of a change, or
refuse to carry out a consultation, if scheme rules would require this.
Indeed, existing legislation requires that members are consulted on any
significant rule changes before they are made. In response to the query
from the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, that will remain the case. In

11 concerns protection for trustee powers and duties. As I have said,
the override does not prevent the scheme operating normally. The only
powers or duties that the override applies to—and therefore that
the amendment would protect—are those that require trustee
consent to changes or provide that only trustees can change scheme
rules. Where these powers stay in place, they would make the override
unusable, which in turn could encourage employers to close their
scheme. Amendment 11 also seeks to ensure that the statutory override
does not trump any duty to consult scheme members and their
representatives. Such an amendment is unnecessary as scheme rules and
existing legislation requiring member and representative consultation
are not affected by the
override.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000108">The

changes they are considering. It is in the employer’s interest
to engage with trustees on proposed changes. Trustees are responsible
for administering the pension scheme. All schemes need lead time before

The amendment would broaden the override. An employer could set
different contribution rates or different rates of accrual for current

the same for both groups of members, and the Bill as drafted ensures

the administrative expense and burden of conducting a poll. It

possibly bound to consult. The override clearly applies in his mind,

That is a mistake. Over the years, many changes have been made at the
behest of employers and with the agreement of trustees. Some of these
were detrimental to future members because of the financial position of
the scheme or legislative changes. Trustees are unlikely to be unable
to recognise the need for such changes, but to override and delete

much more hesitant about taking. However, for the moment, I beg leave

Turner of Camden:</Member></B> My Lords, this is a short amendment

review of rules about pensionable age. When I read it, I was concerned
that there was nothing at all about the type of work people undertook
before they retired. At Second Reading, I said that there were many
people who were quite happy to go on working past normal retirement age
but it depends on the kind of job you do, whether you are well paid,
whether your job has authority, whether 
<?notus-xml column=808?>you enjoy your job and so on. However, there are many people who do work
that is very necessary if the rest of us are to lead reasonably
comfortable lives, such as people who work in construction and other
industries where there is strenuous activity and, sometimes, danger. It
is not a good idea to have elderly people in this kind of
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:28:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

day to make a long statement about this, but if there is to be a review
of retirement ages it must be understood that people do very
different types of work and it is not a good idea to think
that one size fits all. I hope the Government will realise that in a
periodic review of retirement ages it is sensible also to take on board
the kind of work being looked at and the sort of people who are
expected to do it. If they do not, it will not be very popular and may
lead to problems in the future. You do not want future problems in a
pensions Bill, so I suggest the Government think very seriously about
this. I quite like Amendment 17, which is also concerned
with a review of how retirement age is judged and brings a range of
representatives of parties, including trade unions, into consultation,
which is also very sensible. In the mean time, I beg to move.</hs_para>

differences in longevity and health. The Government are setting

need to be made by ensuring that they are not made too quickly. Rather
than simply being a matter for the Secretary of State, as the Bill

cross-party and independent representation that will reassure the

include representatives of the opposition parties and of the Cross
Benches of this House to ensure that Parliament as a whole is at the

are all keen that the Secretary of State receives a report that is

first to the substance of the amendment tabled by the noble Baroness,
Lady Sherlock, and the noble Lord, Lord Browne, if one thing is
apparent it is that there is no clear consensus on who should sit on
the review, what they should look at, or how they should collect the
necessary evidence. We have been clear in Grand Committee and in the
other place that this Government’s vision of the review is one
similar to the independent review of public service pensions. That
review was run by the noble Lord, Lord Hutton, a member of the
opposition Benches and an expert in his field. It was transparent,
comprehensive, independent and established a consensus.</hs_para>

tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, and the noble Lord, Lord
Browne, would preclude these two successful models. It would result in
a body of at least six individuals from stakeholder groups, the other
place and this House. It would not necessarily have the expertise to
review the relevant data and would effectively create a mini
parliamentary process before the parliamentary process proper. We do
not think that is the right way to run a review designed to inform the
Government. In the Bill as currently drafted there is nothing to
prevent a future Government running the review in whatever way they
think best. That is a key point underpinning our approach to the
review—getting future Governments to take active ownership of
and responsibility for all aspects of the review, instead of just going
through the motions.</hs_para>

to be considered as part of any review, I must note that in response to
the recommendation made by the noble Baronesses, Lady Turner and Lady
Sherlock, we do not have the data regarding the relationship between
specific occupations or types of work and life expectancy and healthy
life expectancy. Beginning to collect such data would be both
burdensome and, I imagine, for some professions simply impossible. More
generally, we do not think it is necessary to specify any factors to be
considered in legislation. We have already consulted stakeholders on
what factors they think are important, and stated the factors we expect
to be considered in the White Paper. The Opposition are worried that by
not specifying the factors in legislation, future reviews simply will
not consider important variables. However, what kind of support would
such a review generate?</hs_para>

all interested parties to feed in their thoughts and contributions to
better involve them. Specifying factors in the Bill could send out the
message that we have already thought of everything important, and that
future Governments do not need to consider additional factors as they
are not set out in primary legislation. Such an approach could lead to
a tick-box mentality, with Governments simply going through the motions
instead of taking a proper, considered approach to each review. My
point is illustrated by the fact that another factor has been added to
the Opposition’s amendment since its predecessor was tabled only
a month or so ago. Other noble Lords have also previously suggested
additional factors, including life expectancy of the lowest income
decile, prevalence of smoking and quality of diet. This demonstrates
that the determination of relevant factors should take place after a
thorough and extensive consideration and on an iterative basis for each
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000138">I turn
now to the review’s remit. We believe that the Government should
maintain control of this to keep it focused on the task at hand. There
is nothing in the Bill to prevent the Secretary of State of the day

stakeholders—would fully expect him or her to do just this if
new and compelling factors were identified during the course of the
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000139">The
amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, also requires evidence

around state pension age, such as the myriad tables, charts and graphs,
does not lend itself well to public sessions. Underpinning our approach
is the idea that each Government will fully own and be responsible for
the review. Setting out membership and factors to be considered
restricts rather than increases that responsibility. It would instead
limit the scope of reviews and reduce engagement by stakeholders. I

It does not surprise me, but, on the other hand, I still think that the
type of work that people do is very important. There are, of course,
already industries in this country in which there are different ages of
retirement for different types of work. It is not unusual for that to
happen; indeed, it is quite a common practice, if an industry is
particularly stressful or difficult, for there to be a lower retirement
age for that kind of work. It is not an unusual state of affairs but
one that is highly regarded where it applies—and people accept
it. They think, “Oh well, that sort of work is very tough, but
at least you go a bit early for it. You don’t have to stay and
work there—after a certain time you can
go”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000141">My

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, pensioners usually have
stable incomes, especially compared to those who work, and they do not
fluctuate by much. At the moment, existing pensioners on pension credit
have their income and thus their eligibility assessed every five years
at 65, 70 and 75. Thereafter, no further means-testing is required,
although people need to report the death of a spouse or when they move
into residential care. The Government are proposing to replace this
light-touch system with annual means-testing every year until death,
with the modest exemption of those currently already over 75, for whom
means-testing has been suspended. All future pensioners will have
annual means-testing until they die, which means that they will
means-test, for example, a frail, 90 year-old
widow<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:43:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:42:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000144">In
Committee, we argued that we would retain the current system of
five-year assessments of income for pension credit eligibility and the
suspension of means-testing after 75, both of which the Minister wishes
to replace with annual means-testing. The Minister was not sympathetic;
he tried to suggest to my noble friend Lady Sherlock that the new
system would be simpler, whereas on any ordinary understanding of the
word it is becoming more complicated. Eventually, he fell back on the
necessity of making these savings—all £65
million or so extracted from some of the poorest people in the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000145">This<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:43:45"></hs_TimeCode>

means-test pensioners annually, as they propose to do, until the
recipient is aged 75, and from then on as now those means tests would
be suspended. Why this proposal? My concerns are threefold. First, the
proposed changes will discourage pensioners from claiming pension

first point of discouraging pensioners from claiming, we know that
pensioners do badly out of means-testing, perhaps through ignorance.
Many do not know what they are entitled to, especially if the husband
who has always handled the finances of the family dies and his widow is
not aware of what she may be entitled
to<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:44:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:44:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000147"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:44:36"></hs_TimeCode>Then
there is the stigma. Even those who are aware of pension credit may
deem themselves ineligible, as DWP’s own research shows, because
years before they were refused another, and different, benefit. A third
of pensioners now do not claim pension credit who should. They miss out
on very large sums indeed—a mean average of £34 per week.
Similarly, some 40% of pensioners do not claim what used to be called
council tax benefit—which now has been very foolishly
localised—although they should. Others do not claim attendance
allowance, although they could. My late mother was entitled to
attendance allowance for my late father, but I could not persuade her
to claim it, because of the stigma of means-testing. It was in part
because means-testing was not an effective way of helping many
pensioners that I was delighted when it was built out of the new state
pension, and I remain delighted.</hs_para>

80% of women will be retiring on a full state pension in their own
right by 2020, and as they will no longer be able to rely on a married
woman’s pension, thousands will, over time, still remain
eligible for pension credit, even after 2016, over and beyond those
with disability benefits, for example, and the new state pension.
Therefore means-testing, as we all know, is not a good way of helping
the elderly or of putting a safety net under them and ensuring that
they have an adequate income. That is why I so welcome the new state
pension.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022433000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000149">My
second objection to the Government’s removal of the light-touch
regime of my noble friend Lord McKenzie is that it is profoundly
unfair. A pensioner who retires after 5 April 2016 will, with 35 years,
get a pension that includes an element representing the full
non-means-tested pension credit. That has been built into the value of
the new state pension. There will be no more means-testing for her. Yet
a pensioner who retires a day earlier, on 4 April 2016, will be
means-tested each and every year and for a less generous pension in
total.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022433000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000150">I well
understand the need for before and after sets of provisions, known as
cliff edges, although it is usually wise to build in transitional
arrangements, if possible, to smooth people’s paths, or to
produce steps in the cliff face. At the very least, the Minister should
not be worsening the situation of those who already fare badly out of
the changes. Here we not only see a sharp difference in treatment for
pensioners retiring before and after 5 April 2015; the Government are
actually worsening, as opposed to improving, the lot of those unlucky
enough to be born a day too soon, by replacing five-year periodic
means-testing with annual means-testing. Those who already will lose
out are going to lose out even more. That is not decent; it is

undeserving poor, merely the random accident of one’s birth
date. The Government are deliberately widening the gap between older

appliances or contribute to domiciliary social care or their meals on
wheels and they deteriorate quite fast—we have all seen it. They
will have been means-tested every year for 10 years until the age of
75. Any small pots of money will long since have been taken into
account under pension credit. Why do we keep both pursuing them and
means-testing them? Their lives will become more difficult as they are
widowed, their health declines, disability increases, their sight goes

stats to know how much would come from means-testing the over-75s, and
the DWP does not know that, although I have tried to find that out. My
guesstimate is perhaps £15 million or £20
million. However, after 10 years of means-testing, I suspect that there
would be such diminishing returns against the cost of administration
that I doubt whether the savings would be worth the distress that
annual means-testing of the very elderly, increasingly disabled,
increasingly frail, increasingly confused pensioners would create. I

Sherlock:</Member></B> My Lords, in Committee the Minister came under
sustained pressure on this matter from my noble friends Lady Hollis and
Lord McKenzie, among others, and I am sure that he did not expect to
emerge unscathed from Report. Many noble Lords pressed the Minister in
Committee to try to understand what the consequences of this increase
in means-testing would be. In particular, they were concerned about
what would happen to those older pensioners who inadvertently, or
perhaps negligently, fail to report changes of

However, the guidance also makes clear that misrepresentation can
involve simply leaving a section blank, perhaps because someone cannot
figure out how to fill it in at that point and forgets to go back and
do so later. The guidance also states at paragraphs 09206-7 that a
claimant cannot avoid responsibility for misrepresentation just on the

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, assessed income periods were introduced
by the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, during the passage of the State
Pension Credit Act 2002. At that time it was assumed that
income and capital for those above pensionable age remained relatively
stable and it therefore made good sense to relax reporting
requirements, both for the individual and the department in terms of
running costs. This was still the case in 
<?notus-xml column=816?>2007 when the Government of the day introduced indefinite assessed
income periods for those aged 80 or over.</hs_para>

just now that income and capital do not fluctuate by much. We have now
tested those assumptions, analysed around 100,000 cases and come to the
conclusion that there is actually a greater degree of volatility in
people’s financial circumstances than she and the department had
anticipated at the relevant times. In some cases, assessed income
periods have allowed people to continue to receive pension credit
following a change in their circumstances when they would not have been
entitled to it had they made a new claim at that point. The evidence
means that we have had to think again about the viability of the policy
and have concluded that AIPs should be abolished. Ultimately, if we
were to allow AIPs to continue, the taxpayer would be providing support
to people who no longer need it. It would mean retaining a system in
which we can only apply changes to retirement provision that would
increase an award but cannot take account of windfalls that would
otherwise see a reduction in or loss of
benefit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000162">Let
me be clear, we are not changing entitlement rules. We are changing the
reporting system so that people’s benefit entitlement reflects
their circumstances at the time. To that end, we are looking to
simplify the reporting requirements so that we are able to support
those who need it most and best target our benefit expenditure. I am of
course mindful that by changing reporting requirements some people may
find it more difficult to adjust, particularly those of the most
advanced years who may have the greatest difficulty in contacting us.
This is why existing indefinite assessed income periods in place prior
to 2016 will continue.</hs_para>

recipients, or those on fixed-term AIPs, we will have the opportunity
to explain clearly what does and does not need to be reported at the
point of claim or when their existing claim is reviewed. I stress that
pension credit is already designed in such a way as to minimise
reporting requirements. For example, changes to capital only need to be
reported if their total amount exceeds £10,000. Currently, only
12% of people on pension credit have capital above that level. People
would need to report new income streams, but we will continue to take
into account annual increases in pensions automatically, based on what
people tell us. We will also encourage people to tell us if their
capital falls below £10,000 or if any income stops, to ensure
that we capture beneficial
changes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T21:59:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T22:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment from the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, would allow for
decision-makers to set an indefinite AIP for those over 75. Through our
policy of matching entitlement more closely to circumstance, we
estimate that annually managed expenditure will fall by around
£82 million per year by 2020. Although we have been unable to
estimate the exact reduction in savings, since we cannot predict how
the overall savings will break down by age group in the future, our
analysis indicates that setting indefinite AIPs for those over 75 could
reduce savings by around 30%; that is a figure of £25 million,
which is not that far different 
<?notus-xml column=817?>from the £15 million to £20 million that the noble
Baroness estimated. It is a high price tag on top of the protection
that we have factored in for people already on indefinite AIPs. It is
also a sum that we would need to find from savings elsewhere. I
acknowledge that this is the upper end of the potential cost of the
amendment by the noble Baroness, as discretion could be applied in
setting indefinite
AIPs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022433000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-0003.htm#14022433000165">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T22:02:13"></hs_TimeCode>
reality, as the noble Baroness will know, allowing a decision-maker
discretion in an income-related benefit carries the risk of arbitrary
or uneven decisions. If an indefinite AIP is not applied consistently
to all those over a certain age, this also carries the risk of appeals
and disputes. Quite apart from reintroducing further administrative
complexity, we would still expect a proportion of these claimants to
end up receiving an amount of pension credit to which they were not
entitled and so we do not believe that such discretion is appropriate.
This change would either increase complexity or reduce savings, or a
combination of both. I know that the noble Baroness will be
disappointed with this response, but I hope that I have made the
Government’s position clear. We will maintain the indefinite
AIPs already in place in order to protect those used to the current
system. However, we cannot agree to an amendment that would raise false
expectations by enshrining a power that we have no intention of
invoking<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T22:02:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/82AB82610BCD16274EB0E52C6BF914380377B20A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 February 2014">Monday,

that he showed a degree of sympathy and understanding in Committee,
particularly of the plight of older pensioners in their late 70s or
their 80s, or perhaps older still, who are getting increasingly frail
and confused. I thought he understood that. That is why in this
amendment I dropped the idea of periodic assessments and simply
suggested that, while the Minister does what he thinks is appropriate
or is required to do on this in terms of having annual means-testing

fact that means-testing will already have excluded pensioners at an
earlier stage. I suspect that at least half his savings will come from
the fact that pensioners do not claim what they are entitled to, rather

<?notus-xml column=819?>and I welcome that wholeheartedly. However, every reason he adduces for
building it out of the new state pension applies equally for not
continuing to means test after 75. Every argument that supports the new
state pension works to support the amendment and not continuing
means-testing after 75. If means-testing is so innocent, why get rid of
it in the new state pension? The Minister knows as we all know, on the
basis of good and effective DWP research, that means-testing is loathed
by pensioners and they do not take up the benefits they are entitled

Minister of State, Ministry of Justice (Lord Faulks)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the purpose of the draft order is to give
legal effect to the administrative merger that took place just over
four years ago, on 1 January 2010, between the Revenue and Customs
Prosecutions Office, which was the prosecuting arm of HM Revenue and
Customs, and the Crown Prosecution Service. The decision to merge the
CPS and the RCPO was announced in April 2009 by the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Scotland, who was the Attorney-General at the relevant
time. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:31:08"></hs_TimeCode>
purpose of the merger was to create a strengthened prosecution service,
to safeguard and improve the high-quality work done by both
organisations in serious and complex cases and to provide efficiency
savings. Those objectives have to a large extent been
achieved<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000004">The
merger that took place in 2010 did not involve legislation. Sir Keir
Starmer, who was then DPP, was appointed Director of Revenue and
Customs Prosecutions as well. Since that date, the person holding the
positions of both DPP and Director of Revenue and Customs
Prosecutions—now Ms Alison Saunders—has been running the
two offices under one umbrella. There is a single management structure
and cases investigated by HMRC are now prosecuted by a specialist fraud
division of the
CPS<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:32:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000005">Although
the administrative merger has been a success, there are disadvantages
in the two organisations still existing as legally distinct entities.
First, it might give the appearance that the merger is incomplete and
could readily be reversed. This might call into question whether the
change is intended to be permanent. 
<?notus-xml column=268?>Secondly, it has practical implications for how the organisations work.
The Government consider that a legal merger would bring about greater
efficiency and effectiveness. That is why we are bringing forward the
present draft order under the Public Bodies Act 2011. The Act provides
for the functions of certain public bodies—listed in the
schedules—to be abolished, merged or transferred. The effect of
this draft order is to transfer the functions of the Director of
Revenue and Customs Prosecutions to the DPP, thus putting the existing
merger of the RCPO and CPS on a statutory
basis<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

requirement for Ministers to consult on proposals before laying a draft
order under the Act, a consultation exercise took place in 2012. Views
were sought on the proposal that legal effect should be given to the
administrative merger and on whether the proposed approach would
achieve the desired effect. Those organisations and individuals who
commented—only eight did so—either supported the proposal
or did not object to it. There was concern that the specialist
expertise of the RCPO should not be lost; the Government agree that
this is an important aim. As the consultation response explained, cases
investigated by HM Revenue and Customs are handled within the CPS by
the same specialist casework division that prosecutes the most complex
and serious fraud and corruption cases investigated by the
police<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:34:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000007">An

Hope of Craighead</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, perhaps I can insert a
few words of welcome for the measure. I used to prosecute in the High
Court of Justiciary in Scotland 
<?notus-xml column=269?>as an advocate depute. From time to time, cases arose north of the
border where the Revenue wanted to prosecute in the High Court. As the
Minister will know, in Scotland all prosecutions are in the hands of
the Lord Advocate. I remember having to deal with officials from the
then Inland Revenue and, separately, HM Customs, who were somewhat
upset that they could not conduct those prosecutions themselves but had
to hand the papers over to me or my colleagues so that we could conduct
the matters on their
behalf<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:36:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000013">Of
course, the order has nothing to do with the position in Scotland,
which is quite unaffected, and it is unnecessary to do anything about
it because it is well established that prosecutions will continue to be
handled by the Crown Office under the overall supervision of the Lord
Advocate. As the noble Lord said a moment ago, my experience was that
efficiency was promoted by combining the prosecution element—the
exercise in presenting the material in accordance with the best use of
the courts—in one body. It seemed to me at the time rather odd
that, south of the border, there was this division of functions, which
gave rise to uncertainty in my mind as to exactly why it was necessary
for there to be a separate prosecution system at all in the hands of
the Revenue or HM
Customs<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:37:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000014">So,
from a rather unlikely quarter, I admire what is being done
administratively and entirely approve of the Minister’s
suggestion that it should now be endorsed in legislation. I am sure
that this is a good measure to promote
efficiency<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:38:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000015"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Beecham" PimsId="5821" UID="14022414000118" xid="2085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000118">Lord
Beecham:</Member></B> I must begin by apologising to the noble and

to speak; I apologise for

I said, try as I might—and I certainly tried—I cannot
find anything much to object to in the 19 pages of the order or,
indeed, the 134 amendments embodied in it. The principle is clearly
right and it is sensible to combine the two positions. However,
although this does not quite fall within the Minister’s brief,
there are still questions to be asked about the operation of the
service as a whole, particularly in relation to
staffing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000017">Of
course we are only talking about part of HMRC for the purposes of the
order, but within HMRC there have been significant staff reductions. To
be precise, 1,697 staff left in 2012-13. That forms part of a
significant reduction in funding of HMRC amounting to about £2
billion, or 16.5%, by 2015. The Chancellor’s reinvestment, as it
were, of £154 million, which was announced with a flourish a
couple of years ago, will not make much of an impact on that massive
cut.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000018">The
question arises, therefore, about the implications for staffing on what
had been the HMRC function. Will the staff be protected, or will there
be reductions? The record of HMRC in recovering moneys is clearly not
very good. The Public Accounts Committee criticised it for collecting
more than £1 billion a year less in December 2012 than it would
have done, had it had the relevant
staff<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:40:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

relation to staffing is: will those who will be employed in the
completely unified structure be paid comparably to those with whom 
<?notus-xml column=270?>they will no doubt be locking horns in the private sector? For that
matter, is there much of a two-way flow between the department as it is
now constituted and the private sector? I am not talking about the
prosecution side thus far, as far as I am aware, but concerns have been
expressed about people coming to work for the Inland Revenue from the
private sector and then going back to the private sector and so on. I
am not asking the Minister to answer this today, but it would be
helpful if he would let us know the position in relation to movement
inward and outward of staffing, particularly on the Inland Revenue
side<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:41:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the concerns raised—I do not think with any great force in the
consultation—was about the need to maintain within the
prosecution side expertise of Inland Revenue matters. The Government
seem to be satisfied on that, and I am not challenging that assertion,
but it underlines the need to keep an eye on matters. No doubt the
Government will be reviewing the situation as it
progresses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T15:41:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000021">A
further point relates to the third arm of prosecutions in this country,
which is the Serious Fraud Office, which comes under the aegis of the
Attorney-General and is separate from the DPP and HMRC, which we are
now discussing. Given the somewhat challenging history of the SFO in
recent years, I wonder whether it might be opportune at some time to
consider a further merger between that department and the structure
that we are formally approving today. I am not suggesting that the
Minister can give an immediate response to that, but it is something
that his colleagues could look into. In principle, it might seem
sensible to have a seamless prosecution service dealing with serious
fraud and tax fraud and the other matters that come under the direct
surveillance of the
DPP.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000022">Having

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have been asked by
others involved in the ERA process how many more electoral statutory
instruments there might be to consider. I am pleased to report that in
the case of individual electoral registration the preparations for
implementation in June are well advanced and it is anticipated that
there will only be a handful of additional SIs during the remainder of
this year.</hs_para>

instruments before the Committee today will enable some fine-tuning,
getting IER off to the very best possible start, which I am sure noble
Lords will all welcome. Perhaps I should say, and I hope that the noble
Lord, Lord Kennedy, will convey this to his colleagues on the Labour
Benches, that some of them still seem to be very sceptical about the
transition to IER, but so far this has been a remarkable success story,
as the matching has been more complete than we had expected. That is
part of the reason why we are continuing to adjust as we take this
process along.</hs_para>

small change to allow the start of confirmation matching to begin
nearly a week earlier, from 16 June to 10 June. We hope and expect this
to increase, from 64% to 83%, the proportion of unconfirmed electors
receiving these invitations to register during July, rather than in the
holiday month of August, which we expect to deliver a significantly
better response rate. This is surely a common-sense piece of
fine-tuning and well worth doing.</hs_para>

the draft regulations, will enable the testing of the IER digital

of it once IER begins.</hs_para>

will have observed that the order and regulations amend existing
instruments, some of which were made only quite recently. Given that
these are two more instruments, why do we need to make these now and
add to the rather large ensemble that we seem to be
creating?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000034">To
explain, the changes that we propose build on work carried out over the
past year. The regulations now being amended to extend the testing
period were made in March 2013 so that we could conduct the dry run of
the process for confirming existing electors. In planning this, we had
regard to the principle that the use of personal data for testing
should be limited to a defined period. Last year’s regulations
therefore provided for exchange of data to end around now.</hs_para>

a crystal ball, when those regulations were made we could not have
known exactly what the testing schedule for 2014 would be, partly
because the contracts with electoral management systems suppliers were
yet to be concluded. However, a simple change to the dates in last
year’s order will ensure thorough testing before we go live.
When the dry run took place across Great Britain last summer, we got
much better results than we had expected, indicating that at the
transition to IER it should be possible to confirm an average of at
least 78% of the
electorate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000036">We
were able to discuss with electoral administrators and the Electoral
Commission options for making best use of the results of the live
confirmation run. The solution emerged to allow the start of the
transition to be brought forward a week from 16 to 10 June. The 2013
transitional provisions order was already before Parliament and to have
withdrawn it to amend that one date would have caused uncertainty about
all the other aspects of IER covered by the order, impacting everyone
working on electoral administration across Britain.</hs_para>

two short statutory instruments before the Grand Committee today will
each, in their own way, play a further constructive part in the

Kennedy of Southwark (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is good to be
back here again to discuss these instruments with the noble Lord. To
start off, the noble Lord made the point about some of my colleagues
having worries about this, some of which I share. I worry about the
speed of the transition and about what will happen if things go wrong.
The Government have quite rightly put a lot of emphasis on voter fraud
and on accuracy, but sometimes I feel that we put less emphasis on
completeness.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022414000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000039">As I have said many
times to the noble Lord here and in the Chamber, on estimate around 6
million people live in our country who are not on the register but are
eligible to be on it. I do not see much evidence that much is going on
to get them on to the register. 
<?notus-xml column=273?>The Government should address that, and quickly. It is of
equal priority to anything else that we are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000040">In
general I support IER. Many noble Lords will be aware that I am a
former member of the Electoral Commission, so I know about the work
that has gone on in the Government and in the commission to get this
right. However, I will keep pressing the noble Lord on the question of
completeness, because it is important that all citizens are able to
take part in our electoral
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000041">As
the noble Lord says, the two instruments before us today bring forward
minor changes, bringing IER into effect. The first order amends a
previous order and brings forward the earliest date for the matching of
existing electoral registers with data held by the DWP from 16 to 10
June. That is fine as far as it goes and I hope that the process will
go smoothly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000042">I
note in the order that publicity is to be undertaken by the Electoral
Commission, which is welcome. I have some knowledge of the work that
the commission is doing on that. However, I am not convinced that that
is going to be enough. The Government will have to look at what else
can be done. This is an enormous change that is taking place. I do not
know what they can do; maybe the noble Lord can tell the Committee what
other plans the Government have, or look at more plans. I certainly
think that we should look at things such as specific funding to local
authorities to do extra work. Noble Lords will know that EROs employed
by local authorities do lots of the extra work, such as going door to
door, and it may well be that additional funding is needed beyond what
they normally receive. If at the end of this process there are fewer
people on the register than there are now, it will be matter of much
regret—in fact, we should aim to get many more people on the
register. Perhaps the Minister could look at
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000043">How will
the Cabinet Office monitor the completeness and accuracy of the
electoral register throughout the process and after transition to IER?
The second statutory instrument deals with the IER digital service. We
have no issues with that, but I return to the general point that I made
at the start of my contribution: with such a major change taking place,
are we doing everything possible to ensure that those citizens who are
not on the register now will be on the register in
future?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000044"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="14022414000123" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000123">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his
comments. I was conscious when I answered a question on this matter the
other week of how long we have all been involved in this. The right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Wakefield asked me whether I had thought
about the problems in Kirklees and I realised that it was the summer
before last that I had been in Holmfirth talking to the Kirklees
electoral registration officer. We have been at this, preparing for it,
with local electoral registration officers and others for quite some
time now.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022414000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000045">I
shared a lot of the concerns that others had at the outset and I have
to say that I am impressed by the thoroughness shown by people at both
the local and the national levels in working through to make sure 
<?notus-xml column=274?>that the transition is a success. We have in some ways the advantage of
being able to learn from the Northern Irish experience, where there was
a certain drop as one moved from household to individual registration,
and we are working on several different fronts to deal with that. As
the noble Lord will be aware, the biggest single reason provided by
surveys for why people do not register is that they are not interested
in politics and do not want to vote. That means that all of us in
politics have to be out there arguing that it is in their interests
both to register and to vote. National Voter Registration Day the week
before last was an autonomous voluntary initiative, with which the
Government were very happy to co-operate, to push that issue further up
the agenda. We are co-operating with a range of voluntary organisations
to get at particularly difficult, vulnerable groups who are less likely
to register. We will continue to do that. We expect everyone to keep us
up to the mark on this. We have allowed in the legislation for a final
parliamentary vote to approve the transition after the next election,
but so far, so very good and so much better than I expected, and I do
not see it
failing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000046">It
was suggested that we might be more concerned about accuracy than about
completeness. We are of course very concerned about completeness, which
is why we are so pleased with the success of the data-matching exercise
so far. We are providing additional funding to maximise registration;
we have just provided an additional £3.6 million to be
distributed to every electoral registration officer according to levels
of electoral under-registration to help them with the costs of local
activities for maximising registration. I remind the noble Lord that
the boroughs that come up with the largest amount of under-registration
are not those that have the strongest Labour vote or the highest
poverty index. Kensington and Chelsea and Westminster come high among
them, partly because there is such a rapid turnover in the population
and people do not get round to registering while they are
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000047">We are
providing funds to EROs because we understand that they are best placed
to determine what local activity is most effective in maximising
registration levels. We are not mandating how they make use of this
funding; a great deal depends on local circumstances. I was shocked to
be told some 15 months ago that in Wandsworth, for example,
some 20,000-plus properties are now behind locked access, so that doing
a door-to-door canvass has become a great deal more difficult. Those
are not just council flats but the new blocks of flats along the Thames
that sell for far too much money. So yes, we still face some
difficulties but we are working extremely hard and providing extra
resources and we are working with voluntary organisations to maximise
registration and to make it as complete as possible. We hope to
co-operate as actively as we can with all those concerned, including,
of course, those within the Labour Party.</hs_para>

but the Government have a very special responsibility. Secondly, he has

<?notus-xml column=275?>I have never, ever suggested that it is about getting Labour voters on
to the register. It is about getting voters on to the register—I
do not care who they vote for. The fact is that there are 6 million
people in this country not on the register to vote. I want to get them
on. That is what I am all about, as a member of the commission and as a

casting that comment at some of the noble Lord’s colleagues who
have made that point very strongly to me. We all share an interest in
this and we want to get as many people to vote as possible. We have no
idea what they will do when they vote—whether they will vote for
one party or another or even spoil their ballot papers—but
rebuilding public commitment to democratic participation is a wider

industries include coal and gas power, offshore oil and gas, chemical
and pharmaceuticals, nuclear power and renewable energy. The
construction and maintenance requirements for these industries require
a mobile, flexible and highly skilled workforce. It is the employers in
these industries who have, since 1991, come together to support
collective action through the levy to develop the workforce, manage
risks and address skills

are central to creating a strong, sustainable and balanced economy. The
Government are committed to ensuring that skills provision meets the
needs of employers and learners. While the Government have a role in
setting the framework for success, employers need to be in the driving
seat if we are to equip the workforce with the skills that employers
need. The ECITB has a central role in the training of the workforce and
in supporting the industry to achieve sustainable growth. In doing
this, the Government look to the ECITB to minimise bureaucracy and to
ensure that support to employers is both relevant and accessible. The
ECITB is employer led, and its role is to encourage the provision of
adequate training of employees and prospective employees in its
industry. It provides a wide range of services, including setting
occupational standards, developing vocational qualifications and
delivering apprenticeships, as well as paying direct grants to
employers who carry out training to approved standards.</hs_para>

the successful application of such a framework, and the

so that the costs of training are shared more evenly among companies in
the industry. This order gives effect to proposals submitted to us for
a levy to be collected by the ECITB in 2015. The proposal involves the
imposition of a levy in excess of 1% of payroll on some classes of
employer. The Industrial Training Act requires such an order to be

satisfied: first, that the amount of levy is appropriate to meet the
current skills requirements of the industry; secondly, that the

and, thirdly, that the previous levy order received support from the
majority of employers and the levy rates remain unchanged. I can

employers from the levy. This order therefore provides that small firms
will be exempt if their expenditure on payroll and sub-contract labour

Those firms that are below the threshold and exempt from paying the
levy are still able to benefit from grant and other support from the
ECITB, and many of them indeed do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022414000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022414000060">The ECITB

one-year proposal is expected to raise around £29 million in
levy income. The Committee will note that the ECITB order covers a
one-year period, whereas the Industrial Training Act requires that levy
orders should normally cover a three-year period. However, a one-year
levy order can be made if, first, it is made within two years of an
earlier levy order for which the ECITB obtained employer support and,
secondly, the levy rate is being kept the same. For this order, the
ECITB will be relying on the consensus established for the 2012 order,
which had the support of 59% of employers, who were likely to pay 69%
of the levy. Notwithstanding that, the ECITB also undertook a
consultation with the industry last year, which showed that 68% of
employers, likely to pay 76% of the levy, 
<?notus-xml column=278?>supported the proposal for the levy to continue. The ECITB has proposed
a one-year levy order, at the request of the industry, to retain the
flexibility to review the levels of levy required to meet future
demand. Next year, the ECITB levy order will cover a three-year period,
which will be co-terminous with the Construction Industry Training
Board three-year levy cycle from 2015 onwards and therefore allow the
ECITB to develop longer-term plans.</hs_para>

from previous debates that the ECITB exists because of the support that
it receives from employers and employer interest groups in their
sectors. As I indicated earlier, there is a firm belief that without
the ECITB there would be a deterioration in the quantity and quality of
training in the industry, leading to a deficiency in skills levels.

industrial training boards were to be abolished. These proposals were 
<?notus-xml column=279?>very controversial. There were responses from outside Westminster, which
will come as no surprise, from the then very large trade unions, some
employers and employers’ organisations. The winding-up proposals

purpose of these proposals is, first, to clarify that work experience
opportunities offered to young people as part of traineeships, helping
them to compete in the labour market, are not subject to national
minimum wage requirements—this reflects the situation with other
government programmes—and, secondly, to take a tougher approach
on employers who do not pay their workers the minimum wage that they
are legally entitled to by increasing the financial penalty that
employers have to pay.</hs_para>

traineeships. The Government are committed to tackling youth
unemployment. Central to this is equipping young people with the skills
that employers need. Employers tell us consistently that young people
often lack the right skills, attitudes and experience when they apply
for an apprenticeship or other job. Some 29% of employers say that
experience is “critical” when recruiting, and a further
45% say that it is
“significant”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000004">The
traineeship programme was introduced in August 2013 to address this
problem in England. Traineeships in England are a training programme
that includes work experience. Lasting a maximum of six months, the
programme has three core elements: work preparation training; English
and maths for those without a good GCSE standard in these subjects; and
a high-quality work experience placement with an employer. Traineeships
unlock the sometimes hidden potential of young people who are motivated
to work but unable to get on the first rung of the ladder because they
lack basic skills and are not yet ready for work. Traineeships are
there for these young people to equip them with the life skills and
confidence that they need to make that vital first step into
sustainable employment.</hs_para>

organisations have indicated that they will deliver traineeships in the
first year of the programme, and many employers are already on board,
including household names such as Virgin Media and Siemens. Many
smaller employers have been engaged locally by training providers. We
expect the programme to grow over time, helping more and more young
people to get jobs, but we rely on employers offering work experience
opportunities to make this
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000006">Exemptions
from the minimum wage for participants in government schemes or
programmes with work experience, such as traineeships, are commonplace
in minimum wage legislation. The Government consider that traineeships
are covered by an existing exemption. However, given that there are a
number of government programmes with work experience to which different
exemptions apply, we are pursuing a bespoke exemption that specifically
names and describes traineeships in the regulations, for the avoidance
of any doubt that any work undertaken as part of a traineeship is
exempt from the national minimum
wage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000007">I will
now turn to the second reason that noble Lords are here today in
Committee. The Government continue to be committed to increasing
compliance with minimum wage legislation and effective enforcement of
the law. Everyone who is entitled to the minimum wage should receive
it. The Government actively target employers who disregard their
responsibilities and we investigate any complaints made against them.
We will not hesitate to pursue civil and criminal proceedings where
necessary.</hs_para>

Revenue and Customs began enforcing the minimum wage in April 1999.
Since then, HMRC has identified more than £45 million in arrears
for over 200,000 workers during more than 65,000 employer
interventions. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs follows up
every single complaint from a worker made through the free pay and work
rights helpline. This commitment is at the core of minimum wage
enforcement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000009">Our
compliance and enforcement action is making an impact. In 2012-13, HMRC
identified £3.9 million in wage arrears for over 26,000 workers.
This is a 33% increase in the number of workers that the Government
were able to help in 2012-13 and a 26% increase in arrears identified
compared to 2009-10. Noble Lords will know how vital the minimum wage
is for low-paid workers, and the Government are actively keeping our
compliance and enforcement strategy under review. Our approach will
continue to be informed by intelligence and data, where we ensure that
we make the best use of all the tools and resources at our
disposal.</hs_para>

Government are taking a tougher approach on employers that break
national minimum wage law and are bringing in these regulations to
increase the penalties imposed on employers who underpay their workers

employers received penalties totalling more than £776,517 for
failing to comply with national minimum wage law. The financial penalty
is calculated as a percentage of the total underpayment as set out in
the notice of underpayment served on the employer by the officer
enforcing national minimum wage legislation. This regulation will
increase the percentage figure from 50% to 100% and increase the figure
for the maximum financial penalty from £5,000 to £20,000.
If employers pay the unpaid wages within 14 days, the penalty is
reduced by 50%. Employers also have 28 days to appeal
against the notice of underpayment issued by HMRC.</hs_para>

secondary legislation, we will go further to achieve the Prime
Minister’s commitment to increase the penalty of £20,000
to apply per worker. However, we will need primary legislation to make
this amendment to the National Minimum Wage Act 1998.</hs_para>

reiterating the Government’s commitment to the national minimum
wage and the protection it provides to the low paid without damaging
their employment prospects. Through these regulations we are providing
the necessary clarity that any work experience undertaken as part of a
traineeship in England is exempted from the national minimum wage.
However, we are taking a firmer stand against businesses that should be
paying their workers the national minimum wage. I commend this order to

welcome a tougher approach—that may be quoted—and the aim

welcoming the aim of increasing compliance, which will necessarily
involve instituting criminal proceedings. We heard in the Committee
just now a very welcome commitment to the national minimum wage itself,
which is a foundation statement when bringing in legislation such as
this to your Lordships’ House. However, I recollect that in
another place, when the national minimum wage was proposed by the
Government of Mr Tony Blair, the opposition to it was somewhat lengthy

also interesting to hear from the Minister that 500 training
organisations have agreed to deliver these traineeships. As we know
from experience, some of the apprenticeship training that was being
delivered lacked quality and the Government had to take action. Bearing
that in mind—it is not only this Government who have suffered,

did so. Like my noble friend Lord Jones, I welcome the
Government’s espousal of the minimum wage. He is absolutely
right to remind us of the dire predictions that were made at the time
about the terrible effect that it was going to have and the millions of
jobs that were going to be lost—not taking into account the
impact on millions of workers who were being paid, in some of the worst
examples, £1 an hour.</hs_para>

am glad that the Government are now fully in favour of the minimum
wage, although not every Conservative Member of Parliament seems to
be—indeed, some of them have put down Motions calling for small
firms to be exempted from paying it. I would welcome some assurance
that the Government will not be going down any such road. Given their
previous strange decision regarding their magnificent bargain offer to
employees to get rid of their employment rights in return for shares, I
wonder what take-up there has been on that. It was almost like buy one

return to this statutory instrument, I found myself a bit confused by
all the statistics being given by the Minister. I think I have this
right: he talked about there being £45 million of arrears; I was
not sure how many complaints that had resulted from. I could not quite
comprehend whether or not these figures were going down as a result of
the enforcement. That is what we want to see. I was pleased to hear the
Minister introduce the pay and work rights helpline. It seems to be
carrying out its
function.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000031">We
welcome the higher penalties, although we probably think that they
should be even higher still because there still seems to be a
significant number of employers that believe they can get away with not
paying the minimum wage, which is a real disgrace. The Minister and the
noble Lord, Lord Jones, referred to getting a 50% reduction if you pay
what you should have been paying. I suppose that I can see some logic
in that if it gets them to pay up, but I would like some assurance
that, if the same employer were to commit this offence again, we would
not allow them to have a second chance of getting a 50% reduction.
Would that apply if there were a repeat
offence?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000032">To
summarise, we generally welcome this measure. I would be interested to
know why we have not yet had any examples of the Government actually
naming and shaming employers, which might act as a further deterrent,

there is no obligation to pay them. He also mentioned skills in maths

traineeships. The Department for Education has published guidance on
what is required to ensure that the work experience is of good quality.
Providers are responsible for actively monitoring the work experience
placement and working with employers to ensure that it meets each
individual’s needs. Providers are given funding to support them
to do this, and we have commissioned an external evaluation of
traineeships starting from the first year. My department, BIS, is

government efforts to toughen up enforcement of the national minimum
wage and to increase compliance. By naming and shaming employers, it is
hoped that our publicity will be an additional deterrent to employers,
who would otherwise be tempted not to pay the national minimum wage.

employers already face if they fail to pay the national minimum

unemployment. These regulations simply clarify the fact that employers
offering work experience opportunities to young people as part of a
traineeship on their journey towards employment will not be required to
pay the national minimum wage, as is the case with other government
programmes that include work experience. These regulations will now be

Citizens Advice Scotland and the General Consumer Council for Northern
Ireland; secondly, to transfer the Office of Fair Trading’s
estate agency functions to the Commissioners of Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs and Powys Trading Standards; and, finally, to
transfer residual OFT functions relating to its former consumer advice
scheme to Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland. The scheme
itself was transferred to the citizens advice services on 1 April
2012.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000055">This
order will complete a programme of consumer landscape improvements that
the Government first embarked upon in 2011. The National Audit Office
report <I>Protecting Consumers</I>,<I> </I>published in June 2011, and
the Public Accounts Committee report on the same issue both highlighted
the fact that the existing consumer landscape was confusing,
duplicative and therefore inefficient. To address that, in April 2012,
following consultation, the Government announced a series of reforms to
the landscape of consumer bodies. Over the past two years, we have
streamlined the landscape of Government-funded consumer organisations
to make it easier for consumers to understand where they need to go to
get help. The reforms will deliver a better deal overall for consumers
by making it clearer who is responsible for what and by facilitating
better co-ordination between consumer bodies and
enforcers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000056">The
improvements that we have made so far include: focusing the new
Competition and Markets Authority, which will replace the Office of
Fair Trading from 1 April, on identifying problem markets
and developing effective solutions to competition issues; establishing
the National Trading Standards Board and Trading Standards Scotland in
2012 to prioritise national and cross-local authority boundary consumer
enforcement; moving responsibility for consumer-facing education and
general consumer advocacy to Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice
Scotland; moving responsibility for approval of consumer codes to the
Trading Standards Institute; and launching Consumer Futures in May 2013
to represent consumer interests in gas, electricity, postal services
and—in Scotland—water services. These organisations work
together as part of the Consumer Protection Partnership—the
CPP—to collectively identify issues causing consumer detriment,
and agree priorities for collaborative action.</hs_para>

specifics of this order. The order will abolish the National Consumer
Council and transfer relevant functions to the umbrella bodies Citizens
Advice, Citizens Advice Scotland and the Consumer Council for Northern
Ireland. The function will be based in the head offices of Citizens
Advice, not within the local bureaux on our high streets. This change
will bring together the technical expertise of 
<?notus-xml column=291?>Consumer Futures with evidence from consumers across the country from
the citizens advice service bureaux and the national consumer advice
helpline. This combination of technical expertise and intelligence
gathering will enable the citizens advice service to act as a robust
advocate for consumers, influencing policy development on general
issues and on the complex energy and postal services markets. Careful
analysis of emerging trends in consumer complaints will enable Citizens
Advice to speak out on behalf of consumers on areas of particular
concern and to lobby policymakers to improve consumer
welfare.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000058">Alongside
the Consumer Futures function, anyone needing impartial help or advice
on a consumer issue will, as now, be able to phone the national
helpline, contact their local bureau or use the interactive help on the
Citizens Advice web pages. This means that the customer journey for the
consumer who has a complaint is clear and simple.</hs_para>

not be the only intelligence-gathering mechanism available to the
Citizens Advice service. It will also receive the National Consumer
Council’s information-requesting powers, a move overwhelmingly
supported by respondents to the government consultation in 2011.
Although those powers are not used regularly, the threat of their use
makes it easier to obtain key information necessary for effective
advocacy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:44:02"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
elaborate on this point for a moment, if I may. When this order was
debated in the other place, there was some concern that the Government
were intending to curb Citizens Advice’s access to those
information-gathering powers. I stress that the Government have no
plans whatever to diminish the ability of the Citizens Advice service
to fulfil the role of consumer advocate by restricting that essential
power.</hs_para>

Bodies Act 2011 requires that where statutory protections exist, they
should be maintained in any transfer under the Act. That is what we are
doing here. We are simply transferring the statutory provisions that
would, as now, in theory give the Government the ability to limit the
scope of this power in future, should that prove necessary, but I am
happy to confirm that the Government cannot envisage a scenario where
such a move might be required. I should also say that Citizens Advice
is happy with this arrangement.</hs_para>

Consumer Futures function is a testament to this Government’s
confidence in the major role that Citizens Advice plays in our civil
society. We firmly believe, contrary to some claims in the other place,
that the leadership of Citizens Advice will be well placed to deliver
the Consumer Futures functions alongside its other bureaux and helpline
services. Citizens Advice will of course continue to receive the same
amount of funding from an industry levy to allow it to deliver that
important work.</hs_para>

transfers essential estate agency functions currently carried out by
the OFT to commissioners of HMRC and Powys Trading Standards, prior to
the abolition of the OFT on 1 April. Currently, the OFT can issue
warning and prohibition orders 
<?notus-xml column=292?>against estate agents who have acted dishonestly or breached provisions
of the Estate Agents Act 1979. Ultimately it can prohibit those persons
it considers unfit from carrying out estate agency
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000063">The
Government believe that from 30 March, those functions would sit best
with the enhanced activities of trading standards. That is in line with
our approach, set out under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act
last year, which noble Lords will recall, to focus the Competition and
Markets Authority, the successor to the OFT, more explicitly on
market-wide
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000064">Under
the oversight of the National Trading Standards Board, a lead trading

the UK estate agency market will be transferred from the OFT to Powys
County Council, via the NTSB’s enforcement grant, and
ring-fenced to ensure that it is used for the purpose intended. Powys
will be responsible for approving redress schemes which handle
complaints from individual consumers, as the OFT is currently. It will
have access to the same tools as the OFT to ensure that estate agents
meet their obligations. We would of course expect the CMA to continue
to play a role if there are any market-wide issues that need
considering.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000066">The
new system will also benefit from trading standards’s
traditionally close relationship with business. That allows for
effective oversight and enforcement of the industry. It makes more
sense to assign that responsibility to a single lead authority than to
distribute it across a range of different trading standards teams, who
would be less able to build up the expertise and capability.</hs_para>

lead authority model has been extremely effective in delivering other
trading standards services. For example, fraud worth more than
£145 million has been tackled by the Scambusters and the illegal
money lending teams in the past 18 months. The Illegal Money
Lending Team is a trading standards unit based in Birmingham City
Council, but it provides an England-wide service and has received
plaudits for its
successes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000068">When
the order was debated in the other place, there was some concern about
the process for appealing against warning and prohibition orders issued
by Powys County Council. To confirm, the Government are not proposing
any changes to the estate agents appeal process under the Estate Agents
Act 1979 through this order. An appeal can be made to the First-tier
Tribunal (Estate Agents), which forms part of the General Regulatory
Chamber of the First-tier Tribunal. It is administered by the Tribunals
Service, an agency of the Ministry of Justice. Appeals will therefore
continue to be considered at the national level, not within Powys or
Anglesey. In practical terms, this means that agents receiving a
prohibition or warning order will appeal to the tribunal with 28 days
of being notified, as is the case
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000069">Estate
agents are also required to be registered with the OFT for anti-money
laundering purposes and to pay fees to cover reasonable administrative
costs. Carrying 
<?notus-xml column=293?>on estate agency business without being registered is a criminal
offence. We are proposing to transfer this function to HMRC, which we
believe will be well placed to deliver this work robustly. HMRC already
supervises a number of other sectors under the Money Laundering
Regulations, and has both experience and capacity on the
ground.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022430000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000070">This

will begin by addressing efficiency and effectiveness. Publicly funded
consumer advocacy is carried out by a number of organisations,
including the NCC, Citizens Advice, Citizens Advice Scotland, and to
some degree by the OFT. There has been significant overlap between
these bodies and there is therefore scope for efficiency improvements
in the use of public funds; for example, both the NCC and Citizens
Advice produce reports for consumers on the energy market and both have
strong links with sector
regulators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000073">This
order will create efficiencies by greatly reducing the overlap and
duplication of effort in consumer research and analysis by merging the
expertise of the NCC with the citizens advice service. Both Trading

will simplify the

appointment of a lead enforcement authority to carry out this work on
behalf of all authorities means that the supervision of prohibition and
warning orders will be effectively co-ordinated and consistently
applied across the UK. Enforcement activity will be better targeted
through continued use of a central intelligence-gathering process and
decision-making gateway. The potential for enforcement gaps relating to
the estate agency industry will be
mitigated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000075">Powys
County Council has been chosen to act as lead authority following a
robust tendering exercise, in which every local authority in the UK was
invited to bid. Bidders were required to demonstrate how they intended

anti-money-laundering supervision to HMRC also has substantial

by this order maintain robust measures of accountability. Citizens
Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland are required by both charity and
company law to ensure good governance. It is therefore not necessary to
impose further statutory governance provisions. Instead, the bodies
will be held accountable through well established grant funding
relationships, which will be expanded to set out the requirements and
key performance indicators relating to these new activities.
Performance will be closely monitored by my department to ensure that
the successor bodies are delivering good outcomes for consumers and

taxpayers.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022430000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000078">In
the case of estate agency enforcement, Powys County Council is
ultimately accountable to BIS. Powys will report to the NTSB in its
role as co-ordinator, and the NTSB is accountable to BIS for the
performance of its enforcement teams and projects, including estate
agency work. Anti-money-laundering supervision is subject to HMRC cost
controls and HM Treasury and parliamentary oversight.</hs_para>

small economic efficiencies resulting from this order. Under the OFT,
the anti-money-laundering supervision of estate agents was 95%
industry-funded, with the remainder coming from central government
funding. The new regime will be 100% industry-funded. This represents a
saving, albeit a modest one, of approximately £55,000 per

happened and some anxieties about the future. Not only will this order
finally abolish the good work that has been done for the past 50 years
by the National Consumer Council, founded by the late Lord Young of
Dartington, but it reflects a failure by the
Government—actually, successive Governments—in 
<?notus-xml column=295?>achieving just what the Minister started out by saying they were trying
to achieve: namely, clarity for consumers, a lack of confusion and a
lack of overlap. Even this last piece of the jigsaw transfers powers

improve understanding and overlap.</hs_para>

the NCC, Energywatch and Postwatch came together following the 2007
Act, it was a partial achievement of what the Labour Party had promised
in the 2005 manifesto, with which I think my noble friend was very
familiar. The original intention was to bring together all statutorily
based bodies with an interest in representing the consumer in the
policy-making and enforcement process. Actually, it never happened
quite that way, due at that stage partly to interdepartmental problems,
in that the Ministry of Transport refused to allow what is now
Passenger Focus to move in, Defra batted a draw and, although there was
a way of getting the Consumer Council for Water in, that was never
actually triggered. The relationships with the panels that were set up
in Ofcom and the then Financial Services Agency never fully
materialised, although that is also reflected in the
legislation.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:29:32"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="14022430000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000274">5.30

new Government came in, I thought that they had grasped the need to
rationalise all the statutory-based bodies and the other powers. I
understood that the original intention of BIS Ministers, and certainly
of senior officials, was that they would try to bring together what was
by then Consumer Focus, covering energy and general consumer issues,
with the expertise that the NCC over the years had developed in
consumer law, consumer redress, European consumer policy and so on,
with particular problems on the postal and energy side. They were going
to bring in the Consumer Council for Water and, hopefully, the
transport bodies, and have a tighter relationship with those bodies
that existed within other

was also defeated by interdepartmental squabbles or defensiveness but
was aggravated by the new Government’s double intention of their
obsession with abolishing quangos on the one hand and public
expenditure cuts on the other, both of which hit the activity of
Consumer Focus seriously. They had another objective from the
beginning, which was to transfer the whole function away from the
public sector into the third sector. Some of my colleagues were deeply
opposed to that but I could understand the rationale. However, they
should have brought all the bodies together first and then transferred
them into the third sector under the aegis of Citizens Advice, or
whatever<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:31:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000087">In
practice, that opportunity was completely missed because the Cabinet
Office insisted that a quango had to be abolished as fast as possible.
The Public Bodies Bill was going through Parliament, and we know the
inadequacies of that Act, how it was dealt with and how it has been
implemented. At the same time, the Treasury was demanding cuts in
public expenditure. Those cuts mainly hit the mainstream consumer
activity of Consumer Focus, which was directly funded by the taxpayer.
By and large, the money coming from industry, as the Minister said,
continued and will continue in 
<?notus-xml column=296?>the new
arrangement<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:32:03"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, all those areas of expertise that the NCC had developed have
been hit seriously by cuts in expenditure. It is not true to say that
there was significant overlap with the work of Citizens Advice. There
was at the margin, but the work, and the prime focus of Citizens
Advice, was different. The expertise is already being lost, and I fear
that under the new arrangements there will be more
loss<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:32:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000088">This
is not a happy story for consumer representation in policy-making. Nor
is it a happy story in terms of the consumer who wants to know why his
or her particular problem is not being covered by the service provider,
the regulator or the Government; it is as confusing as it ever was.
However, this has gone a long way down the road. I have anxieties about
what will materialise. My anxieties are of three sorts, one of which in
recent months has been largely allayed. It was about the apparent
difficulty of getting Citizens Advice and the traditions of Consumer
Focus and the NCC to understand each other. In recent months I think
that that has significantly improved, or so I am informed. Of course,
it is only part of the old NCC/Consumer Focus role that Citizens Advice
will be taking
over<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000089">My
second anxiety is that the focus of Citizens Advice will be elsewhere.
It is a superb organisation in dealing with consumer complaints. Its
role in policy has been more limited, and it has not had the
relationship with the regulator and the industry that, for example,
Consumer Focus, and Energywatch before it, developed in relation to the
energy companies. Nor has expertise extended to the whole area of
consumer law—perhaps, in particular, to European consumer law,
where an expertise rested with the NCC and Consumer Focus and was
recognised right across Europe. Indeed, the European organisation,
BEUC, greatly relied on them to provide that level of expertise. That

third anxiety is simply about resources. Although, as the Minister
said, the money that comes from the postal and energy sectors will be
transferred, the money that is spent on these more general areas of
expertise and input has already been cut. There has been some increase
in the central government grant to Citizens Advice, but that is against
the background of Citizens Advice seriously suffering, directly and
indirectly, from public expenditure cuts more generally. A vast amount
of the resources for Citizens Advice on the ground comes from local
authorities, but that has been severely cut back in many parts of the
country. Another part of its resources comes from charities, which
themselves are quite dependent on public expenditure; that part has
also been squeezed. I would like the Minister to give me the figures
for the central government grant, but it seems to me that the
Government had already cut the grant to Citizens Advice. They are now
topping it up by an amount that is supposed to reflect the additional
responsibilities arising as a result of the transfer of the functions
of Consumer Focus and Consumer Futures into the
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>. I
remain to be convinced that those resources are there.</hs_para>

a happier note, and perhaps not putting quite such a gloss on history
as the Minister, I am glad that the Government have changed their mind
about the 
<?notus-xml column=297?>allocation to Citizens Advice of Section 24 powers in the 2007 Act.
There were severe anxieties, some of them understandable, about
transferring significant powers to demand information from providers of
goods and services of all kinds that were given to Consumer Focus by
the 2007 Act to a body that was no longer a public body. However, the
Government seem to have seen the light on this one and those powers
will now be transferred. I am glad that they are being transferred and
that the Minister has reiterated the assurance that there will be no
constraint on Citizens Advice using those powers. In reality, they will
not be used very often, but the existence and threat of use of those
powers will make providers of goods and services sit up if Citizens
Advice takes on the role that Consumer Focus used to have of tackling
major business bodies and government bodies over their treatment of the
consumer. I therefore welcome that part of the order.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:37:38"></hs_TimeCode> hope that the
new arrangements work. I have my doubts because, frankly, it is a bit
of a sorry
history<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:37:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000092">Although
the transfer of estate agency functions to Powys looks slightly odd, it
may well work. The reality, though, is that if you look at it in total,
no one is going to understand why a problem with an estate agent in
Balham is being dealt with by Powys County Council. Looked at more
broadly, the reality is that as a result of this measure and the
previous one, trading standards have taken on a lot more
responsibilities at a time when their own resources, personnel and role
within local authorities are being severely squeezed—in some
local authorities, beyond the point where they are a viable
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, while I do not disagree with giving trading standards some
of the old OFT functions, I do not think that it will work effectively
if the resources of trading standards in total are being squeezed at
the same time. I hope that the Government will take those points on
board.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/257B08E5139113872460C51B063E6FF6BE287607" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 February 2014">Monday,

County Council was selected following due process, a tendering process
in which a number of other local authorities—I cannot remember
whether it was five or six—had made expressions of interest and
put forward detailed tendering documents. Powys County Council was

effectively.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000095">It
may seem strange that a single local authority—I think it
matters not whether that authority is in Wales or England—is
given a national function in this way, but the National Trading
Standards Board does that in respect of a number of national functions.
The Minister referred to the Illegal Money Lending Team for England.
That service is provided through Birmingham City Council and the
arrangement works extremely well. There is a similar arrangement for
the Illegal Money Lending Team in Wales. Another example is 
<?notus-xml column=298?>the National Trading Standards eCrime Centre, which is provided by North
Yorkshire County Council. These are national functions, nationally
available, provided throughout the country but delivered through a
single local authority. That is the arrangement that is being followed

benefit of this structure is that while individual local authorities
are leading on these issues, they are part of a national network and
structure. They are able to work with local authorities around the
country on the development of intelligence. A national intelligence
unit for trading standards, funded by the National Trading Standards
Board, is provided through Suffolk County Council. So it is part of a
national
network.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000097">My
noble friend Lord Whitty spoke eloquently about the way in which the
Government have simplified and introduced clarity to the arrangements
for trading standards and consumer protection. Of course, greater
clarity and transparency would have been provided had the Government
looked across legislation and considered the licensing of letting
agents, which is also in progress at the moment, and seen a potential
synergy between locating the licensing of letting agents with the
licensing of estate agents, given that letting agents and estate agents
are often effectively the same individuals. No doubt the
Government’s desire for clarity and simplification will mean
that these issues will be reviewed in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000098">No
doubt the Minister will give us a clear assurance on this, but my
understanding is that all the resources that were available to the
Office of Fair Trading for this estate agency licensing work have
indeed been transferred to the National Trading Standards Board, and
that money will be passed through to Powys County Council to do this
work. My noble friend commented on the difficult financial
circumstances that most trading standards departments around the

Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, when the Division
intervened, I was simply making the point that trading standards
departments around the country have been facing substantial reductions
in their budgets over the past few years. It is estimated that,
overall, trading standards funding from individual local authorities
will, on average, have diminished by 40% by 2015, which is a
substantial change. The only assurance that I can give my noble friend
Lord Whitty is that the resources for the estate agency function will

Hayter of Kentish Town:</Member></B> My Lords, I share the views of my
noble friend Lord Whitty that this is actually a sad day. I am sorry
that the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=299?>did not pay tribute to the extraordinary work that the NCC has done over
its life. It has been seen as that third part of civil society. There
have always been the employers and the trade unions, represented quite
rightly by their bodies; a third body representing consumers has been
really important for making markets work, being a big national player
along with the TUC and the CBI. It is a great sadness to lose that,
particularly—and I will come back to this—given the
fragmentation that the Government have managed to put in its place.
This was just about trying to get rid of a certain number of quangos;
we know that that is what it was. There was a rush into it and very
little understanding of what the NCC actually did because, as my noble
friend Lord Whitty said, there was very little duplication. I should
confess—or rather boast—that I was a member of the NCC
council and there was very little duplication between what we were
doing and what Citizens Advice was doing. Citizens Advice deals with
people coming through the door; we were trying to think of problems
five, 10 or sometimes 15 years
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:55:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

argument by just 12 votes at the time that the Public Bodies Bill went
through House, and my guess is that, having dealt with the complexity
of transferring those functions, BIS may have belatedly recognised the
force of our arguments. There are problems with Citizens Advice taking
over the work of the NCC. At the moment, it can answer only 45% of its
telephone calls and we have heard from my noble friend about the cuts
to the advice service, so there are problems
there<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:56:21"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
we recognise that the decision has been taken and we therefore need, or
want, whatever replaces the NCC to work as well as possible for the
sake of consumers. That is the important
criterion<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ready to ask about the order, but before that, I have another question.
Given the report on the pre-emption of Parliament by our own
Constitution Committee—which noted, when the Public Bodies Act
2011 was merely a Bill, that a number of public bodies began to wind
down their activities in anticipation of abolition—can the
Minister confirm that no public money was spent on the abolition of the
NCC and the transfer of functions prior to the relevant approval by
Parliament?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022430000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000104">On the order, there are
five areas in which we seek either assurances or answers. One is on the
transfer of Consumer Focus’s statutory information-gathering
powers—which have already been mentioned—to Citizens
Advice. There was an earlier debate here about whether those could be
overused, and in fact our Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee
returned to that issue. My concern is different: it is the potential
underuse of those powers by Citizens Advice. Given the increasing
demand on it for its own advice services from very hard-pressed
consumers, my concern is that it might take its eye off its longer-term
policy role, which has been played hitherto by Consumer
Focus<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:58:17"></hs_TimeCode>. It was
partly with that in mind, when the ERR Bill went through, that my noble
friend and I argued at that stage that someone—I think we
suggested the CMA—should have a sort of reserve power to ensure
that sufficient attention was paid to this element of Citizens
Advice’s work, given that its own programme and budget were laid
down by its individual charitable trustees. Those 
<?notus-xml column=300?>trustees are not accountable to BIS or any other arm of
government<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T17:58:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
question, therefore, is: what happens if Citizens Advice falls down on
that part of consumer protection? Who would know? It would certainly
not be the consumers: there is no accountability for this work to
consumers. The letter that Vincent Cable wrote to the noble Lord, Lord
Goodlad, on 17 January,
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14022430000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000243">“The

am not clear how that will happen. Will it be done simply by the terms
of the grant? If so, how will the Minister hear consumers’ views
and what action would she take if, for example, Citizens Advice failed
to prioritise vulnerable consumers or the users of government-provided
services? How would the Minister know and what would she do if she
found any such
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:04:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_parafo><hs_time UID="14022430000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000277">6

second question arises about the transfer of the OFT’s role in
issuing a warning and prohibition orders in relation to estate agents
and the approval of the estate agent requesting, which was touched on
by my noble friend Lord Harris. My noble friend also mentioned that the
ERR Act made it mandatory for letting agents—sometimes, as he
said, the same organisations as estate agents—to belong to a
redress scheme. As he said, the Government are not giving the same
powers to Powys on redress schemes for letting agents as they are for
estate agents. So the existing OFT-approved redress scheme will come
under the watchful eye of Powys, but those redress schemes will have to
apply to a completely different body to be approved to be the redress
scheme for letting agents. That would be nonsense; perhaps the noble
Lord will take a moment to explain that to
us<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:01:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000106">The
Secondary Legislation Scrutiny Committee also raised some serious
concerns about how Powys could reconcile its accountability to
different bodies. Obviously, Powys, as an elected authority, has a
responsibility to its electors. As we have heard, it will be
accountable to BIS for this part of its work, it will report to the
National Trading Standards Board, and it will be accountable to the
Trading Standards Institute for the administration of its grant.
Perhaps the Minister could explain how easy it will be for the people
concerned to report to so many different bodies. After all, as my noble
friend Lord Harris said, it will be the national body covering 25,000
estate agents which, between them employ about 1 million
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:02:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000107">Meanwhile,
there is the role of Anglesey. The Minister seems to say that appeals
were to the tribunal, but the information I have from Powys dated 2
December 2013 outlining the appeal process—not for redress
schemes but for estate agents who have been
barred—states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14022430000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000244">“The

the Minister confirm that I am reading that correctly and, if so,
whether every estate agent in England and Wales would have to get
themselves to 
<?notus-xml column=301?>Holyhead within 14 days for a hearing, and reassure us that Anglesey,
which is, I think, only just out of special measures and likely to

I turn to the transfer of the ML role to HMRC. I just say:
congratulations, this bit is brilliant. I hope that the Minister does
not faint to hear that. In fact, in a previous existence, when I was
chair of the Property Standards Board, I very unsuccessfully urged the
then Labour Government to do that, so I am delighted that that is
happening; it is very sensible. It means that the HMRC will then have a
complete list of estate agents, so will be very helpful if the Minister
could tell us whether that will be given to Powys, which would
undoubtedly help it in its work. As an aside, it is rather silly that
anti-money-laundering affects estate agents, who do not handle money,
but does not affect letting agents, who do. Maybe someone else could
deal with that.</hs_para>

was touched on by my noble friend Lord Whitty—there is real
concern about whether this new architecture will ensure the
continuation of the European work that has been so well done by
Consumer Focus and, before that, by the NCC. I do not think that the
Committee needs telling how much consumer law is made in Brussels, so
any reduction in that could be a real detriment to consumers. There is
no mention of it, or indeed of the EU, in the explanatory document or
in the scrutiny committee’s report—at least, I could not
find it. Looking around the Room, I am not the only person who found
that it was not there. It would be useful to have some clarification
from the Minister about the continuation of this work.</hs_para>

what my noble friend Lord Whitty said: so much for a clear system. We
get rid of the OFT and the NCC, and instead we have the Competition and
Markets Authority, Citizens Advice and Citizens Advice Scotland, the
Trading Standards Institute, Consumer Futures for a little bit, the
Consumer Protection Partnership, the National Trading Standards Board,
Trading Standards Scotland and Powys and Anglesey county councils. How
that is a clearer architecture leaves me bemused.</hs_para>

said that they will monitor this set-up. Perhaps the Minister can tell
us whether and how that report will come to Parliament. However, the
Opposition do not consider that this order meets the test of the Public
Bodies Act 2011, that measures should lead to a more efficient,
effective and appropriate level of accountability to Ministers. It is a
dog’s breakfast. It is accountable to Powys for some things, to
trading standards for others, to BIS indirectly through a grant and
accountable partly to the trustees of an independent charity. The one
group to whom it is not accountable, of course, is consumers
themselves.</hs_para>

overhasty, ill thought-out change. It is simply about the Government
wanting to abolish a quango. It is not about protecting consumer
interests or about transferring the tool that is needed to a legitimate

way, the order is diluting

National Consumer Council has made to consumer issues over the years,
and the no small part that a number of noble Lords have played in
contributing to that. I believe that I said this earlier, but the
NCC’s strong track record of consumer advocacy was one of the
key reasons for the body being folded into Consumer Focus when it was
created by powers under the Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Act
2007. The great track record of the NCC was enhanced and expanded when
it joined with Energywatch and Postwatch to form Consumer Focus in
2008. It will be further enhanced when it joins the Citizens Advice

noble Lord, Lord Whitty, asked how the consumer journey will work under

are simply joining up the policy-making and regulatory oversight
expertise of Consumer Futures with the existing consumer
complaint-handling abilities of the Citizens Advice service. As a
result of these changes, anyone needing impartial help or advice on a
consumer issue, whether that is a general matter or on a regulated

more about

been the expression he used. Citizens Advice will work closely with

whether they had the expertise to deal with the work. I can reassure
him that the Citizens Advice service is already fully engaged on policy
and research across a very wide range of consumer issues. It has both
the experience and expertise to provide a highly effective voice for
consumers, and this capability will be bolstered by the expert staff
transferring from Consumer Futures. The Citizens Advice service will

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, my question was slightly different. It
concerned the addition of what was the Consumer Focus function,
particularly the function that was not funded by industry, which has
been handed over to Citizens Advice. Has the amount of money that was
previously spent by Consumer Focus on that area of its work prior to
2010 been reflected in a proportionate increase in the funding of
Citizens Advice? My impression is that it has not, and that while the
aggregate amount for Citizens Advice may have been maintained in
difficult times, the full reflection of what was previously done
elsewhere is not reflected in that total figure. It would be useful to
have the
figures.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022430000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000278"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:14:15"></hs_TimeCode>6.15

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> Absolutely. I was going to say that I
will be more than happy to write to the noble Lord to confirm the
precise figures. I reiterate that it is not our intent to cut the
funding. The funding to the service to deliver advocacy on energy and
postal matters will be maintained as currently allocated to Consumer
Futures, at £8.7 million, with an additional £220,000
allocated to the general Consumer Council for Northern Ireland to
deliver postal advocacy. This funding will be recouped via the levy

noble Lord, Lord Whitty, also asked whether I would ensure that the
lead local authority is properly resourced to undertake this work. This
is to do with the estate agency functions. The baseline costs of
policing the UK estate agency market will transfer, as he knows, from
the OFT into the NTSB’s enforcement grant. This amount will be
ring-fenced from the main portion of the grant to ensure that the full
funding will be used for the purpose

Harris, spent some time speaking about Powys and the transfer of the
OFT estate agency function. In thanking him for his support, I want to
clarify—perhaps for the noble Baroness, Lady Hayter—that
we believe that the role of Powys is very important within the new
national enforcement regime, and I re-emphasise the national element of
that for the avoidance of doubt. The noble Lord and the noble Baroness
asked why the Government were not harmonising letting agencies in
addition to the changes that we are making to estate agents. The noble
Baroness will be aware that letting agents are already subject to
consumer protection legislation. The Government do not believe in
excessive regulation. The amendment of the Estate Agents Act to include
letting agents would lead to overregulation of the market, which would
run a real risk of reducing supply in the rented sector, which in turn
would drive up rents and reduce the choice for hard-working
tenants<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:16:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000125"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hayter of Kentish Town" PimsId="5755" UID="14022430000317" xid="2032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000317">Baroness

I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:16:05"></hs_TimeCode> am sorry that
I was not clear. I absolutely understand that—I may not go along
with it but I completely understand it. I asked about a different
issue. At the moment, a redress scheme for estate agents has been
approved by the OFT. Approval for that redress scheme will now go to
Powys. I understand that. There will then be redress schemes for
letting agents—I think they will be the same schemes, but that
is neither here nor there. In order for a letting agent to be approved
by the redress scheme, they will not be able to go to Powys to get a
tick; I understand that they will have to go through the DCLG. That is
the same issue mentioned earlier by my noble friend about two
departments not quite co-operating. My question is not about the
letting agents themselves but the approval of a redress scheme for
letting agents. It is extraordinary that it is not being done in the
same way as for estate
agents<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:17:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Viscount Younger of Leckie" PimsId="4709" UID="14022430000318" xid="2037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000318">Viscount
Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I have listened carefully to the noble
Baroness, and I believe that she is correct. She mentioned the DCLG,
and I can say that the reforms will create a new requirement for
letting agents to join an approved redress scheme. It will be
implemented through the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act
2013, which she was very much a part of, with my good self. The order
simply transfers existing enforcement arrangements from one body to
another rather than creating a new redress scheme. I do not know

noble Baroness raised an important point about Citizens Advice being
able to answer only about 45% of calls—to paraphrase her
question. I am not clear where those figures come from because Citizens
Advice is now reporting very high levels of satisfaction on the use of
its national call line. Perhaps the noble Baroness can advise me on
where she got those figures. They

raised the important issue of accountability relating to Powys County
Council. She said that it is convoluted and unclear, but we believe
that that is not true. Ultimately Powys County Council will be
accountable to BIS, as I explained in my opening speech. As she knows,
Powys will report to the National Trading Standards Board in its role
as co-ordinator, and the NTSB is accountable to BIS. I am not entirely
sure why she is concerned about that because we believe that there is
actually quite a short direct reporting line to BIS. Again, I am
extremely happy to speak to her outside this Room to clarify what I
mean by that. At the same time, the noble Baroness raised the issue of
Anglesey. I can confirm that Anglesey’s licensing committee will
play no role in appeals against Powys’s warning and prohibition
orders. These will be made first to the First-tier Tribunal.</hs_para>

asked how the Government will ensure that Citizens Advice will deliver
on the work that it has been given and how its work will be monitored.
We will hold annual performance reviews with the Citizens Advice
service to ensure that the new arrangements are effective and that the
successor bodies are delivering on behalf of consumers. We will also

raised the question of whether Section 24—in other words, the
information-gathering powers—would be underused. I reassure her
that Citizens Advice will have full access to these powers should it
require them. She also asked when Powys and HMRC would receive the list
of estate agents from the OFT. HMRC is already in an
information-sharing agreement with the OFT as a supervisor under the
Money Laundering Regulations 2007. The order provides an
information-sharing gateway for Powys that will come into force as soon

noble Baroness also asked how the consumer will be represented in
Europe. The CMA will be responsible for acting as the UK’s
single liaison officer in ensuring compliance with the consumer
protection co-operation regulation. It will forward individual
enforcement actions to the NTSB unless they relate to problems where it
takes the lead. However, Citizens Advice will continue to work closely

ability, not the strongest that keeps on winning. My blood pressure

provide qualified coaches to deliver cricket sessions and matches in
schools, train teachers and encourage children to come and play at

largest structured primary school initiative in England and Wales gives
children aged five to 11 at 10,000 schools the opportunity to play and

concerns and tensions. Sport is only partly at international level and
only partly competitive. As has already been mentioned, the noble
Baroness, Lady Campbell, recently talked about “a crisis of
inactivity”—not of sport, of inactivity. There have been
reports of competitive sports encouraging pupils to cheat because of
pressure to win and suggestions that pushy parents and grandparents on
the touchline set a bad example for behaviour at sporting events. I
have seen that. Sadly, there are examples of the poor behaviour of
professional, or at least competing, sportsmen—usually, they are
men—which degrade the name of
sport<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:35:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000150">Let
me try to tease out the issue further. When I taught in schools and,
indeed, when I was in school all those many years ago, it was clear
that many children were not going to succeed in competitive sport.
Sport for them did not improve self-belief and self-esteem; quite the
contrary. Such pupils hated games, invented excuses not to do them,
lied, forged sickness notes from parents, and so on. Sadly, they were
often bullied and disparaged for not being able to catch, throw, run or
swim. I am sure that it is the same in schools today. We know that many
girls simply give up physical activity when they do not have to do it
at school. What a
pity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000151">I have
always supported the notion of health-related fitness, as well as
competitive sport; they are not mutually exclusive. Many schools now
offer dance, 
<?notus-xml column=310?>movement and exercise which all can enjoy. Classes in yoga, tai chi,
Pilates and Zumba—whatever that is—are proliferating in
communities. They are not competitive, except perhaps in relation to
oneself. Walking is competitive in relation to oneself and the
elements. I went for a walk in Sussex recently and fought against the
wind and the
mud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000152">If there
is enjoyment in being able to perform a physical activity, the activity
may well continue, to the benefit not only of the body but of the mind.
It is well known that physical activity also improves mental
performance. Mr Gove recently praised the academic achievement of
pupils in Shanghai schools. I wonder whether he is aware that in
Shanghai, pupils also do one hour of physical activity a
day<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:37:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000153">I
turn to cricket for a few final thoughts. Wasim Khan, chief executive
of the Cricket Foundation, has spoken of concern that so many
youngsters may be struggling “in a pressure cooker” to
win at all costs. He has emphasised the need to play fairly and to
respect the rules and the opposition. The ECB programme, Chance to
Shine, cited by the noble Baroness, Lady Heyhoe Flint, is a brilliant
example of taking sport into inner-city schools. It is
competitive<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:37:41"></hs_TimeCode>, but
in a fairly light-hearted way.</hs_para>

Baroness’s Question refers to younger children competing in
sport. I must say that I would not like younger children to be
demoralised by an apparent lack of sporting ability or being in a
pressure cooker. Younger children should be, and many are, active
creatures. They like being physical. If they can taste the excitement
of competition, handled well and positively, that could be a good
experience that it can be fun to not win. All I am saying—I
think that the noble Baroness will agree—is that qualities of
collaboration, teamwork and respect for others are part of sport and
that those qualities should not be downplayed in favour of competition,

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for
tabling this debate, although I fear that when I read the articles
about Surrey, I understood why they are bringing that provision in. To
deal with that first, Rugby Union is a game where physical size and
strength are important. If you have a group of children who are bigger
earlier, they do not compete; they smash down and defeat their
opponents and drive them down. They gain nothing in terms of
competition from being bigger and stronger; they do not actually have
to be very good at the game; and those that they are walking over do
not benefit from that either. That is why, in a club game, it is now
encouraged that if someone matures earlier, you stick them in with
older people. Thus, that article becomes more understandable. When
someone says, “You’re taking away the trophy from my
children and my club”, I say, “If you’re judging
the success of your club by a trophy won by under-nines, go away and
have a think about yourself”. That is my take on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000156">When
it comes to competition, I do not know a sporting activity in which
competition is not involved. Competition does not mean the end result
but the 
<?notus-xml column=311?>process by which you undertake these games—how, in any team sport
where you have a ball, you move that ball around to achieve your ends.
How you teach people to run and receive the ball within the confines of
that game is the essential competitive element from which a score can
be derived. The competition is the build-up, part of the structure, the
movement and the correct way in which you do that. People get obsessed
about scores, results and league tables that they can publish and point
at—and they are often the people who are not taking part in the
sporting activity.</hs_para>

true competitive element—that is, getting somebody in a
competition where the outcome is not more or less
predetermined—you are creating competition. By evening the sides
out, you create it. Why do you have first, second and third teams in
adult sport, in amateur games? It is so that you have even competitive
results. The RFU is removing trophies from its junior ranks because
they are meaningless for the adult game. The idea that you should have
a contest on as even terms as you can get, where the result is not
guaranteed, is essential. If we can  bring this into the youth
policy, it means making sure that people are trained
properly to create these
situations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:41:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000158">To
go back again to rugby union, the sport I know full well, it was
probably the worst game for children ever at full 15 level on a full 15
pitch. “Let’s put the winger out there and see if he gets
hypothermia first or dies of boredom”, because the ball is too
big for him to carry and the pitch too big. All team sports suffer from
this to an extent. Rugby is probably the worst, but I remember Trevor
Brooking recently saying something about having a full-sized pitch and
small children, and how the biggest kid who can kick it down the field
and then win it in the air will win you the game. Half of both teams

when we are talking about competition, look at the essence of what it
is. Forget about the league tables and the junior trophies. Let us talk

terms as possible. It ain’t going to be for everyone, but most

have been on the losing side many times and, quite frankly, it is
miserable. Many sports have guidelines on how winners should behave,
and I am glad to see that this will be extended to what I call
overenthusiastic parents. There has been a lot of debate about the
right way to encourage fair play and, while losing can be perhaps a
little easier to understand, if not accept, as you get older, it is
down to the skill of the coaches and teachers to balance competitive
teams but not in a patronising way. I have seen some great examples of
balance and, while being beaten by a massive margin is miserable,
knowing that someone was being easy on you is worse. We should be more
creative, but I do not wish to see junior competitions dumbed down;
trophies should be awarded for excellence, effort, and
commitment.</hs_para>

in another place, Mrs Helen Grant, has been extensively quoted this
weekend speaking about girls in sport. She was building on research
that has shown why many girls drop out of physical activity and how
they feel about competition. We know the issues—they have not
changed that much in the years that I have been involved—but one
piece of news that I am really pleased about is that the ECB has
professionalised the women’s game and is offering paid
contracts. I heartily congratulate it and cannot wait for other
professional sports to follow. There may always be challenges around
body image for young girls but we can make it cool for girls to be
sporty and competitive, and what the ECB has done is very
powerful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000166">What
we can change relatively easily is how we deliver physical activity in
schools. Young people need to be physically literate. If they are
taught good, basic skills, they will be able to take part in a wide
range of activities with increased confidence and think more positively
about participating and competing. For me, the solution is simple: we
need to help teachers to deliver physical literacy. The investment that
the Government have made is incredibly useful, but think what we could
do if we took a radical approach and changed initial teacher training.
Can the Minister update us on what plans Her Majesty’s
Government have to look at teacher training, especially at primary
level, so that a lot of women teachers who may have dropped out of
sport between the ages of seven and 12 can understand the principle of
physical literacy and are better able to teach core skills?

career that started in the steel industry in Scotland when I was 17 and
has spanned more than 40 years working in business, broadcasting and
the media, but I am delighted to be able to make my maiden speech on a
subject that I am equally passionate about. I had the privilege of
chairing the Commonwealth Games in Manchester in 2002, was vice-chair
of the London 2012 bid and was Mayor of the Olympic Village. Visiting
thousands of grassroots clubs as chair of nations and regions has
fuelled that passion. I remember vividly one particular visit to the
Percy Hedley Academy for Disability Sports in north Tyneside where I
was asked to play wheelchair football, demonstrating that this sport is
not for the faint-hearted as I sped around at 20 mph much to the

2012, the world witnessed how London made the two greatest sporting
events, the Olympics and Paralympics, even better. Seventy thousand
Games makers and London 2012 volunteers around the country played a
huge part. Every competitor I spoke to told me how important volunteers
are at grassroots level: it had been volunteers who had inspired them,
volunteers who had coached them and volunteers who had raised money for
their equipment and training. We therefore need to encourage disabled
and able-bodied people from all walks of life to join this army of
volunteers: the Ritas who, after a gruelling shift at work, turn up
even on the wettest Wednesday evening in Wigan, Winchester and Wishaw
to coach the under-12s; the Roys who give up their time to repair and
maintain the club houses; the Alans who do the fixtures and the
transportation; and the Amys who spend many hours

Lady Heyhoe Flint for initiating this debate because it is very
interesting. In field sports, it is often the adult motivation we are
looking at rather than that of the children who are participating. We
should start from that kind of standpoint. I will explain what I mean
by that. Very often, many of the practices that adults expect of
children are too difficult for the children themselves to do. They are
expected to win at all costs. Every Saturday, I take our dog for a walk
and I go past schools where they are playing football. I tell you as an
engineer that the language that I hear there frightens the
dog—and the dog is a Rottweiler—never mind frightening
me. The other problem, which has been mentioned before, is about not
being good enough, because, as has rightly been said, kids are at
different stages of development. Very often, it is the most physically
developed who get onto the
team<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:52:07"></hs_TimeCode>, and that

my connection to Rugby League, I want to talk about what we are trying
to do there. We are running a new pilot scheme. In 2011 we decided to
look at what was happening with seven and nine year-olds and see what
we could do about it. We looked at the existing practices that were
taking place, and from that a pilot scheme has evolved. It is designed
to make playing itself more fun for the children—to make them
enjoy it and want to do it. It is designed also to give them more time
on the ball and to develop their skills. It is absolutely providing
that. To give them an opportunity to develop skills is very
important.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=315?>modified game so all children can play. No child is left out: there are
enough teams to ensure that everyone has a chance to participate in it.
There are no substitutes either, so they all get a chance to develop
their skills. Even when they have not been interested, we are finding
that there is an interest that children take. More importantly, we are
finding that this interest is being carried on later in life, so that
the interest in sport

pilot scheme itself was launched in Leeds and was particularly
successful in east Leeds, which is one of the more deprived areas of
the city. We saw a dramatic increase in under-sevens who are
participating in the game and registering to be in it. It is a new step
forward, as far as we are concerned, in getting children involved in
the game. I will finish on this because my time is up. Having been
rolled out in Leeds, it is now being rolled out across Yorkshire and
that will be followed by Cumbria, London and the north-west, so I hope

agree with other noble Lords that dads can be a bit of a problem. They
are standing there yelling their heads off and trying to fulfil their
own dreams; normally they were not very successful themselves. I
remember one friend of mine pulling his youngster off the field and
saying, “You little blankety-blank coward”, which I did
not think was very helpful for a 10 year-old, and that is the sort of
conduct that you see. I have been there refereeing, controlling dads on
the line, coaching and trying to get parents to realise that little
Johnny may not have been picked for the very best of reasons. The
problem is that children feel that they have failed, and become
disillusioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000181">The
noble Lord, Lord Hoyle, talked about Rugby League and outlined the
programme that the RFL has carried out. The one area that he did not
refer to, however, was north Wales. I declare an interest: my son is
the chief executive of the North Wales Crusaders. The club started up
two and a half years ago, and rugby league is now the most delivered
sport in schools in north-east Wales. It is simple and inclusive.
Coaches focus on the physical literacy to which the noble Baroness,
Lady Grey-Thompson referred. It encourages them to run, pass, catch and
dodge with the ball in hand, and promotes the fun aspects of the game
before anyone gets hung up on winning. This is done first in school
sessions and then encouraged at larger mass participation events. The
North Wales Crusaders’ “Give &amp; Gain Day”
brought 400 children together from 20 schools to attend one event,
where players from the professional team, who had qualified as coaches
especially for the event, ran different “skill stations”,
encouraging the children to develop that physical literacy before being
introduced to a competitive environment.</hs_para>

introduced in a controlled and inclusive way so as to avoid the
“biggest/strongest/fastest” issue that my noble friend
Lord Addington talked about. I recall that when I was in school, one
Kilblinski—known as “Killer Kilblinski” to his
friends—was playing with us in the First XV aged just 15. The
Crusaders have developed some simple strategies; for example, if a
child scores a try, he is taken off the pitch for two minutes and given
a break. This means that those who hog the ball spend less time on the
pitch if they simply try to score every time they touch the ball and do
not include those around them. That is a very sensible way of getting
more
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000183">In
the past 12 months the Crusaders have held 578 coaching sessions, with
95 schools or clubs involved; 2,800 children aged eight to 17 did on
average nine sessions each. However, the local council and Sport
Wales—which is focused on the union game—provide minimal
funding: between them, they do not even cover the cost of one community
coach’s salary. That has to be addressed if this sort of
participation is to be
encouraged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0001.htm#14022430000184">The
absolute key to all this is bridging the gap between school and the
community game. Sport does not end when the school gate is closed.
North Wales Crusaders are developing a network of
“doorstep” clubs, which can be easily introduced into all
communities. Who knows? Rugby league may dominate the north of Wales as
union does, very successfully, the
south.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_24_PT_1/15B26C2A38BFD9FC1BD4FE3A23DBA3D96D919CE0" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 February 2014">Monday,

I applaud the approach taken by Scotland in its
“Excellence” curriculum for physical education in primary
schools that calls for all subjects to be delivered in a physically
active way—not always through competitive sport. A step change
is also needed at the Department of Health towards preventive health
rather than having clinical targets, and recognition by the Department
for Education that physical education has a distinctive

biggest neglect in national strategy during the past two decades has
been the lack of focus on how local authorities can assist. In the main
they provide most of the facilities that clubs and national governing
bodies need to support young people and they often finance the most

The Government need to support local government, making spend on

School Games initiative was the silver bullet in the mind of Jeremy
Hunt in the run-up to the London Olympics. That was thought to address
competition in sport. It was a good idea in principle but I regret that
it has become in many respects a complex and unwieldy bureaucratic
structure of activities ranging from level 1 up to level 4. I well
recall going to a county level 3 in Kent where “Splat the
Rat” and golf with giant plastic clubs and foam balls were in
evidence on a hard tennis court. That was not competitive sport between
teams representing their schools. Everybody enjoyed themselves but the
reality is that funding, as recognised by the Government, should go
first into schools to improve delivery. It needs to be directed towards
the governing bodies of sport that for decades have built the expertise

make no apologies for raising the question of boxing in schools, and
its importance. I wish to illustrate the beneficial side of competitive
sport, particularly boxing at school and amateur levels. Certainly at

boxing in schools promotes skill development and a structured pathway
leading to competition and coaching. Some who contend that boxing is a
dangerous and inappropriate sport for youths are, in my view,
misinformed. Boxing is not only about fisticuffs and strength but is a
sport based principally on skill, structure, rules and discipline. It
is also a sport that appeals to both boys and girls, and is less
dangerous than many sports as defined by Sport England.</hs_para>

competitions have taken place in various schools near where I was an
MP, in Manchester, but also in London, the south-west and other areas
of the country. I argue that in those schools, competitive boxing
increases fitness levels and promotes a healthy lifestyle. Many
teachers have witnessed increased motivation in disengaged students,
improvements in self-confidence and self-esteem, greater enthusiasm and
positive behaviour. Boxing teaches both girls and boys about the value
of respect, sportsmanship and self-worth. In my view, teachers and
parents heavily support competitive boxing in schools, with schools
such as North Chadderton School in Oldham, which I recently visited,
allowing students to be assessed practically on their boxing skill as
part of GCSE and A-level studies. At one of the schools I went to
recently, in fact, the Ofsted inspector was quoted as saying
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14022430000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0002.htm#14022430000266">“it

so left, I shall simply say that the current debate brought about by
the Minister for Sport underlines the need for a more appropriate
approach to sport. What planet is Helen Grant on when she advocates
young girls to take up more feminine sports like cheerleading, ballet
and roller skating to make them look “absolutely
radiant”? Tell that to Nicola Adams, the boxing gold medallist,
or Gemma Gibbons, the silver medallist in judo, or indeed our speakers
today: the noble Baronesses, Lady Heyhoe-Flint, Lady Massey and Lady
Grey-Thompson, the greatest Olympian of them all. They are all feminine

the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, said, despite the title, most
noble Lords who have spoken in this rather excellent debate have
challenged the binary 
<?notus-xml column=319?>assumption of the title and drawn attention to the need to think much
more widely about the question of how we locate competitive sport
within sport in the context of other issues, such as the problems with
obesity in the population; issues about body image, which affect boys
and girls; the role of physical literacy, which is important across
many ways in which we engage with the world; and the role of elite
sports men and women in our society, possibly in combination with the
way in which the media relate to them.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, said, the situation that we face at the
moment is pretty dire because we have not achieved the aspirations that
we all had when we engaged with the Olympics. Indeed, the situation has
got worse since the end of the previous Government. In 2009-10, more
than 90% of pupils were taking part in two hours of PE and school sport
a week, up from an estimated 25% in 2002. In competitive sport, 78% of
pupils—77% of girls and 79% of boys—took part in
intraschool competitive activities. In 2009-10, 49% of pupils took part
in interschool competitive sport; again, up significantly. That was a
reasonable starting point and it was largely down to the success of
school sport partnerships, which have not been mentioned much today but
were a notable feature of the past decade or so, which increased
participation for both men and women and did not pose the question of
whether it was competitive or encouraging participation—it was
both.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022430000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0002.htm#14022430000202">Recent
research has shown a 60% decline in the number of schools involved in
organising school sport partnerships, and that is to be regretted. We
now read in the papers that more than half of children fail to get at
least two hours of physical education every week. The Education Select
Committee published a report in July that criticised the
Government’s approach to school sport, saying:</hs_para>

country for sporting competition. In the past year, 83% of children
aged 
<?notus-xml column=320?>five to 15 reported that they had participated in some form of
competitive sport—I think that the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of

sport plays an important role in a child’s development. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, and the noble Lords, Lord Allen and
Lord Stevenson, said, it is all about improving health and well-being,
but it also helps to teach children how to deal with the ups and downs
that life undoubtedly brings. I was very struck by what IOC President
Thomas Bach said last night in the closing ceremony about recognising
victory and defeat with dignity. It also teaches children how to work
in a team, which is extremely important, and many of your Lordships
have been involved in very senior team-making. It also improves
confidence and increases concentration.</hs_para>

widely held view that children should be physically active as early as
possible so as to gain the skills and confidence they need to compete
in sport—as well as life skills—and take them on into
adult life. That is why the Government are committed to reviving
competitive sport and why we have given it a much needed boost by
establishing the School Games and investing in the PE and sport primary
school premium. I agree entirely with the noble Baroness, Lady
Grey-Thompson, that it must be delivered in the right
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022430000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-gc0002.htm#14022430000207">Launched
in 2011, the School Games features more than 30 sports, many of which
have been raised during this debate. It is sponsored by

also wanted to raise an issue that has obviously been a matter of some
discussion in the newspapers, and I think it quite rightly belongs in
this debate. This is about ensuring that girls are given as many
competitive opportunities as boys. The noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
particularly raised this, as did my noble friends Lady Heyhoe Flint and
Lord Moynihan<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:20:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I
was interested to be briefed that now more girls than boys are
competing at the School Games county festivals. I very much hope that
this will be a feature of a continuing competition between the boys and
the girls to ensure that the girls are in the lead on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:21:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

volunteering. School Games is about more than just competing in sport.
The noble Lord, Lord Allen, who chairs the highly successful Join In
programme, will know well that School Games is also helping to build
teams of volunteers. Volunteers in sport are crucial: without them,
most sport simply could not happen. School Games is supported by a
range of volunteers, including non-teaching staff, parents and the
children themselves. I must also refer to referees, as my noble friend
Lord Thomas of Gresford raised referees as a very important feature of
any
sport<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:21:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T19:21:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
The county festivals alone benefited from more than 12,000 young
volunteers giving up their time to support the athletes and spectators,
while the majority of volunteers at the national finals were young
people, with over 500 involved in Sheffield last year.</hs_para>

should be able to enjoy and participate in competitive sport from a
young age, and take those skills with them on into secondary school,
the community and beyond. The important word that came out was
“fun”. My noble friend Lady
Heyhoe<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-24T18:43:57"></hs_TimeCode> Flint
mentioned the “fun environment”; the noble Lord, Lord
Hoyle, mentioned the word “fun”. It is very clear that
rugby league in his part of the world is in very good heart as it is in
Wales, in my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford’s part of the
world. Boxing is a game which the noble Lord, Lord Pendry, has
mentioned. They are all very much part of the community. That is why,
in addition to the School Games, and the premium and the curriculum, is
our £1 billion youth and community sport strategy for 11 to 25

Inquiry (COI) was established by a unanimous decision of the UN Human
Rights Council in March 2013. Its mandate is to investigate
independently the reports of systematic, widespread and grave
violations of human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic
of Korea. These include violations of the right to life, the right to
food, freedom of expression and freedom of movement; violations
associated with prison camps, torture and inhuman treatment, and
arbitrary detention; and enforced disappearances, including in the form
of abductions of nationals of other States. The Commission was also
tasked to conduct its investigation with a view to ensuring that those
responsible for human rights violations will be held accountable for
their crimes. The UK has actively supported the work of the Commission.
In October 2013, we arranged a visit by the Commissioners Justice Kirby
and Sonja Biserko to the UK, where they took evidence from North Korean
refugees and from NGOs. The Commissioners also met me as FCO Minister
of State, as well as other Parliamentarians.</hs_para>

systematically collected detailed and damning accounts of appalling
human rights violations in a way that has never been done previously.
Their findings are horrifying. They include: torture, rape, executions
and disappearances; using deliberate starvation as a means of control
and punishment in detention facilities; a virtually absolute ban on
ordinary citizens travelling abroad; and severe punishments for
practising Christianity. While the COI acknowledges it is neither a
judicial body nor a prosecutor, it believes its findings constitute
reasonable grounds to establish that crimes against humanity have been
committed. The Commissioners have found that the DPRK is a state where
human rights violations and crimes against humanity are ingrained into
the institutional framework, pursuant to policies established at the
highest level of the state. These crimes against humanity are ongoing
and occur as part of a systematic and widespread attack of the state
against anyone who is considered to pose a threat to the political
system and leadership of the DPRK. The report finds that the
DPRK’s isolationist mindset, aversion to engagement with the
international community, all-encompassing indoctrination policies, and
brutal security institutions protected by impunity are without parallel
in the contemporary world.</hs_para>

spotlight the Commission has shone on these shocking human rights
violations, which have gone on for far too long. I have urged the DPRK

Commission will formally present its report to the UN Human Rights

UK and Ireland launched a joint search for a new marker in 2012, which
concluded last autumn after rigorous evaluation. This unique

of oil and gas in the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). I am grateful to Sir
Ian and his review team for the work they have done, and to all those
who contributed. The report can be viewed at: www.woodreview.co.uk. I

UK oil and gas industry is of national importance; it makes a
substantial contribution to the economy, supporting around 450,000
jobs, and had record capital expenditure in 2013 of around £14
billion. Oil and gas will continue to be a vital part of the energy mix
as we transition to a low carbon economy, with indigenous oil and gas
production supplying the equivalent of about half of the UK’s
primary energy demand. It is vital, therefore, that we continue to
maximise economic recovery of our indigenous hydrocarbon reserves,
thereby boosting growth, energy security, and jobs.</hs_para>

review in June 2013 because, while investment levels are rising and
near-term prospects are strong, there are new challenges for
exploration and production, and the environment is very different 
<?notus-xml column=68?>to when production peaked approximately 15 years ago.
Production and exploration levels have fallen, and production
efficiency has declined. The review recognises the positive steps
already taken by the Government to incentivise recovery, such as the
allowances for brownfield and small fields. The report recommends that
industry commit to working with Government to implement the UK Oil and
Gas Industrial Strategy, and to develop new industry strategies in
areas such as exploration and decommissioning cost reduction.</hs_para>

Sir Ian’s key recommendation that Government should work with
Industry to adopt a cohesive tripartite approach between industry, HM
Treasury and the UKCS stewardship body to a new shared strategy of
Maximising Economic Recovery for the UK (MER UK). Sir Ian Wood has
identified some key recommendations for industry, including that
industry commit to making the most of production facilities, does more
to promote third party access to infrastructure, develops new
infrastructure business models, improves collaboration, improves asset
stewardship and reduces the legal and commercial burden of working in
the UKCS.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022412000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-wms0001.htm#14022412000098">The
report also recommends that stewardship of the UKCS should be under a
new arms-length body, funded by industry and better resourced. The
Review heard consistent praise for the staff working in the current
stewardship unit within DECC, but the Review concludes that it needs to
be strengthened and focussed around a new MER UK strategy if it is to
support industry in successfully meeting the challenges in the
UKCS.</hs_para>

to further detailed work to support the business case, we shall proceed
with taking the stewardship of the UKCS into the next phase, with a new
arms-length body, funded by industry, with new resources and any
necessary statutory powers to meet that challenge. We will develop
plans for a new arms-length body, and will introduce legislation in the
Fourth Session to bring the new body into effect. The next step will be
to appoint a Chief Executive Officer, with the aim of having that
person in post in the summer 2014, so that they can steer the work to
design and build the new body, which could being operating in shadow
form in the autumn. Stakeholders are being invited to participate in an
interim Advisory Panel on implementation, which Sir Ian Wood has agreed
to chair. I will publish a formal response to the Report – along

the recommendations will require Government and industry to adopt a
new, more collaborative, approach to stewardship of the UKCS. It is
vital that we create the right environment for maximising economic
recovery because the prize on offer is considerable. Sir Ian’s
report estimates that full and rapid implementation will deliver at
least 3-4 billion barrels of oil equivalent more than would
otherwise be recovered over the next 20 years, bringing over

are important in supporting our wider agenda on transforming

factor in reducing re-offending and these reforms will help more people
who have shown that they have put their offending behaviour behind them
to get back into productive work. The provisions will reduce the period
of time during which some offenders may have to disclose their
convictions to prospective employers (the rehabilitation period). I
should emphasise, however, that public protection will not be
compromised. It will remain the case that fuller disclosure of cautions
and convictions will continue to apply to a range of sensitive
occupations and activities. In addition, the most serious convictions
will remain subject to disclosure for any
job.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022412000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-wms0001.htm#14022412000174">The
measures being commenced are contained in sections 139 and 141 and
Schedule 25 to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders

‘spent’ and need no longer be disclosed for most
purposes. The changes also extend the scope of the 1974 Act as it
applies in England and Wales so that custodial sentences of up to, and
including, 48 months

national pay framework to reflect the changing nature of school

Children’s social work is one of the most demanding careers a
person can pursue, with the power to transform the lives of deeply
disadvantaged children. It requires a unique and highly complex set of
skills and knowledge. When those skills and that knowledge are not
present, lives which might have been transformed immeasurably for the

independent report, by former Barnardo’s chief executive Sir
Martin Narey, which reveals a training system which in too many
universities is not fit for purpose. He concludes that entry demands
are not high enough, the system of endorsement of courses is
insufficiently rigorous, and the content of those courses too generic.

stresses that some fine social work courses do exist, in too many
universities and in many social work texts, social work training can be
dominated by an emphasis on inequality, empowerment and anti-oppressive
practice. As Sir Martin Narey says, “sometimes, parents and
other carers neglect and harm children. In such circumstances, viewing
those parents as victims, seeking to treat them non oppressively,
empowering them or working in partnership with them can divert the
practitioner’s focus from where it should be: on the
child.”</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022412000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-wms0001.htm#14022412000210">Sir
Martin argues that there is too much theory, not enough good practical
experience. Training for children’s social work ought to
include: recognition of the signs of abuse, understanding of the impact
of child abuse and neglect in very early years and beyond, assessment
and analytical skills, training in how to question and engage parents
and children, a sound knowledge of the evidence base around parental
capacity and effective intervention including how to prepare a child to
move home, either in an emergency or to a new permanent family,
management of risk, the legal framework, and child development. To
learn how to apply this knowledge in practice, training must always
include a placement in a statutory
setting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022412000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224-wms0001.htm#14022412000211">Sir

social workers, as Sir Martin also reports, are entering university
ill-equipped to meet those demands. Between 2003 and 2012, no fewer
than 307 social work degree courses at 83 institutions were formally
approved, with a rapid increase in the number of entrants and
worryingly low entry standards: less than a third of those on
undergraduate courses 
<?notus-xml column=83?>had one or more A-levels. The failure rate on these courses was just 2.5
per cent. We want to see universities demand more of prospective social

what a newly qualified children’s social worker needs to

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member> Previous analysis on gender ratios
at birth, carried out by the Department based on birth registrations,
found that when broken down by the mothers’ country of birth, no
group is statistically different from the range that we would expect to
see naturally occurring. Given the large natural variation in gender
ratios, large sample sizes are required to give tests of suitable
power. Breaking down birth data by country of mothers’ birth
leads to small sample sizes. Consequently, to ensure tests of
statistical significance had reasonable power, the Department’s
analysis used data that was aggregated to a national level and across
the five most recent years. As analysis at sub-national level was not
practical, the issues raised by Simpson’s paradox were similarly
not of practical relevance. The analysis was quality assured by
statisticians at the Office for National
Statistics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022415000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415000004">It

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

must be accurately assessed prior to an abortion taking place. This is
important as different abortion methods are appropriate at different
gestations. Gestation can be assessed through ultra sound scanning,
pelvic examination and/or date of last menstrual period. Gestation is
recorded on form HSA4 by the terminating clinician. It is a mandatory
requirement that the HSA4 form is submitted to the Chief Medical
Officer and the terminating practitioner must certify “to the
best of my knowledge the particulars on this form are correct”.
If any evidence came to light that practitioners were falsifying
information on HSA4 forms this would be reported to the General Medical
Council to investigate, which could result in disciplinary
procedures.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14022415001163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415001163">Agriculture:

A proposal to authorise the planting of 1507 maize
was discussed at the European Union (EU) General Affairs Council on 11
February. The UK indicated its support for authorisation, given the
favourable scientific opinions of the European Food Safety Authority
and the UK Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment.
Variations in the level of Bt protein are to be expected and are not in
themselves a cause for concern. Whilst the protein level could have a
bearing on the potential for pest resistance and theoretically on the
risk to non-target Lepidoptera, these considerations have been
adequately addressed by the risk-management measures that will be
provided for in the EU authorising decision. The herbicide glufosinate
will not be used on 1507 maize crops in the EU, so its effect on Bt
protein levels is not a factor in this

levels of exposure to chemicals in contaminated bleed air would need to
occur in far higher concentrations to have toxic effects, and that a
causal link to the range of illnesses reported in relation to fume
incidents is
unlikely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022415000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415000065">As
stated in the CoT’s paper, any decision to undertake further
research would need to balance the likelihood that it will usefully
inform further management of the problem against the costs of
undertaking the work. Since 2008, successive Governments have devoted
considerable resources to the study of cabin air. An international
approach to future investigations now seems justified and, with this in
mind, the Department for Transport does not plan to undertake any
additional research. However, officials will forward the CoT’s
paper to the European Aviation Safety Agency in order to highlight the
CoT’s suggestions for further
research.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14022415001175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415001175">Bahrain</hs_DebateHeading><hs_DebateType>Question</hs_DebateType></NewDebate><hs_TabledBy UID="14022415001297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415001297">Asked

Responsibility forecasts that Real Household Disposable Income (RHDI)

As part of the Severn Estuary strategy, the
Environment Agency has created inter-tidal habitat on the Steart
peninsula at a cost of £20.2million. The new habitat helps
protect 75 properties and the high voltage power line from Hinkley
power station. In addition it compensates for the losses of
internationally important wildlife sites that would otherwise be lost

I would note that the National Planning Policy Framework states that
inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding should be
avoided. Local planning authorities should direct development away from
areas at highest risk, including floodplains, but where development is
necessary, it must be demonstrated that it is safe and will not
increase flood risk elsewhere. This gives councils the robust ability
to reject unacceptable planning applications. Councils' Local Plans
should also shape where development should and should not go, and
address the need for associated infrastructure to accompany new
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022415000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415000166">Flood
prevention measures, like robust flood and coastal defences, can make
development acceptable where it would otherwise not be. For example,

London. However, since 1983, the Thames Barrier has mitigated that

national planning policy is clear that any new buildings that are

The aim of Flood Re is to provide support to those
who need it the most; this received wide agreement in the public
consultation. Properties built after 2009 were not covered under the
2008 Statement of Principles agreement, the predecessor to Flood Re,
and on this basis continue to be excluded. Strong planning controls
should mean that very few of those homes which have been built since
then will be in areas at risk of
flooding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022415000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415000169">Over
98% of the UK’s current housing stock was built before 2009.
Changing the cut-off date from 2009 to a later date could add between

in discharging spinal cord injured patients from ventilated beds may
occur for a number of reasons. Due to patients’ complicated
needs, the discharge planning for long term ventilator dependent
patients can be lengthy and complex. Often, continuing healthcare
funding is almost certain to be awarded, meaning that the clinical
commissioning groups (CCGs) will be responsible for funding and
sourcing care on discharge, wherever this is provided, which can also
take time. In addition to this, the spinal unit requires early
authorisation from CCGs to purchase the essential ventilators,
respiratory equipment and consumables required for discharge. It may
also be the case that further delays occur to allow for the specialist
training of necessary 
<?notus-xml column=198?>care staff. Discharge dates of patients with complex needs such as these
are often altered, which can delay the entire
process.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14022415001225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0001.htm#14022415001225">Health:

residency rules and who refuse to return home voluntarily may have to
be administratively removed. European Economic Area nationals who are
begging or sleeping rough will be administratively removed. From the

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member> The provisions in the Immigration Bill
relating to landlords are modelled closely on the existing civil
penalty scheme for employers of illegal workers in the Immigration and
Asylum Act 2006. Under the proposed scheme, a landlord will face a
civil financial penalty for letting property to an illegal migrant if
they have failed to comply with specified document checks. This civil
scheme is distinct from criminal prosecution involving bringing a case
to court, and the Bill does not create a criminal offence for
landlords. The scheme incorporates important safeguards to ensure the
arrangements are transparent and to protect the rights of landlords.
The maximum level of penalty is specified at £3,000 on the face
of the Bill (clauses 18 and 33), and may only be adjusted by
affirmative resolution order. Penalties will operate in accordance with
a scale set out in a statutory code of practice under clause 27, and
landlords will have a right to object to the Secretary of State against
a penalty (clause 24) and then to appeal to the civil courts (clause
25) on the grounds that they are not liable to the penalty, have
established an excuse, or the level of penalty is too
high.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14022415001234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140224w0002.htm#14022415001234">Immigration:

2012 inspired the country to enjoy sport, and the Government wants to
embed that enjoyment of sport and physical activity in children from an
early age, so that children develop a lifetime habit of healthy
activity. Through the cross-Government primary physical education (PE)
and sport premium we are providing 
<?notus-xml column=224?>over £450 million of ring-fenced funding across academic years
2013/14, 2014/15 and 2015/16. This goes directly to primary schools, to
be spent on the improvement of PE and sport, so that all children
benefit from high quality teaching, and have the opportunity to compete
against their peers. Building on this, the Prime Minister pledged on 6
February that this funding would continue until 2020, a significant
commitment to the health of our children and young people.</hs_para>
