Bach (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his Answer
as far as it goes. Parliament and the public were told time after time
to believe that Section 10 would act as a safety net for
those cases where it was manifestly unfair that the citizen should not
have access to civil legal aid. However, the application forms are
impossible for a non-lawyer to complete and a lawyer will not get paid
a penny if the claim for legal aid is unsuccessful. Even worse is the
fact that only in 3% of claims has legal aid ever been
granted. The noble Lord was a member of the JCHR which, along
with the Low Commission and many others, has recently criticised the
working of this provision. Now that he is a distinguished member of Her
Majesty’s Government, will he act to make this vital provision
fit for
purpose<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:38:19"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Faulks:</Member></B> The provisions contained in Section 10
of the LASPO Act make it perfectly clear that it is there for
exceptional cases where, in the absence of legal aid, there would be a
violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights or
possibly of the provisions of the European Union. It is not about
whether a case may be deserving; it has to fall specifically within the
confines of the section. As to the application form, it was consulted
on regularly and in detail before it became part of the process. I am
surprised that solicitors are having difficulty in filling it in. It is
possible for someone to fill in the form on their own and they can then
have a preliminary view given to them by the Legal Aid Agency as to the
prospects of success. It is true that the number of applications has
been much lower than expected and it is also true that very few have
been granted, but we are satisfied that the system is working in
accordance with the
section<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:39:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Thomas of Gresford (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, before the Bill was
introduced, the Government said that they were expecting 5,000 to 7,000
applications a year. In fact, in the first year there were 893, of
which only 23 were granted, which represents 1%. Is it not nonsense to
suggest that this provision is a safety net for those who seek
justice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:39:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Faulks:</Member></B> I can update the noble Lord by saying that in fact
the total number of applications received is now 1,030, and the number
granted is 31. I agree that it is a small percentage. It was difficult
for the Government to predict exactly how many applications would be
received. In fact, in some areas, including the area in which I
practised, that of clinical negligence, there have been virtually none
when it was expected that there would be very many. Trying to
anticipate what might or might not be considered to be a violation of
Article 6 has confounded many courts, not only in this country but also

Woolf (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps what the Minister has just
said indicates that I may have been right when I differed as a judge
from my distinguished predecessor, Lord Bingham. He took a narrow view
of the word “exceptional” while I took a very broad view
of it. I regard it as a word which should be used to ensure justice in
all cases where justice is required. Does the noble Lord agree with my
approach?</hs_para>

Faulks:</Member></B> The answer to the noble and learned Lord is that
it depends very much on the context in which
“exceptional” is used. The context in which it is used in
this particular section is by specific reference to the European
Convention on Human
Rights<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Beecham" PimsId="5821" UID="14021176000297" xid="2085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000297">Lord
Beecham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, in answer to a recent Written
Question from me, the Minister said that there had been 1,130
applications, of which 35 were granted, not the figures that
he has given today. Be that as it may, what was the Government’s
estimate of the number of successful applications and what did they
anticipate would be the proportion of successful applications? Given
that it has taken 14 months to reach a decision to grant legal aid in
an important inquest case in which counsel appeared four times without
any certainty of being paid, will the Government publish details of the
times taken to determine
applications<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Faulks" PimsId="5823" UID="14021176000298" xid="2086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000298">Lord
Faulks:</Member></B> In answer to the second part of the noble
Lord’s question, the Government will be happy to publish the
times taken. Indeed, I think that the noble Lord will be pleasantly
surprised at how quickly these applications are being processed. In
answer to the first part of his question, it was expected that some
3,700 would be funded each year. As I said in answer to an earlier
question, it is somewhat mysterious as to why so few have qualified.
Each case is considered separately by the Legal Aid Agency in
accordance with guidelines given by the Lord Chancellor. All those
doing this work are experienced and all of them follow the
guidelines<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T14:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Pannick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord said that Section
10 is working effectively. Will he give further

The Treasury has done some work on the so-called border effect:
what happens to growth if the Scottish economy and those of the rest of
the UK are separated by a border. Its best estimate was that over a
period of several decades, the Scottish economy could be about 4%
poorer than would otherwise be the case, compared to a reduction in the
rest of the UK economy of 0.2%. There are much bigger risks for the
Scottish economy through independence than there are for the rest of

in the 1990s unemployment in Scotland was slightly higher
than it was here. In recent years, and particularly in

that Scotland, while moving broadly in line with the UK, can do better
than the rest of the UK, as it has done in a number of respects. It is

that. There are, for example, great arguments about the division of oil
revenues. This has to be set against the block grant that
Scotland gets. When looking at the economic consequences of
independence, you have to look a long time in the future, not just a
year or two. Independence is not for Christmas—it is a long-term
business. The question for everyone in Scotland is not whether we are
going to be better off in six months or a year or five years, but where
we are going to be 10, 20 or 50 years down the line, because once you
have done this, you cannot reverse

contribute to the joint effort across government to influence the way
in which calories are consumed by children. I have encouraging news on

to my noble friend Lord Ribeiro for the part that he played in bringing
about the amendment 
<?notus-xml column=536?>on smoking in cars. A number of soft drinks companies have taken action
to reduce calorie content in their drinks. Coca-Cola has reformulated
its Sprite product. AG Barr pledged to reduce the average calorific
content in its portfolio of drinks. I have mentioned Sainsbury’s
and Tesco’s actions on their own brands. Premier Foods has
reformulated various products and reduced sugar in those. Therefore, we
are making headway and I think that the responsibility deal is proving
its worth.</hs_para>

therefore comes at a critical time, as it supports more than a million

Baroness for that reply. Will she confirm that in the 10 years that
have elapsed since I described to your Lordships’ House the
conditions in the refugee camps in Darfur, some 2 million people have
been displaced and between 200,000 and 300,000 people have died there?
Some 57 peacekeepers and UNAMID personnel have been murdered, with no
consequences for those responsible, while humanitarian agencies are
expelled and aerial bombardment continues unabated, both in Darfur and
in Kordofan. Why, while these serial violations occur, do we use
British resources to pay off Sudan’s debts? Why, as we approach
the fifth anniversary of the indictment for crimes against humanity of
Field Marshal Omar al-Bashir, the President of Sudan, can he travel
abroad with impunity and continue to control vast personal and
commercial interests while openly boasting that 2014 will be the year
that he will finish off what he began in Darfur 10 years
ago?</hs_para>

the spotlight that he has focused on the situation in Sudan. He is
right about the dire situation of many of the people there. We have no
doubt about the serious shortcomings of the Khartoum Government. The UK
Government’s primary and only concern is the welfare of the
Sudanese people. Our engagement and support is driven by what will make
a difference to them. We cannot walk away and we work at every level to

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, before we get on to this
afternoon’s main business of flood insurance, I have down one
amendment, relating to environmental regulation, which concerns the
effect that fracking will have on the water supply system. This has
been a major concern in another place for a number of Members of
Parliament, who have local problems about the impact that any major
expansion of fracking might have on watercourses and water
supplies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000066">I do
not intend, this afternoon, to open up the whole debate on the
importance or otherwise of fracking, what its effects might be and
whether we could repeat, 
<?notus-xml column=541?>in the UK and Europe, the experience of the United
States. For what it is worth, I doubt that it will be transformational,
but it will be important and will produce some significant gas and oil
in this country. That will need to be tightly regulated by the
Environment Agency, the HSE and local planning systems. In particular,
water supplies and watercourses will need to be protected and, if
anything goes wrong, fracking companies will have to be seen to be
clearly
liable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000067">On the
relationship between fracking and the water supplies, there are three
main issues. First, there could be pollutants released, potentially,
into water systems and aquifers by the fracking process—that is,
the chemicals contained in the fluids that are used in the hydraulic
fracturing process. There are also naturally occurring contaminants
which could be released from the shale itself, including naturally
occurring radioactive contaminants. There could also be fugitive
emissions released into ground-water, particularly of methane. All of
those could have serious effects on water quality, ecology, habitats
and water supply. To a greater or lesser extent, all have been
experienced in the United States, although on a limited
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000068">Secondly,
if the fracking industry develops on any scale, for the purposes of
shale extraction fracking will also require major abstraction of water
from the system. As we have already stressed in previous days in
Committee, the urgency of reform of the abstraction system needs to
take into account the impact of mass fracking on abstraction levels and
hence on already stressed catchments. This is linked to amendments we
discussed the other day. For example, if fracking companies take up the
headroom in existing licences in particular catchments, then a lot of
catchments could be in serious trouble if they are not
already.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000069">Thirdly,
there is the requirement for the cleaning and treatment of the water
that has been used in fracking, which will need to be
decontaminated.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14021176000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000070">Amendment 154 really
focuses on the first of these effects, and to some extent the third,
but all three are important for the water system and need to be taken
into account. It is vital that we protect ground and surface water. For
example, in the south of England, 70% of the water supply depends on
healthy aquifers. This includes drinking water as well as water for
industrial and agricultural use. Frankly, the American experience,
though variable, is not completely reassuring. In another place, my
colleague Joan Walley quoted an example from Pennsylvania, where
methane was found in 82% of drinking water samples. We need to be
reasonably confident that our regulators, the Environment Agency and
the Drinking Water Inspectorate, will operate a much more effective
regulatory regime here in the UK than has been operated in certain
parts of the United States. Even so, and with a fairly high degree of
confidence in our regulators, disasters—or at least
leakages—may well
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000071">We
have a history of earlier energy sources to instruct us: the legacy of
coal mining and, in a somewhat different vein, the earlier phases of
the nuclear industry. Not only can pollution occur, we have seen the
inability of the organisations that produced the pollution to finance
the decontamination and the clear-up, which have required very
substantial sums. We all support the “polluter pays”
principle in theory, but we also 
<?notus-xml column=542?>have to ensure that the polluter can pay. In both coal and nuclear, it
has in effect fallen to the taxpayer to pay for the clear-up over the
past few decades, and that is still going
on.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14021176000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000268">3.15

fracking of shale gas is likely to benefit the companies involved with
substantial tax concessions and, whether rightly or wrongly, the
companies involved expect to make substantial profits from fracking.
Those companies really should be required to show not only that they

safety regulatory requirements but also that, if something goes wrong,
they have the ability to cover potential liabilities.</hs_para>

My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, has explained, Amendment 154

security when applying for an environmental permit so
that funds would be available
to deal with any water pollution incident caused by the operator. The
amendment would

industry in this country—an aspiration supported at Second
Reading—to provide us with an important source of gas for our
future, but it is vitally important that it is safe. We already have a
well established UK conventional onshore oil and gas industry that has
happily coexisted with local communities, in some cases for half a
century or more. This has been achieved not least because the industry
has maintained a good record of environmental responsibility and
competence. The existing controls and the application of good
operational practice have served us well to prevent pollution from

Department of Energy and Climate Change assesses as a matter of course
whether a company has sufficient funding for its planned operations
prior to awarding any licence. It also checks at the drilling stage
and, where relevant, at the production stage that the company has
appropriate insurance. Similar financial competence checks are also
carried out by the Environment Agency as part of the permitting
process. In the event of serious damage to surface or ground-water, the
Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales have powers, under the
Environmental Damage (Prevention and Remediation) Regulations 2009 and
the equivalent Welsh regulations, to serve a notice requiring that the
polluter pays to clear up the pollution. If a significant environmental
risk becomes apparent, the Environment Agency has the authority to stop
the activity. These powers apply to a wide range of operations and
activities undertaken by different industries. I do not think that it

the Government are aware that there are widely felt concerns about the

the Department of Energy and Climate Change and the shale gas industry
are working to put in place a robust scheme that would cover
liabilities even if the relevant operator is no longer in business.
They are also in discussion with leading insurers about proposals to
build expertise and capacity in the insurance market to facilitate the
development of products specifically appropriate for unconventional
operations, which in turn could facilitate the development of an
industry-wide scheme. In addition, while we already have a robust
regulatory framework in place, I can confirm that it will be reviewed
and refined as appropriate as we move towards the production phase. The
question of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, will be addressed in that
process. This regulatory review will include the question of
environmental liabilities in the wider sense, not solely relating

we have provided for such a possibility for current operations,
although obviously there is a huge legacy that has not been provided
for and a huge bill for the taxpayer as a result. We have done the same
on a much lesser scale in relation to landfill. We could probably also
establish a regime in relation to fracking to ensure that this

is some progress. I will watch this space, as I am sure will others. At

Parminter (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, in the face of the desperate
flooding challenges that many in our country are now facing and look
set to face in the future, I strongly welcome the proposals for Flood
Re, which we are now coming on to debate and which will provide
affordable flood cover for all households. My Amendments 154A, 154B,
156A and 156B give Flood Re, which will be a private company in receipt
of public money, a duty to act in the public interest and extend its
remit to help deliver a more resilient future in the face of flooding,
working with other bodies to achieve that where
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:26:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will benefit householders at risk of flooding. However, if flood risk
management is not significantly improved over the lifetime of the
scheme, we will be in no better a place after 25 years 
<?notus-xml column=545?>than we are now. The adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on
Climate Change—and I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Krebs,
in his place today—in its policy note to the Government last
month makes it clear that significant increased investment in
flood-risk management is required, as well as in flood defences, if the
levels of risk are to be maintained, let alone
reduced<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:26:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

awareness of flood risk, direct policy holders to advice and support
and, crucially, if sufficient reserves are generated, it could support
measures that individuals or groups can take to reduce flood risk.
Surplus funds could, for example, pay for property-level measures, such
as flood gates and air brick covers, which typically cost £5,000
per property. Government grants of between £2,000 and
£4,500 are available, so Flood Re could, for example, meet the
difference. It would be a sound investment, given that every £1
invested in property-level protection typically achieves a benefit of
£5 or more; or it could contribute towards the cost of
Environment Agency schemes that do not justify full government grants
under the partnership funding approach. Funding from Flood Re could
make the difference between a flood defence scheme going ahead or not,
which would be worthwhile if it were to protect some of Flood
Re’s highest-risk customers.</hs_para>

determine what Flood Re could do, it is critical to know how any
surplus funds will be defined and what will happen to them. The
evidence of a Defra stakeholder presentation on Flood Re, in a slide
entitled “Flood Re’s exposure to claims”, gives a
median-loss scenario of £65 million in claims per year. That
means that it could have at least £100 million in reserves at
the end of the first year. Defra’s final impact assessment for
Flood Re, in table 5 on page 20, states that, over the life of the
scheme, it should on average make an annual surplus of £27
million. This calculation is based on Flood Re’s expected loss
scenario which takes account of the low-probability/high-cost flooding
that could take place during the 25 years for which the scheme is
operational<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:28:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

likely to hold significant sums of public money that could be used to
help manage down flood risk. This would help save everyone money:
high-risk households, other policyholders and Flood Re itself. This
could be achieved without the main £180 million levy needing to
be increased because it could just be pursued if Flood Re were in
surplus. Over the 25-year lifetime, this would make a material
difference to the number of homes at significant risk while helping
those households secure affordable flood insurance on an ongoing basis
once Flood Re is withdrawn. It is therefore important to know how the
Government expect any surplus to be defined, in order that it might
support such an approach. I look forward to hearing more from the
Minister on that in his response.</hs_para>

Shipley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lady
Parminter and strongly welcome the Government’s proposals on the
Flood Re scheme. Getting insurance in high-risk areas is of fundamental
importance to the individuals affected; the outcome of the negotiations
and planning that have gone into the scheme is very important. All
those who have taken part in that should, in my view, be
congratulated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:30:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000093">However—I
refer here specifically to Amendments 154A and 154B—Flood Re
cannot be just about reinsurance: it also has to be about reducing
flood risk over time by getting householders who have been flooded and
claimed on their insurance and householders who are at high risk to
invest in better flood protection. As my noble friend Lady Parminter
said, in 25 years’ time we should not be in a position where we
have not made any progress in flood protection and end up simply
repeating the
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:30:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, Flood Re should not be seen simply as a financial
transaction providing a means of reinsuring properties at risk, or
deemed to be at risk. We have to go a step further and provide
incentives for people to engage proactively in flood risk
management<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:31:11"></hs_TimeCode>.
There are clear benefits in this for the insurance industry: better
protection will lead to lower total claims. Householders will gain
greater security from
flooding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

156B—which are intended to be probing amendments—are
about the duty of the Flood Re scheme administrator to co-operate with
all those bodies that have an existing duty to co-operate under the
2010 Act. It is very important to put this point in the Bill
because, as I said, the scheme should not be seen to have just a
financial role: it has to be about resilience as well. The introduction
of the FR scheme administrator means that strategic interventions can
be undertaken. For example, each household in a given
high-risk area might be with a different insurance company, so
developing strategic solutions involving the insurance industry, which
has not so far been possible, now could be. Examples are in
data sharing: competition rules have meant that it is not possible to
get access to insurance claims data to identify trends in the scale and
frequency of flooding. Having this data available through the scheme
administrator, alongside public information held by the public agencies
and the water companies, could be crucial in making investment
decisions to reduce flood risk and, of course, future claims. The FR
scheme gives us an opportunity to enable this information to
be made available for high-risk areas and
we need to make sure it happens as part of this

noble friend Lady Parminter referred to the Committee on Climate
Change—and we might hear more about that shortly—but the
estimate that there could be up to 190,000 homes that could have their
flood risks reduced through measures to protect them is a very
important factor. Flood Re could be charged with taking a more
proactive approach to encouraging and supporting those people in
high-risk areas to protect themselves better. As my noble friend Lady
Parminter has made clear, there could be systems of loans and
investments as well to assist
householders<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:33:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

insurance for those people who cannot buy it at the moment. The first
year or two will be very difficult until it has built up its reserves,
provided that there are not too many claims in those early years.
However, I am very nervous about the suggestion that Flood Re ought to
spend money on flood-resilient activities. What happens in 10
years’ time if we have another horrendous year of
rain—floods all over the place—and these households go to
Flood Re and say, “I’ve now got a claim, will you pay
it?”. What happens if Flood Re replies, “I’m so
sorry, I have paid it all out on building a dam here and there”?

costs. Also, the Environment Agency’s investigation and
collation of information from the hazard risk assessments, which it is

Crickhowell (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, one of the great advantages
of modern technology is that you can discover something you did not
know anything about while a debate is taking place. As this debate
started, I chose to look at a Defra website on obtaining flood
insurance in high-risk areas. At the top of the main page, a number of
participants are indicated: BIBA, the Environment Agency, Which?, ABI,
the National Flood Forum and Defra. Flood Re does not appear there yet.
Can the Minister say how far the department has already gone down the
road that is suggested here? This website, which contains a great deal
of other valuable information on the steps you could, and should, be
taking, already exists. Presumably, at some point Flood Re will be
fitted into the whole arrangement. My only anxiety about the Flood Re
participation is that indicated by my noble friend—namely, that
against the present background, I only hope that there is a surplus in
the early years because the fact is that we could have a situation
whereby, far from having a surplus in the early years, we have a
substantial loss. However, as there is a website and as a good deal of
advice is being given by the department—I think it is rather
good advice—perhaps my noble friend will indicate what the
department’s overall approach is and how he sees Flood
Re fitting into what is already going

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, in her opening remarks, the noble
Baroness was correct to set this matter in the broader context of where
we are now, and have been in recent years, with instances of serious
flooding in Somerset this week, possible serious flooding in Surrey by
the end of the day, that which occurred in Keswick not long ago; and
the resources that are needed to ameliorate that position in the long
term which are, essentially, the resources that the Government are
putting in. We will no doubt return to that issue at some stage in
these proceedings. However it raises the question of whose
responsibility this is. I have slight reservations about these
amendments in that regard. The public authorities and the Government
have responsibility for ensuring that adequate resources are available
for flood defence and catchment management to mitigate the impact of
flooding and insurance and reinsurance schemes can help through their
normal
operations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, insurers can insist on mitigation or flood recovery measures
along the lines mentioned by my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours as a
condition of renewal or extension of policy cover or as a deduction, if
you like, from compensation. That is a normal insurance
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000110">These
amendments seem to be saying that Flood Re would take on some public
responsibilities and social objectives and have executive
responsibility for 
<?notus-xml column=550?>delivering flood limitation measures. It is
important and right that Flood Re should co-operate with the public
authorities, landowners and everybody else in this area, so in that
sense I support Amendment 156B. However, it is also important that we
do not transfer the risk from public authorities and property owners to
an insurance system which, at the end of the day, is viable only if it
takes a cut from all policyholders, including those whose properties
are not at all at risk of
flooding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000111">This
is a difficult issue. The noble Baroness referred to public money. In
one sense public money is involved because we are legislating for the
system and the Treasury will, therefore, regard the expenditure
involved as public money, but it is not really public money—it
is the policyholders’ money. At the end of the day, you cannot
place too many responsibilities on the Flood Re operation when it is
dependent on individual households and businesses paying into it for
insurance
purposes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000112">It
may well be that a surplus is generated and that the assessment of who
pays for flood defence is looked at more broadly. Clearly, there are
limitations on public expenditure and expenditure on better flood
defence and catchment management could be met by those who are the most
direct beneficiaries of it. You could argue that insurance companies
themselves benefit from fewer claims as a result of more effective
flood defence, but that is a slightly wider argument than placing the
statutory responsibilities for which these amendments ask on to Flood
Re itself. I think that that is slightly going round the back
door<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:49:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000113">As

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lady
Parminter for her amendments regarding flood resilience and Flood
Re’s role in that matter, and to all noble Lords who have
spoken. Regarding Amendments 154A and 154B, I agree with my noble
friend Lord Shipley that we need to tackle the root cause of the
difficulties with the availability and affordability of flood
insurance—the flood risk that households face. The coverage of
the tragic events of the past couple of months, which my noble friend
Lady Parminter mentioned, have brought the full impact of this home to
us all<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:50:23"></hs_TimeCode>. I

benefiting from Flood Re need to understand both their flood risk and

we have agreed with the Association of British Insurers the principle
that insurers will be required to provide such information to customers
when a property is ceded to Flood Re and at the point of a claim. I
hope that the statutory requirement for the Flood Re scheme to manage,
over the period of the operation of the scheme, the transition to
risk-reflective pricing of flood insurance for household premises also
offers some reassurance.</hs_para>

regards
A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:53:20"></hs_TimeCode>mendment 156B,
my noble friends are right that co-operation between Flood Re and flood
risk management authorities will be important, in particular should
Flood Re wish in the future to commit any of its resources to
supporting flood risk mitigation measures. Clause 54 provides for Flood
Re to share information held by it with the Environment Agency, its
equivalents in devolved Administrations and any other bodies specified
in regulations. It also provides for Flood Re to have a duty to act in
the public interest, so where it is in the public interest for Flood Re
to co-operate with other risk management authorities, it would be
expected to do so.</hs_para>

Water Management Act 2010, flood risk management authorities have a
duty to co-operate with each other in the exercise of their flood and
coastal erosion risk management functions. This is because the causes
of flooding can cross organisational boundaries and responsibilities.
For example, flood risk management schemes to protect one area may make
the problem worse elsewhere if there is not a partnership approach to
developing solutions. Flood Re will not have an operational role in
designing or implementing flood risk management schemes. As I think the
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, suggested, that would be beyond the scope of
Flood Re and would require different skill sets. Flood Re will
therefore not have the same degree of interaction with the risk
management authorities that they will have with each other. I am not
convinced that there is a need to extend the requirements based upon
the Flood Re

noble friend Lord Cathcart that while directly managing flood risk is
not the purpose of Flood Re, it is nevertheless vital that Flood Re
does not just deliver affordable flood insurance. It should also
contain the right incentives for householders and insurers to put in
place the necessary measures to become more resilient, since otherwise
the effective price limits in Flood Re may remove some of the financial
incentive to take such action. He has suggested—the noble Earl,
Lord Lytton, also asked about this—that Flood Re will need to
build up its reserves, which is of course right, but it will have
access to the proceeds of the levy and be able itself to take out
reinsurance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:56:05"></hs_TimeCode>. Can
I offer to meet noble Lords before Report, on which occasion I shall of

flood repeatedly might be

we should accept that it is not just a flood insurance vehicle,
important and critical though that is. It will also need to provide the

Moynihan (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall start by echoing the
view that Flood Re is a welcome scheme, and I congratulate the
Minister, his colleagues and the industry on introducing it. The scheme
is to be supported 
<?notus-xml column=553?>in principle, but the devil may be in the detail.
Other amendments grouped with mine allow the Committee to consider
those who will be excluded from Flood Re, their ability to get
insurance, and the costs of such insurance. Mine is a probing amendment
but, that said, it is important in that it focuses on the significant
absence of much-needed support to SMEs in the proposed Flood Re
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:59:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

provisions, small businesses of up to 49 employees are covered under
the statement of principles. The Bill before the Committee proposes a
new scheme, Flood Re, which is substantially built on the statement of
principles. However, Flood Re provisions extend only to domestic
properties and offer no protection at all to any businesses except a
category called “micro-businesses” at risk of flooding.
This is a really important distinction between SMEs and
micro-businesses. My noble friend the Minister may be able to clear up

critical point that I wish to make is that small businesses are key to
economic growth. The importance of flood insurance has been highlighted
by recent adverse weather, and removing the protection for small
businesses from the statement of principles leaves them vulnerable to
very significant increases in insurance premiums and even facing the
possibility of being unable to afford flood insurance. This would be
disastrous for many small businesses, including the shops battered on
so many seafronts recently, village shops and businesses in the heart
of stranded local communities. The need for affordable flood insurance
in high-risk areas is essential to these small businesses. I urge the
Government to ensure that an appropriate form of flood provision for
small businesses is
available<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:00:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000127">Of
course I appreciate that businesses reflect a different risk from
residential properties and as such Flood Re may not be an appropriate
form of protection for them. However, I very strongly argue that some
provision in this area is required. Small shops are more vulnerable to
the effects of flooding compared to their larger competitors, with
fewer resources to fall back on and less power to negotiate insurance
provision. Many small shop owners have no greater knowledge or
expertise than domestic
customers<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:01:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Small
shops are at the heart of many communities. If they recover slowly from
flood events, it can have a significant knock-on effect for the wider
community. I believe that government-supported flood insurance
provisions should cover all small businesses previously covered by the
statement of principles, especially those dependent on the locality for
trade and which, by their nature, support communities. This view is
supported by the National Flood Forum and indeed the Association of
Convenience Stores, whose campaign I support. Proposals to exclude
small businesses are contrary to other government measures, including
small business provisions such as those seen in the energy
markets<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:02:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000128">As
I have stated, I accept that this scheme will cover micro-businesses

I am pleased to report that London Councils supports this amendment. In
some key areas of London, businesses are at risk of flooding as much as
households. It is important that small to medium-sized enterprises and
third-sector organisations, particularly those at surface level on our
high streets, have access to affordable insurance cover. London
Councils points out that flooding can devastate the economy of
London’s high streets, many of which contain SMEs and charity
shops. They are affected by damage not just to property but also to
stock, and they can take a long time to recover. The flood hazard and
risk maps published by the Environment Agency in December last year
show that in the Thames area more than 166,000 non-residential
properties are at risk of flooding, nearly 76,000 of which are in
London. A significant number of these non-residential properties are
small businesses. Bearing in mind all these representations, I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000130"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:04:39"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Sheikh" PimsId="5088" UID="14021176000376" xid="1933" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000376">Lord

to my noble friend the Minister both for the remarks he made during
that debate and for the correspondence I have received since then.

there is one area where I still have a slight concern, which relates to
the effect this legislation will have on small

Second Reading I said that since small businesses will be ineligible
for Flood Re, they will therefore be afforded less protection than in
the statement of principles by which they are covered. In his
correspondence to me, my noble friend the Minister said that it was the

justify intervention in relation to small businesses. However, I
believe that more should be done to protect our valued SMEs, many of
which operate under tight budgets and may be unable to obtain
affordable flood insurance. My noble friend the Minister has also said
that it was his belief that SMEs were more able to protect themselves
from flooding. Again, I point to the issue of cost here. Just as many
SMEs struggle with the cost of insurance, they also struggle to afford
to put in place measures to protect their businesses and
livelihoods.</hs_para>

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak to Amendment 160,
in the name of my noble friends Lord Whitty and Lord Grantchester. I
intend to speak on a number of amendments so I must declare an
interest. I have a leasehold interest, with my wife, in a band G home
on the Thames built on the flood plain. My flat is not threatened by
flooding. My home has therefore never been evacuated and I have never
made an insurance claim on a property I own. Nevertheless, I feel that
I have an interest to declare while speaking on an issue that affects
tens of thousands of home owners who similarly live in the vicinity of
the Thames, many of whom are now being
evacuated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000135">I
start by congratulating the Government on introducing this scheme,
which I understand was the subject of some very difficult negotiations
with the insurance industry. I want to refer to a particular group of
home owners, of which I am not one, who come under council tax band H.
Council tax band H is pretty expensive property, as we know, and the
flooding over the past few days has probably affected thousands of
these properties up and down the River Thames between Chertsey and just
south of Maidenhead, near Windsor. These home owners will be very
worried about what is going to happen. They are excluded from this
scheme. Not only do they have the problem of how to resolve their
immediate difficulty of dealing with the flooding and the consequences
for their homes, but they will also be worried about the longer term
financial implications, in the event that their premiums are
substantially increased—which they will be. I know that from my
own experience in the Lake District, which I mentioned during my
previous intervention. For most of my life, I lived there in the town
of Keswick, which was subject to flooding. Many people there found it
impossible to get insurance from insurance companies following the
floods that took place some years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:14:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000136">There
is going to be a real problem for these people. Many in the Thames
Valley are not included in this scheme because their properties fall
into band H. It is not that the Government need to interfere with this
scheme. I understand its merits and it has been very sensitively
negotiated. We very much support it. However, heads have got to be
banged together to find a way of resolving the problem of many of these
people who live in band

doing defending people living in band H properties from the Labour
Benches. The reason is simple: many people who live in band H
properties did not buy them as band H properties. They bought them when
they were much cheaper, and when their incomes may well have been quite
modest. Property price inflation in London and in the south of England
has placed many people in this position. Even the way that the mansion
tax is being construed may affect people who have quite small incomes.
I am in favour of the mansion tax, but maybe the way that it is to be
calibrated raises the same questions. People on low incomes who find
themselves living in expensive properties—I am not one of them,
as I said—have to be considered in these matters. I hope
that the Government, even as late as this in the Bill, might on Third
Reading at least make some statement as to what provision might be made
for them, notwithstanding what the Bill provides on Flood
Re.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/E27E71D7CFEA82D1D6240E7F27C2E8BC3D572FF4" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2014">Tuesday,

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> My Lords, it is probably appropriate that
I follow the noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. I have to admit that I
live in a band H property, but it is not in London and I am glad to say
that it is built on a hill. My Amendments 160ZA and 161D are in this

tabled Amendment 160ZA to see whether I could flush out the rationale
behind the exclusion of certain categories of property from FR, but
also because there seemed to be a reluctance to consider both sides of
the coin in terms of what is in and what is out of the safety net. What
is in identifies and underlines what is out. It cannot be otherwise.
The fact of exclusion does not mean that other insurers will not
provide some cover, but it does, as the noble Lord, Lord
Campbell-Savours, said, have consequences. I have certainly received
correspondence suggesting some very significant rises in free market
premiums based not so much on the immediate severe risk but on that
broader category of material risk that will be flagged up and will lie
between those that have no risk whatsoever and those that are protected
by the FR safety net. It is in the public interest that any scheme
report under Amendment 160 should look beyond the narrow scope of FR
inclusions and also look at wider
exclusions.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14021176000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000272"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode></I>4.15

Amendment 161D, I wanted to raise an allied issue. Part of the problem
is that many of the terms in Clause 69 are undefined, “household
premises” being one of them. My amendment would simply insert a
definition of “household
premises<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>”.
Paragraph 14 of the 20th report of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory
Reform Committee points to the huge amount of detail that is going to
be—to put it bluntly—kicked down the road to be dealt
with in regulation, probably towards the end of this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:15:21"></hs_TimeCode>. This
creates great uncertainty both for this House, in terms of working out
what we are legislating for, and for those homes and businesses which
may in due course be affected. Uncertainty, as I know as a professional
valuer, is corrosive, and particularly so in the present state of
flooding and dislocation of households, businesses, services and
infrastructure, of which we have heard a great deal. As a factor in
risk 
<?notus-xml column=557?>assessment, it is essential to contain it as far as possible. I think
that the Government could probably do better on that count because FR
is hypothecated on a very narrow
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000141">I have

assume that they are excluded because there are no government plans to
reduce the risk and therefore flood reinsurance cannot underwrite
them—that is an assumption that I make. So the many people who
thought that FR would ensure future cover for their properties will be
disappointed.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14021176000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000142">I
understand that the sustainability of insurance cross-subsidy is an
issue, and I do not suggest that this should be perpetuated for any
longer than is absolutely necessary—nobody should expect
government or society at large to prop up an outdated risk model or
practices involving cross-subsidy in the knowledge of much more
detailed individual risk. However, this is about a managed transition
and it is to the credit of the Government and the ABI that a
precipitous withdrawal of flood cover did not occur last summer.
However, with the present weather, the exclusions from FR and a lack of
clarity over many of the implications of Clause 69 definitions, along
with better knowledge— which is always a dangerous
thing—we have significant transitional uncertainties. Valuer
members of my profession, like me, deal with this sort of thing

to what the Defra impact assessment might lead one to suppose, there is
no simple gradation of supply and demand via the price system when
dealing with risk in property valuation. In the lending world, it is
more a case of a simple on/off switch. There are many reasons, but the
voluntary banking regulation under Basel III may have something to do
with it along with recent memories of toxic loans. I have conferred
within my own profession and with the British Property Federation and
the Council of Mortgage Lenders. It appears to me that the
interdependence of insurance and mortgages is highly significant.
Absence of cover for a standard peril, including flood, most probably
means no mortgage
either.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000144">There
is also, of course, the lenders’ ability to look at risk on
their own terms, regardless of whether there is an insurance
underpinning. It is my belief that, in future, lenders will not be any
more indulgent than insurers when it comes to risk, and probably a good
deal less so, given the typical mortgage life compared to an annually
renewable insurance policy. This becomes akin to what I understand is
known as a “red-lining principle”, a term coined in the
USA, which the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill of Bengarve, who is
not, I think, 
<?notus-xml column=558?>in the Chamber, pointed out to me a few days ago. Put simply, everything

noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, who is also, I fear, not here
today, reminded me last week of the effects of lender reticence on
high-rise and ex-council flats. Value write-offs in these cases might
easily be in the order of 10% to 15% without any other environmental
risk. Once property of any kind is in a limited market of cash buyers
only and with a material flood risk attached, as we are talking about
in this instance, write-downs might easily exceed
30%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000146">The
Council of Mortgage Lenders calculates that 5 million
residential properties will fall outside the FR scheme, to which might
be added—I am guessing—a million small business premises.
If a third of those suffer an average write-down of £100,000 due
to being in a mortgage ghetto, the outcomes are substantial. Mr Philip
Wilbourn, FRICS, an expert in valuation and environmental risk,
considers that direct and indirect write-offs could be trillions of
pounds. That is a very serious implication. Even if he is only half
right, the Government need to take note. It is enough to affect loan

do not blame FR, but I do suggest that a more holistic approach is
needed if market turbulence is to be minimised. Leaving
significant sectors high and dry—excuse the pun—has
accentuated what is ultimately a latent problem. Nor do I suggest that
FR could ever be expanded to cater for this, so we need to look
elsewhere. I have written to the Minister suggesting ways in which
potential harm might be mitigated. I suggest that he engages in urgent
discussions with professionals and lenders as to how some of the very
useful measures in the Bill can be fast-tracked to empower and resource
local communities, such as those on the Somerset Levels, and foster
more initiatives such as Sheffield’s Lower Don Valley business
improvement district scheme. I also think that it is time for a change
in the lending and insurance markets. The Government have a role in
constructively addressing risk and preventing precipitate and
unconstrained damage affecting
everyone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000148">I
raise this issue because it seems to me that, although it sits outside
FR, it is a matter of very great public interest and very great

I do not think it is anywhere near a lost cause, but for the
same reasons I gave earlier this afternoon that we need investment to
go into resilience and flood protection measures, we do not need the
plug pulled on the capital value element of properties at
the same time. I hope that the Minister, who I am certain will
not be able to give me any very detailed response, if any at all, will
take this away and that perhaps some aspects of the Bill can be

introduction of Flood Re and accepting that it is essentially a scheme

businesses, especially in very rural areas. I refer specifically to
those which are mixed hereditaments. The key question appears to be:
what happens to mixed hereditaments in terms of qualifying for

two scenarios for mixed hereditaments. The first is where the business
element is deemed by the valuation to be de minimis. This means it
forms such a small part of the overall hereditament that it appears
only in a domestic list for council tax. The second is where the
business element is more significant, and is therefore liable to both
council tax and business rates. If the property does not appear in the
waiting list for business rates as well as for council tax, the liable
party may qualify for business rate relief. This could be small
business rate relief, where it is their only business

understand that, currently, if the rateable value is less than
£6,000 the relief received would be 100%. Rateable values
between £6,000 and £12,000 receive relief on a sliding

extended until 31 March 2015, and not beyond that at the moment. The
standard scheme allows a relief of 50%. In a rural settlement it might
be the case that a village shop or post office is part of a mixed
hereditament. In this case it would qualify for rural rate relief.

Cathcart (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I congratulate my noble friends
Lord Moynihan and Lady Parminter on tabling Amendment 155, as it has
given us a good chance to debate flood insurance for businesses,
whether in Flood Re or in another mutual set up specifically. We are
all under pressure to include small businesses under the Flood Re
scheme. That is quite understandable. If I had a business in a flood
risk area, I would want to insure it under the Flood Re scheme. I know
that the Association of British Insurers and the Government looked at
whether businesses could be included within the Flood Re scheme, but
found that it threw up more problems than it solved. This is best
illustrated with an
example.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000165">I am
a free range egg producer on my farm in Norfolk, and when it came to

terrorism and malicious attack; livestock, including theft, worrying,
death after straying, accidental or malicious death; deterioration of
stock, in my case probably due to bad feed or electrical failure;
perils and fatal injury; livestock in transit; disease, in my case

list goes on, but I hope that gives your Lordships a flavour of the
range of commercial insurance on offer. I, of course, had to cherry
pick the cover that was most relevant to me. For instance, I did not
buy livestock or goods in transit cover, because this is the
responsibility of third parties with whom I have a contract. Also, I
have no vehicles in that business, so motor insurance was not an issue.
However, salmonella is an issue for my business, but because the
insurance is so costly I chose not buy it. I hope that I got that one
right. I have to choose not only the type of cover that I think is
appropriate to my business but how much cover to buy for each category,
the cost and the level of excess necessary to reduce that cost. The
excess across my shopping list varies from £100 to
£20,000.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000167">Although
there are hundreds of egg producers up and down the country with
identical businesses to mine, I very much doubt that there is another
that has commercial insurance exactly the same as mine. They will all
be different, and that is the problem: all businesses, whether a corner
shop, a pub, a guest house, a property investment company, a hotel or
guest house, a manufacturing company or an engineering firm, will buy
commercial insurance to suit their particular circumstances. The whole
point of a mutual, whether Flood Re or one geared specifically to small
businesses, is that the conditions are common to all. The price, the 
<?notus-xml column=562?>excess, the cover and the conditions must be
standardised. This can be done for homeowner insurance—it is
pretty bog-standard—but sadly, as I have tried to illustrate,
not for commercial insurance. You just cannot standardise it. If it
were standardised, virtually all commercial members of that mutual
would end up with a policy that did not give them the cover that they
wanted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000168">It

was deemed to have commercial insurance with it and was therefore
excluded from the mutual, I would ask my broker to split my insurance
cover into two separate policies: one for the bog-standard homeowner
cover, buildings and contents, to ensure inclusion within the Flood Re
scheme, and the other to include all elements that made my cover
commercial, such as owner’s liability or public liability cover.

all have some sympathy with those groups that are excluded. However, we
must be careful, as this is a delicate arithmetic deal between the
Government and the ABI. I understand that negotiations were hard and
long. As far as businesses are concerned, it is obvious that this must
be addressed somehow. We have all seen the effects of flooding in
recent weeks and the past few years, on small businesses and farms, on
the Cockermouth high street a year ago and on the seafronts at Dawlish
and Aberystwyth in recent weeks. We also know that the businesses that
are hit—the shops, boarding houses and small
businesses—are key to the prosperity of those local economies.
It must be frustrating for small businesses, and those advocating their
case, like the federation, because they were covered in some way 
<?notus-xml column=563?>under the statement of principles under the old scheme. However, the old
scheme was a different sort of scheme. It was a deal struck by the ABI,
agreeing that it would continue to cover—even then, it was not
offering new cover—small businesses as well as households if the
Government committed themselves to a certain level of expenditure on
flood defence.</hs_para>

sort of deal; it is actuarially based. While we have all received
representations on behalf of businesses, the approach now has a
different basis. Even so, it is complicated. Some micro-businesses
operated out of the owner’s house could be covered because they
pay council tax rather than business tax. However, others will not.
There are good reasons for this. The noble Earl, Lord Cathcart,
described the bespoke way in which businesses negotiate their insurance
as distinct from the more generalised way in which households are
covered. It is difficult to see how businesses could be included in
Flood Re as it stands without serious reconfiguration of the whole
arithmetic. Therefore, while I have sympathy, I would not go so far as
to press the Government on this front. However, I am in favour of
knowing more about this. Therefore I support the proposition of the
noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, that we look at this and report on it and
see whether that might lead us to some other form of provision in
parallel with Flood
Re.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000174">Some of
the other boundary issues are even more complicated, particularly in
relation to leasehold properties and the issue of whether landlords and
tenants are included. The noble Earl, Lord Lytton, has dealt with one
element of this and others are dealt with later on. Some of the
government literature refers to leasehold properties. However, in
general, the ABI and the Government do not think that leasehold
properties are included. The situation with single landlords and
tenants is not clear, although commercial providers of leasehold
property are not included. The differentiation here is more the nature
of the insurance than the nature of the property. While the property
may be defined as being in risk or not, in a landlord/tenant situation,
the tenant probably takes out the contents insurance, which is covered,
whereas building insurance, which is the landlord’s
responsibility, is not covered. That is quite a complex position, and
it would also be true for multiple leasehold property. A future
mortgage on such property is dependent to some extent, as the noble
Earl, Lord Lytton, said, on there being ongoing insurance on the
property. Leaseholders and the owners of the property may be faced with
a double whammy if they are not careful.</hs_para>

cross-subsidy for ever, but nobody knew that before. Now that it is
explicit, the Government have to be careful if they are going to accept
some further risk which increases the costs, which people who are not

you should be included at the beginning; it is not about whether band H
should be included or not. It is about subsequent developments which
might exclude people who initially appeared to be included in Flood Re,
but were for one reason or another excluded. That can happen for a
number of reasons, because either the flood risk or the actual
incidence of flood has increased and therefore premium arithmetic
changes; or it could be the situation I described in the previous
amendment: the insurance company insists on mitigation provision as a
condition of renewal of the policy but the policyholder feels that they
are unable to meet that cost and are thereby excluded. That may or may
not be justifiable in any particular case, but a system which is being
legislated upon by Parliament has to have some element of natural
justice built into it. Therefore, some form of appeal is needed

Amendment 155 of my noble friend Lord Moynihan, which would require the

decisions about the scope of Flood Re have been evidence-based.
Compared to the household sector, there is not the same evidence of
market failure in the commercial sector, where the insurance market is
different. Bespoke policies are more routine—as my noble friend
Lord Cathcart so eloquently explained—and they are already
priced to risk. I listened with interest to what he, my noble friend

unlike households, have a de facto income stream to cover their costs
and can offset the cost of their insurance for tax purposes, so they
are different. Flood Re, I emphasise, is concerned with helping to
protect those relatively few low-income households from high insurance
premia. My noble friend Lady Parminter was, perhaps, sceptical of the
suggestion of a lack of evidence. A government survey of more than
9,000 businesses in England estimated that fewer than 1% of businesses
had experienced difficulty obtaining property insurance in the last
year due to the risk of flooding, and that no businesses had been
refused insurance cover due to the risk of

Amendment 160ZA on reporting on leasehold and private rented sector
policies, I see that we will also discuss the proposals in this regard
on Flood Re later on today. However, before I come on to the
specific subject of reporting, I remind noble Lords that the key issue
in determining the scope of Flood  Re is 
<?notus-xml column=567?>whether the policy for a particular property is
treated as commercial or residential by the industry. Commercial
policies are out of scope of Flood Re, which is designed to support
households. We believe this approach is fair and practical, and it was
supported in the public consultation. However, we recognise that the
leasehold sector presents a more complex situation, where the contents
policy is classified as domestic but the buildings policy could be
classified as either commercial or domestic and could cover multiple
dwellings.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021176000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000191">I
have listened to representatives of the property sector who have come
forward with concerns about the impact of the proposed approach on the
leasehold sector. They highlighted in particular that those in a
smaller building might find it difficult to afford cover in the open
market. The ABI has assured me that there is no evidence of a systemic
problem with freeholders being able to obtain insurance for their
leasehold properties, which I am sure noble Lords will agree is very
welcome. However, given the strength of feeling on the matter,
particularly in light of the ongoing extreme weather conditions, we
need to take time to consider it in more detail, although without
evidence of market failure it will be difficult to justify action. We
will examine the evidence further with the ABI and hope to provide an
update on Report. We will also continue to monitor this sector over
time, as a part of the commercial insurance market.</hs_para>

the subject of the private rented sector. I take this opportunity to
explain that it is proposed that buildings insurance cover for
landlords would be out of scope for Flood Re, although contents cover
for tenants would be eligible. At this stage I reiterate my declaration
of an interest as owner of a property that flooded in 2007. The reason
that landlords’ policies are out of scope is primarily because
insurers classify all types of landlord insurance as commercial
business, while Flood Re is designed for the domestic market. However,
it is also important to recognise that the inclusion of landlords would
effectively mean that people who do not own their own home could,
through their contents premium, subsidise people who own
several.</hs_para>

to the subject of reporting on the availability of affordable insurance
for this sector, I should like to point out that the insurance industry
is clear that the majority of landlords would be able to find a more
competitive rate outside Flood Re. However, as is the case for the rest
of the small business sector, the Government and the industry will
continue to monitor the situation. I hope that this provides

I turn to Amendments 161B and 161C in the name of my noble friend Lady
Bakewell and Amendment 161D in the name of the noble Earl, Lord Lytton,
to Clause 69, the purpose of which would be to define all mixed-use
properties as household premises for the purposes of the register under
the flood insurance obligation, the Government’s fallback
policy. This could include a very large range of premises, including
many that are beyond the scope of the policy intention. The broad
intention is that eligibility for inclusion on the register for the
purposes of the flood insurance obligation would be based on publicly
available data about the level of flood
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000196">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:04:21"></hs_TimeCode>
remind noble Lords that the criteria for inclusion on the register for
the purposes of the obligation are different from the eligibility
criteria for Flood Re, and therefore some of the exclusions and
inclusions may be different. Where Flood Re considers eligible
policies, the obligation would be based on eligible properties. The
intention is to use the same definitions where possible, but these also
need to be consistent with the criteria used for defining domestic
properties by the administrators of the register, the Environment
Agency and its counterparts in the devolved Administrations.
Before<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>
regulating under the Bill, we would need to consult fully on the
definitions and any possible exclusions, not least to ensure that they
are clear and can be consistently applied across the UK.</hs_para>

Delegated Powers Committee has recommended that these definitions be
subject to the affirmative procedure and we are carefully considering
this recommendation. I hope this reassures noble Lords that, should the
flood insurance obligation ever need to be used, the definitions would
be subject to appropriate scrutiny, and that their amendments are not
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000198">Understandably,
there has been much interest in those who may not benefit
from Flood Re or the obligation. However, we must not lose sight of the
hundreds of thousands of householders who will benefit. The Government
are satisfied that, overall, the proposed approach is fair and targeted
towards those most in need of support. However, it is always important
that the effect of any policy is reviewed as time goes on. That is why
we have committed to monitoring the market over time, and to publishing
these findings. Should the evidence point to a specific issue for
domestic household insurance, we will discuss with the industry what
might be
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000199">Turning<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>
to Amendment 161, I recognise noble Lords’ concern that Flood Re
should help households at high flood risk. To ensure value for money,
should households with policies in Flood Re flood repeatedly and not
take action, their continuing eligibility to benefit from the public
subsidy provided by Flood Re may need to be considered. Constructive
discussions continue with the industry on how those who may over time
make themselves ineligible for further public subsidy should be
treated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000200">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>
is important that there should be a challenge mechanism if an
individual exclusion from Flood Re were unjustified. I can confirm that
the Government will not designate the scheme until we are satisfied
with the industry’s proposals. These could include the need to
have in place a proportionate challenge mechanism 
<?notus-xml column=569?>for any households that are deemed to have become ineligible. The
regulations setting up and designating Flood Re will be subject to
public consultation and we are currently considering the
Delegated Powers Committee’s recommendation that regulations
made under this clause should be subject to the affirmative procedure.
However, Flood Re is not a compulsory scheme and insurers may choose
whether or not to cede the flood risk element of policies to it.
Householders should, therefore, continue to shop around to get the best
deal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000201">Moreover,
it is important to recognise that the relationship between the insurer
and the householder will not be affected by the introduction of Flood
Re. Under the current regulatory regime for financial services there
exists a conduct of business regulator, the Financial Conduct
Authority, and a separate complaints-handling service, the Financial
Ombudsman Service. The Financial Conduct Authority sets the rules
regarding the treatment of customers, the behaviour of firms and the
functioning of the market. The Financial Ombudsman Service is an
independent entity that makes a judgment against these rules should an
individual consumer have a dispute which they cannot resolve through
contacting their insurer. I will be meeting noble Lords before Report

noble Earl, Lord Lytton, asked about definitions. We recognise the
desire to give greater certainty about what is meant by the terms in

take action to lessen the impacts over this period, it is likely that
they could face higher premiums when the scheme comes to an end.
Adjustments in asset prices and mortgage decisions

just that some householders did not buy their properties as band H
properties; it is that there is no absolute correlation between
personal wealth and band H occupancy, a point that I sought to
demonstrate at Second Reading. If you accept that principle, surely it
is wrong that band H should be automatically excluded. Indeed, the
Minister, in his reply, mentioned the 45 properties that were in need

Northumberland, parts of Newcastle and several parts of the north, and
1,000 people had to be moved out of their homes in Morpeth, it was a
major learning exercise for the statutory authorities; that is, the
Environment Agency, Northumbrian Water, the local councils and the

in Somerset it has become unclear whether that duty has worked
effectively, given the Environment Agency’s statement that it
offered to dredge on the Somerset Levels if other partners joined it. I

concerned to discover that the Environment Agency comments only on

2012-13—here I am quoting from DCLG statistics—local
planning authorities received 455,500 planning applications and the
Environment Agency provided responses to 30,251 of them; that is, 6.6%
of the total. Obviously, most planning applications are small ones in
which the Environment Agency need not have a role. However, we need to
be clear whether the Environment Agency should have a formal, statutory
consultation role in more planning applications than is currently the
case. The current position is that the bulk of applications, including
those for high surface water flood risk areas, are being dealt with
entirely by planning committees and their officers, who follow national
guidance. One assumes that they follow that guidance, but it also means
that the cumulative impact of many small developments is not commented
on and may not be taken into

If the right preventive measures are put in place, which can include

being built on flood plains. However, an important statement of the
obvious is this: SUDS do not work on flood plains when there is
substantial flooding. I guess we all know this, but I am concerned that
there is a cumulative impact on planning permission for small
developments; or, rather, I would like to be convinced that that is not

proposed a reservoir in Oxfordshire. Its plan set out how the company
could meet demand up to the year 2015 for water supply in the
south-east of England. Its proposal was for a reservoir on land
south-west of Abingdon in the Vale of White Horse. In 2008, some 18
years later, Thames Water held a consultation on its draft water
resource management plan for meeting water demand up to 2032. The draft
plan again included a proposal for the Abingdon reservoir. If it
appears that I am speaking slightly obliquely to the amendment, I am

I have to say and the amendment on the Marshalled List.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:22:12"></hs_TimeCode> 2009,
following a process of consultation, the management plan from Thames
Water was amended and the reservoir reduced in size, and in 2010 there
was a public inquiry. In March 2011, the Secretary of State, Caroline
Spelman, announced her decision to remove the proposal for a reservoir
at Abingdon from the management plan. The reasons were, primarily, that
Thames Water could not prove a risk to current water supplies and,
secondly, that insufficient consideration had been given to transfer
and reuse
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000223">It
was argued that water available in other parts of the United Kingdom
could be transferred to the south-west of England, although when I was
doing a little research on this last week I could not understand how it
was impossible to prove that there was not a risk to the water supply
in the south-west of England when over a number of years, certainly in
the early 2000s, we were being told that reservoirs were empty almost
throughout the United Kingdom. There were blocks on the use of water
for gardening, and I understand that in some areas there was even talk
of introducing standpipes for the water supply. Nevertheless, that was
the decision taken at that time by the Secretary of State. I suspect

is all this relevant? To answer that question, we have to move north to
Cumbria, to Thirlmere. Thirlmere supplies water to Manchester.
Thirlmere is a reservoir above the town of Keswick—where I have
lived most of my life—which feeds water from the dam down the
Greta river through Keswick, down through Bassenthwaite Lake, down the
Derwent and on to Workington, which 
<?notus-xml column=574?>was the subject of substantial flooding some years
ago. After that flood event some years ago, I was asked to set up a
group in Keswick to hold discussions with the Environment Agency and
United Utilities on what action could be taken to reduce the incidence
of flooding in Keswick. Our group’s case was simple: Thirlmere
could be used for flood alleviation purposes as well as for water
storage. If we retained within Thirlmere sufficient unused water
storage capacity, in times of predicted heavy rainfall we could use the
reservoir to control the flow of water into the Greta through Keswick
and substantially reduce the incidence of flooding in the Keswick
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000225">In the
beginning, United Utilities resisted because it meant the release of
its valuable asset—water. However, over time it adopted a more
reasonable approach and agreed to reduce the level of the reservoir in
the months of high rainfall, primarily in the autumn, winter and early
spring. We set target water levels for each month in the meters below
the spillover at the head of the reservoir and the dam head. When the
reservoir is too full, water is released. Many people in the town
believe it has served the town well and avoided substantial flooding
over recent years, despite the fact that on occasions they have had
trouble releasing sufficient water due to mechanical release valve
difficulties.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000226" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000226">Let
us return to Abingdon and what has happened over the past week in the
Thames Valley. I refer again to the interest I declared earlier. Why
can we not have a similar arrangement for Abingdon? Why can we not
bring back the proposal for a reservoir on the Abingdon site with a
dual purpose? The first would be water storage to meet increased demand
in the south, and with the proposed development of new towns in the
south that is part of the Government’s housing strategy, there
will be increased demand—indeed, at the moment demand in drought
periods is not being sufficiently met. Secondly, the reservoir could be
used for flood alleviation purposes, with target storage levels
providing for controlled releases into the River
Thames.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021176000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0001.htm#14021176000227">Let us
go back to the Thames Valley. The communities that have suffered over

necessary to protect the towns and villages—Wraysbury, Datchet,
Chertsey, Staines, Sunbury and all those towns; it is impossible. We
have to find a solution further up the system. I have raised this in
relation to this amendment because I believe that the solution is to
create large areas that can be pooled and used for flood alleviation in

strengthen the hand of those who wish to use reservoirs in this way. As

the Government—placed on water companies to use their assets in
the way that I suggest. I hope that what I am suggesting today is
followed up in the communities that have been affected over the past
week by this vast, insuperable problem of flooding, because they need
to look long-term as to what the solution is, and the solution is not
in flood defences. The solution is upstream. I hope that they follow up
my suggestions. In Abingdon there will no doubt be

affordable flood insurance, but the planning system has a vital role in
making our country more resilient for the future. On the potential
effects of cuts in local authority budgets on their ability to
undertake their important planning functions, which my noble friend

given that in the intervening 24 months there will be further
significant cuts to the Environment Agency’s budget, with an

the scenes we have seen in recent days, it would be only too easy for
people, rightly, to make the case that we must protect front-line staff

consultations on significant planning applications for developments of
more than 10 houses or one hectare. Equally, it is important that the

Lord, Lord Shipley. I have already declared an interest as the chairman
of the adaptation sub-committee of the Committee on Climate Change. The
sub-committee has a useful data set that could be brought to bear were
this review to happen. It has developed a set of indicators, which are
published, for the resilience of planning decisions in relation to
present and future risks from flooding, particularly from future
impacts of climate change. For example, it has looked at the
implementation of SUDS, at the implementation of household measures
that could provide protection at the individual property level and at
planning decisions to develop in the flood plain. As has already been
said by the noble Lord, development in the flood plain has been going
ahead faster than development elsewhere, but this is not necessarily a
bad thing. If the properties are appropriately protected, either by
community-level measures or by individual household measures, the risks
can be managed. The sub-committee has a data set and a set of

debate this important point. I declare a professional interest in
aspects of planning. The question of planning policy and its co-runner,
which it informs, 
<?notus-xml column=576?>development control, raises some important issues on the ground. These
need to go beyond the question of new-build developments alone. I do
not know whether the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, intended to address just
new-build developments but if he did, perhaps I could digress into the
area of what we do about some of the existing building stock, which I
flagged up at Second Reading. I alluded then to the desirability of
making conditions concerning the containing of surface water run-off
within existing individual properties, as opposed to just allowing each
to discharge it on to the next property downstream.</hs_para>

might be made retroactive to a degree, perhaps by requiring extensions
and alterations to existing properties to incorporate, in appropriate
circumstances, a surface water attenuation scheme. I do not believe
that this is a general requirement but there are precedents. For
instance, if you renew the roof covering of your house, you are often
obliged to upgrade the insulation of the roof of your property. There
is an analogy there. Surface water attenuation on a per property basis
could also be combined not only with water conservation, but with
habitat-friendly outcomes. The same thing could apply to the principle
of reducing vulnerability of the property itself—a point made
earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter—in connection with
quite ordinary adaptations that can be put in place to prevent
properties being so severely affected by flooding, should it happen.
There is also the question of community-based schemes to protect groups

hazards to all the other problems of clean-up. That requires special
measures, not least because shared sewer pipes that are on private

secure against flooding is one thing. Transferring risks to properties
elsewhere is self-defeating. My difficulty is that I am not sure that a
holistic approach is taken to dealing with the totality of flood
plains. Often, these may be in more than one local planning authority
area, so there may be problems of co-ordination. With regard to that,
the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, referred to the competence and capacity
of local government and the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, referred to
reductions in Environment Agency budgets that might affect its ability
to have this overarching, integrated view. I worry about that. It is
vital that the sort of report that the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, has in
mind covers all these aspects. If we start leaving bits out, we shall
be no further forward in a few years’ time than we are
now<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:38:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

draw attention to the catchment area management plan referred to by the
noble Lord, Lord Campbell-Savours. I have some experience of this, not
all of it edifying. In at least one instance, I found that half the
catchment area concerned, the upstream half, was missing from the plan.
The only fact that I could ascertain was that the owner of the missing
part was the National Trust. I am unsure what conclusions I should draw
from that, but if you have a catchment management plan, the boundary of
it has to be drawn along the watershed. No other boundary is possible.
The simple arithmetic that was drummed into me, probably from O-level
geography onwards, has not escaped me. Making up rules to suit as one
goes along will not wash. I am sorry for that terminology as

time ago, I attended a professional lecture on restoring part of
southern Exmoor to a peat bog so that it would hold more water and
release it more slowly into the River Barle and the River Exe systems.
It had something to do with pumping and repumping water back into
Wimbleball reservoir, which I shall not go into. I nicknamed the scheme
the “Exmoor sponge”. I do not think anyone else has used
that term. There is nothing wrong with such projects, but if they do
not have durable management structures that are proof against misuse
for commercial objectives, neglect because of spending cuts, simply
being forgotten, or participant landowners deciding that there are
better land uses that they would rather adopt, they will fail. There
need to be more durable ways of dealing with these things. That is the
sum total of the points that I wish to make. The last of them probably

intention behind this amendment. The importance of managing the impact
of flooding has been brought into very sharp focus recently, and my
noble friend has made a cogent case for ensuring that all those
involved, whether builders, local councils, inspectors or national
organisations, are fulfilling what is required of them in terms of

noble friends Lord Shipley and Lady Parminter made the case for a
review of planning policy delivery. Planning policy for flooding is set
out in the <I>National Planning Policy Framework</I>. The framework was
published by the Department for Communities and Local Government in
March 2012 following extensive public consultation and is supported by
practice guidance. It sets strict tests to protect people and property
from flooding, which all local councils must follow. We have been very
clear that where these tests are not met, new development should not be
allowed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000017">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:43:14"></hs_TimeCode>
framework states that councils should plan the location of new
development to avoid areas of flood risk where possible. Only if no
sites are available in areas of lower risk of flooding can local
councils even begin to consider whether to allow development in areas
where there is a higher risk. For logical reasons, this is known in
planning terminology as the sequential test. Where the sequential test
has shown that it is not possible, consistent with wider sustainability
objectives, to locate in an area with a lower risk of flooding,
then—depending on the flood risk—a second stringent test
must be met before a development can go ahead. This is called the
exception test, which provides a very strong safeguard. To pass the
exception test, you must show that the development provides wider
benefits to the community that outweigh the flood risk and that it will
be safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk
elsewhere—which was another point that noble Lords flagged up.
Where possible, the development will reduce flood risk overall, such as
through new flood defences. If there is a risk of flooding, a planning
application has to be supported by a site-specific flood risk
assessment. This is important because, where there is a risk of
flooding, councils should give the go-ahead to new development only
where, following the sequential and, if required, the exception tests,
it can be demonstrated that what is to be built is flood resilient and
resistant, and, as necessary, includes safe access and escape routes.
Quite simply, in terms of flood risk, if there are better sites for
developments, or developments demonstrated to be necessary are not made
safe, they should not be

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendment 158. As
we have discussed, actuarial calculations for the establishment of
Flood Re have had to be pretty robust and tight, reflecting the level
of risk assessed by the insurers and by the Government at this time,
but we also all know that flood risk will change over time. We cannot,
therefore, establish Flood Re on a totally static basis; it needs to be
a dynamic process. The reality is that the numbers at high risk of
flood damage are likely to increase, particularly, but not solely,
because of the effects of climate change. The Committee on Climate
Change and its Adaptation Sub-Committee are the key adviser to the
Government on the numbers likely to be at risk of
flood.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000035">Over
the next few years, Flood Re is supposed to operate in an area in which
the Committee on Climate Change has already indicated there will be a
significant increase in the numbers at significant risk of flood. The
definition of “significant” in this context is one in 75
years. At the moment, that relates to about 370,000 properties. The
information that Defra put into the basis of the impact assessment
derived from the Committee on Climate Change statistics. I am not sure
whether it is the database to which the noble 
<?notus-xml column=582?>Lord, Lord Krebs, referred or some other, but given
that we are working on a 25-year timescale it said that this figure
will have increased by the 2020s to between 475,000 and 825,000 and by
the 2030s to between 525,000 and 1 million. That is a pretty big
increase. By the end of the 2030s, the end of the 25-year period, it is

is a gap between the required expenditure and what is likely to be
needed of about £500 million over the period of 20
years. That means that we have a significant problem in defining what
is at risk in 10 or 20 years and therefore where Flood Re has to get to
in terms of its financial arithmetic and the number of properties that
it is going to cover. The Committee on Climate Change can advise on the
likely change in crude numbers—indeed, it already has. It can
apply probabilities to that, it can indicate what degree of mitigation,
at what likely cost, is likely to offset this and it can look at the
change in the nature of the risk and the areas to which it applies. It
is important that both the Government and the administrator of Flood Re
get strong, independent assessments of this changing and growing
risk.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021193000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000037">Indeed,

“Actually, the Minister might or might not take notice of what
the Climate Change Committee says, but, in any case, it is not the role
of the Climate Change Committee and the Adaptation Sub-Committee to
talk about financial risk assessment”. That is not what we are
saying, though. To feed in to the risk assessment, you need the most
authoritative input that you can get, in order that the financial
structure can be changed to reflect those increased risks, changed

authoritative input. At the end of the day Flood Re is—despite
its statutory base and its reporting to Parliament—a private

in the second, have already been thoroughly explored by the noble
Baroness, Lady Parminter, in her

156C and 156D are really about information for householders. I find it
hard to see why one would object to giving householders information
that will help them now and in the future. The first part of Amendment
156C simply asks that Flood Re should build awareness among
householders of their own flood risk. Earlier this afternoon we heard
the noble Lord, Lord Crickhowell, alluding to a Defra website where
information could be garnered, but the fact remains, from surveys of
householders, that many of them are unaware that they are living in a
flood risk area, and Flood Re has been designed to be invisible to the
households concerned. As currently cast it will not give them any
source of information. It is important that we incorporate in the Bill
the requirement for the Flood Re administrator to give households
information about their
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000058">The
other part of this, in the addition of proposed new paragraph (f) at
the end of line 25, is to again alert householders who might be
affected to the fact that Flood Re is not a permanent arrangement, and
that there will be a transition. The transition is over a long
period—over 25 years, as we are now familiar with—but it
is important that householders over that 25-year period take action if
they are at risk, to reduce their risk. Therefore it is important for
households to have transparent information about the nature of the
transition to risk-reflective prices that will arise at the end of
Flood Re. It is hard to object to giving consumers
information.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000059">I
now move to Amendment 156D, the second of my amendments. Again, I can
be brief about this. It requires Flood Re to be explicit about the plan
for transition, and to publish a transition plan so that the
householder concerned will know what to expect—otherwise there
will not be clarity for households. Difficult decisions to gradually
withdraw the benefits of the scheme may continually be postponed,
because it is always difficult to tell householders that they are going
to lose a certain benefit that would arise through the coverage of
Flood Re. In order to avoid confusion it is important that the Bill
sets out a requirement to give a plan for the future, and therefore
prevent Flood Re becoming a permanent and growing burden on the costs
of insurance paid by other policyholders. So the transition must take
place at the end of the 25-year period, and my Amendment 156D seeks to
ensure that a plan for the transition is published, so that we can have
more confidence that it will take place, and when it will take
place.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14021193000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000220">6.15

156F has again largely been explored in earlier discussions of the
amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter. This is a way of
proposing the same thing but in a slightly different form. The
discussion, as noble Lords will remember, was whether some of the
forecast surplus from Flood Re should be invested in mitigation. This
is a form of investment 
<?notus-xml column=587?>now to save costs in the future. With the likely impacts of climate
change, uncertain though they are, it is nevertheless likely that the
extreme events we have witnessed—for example, in the past couple
of months—will become more frequent. We cannot tell by how much
and when that will happen. Nevertheless, investment today to help make
households more resilient is likely to save costs tomorrow.</hs_para>

amendment does not specify a pattern of investment, but recognises that
there could be surpluses in the early years of Flood Re. It is asking
the administrator to encourage and support households to address the
resilience of their properties and consider options, including
investment in mitigation strategies to make properties more resilient,
and to publish a plan for how Flood Re would use its resources to
address the underlying risk. This is perhaps a short-term cost to Flood
Re, but a long-term saving. It is an “invest to save”
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000062">Finally,
I move on to Amendment 156G, which is something that has not been
discussed so far. I will explore this in a little more detail. The
point of this amendment is to help preserve incentives on insurance
companies and households to keep the costs of flood claims down. This
is important, because unless claim costs are kept under control, the
levy on the bills of other households will need to rise. Under current
arrangements insurers have the incentive to get householders back in
their homes as soon as possible, because providing people with
temporary accommodation costs insurers money. In the future, Flood Re
is set to bear all of these costs under the current proposals, leaving
no liability with the insurer managing the claim. So what incentive
will there be to keep claim costs down and get people home as quickly
as possible? A similar lack of insurer “skin in the game”
has been blamed by the Competition Commission for a
£150 million to £200 million rise in motor
insurance premiums. Insurers may not care if home premiums rise if it
affects the whole market equally. Auditing of insurer claim costs
post-event will be too little, too late, to control
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000063">Reinsurance
products require an element of risk-sharing between the insurer and
reinsurer. This is a sensible precaution by the reinsurer to avoid them
being hit with avoidable costs. Risk sharing usually takes the form of
a quota-share agreement whereby the insurer agrees to retain a share of
all claims, commonly 25%. There is no reason why Flood Re cannot
operate in this way, given that it is standard practice in the
market.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021193000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000064">If we
had such an insurance-sharing arrangement, it would have a number of
benefits. It would encourage insurers to properly assess flood risk,
otherwise they might be tempted to take a simplistic or risk-averse
approach and cede more properties to Flood Re than ought to be there,
which would mean high-risk householders paying more for their insurance
than they should. An element of risk retention will require insurers to
assess the risk left with them. Secondly, it would encourage high-risk
customers to shop around and get the best deal. In shopping around,
they could well find an insurer with a lower risk assessment for their
property who was willing to offer a policy below 
<?notus-xml column=588?>the Flood Re cap. Thirdly, risk-sharing would make
Flood Re more likely to receive state aid approval, as appropriate
risk-sharing is likely to be one of the factors that the European
Commission would consider in any investigation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14021193000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000065">The amendment would
also introduce an element of risk-reflective pricing for households in
the Flood Re pool. I acknowledge that this has the downside that those
at the highest flood risk may pay somewhat more for their insurance
than those who are just within Flood Re’s scope. People will be
asked to pay a small risk-reflective element premium in addition to the
standard Flood Re cap, but that would reflect the important role in
managing claims that householders themselves can play. Householders can
take a number of actions to reduce their risk of flooding and the size
of any potential claim; we heard about some of those in earlier
discussions. For example, we need to encourage people to sign up to
flood warnings, to heed them when they are issued and to move valuable
possessions and property away from floodwater if they can.</hs_para>

that high-risk households, along with insurers, should retain a share

this would make insurance policies less affordable, but the thresholds
could be adjusted so that the net effect was zero without increasing
the size of the levy. People concerned by the risk-reflective element

would require Flood Re to publish the intended framework for reviews,
outlining the decisions that needed to be made at each review point.
Why is that important? The Government’s consultation document on
Flood Re specified that reviews will be held in order that there should
be a gradual transition to risk-reflective pricing. Discussions have
centred on reviews every five years and the impact assessment for flood
risk is based on that hypothesis, but there is nothing in the
legislation to confirm that this will be so.</hs_para>

a five-yearly review is critical. Flood Re is designed by the
Government to expire in 20 to 25 years’ time, with review points
where decisions can be taken to reduce the benefit of the pool to
claimants and the levy to all policyholders. If a 
<?notus-xml column=589?>linear approach is taken, this might result in a 20%
drop in the levy, and the benefits, every five years. The potential
problems are that the reviews could be more frequent, or never. The
Treasury could require the transition period to be shortened, thus not
allowing the necessary flood risk management investment to take place,
or it could set the percentage drop in the levy to be higher in the
earlier period. The reason why it might do so would be that under OECD
rules the levy is considered to be a tax. Removing it early would
reduce the percentage tax burden on the state.</hs_para>

not just when the reviews take place but what information they provide
so that the Government and parliamentarians have the necessary
information to make informed decisions. As such, it would seem
important to define the critical parameters in the review in some
detail at the outset, understanding exactly what areas beyond
affordability and accessibility will be judged to see whether or not
the scheme is effective. I hope therefore that the Minister will put on
record the Government’s intentions in this regard so that we can
have reassurances that the scheme will achieve the outcomes that we all
want.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/73452D299B306CF4EB560B67295728E4515AA0C9" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2014">Tuesday,

156C, moved so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, as it enables
me to raise a series of allied issues. The first is that, Flood Re or
no Flood Re, we are all on notice that the cross-subsidy of flood risk
needs to be replaced by individual risk assessments. The reason for
that is our better geographical knowledge and the unsustainability of
the continued mutualisation of risk in those circumstances. I have

the data produced by the Environment Agency. Obviously, those data are
very important for the industry and for consultants, but they are
equally important for individuals because, if we are moving to
individual assessment, we must have some means of identifying the

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I broadly support most of these
amendments, but I have a few queries. I support the first two
amendments, Amendments 156C and 156D, unequivocally. It should be part
of the role of Flood Re to help raise awareness, both among
policyholders and in the community at large, and it will need to do so
in conjunction with the Environment Agency, local authorities and so
forth. However, clearly, the insurers also have a responsibility, as is
reflected in these amendments. This will help both the beneficiaries
and the insurers to move to a more systematic, cost-reflective basis
for the whole system over time. It is also true that the administrator
should be required to produce a plan for the operation of that scheme,
as provided for in Amendment 156D. There must also be an overall
longer-term plan for transition over the 25 years of the
plan, as is proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, and the noble
Baroness, Lady
Parminter.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000080">I
am less sure that we should stipulate a five-year review period in
legislation. In a sense, the scheme is always under review and will be
changed in the light of new advice or new experience of flood
conditions. Tying this down to every five years may not be
the most sensible thing to do. Part of that assessment would
be to indicate what measures would be needed to reduce long-term costs,
as provided for in Amendment 156F. Insurers may encourage both
individual and collective schemes of mitigation. As I have said before,
this may involve mitigation by the policyholders, as a condition of
that policy, or as a “cream-off” from compensation
received in order to renew the policy. The noble Lord referred to Flood
Re’s assessment of the need to invest 
<?notus-xml column=591?>in order to save in the longer term. I understand
all of that. I am, however, a little worried by the term
“subsidising”, which is included in Amendment 156E. I am
not sure who is subsidising whom in this context. If the noble Lord
means measures such as these, I think that is appropriate, but I would
not use that term, as it might suggest a cross-subsidy over and above
what is already provided for in the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000081">Even
after the noble Lord’s gallant attempt at explaining Amendment
156G, I do not follow it fully. As I understand it, the objective is to
keep the levy cost down for those outside the scheme and the means
would be some sort of quota-sharing agreement. I bow to the greater
expertise of those involved in the insurance industry to tell me
whether that will work. Subject to those queries and my slight lack of
comprehension on the last amendment, the noble Lord, Lord Krebs, and
the noble Baroness are in the right territory with these
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:33:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000082"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="14021193000247" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000247">Lord
De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, I concur with the noble Lord, Lord
Krebs, in Amendment 156C that it is important that householders whose
policies are ceded to Flood Re are aware both of the flood risk in
their vicinity and of the transitional nature of the scheme. Knowing
about flood risk is vital so that households can take simple steps,
such as signing up to free flood warnings, as well as investigating
longer-term options for managing their flood risk, and can understand
the likely impact on their future premiums of the withdrawal of the
subsidy from which they are
benefiting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000083">We
will work with insurers and Flood Re to support people at flood risk to
plan for and adjust to risk-based pricing. I hope that noble Lords will
be reassured to know that we have agreed with the ABI that insurers
will be required to provide information to customers about their flood
risk, Flood Re and the actions that they can take to manage this, both
when a property is ceded to Flood Re and at the point of a claim. Of
course, raising awareness of flood risk remains primarily a matter for
risk management authorities, such as the Environment Agency, so it will
be important to ensure that any action by insurers on behalf of Flood
Re complements their work.</hs_para>

156D, I understand that by changing the phrasing of the power in Clause
54(3) from “may” to “shall”, the notion
that Flood Re is a transitional measure is strengthened. I point to the
Government’s stated policy objective in the June 2013 public
consultation
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14021193000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000209">“there

to the existing provisions in subsection (2) of the clause, which may
require the administrator to have regard to the transitional nature of
the scheme in discharging its functions. We have been clear that there
should be a gradual transition to more risk-reflective prices and that
we are committed to ensuring that the scheme retains incentives for
flood risk to be managed. The Government will not designate the scheme
until we are satisfied with the industry’s proposals. As I have
already said today, the regulations designating the scheme will be
subject to public consultation and we are currently considering the
recommendation of 
<?notus-xml column=592?>the Delegated Powers Committee that regulations made under this clause
should be subject to the affirmative procedure. While I recognise that
the shift from a permissive power to a firm expectation could be
claimed to underscore Flood Re’s duties in this regard, I
believe that there is sufficient clarity in Flood Re’s role to
manage the transition to risk-reflective pricing and for that
to be achieved through the current drafting of the Bill.</hs_parafo>

156E, from my noble friend Lady Parminter, I can confirm that it is, as
she said, our firm intention that the policy will be reviewed every
five years by the Government. This review will assess the level at
which the levy and the eligibility thresholds are set to ensure that
the policy objectives of Flood Re continue to be delivered, including
the transition to risk-reflective pricing. The plan will be a public
document and Parliament will be able to use existing powers to call
Flood Re’s staff to answer any questions. On the point made by
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, in the case that Flood Re’s
finances are out of kilter or the scheme is not operating effectively,
that review will be brought forward. We are working with the ABI to
define this process. The amount of the levy and the thresholds will be
set out in secondary legislation. We intend those instruments to have a
review period, always accepting that they might be reviewed early if
circumstances require it. In addition, as I have just said, we are
taking a power to make Flood Re’s responsible officer directly
accountable to Parliament for the scheme’s value for money and
for propriety and regularity. There are powers to require Flood
Re’s audited accounts to be laid before Parliament and provided
to the Comptroller and Auditor-General to examine and compare against
Flood Re’s published transition plan.</hs_para>

156F, which would require the Flood Re scheme administrator to set out
how it intends to manage the transition to risk-reflective pricing by
investing in flood risk mitigation measures. Actions taken by
households, communities, businesses and Government to reduce flood risk
are the best and most cost-effective way to secure affordable insurance
for households at risk of flooding in the long term, and I recognise
the noble Lord’s intention to see this reflected in the Bill. As
I said earlier, Flood Re will have a duty to have regard to the need
both to act in the public interest and to ensure economy, efficiency
and effectiveness in the discharge of its functions. It may well be
that the Flood Re administrator decides in due course that investments
of the sort that the noble Lord would like to see present an
appropriate means of complying with these requirements where there is a
clear case for doing so. Nothing in the Bill precludes this. However,
we think that it is important for Flood Re to retain flexibility in the
way that it discharges its public-interest duty and plans for
transition, in order to ensure that it is in a position to balance
these requirements against its core obligations as a reinsurer.
Accordingly, we do not think that it would be appropriate to mandate
Flood Re to subsidise flood risk mitigation
measures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000087">Finally,
Amendment 156G would limit the maximum proportion of the cost of a
claim that an insurer could reclaim from the Flood Re scheme to a
specific amount, 
<?notus-xml column=593?>as part of the Flood Re scheme’s management of transition to
risk-reflective pricing. I understand that the intention is that this
would restore an element of risk-reflective pricing to insurance
policies in Flood Re. This could create a financial incentive for
households and insurers to put in place the necessary measures to
manage their flood risk.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:40:22"></hs_TimeCode>, price
is one, but not the only, signal to households for achieving that and
our proposals for ensuring that households have the necessary
information to make informed choices about managing their risk should
also act to drive resilient behaviours. While superficially attractive,
sharing an element of the risk between Flood Re and households would
also have the effect of creating a more complex system to administer,
thereby adding to the overall costs of the scheme. Having listened to

Lords’ attention to government amendments tabled to Clauses 54,
70, 72 and 80. These are generally minor and technical amendments but I
draw your Lordships’ attention to two areas which may be of
particular
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000091">Amendments
162 and 163 concern the winding up of the Flood Re scheme under Clause
70 and the distribution of any reserves. As part of the operation of
the Flood Re scheme it is expected that Flood Re will build up capital
reserves. These reserves would contribute to the payment of the scheme
liabilities including flood insurance claims for those households whose
premiums have been ceded. It is expected that these reserves will be
reduced over the life of the scheme and taken into account as part of
the five-yearly levy-setting discussions. At the end of the scheme, 
<?notus-xml column=594?>Flood Re will still hold some level of residual capital reserves. Clause
70 allows for an order to be made requiring a specific amount of those
reserves to be transferred to the Secretary of State upon closure of
the
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000092">These<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:43:23"></hs_TimeCode>
amendments require that, in preparation for closure of the scheme, the
Secretary of State must consult the Flood Re scheme administrator in
relation to the transfer of any reserves, as defined for these
purposes. This consultation must be carried out before an order
requiring the transfer of reserves can be made. As drafted, this
consultation duty will apply only at the end of the life of the Flood
Re scheme and will not extend to any other circumstances. Because of
this, I ought to mention that I may need to come forward with a further
amendment in relation to reserves on

other area of interest relates to Clause 72 on internal drainage
boards. This clause amends Schedule 3 to the Land Drainage
Act 1991 to simplify the process by which internal drainage boards in
England may seek to make organisational or structural changes. At the
Welsh Government’s request, Amendments 164 and 165 extend Clause
72 to internal drainage boards and internal drainage districts in
Wales. This will align the process throughout England and Wales. I beg

Grantchester:</Member></B> My Lords, the amendment concerns information
on the flood reinsurance scheme and would clarify that
regulations will be brought forward to set the date of the
commencement, and that Parliament will have approved by
affirmative procedure the requirements on insurers of the scheme. Most
critically, the proposed new clause would ensure that when these
important Flood Re provisions come into effect, the database will have
been established, as defined in Clause 61, with the relevant
information in the right form as specified in subsection (4) of the
proposed new
clause<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
Subsection (4) of the proposed new clause says that the database must
be accessible to everyone, and must allow them to check whether or not
the property with which they are concerned is covered by the Flood Re
scheme, and what the risk of the property flooding
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:46:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lords in the Chamber today share my heartfelt sympathies for those in
Somerset and the Thames Valley who have been struggling to deal with
these awful floods, and hope that this Flood Re scheme will make sure
that people are able to get affordable and accessible insurance in
future. The importance of the amendment is that it would provide
information to someone buying a property as to whether their
prospective purchase is at risk of flooding and, if so, if they will be
able to get insurance under the scheme. It does not make sense that a
family looking for a house in Somerset, the Thames Valley or elsewhere
would be unaware of whether or not it was covered. It would add
particular difficulties for them when it came to budgeting for the
years ahead. It would be essential information when it came to looking
for a mortgage. Lenders will require insurance on property to be able
to advance money for the purchase, and will want to know whether or not
the costs associated with the property are going to be high and whether
insurance is
affordable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:48:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

While the objective of the amendment is to emphasise transparency of
and accessibility to information, including mapping, it also highlights
the necessity for clarity on flood risk. The Minister may respond that
subsection (4)(c) of the proposed new clause is opaque and refers only
to property in the scheme. Yet the scheme must manage the situation and
a transition over the period of the scheme. There must be a planned and
collaborative withdrawal of the Flood Re scheme, and not a precipitate
change into market

expressed that there is a lack of clarity concerning elements of

Oxburgh:</Member></B><B> </B>Amendment 161A scarcely needs any detailed
discussion: we have spoken this afternoon on a number of occasions of
the importance of getting information to people. Certainly, this was a
plea that came to us through many of the verbal representations that we
had when we saw various interested groups in the lead-up to the
discussion of this Bill. I simply offer this proposal to use council
tax demands as a simple and almost cost-free way of disseminating
information very widely, reminding people on an annual basis of their
vulnerability to flood. It could d serve as a portal to the various
schemes and proposals that we discussed this

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lords for
their amendments. We are certainly supportive of their intentions in
tabling them. The provision of information to households at risk of
flooding is vital for managing the costs and impacts of flooding. We
believe that it is essential that households benefiting from Flood Re
should know about Flood Re and actions that they could take, for
example, to reduce flood risk, allowing them to plan for the future.
This was a key issue in the public consultation on flood insurance;
some of the issues in these amendments echo some of the issues raised
in earlier groups, which my noble friend Lord De Mauley has
addressed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:52:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Grantchester, rightly emphasised transparency; we certainly agree with
that. As my noble friend Lord De Mauley has just pointed out, the
Government have agreed with the Association of British Insurers the
principle that insurers will be required to provide information to
customers, both when a property is ceded to Flood Re and at the point
of a claim, highlighting their flood risk. We are also keen to ensure
that Flood Re plays its part in managing the transition to
risk-reflective pricing, which we discussed earlier. We are continuing
to develop with the ABI proposals in this area. We strongly believe
that it is equally important that households outside Flood Re are aware
of their flood risk, and the Government are committed to making this
information available to the public. That is why we already have
systems in place, through the Environment Agency and its devolved
equivalents, to provide this
information<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:53:10"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:54:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Environment Agency already makes comprehensive and searchable flood
risk data available on its website. This has enabled people to check
their flood risk from rivers and the sea and take action to prepare for
flooding. The agency provides the same information for insurers to use.
In addition, last December, the Environment Agency published surface
water maps for all areas of England on its website and will produce a
combined map, showing all sources of flooding, by December 2015. This
work further helps improve public understanding of their flood risk and
I hope noble Lords will be further reassured by
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T18:53:52"></hs_TimeCode>. While this
places the onus on home owners to seek the information themselves, it

Grantchester, raised the point about people buying properties. Clearly,
anybody purchasing a property should check their flood risk by
commissioning property surveys and searches or, alternatively,
information on surface water risk that has been available in recent
years on request from lead local flood authorities. If they conduct
those kinds of searches and surveys, then this kind of information
should emerge. Clearly, if, having discovered the flood risk, they
discuss it with whomever they are buying their property from, the issue
of Flood Re would no doubt enter their

own mapping of flood risk and will mean that our record levels of flood

talk to a broker and shop around—this was referred to by the

amendment uses the date later than 2009, which is simply intended to
probe the Government’s intentions. I support a cut-off
date—there must be one for the scheme to operate
effectively—but the question is whether it must be 1 January

that imply that the understanding might change because of developments
since the statement of principles was established in 2008? This doubt
is also important because the proposals in the Bill do not take account

alter our understanding of what “high risk”

essence of this amendment is: given that houses granted planning
permission before 2009 but built afterwards would not covered by Flood

allowed to enter Flood Re where flood risk has genuinely changed since
2009 due to changing weather; where developments are affected by
surface water but the risk was not taken into account as it was not

in which the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, moved
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:06:57"></hs_TimeCode>. I received a
different narrative on this. The circumstances of the post-2009
cut-off, as explained to me, were that that was the time when
<I>Planning Policy Statement 25</I>, in relation to construction on
flood risk areas, came into being. As the story went, therefore,
everybody was on notice that that was an issue, so that was the cut-off
point. However, it occurs to me that the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, has
raised rather an interesting issue.</hs_para>

is fair to say that the end of summer 2008 was when the wheels came off
the banking system and, with it, the property development system. If
anybody had a planning consent that he was hoping to implement in 2008,
he would have found that there was no money or funding to implement
it—nothing would be forthcoming. Many of these schemes were put
on ice. Indeed, there was a government recommendation—I do not
know if you can call it an instruction—to the local planning
authorities that they should look favourably on extending the
three-year life of these. As I am sure noble Lords are aware, detailed
planning consent has a three-year life, so it would have run out and
would have had to be reapplied for. Due to the circumstances of having
to reapply—maybe there are a new lot of regulations and so
on—you can run into a whole raft of cost, time and
delay.</hs_para>

idea was that those things should be perpetuated, and with very good
reason. They underpinned balance sheets, loans and all sorts of things.
If they were to be effectively prejudiced by the loss of a planning
consent, so that you had a property with either no verifiable
development value or a lower development value, that had repercussions
for precisely the sort of reasons I outlined earlier this afternoon in
another context. So it is perfectly possible that a planning consent
that was negotiated on the basis of rules in 2006 or 2007 would not
have got going by the end of 2008 or 2009, and would have had to be
preserved. The houses would not have been constructed until some time
later, but the circumstances relating to that consent would have
related to the antecedent circumstances at the time of granting of
planning consent. I can see that there is an issue

frightened by development land values anywhere. I am even more
frightened when things go wrong and people start reaching for their
lawyers. What are they going to start looking at? Will they say,
“The house is now constructed, it was built on what might be
called an old technology basis pre-2008, and, lo and behold, it has
flooded”? If they are excluded, it may have a material effect on
the value. Who will they look to for recompense—the
local authority or the fact that <I>P</I><I>lanning

they are excluded from Flood Re. Like the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, I am
interested to hear from the Minister how many properties were built
before 2008 but were not occupied until 2009 or after. The people
living in these properties may well get a nasty shock when they realise

Amendment 160A is that all classes of people, whether they are
freeholders, leaseholders or the owner of a commonhold tenancy, should
be treated equally. Other noble Lords have covered this area in detail.
If properties are on the flood plain, whether they are 200 or five
years old and whether they are owned or rented, they should be able to
access affordable flood insurance. Anything less is invidious. There
will be households where a newly married couple have taken on the
leasehold of a property, raised their children, lived in it all their
working life and now seek to retire there. When they first took up
occupancy of the dwelling, there would have been no hint of it ever
flooding. However, with changes in the jetstream and continuous and

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, there is an element of
confusion both outside and inside this House as to where the words
which define the exclusion of leaseholders are to be found. I
understand that Defra put out a notice in which it excluded
leaseholders, but can the Minister tell us where this provision is
made? The public are confused. The assumption when anyone reads this
Bill that freeholders are included will be interpreted by flat-owners
who have purchased their freehold but manage their blocks through
leasehold companies—companies which have been established to
manage the freehold, owned by the residents who have 999-year
leases—to mean that they are also included. They will assume
that because they are freeholders they are included. My understanding
from my reading, although, as I say, I have not found the authoritative
piece of literature, is that they are not included. In other words,
people out there who believe they are included—freeholders of
blocks of flats; not corporate interests but individual
share-of-freehold owners—will think that they are included when
they are not. That needs to be sorted out.</hs_para>

cannot understand why they are excluded. Indeed, I would argue that
they are probably less of a risk to insurance companies, even though
they may well live in buildings on flood plains, because very often you
find blocks of flats where no one is living on the bottom floor at all
and the first flat in the block is on the first floor, above the area
at risk of being flooded. If I am correct in what I am saying, will the
Minister 
<?notus-xml column=603?>tell us why share-of-freehold owners in blocks of
flats are being excluded when, in fact, they are freeholders and when,
as I say, people reading the Bill will presume that they are

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I think my noble friend Lord
Campbell-Savours is going back to a point that I raised
earlier—namely, that the Flood Re parts of the Bill may have
been produced relatively late in the Commons. However, the dividing
line between what is included in terms of property and what is not is
not as clear as it should be. My noble friend has just
identified a group for whom this issue is particularly confusing, but
in any case the distinction is not in the text of the Bill. As I said
earlier, there is slight confusion about the various bits of paper that
Defra has produced on this matter, so we need clarity one way or the
other as to which groups are included and which are not. We
have heard various bits of clarification from the Minister today. I
think that most of those should end up in the Bill before we finalise
it and I look to the Government to come forward with amendments on
Report or at Third Reading to make sure that the position is
clear<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000136">I
am afraid that I confused the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Shipley, in this group with an amendment in an earlier group and
commented on it earlier. However, whereas I have great sympathy with a
lot of the other excluded groups, I have virtually none with those who
built on and developed land in high-risk areas after 2009 because it
was already clear from the previous agreement between the Government
and the ABI that new insurance would not be given for those
developments. Like the noble Earl, Lord Cathcart, I do not think we
should give those people leeway retrospectively. If we shift the
deadline now, somebody will argue for a deadline at a later stage to
allow yet more development in inappropriate places, and that will skew
the insurance figures and the whole calculation behind Flood Re.
Therefore, I do not support the noble Lord on this

160A seeks to make all houses built and occupied before its

Flood Re, rather than from 2009, and would also bring band H households

apologise to noble Lords as I suspect that I may be repeating what I
said earlier today and, indeed, we may repeat it yet again later.
First, I reiterate why we intend that properties built before 1 January
2009 and those in council tax band H and the equivalents would not be
eligible for the scheme. However, before I do that, I shall respond to
my noble friend Lord Shipley and a number of other noble Lords who
asked what state the property must have been in at 1 January 2009 in
order to qualify. It must have been in possession of a council tax
band, which would imply that it was habitable at that date. I hope that

2009 cut-off date recognises that new housing development should be

not increase flood risk elsewhere, in line with the national planning
policies in place. This date therefore reflects the fact that homes
built since 2009 should already be insurable at affordable prices. As
the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, said, that marker has been in operation
for several years, and it has been maintained under the Flood Re

properties. As we have discussed, commercial policies are out of scope
of Flood Re, which is designed to support households. We believe that
this approach is fair and practical, and it was supported in the public
consultation. However, the leasehold sector presents a more complex
situation, where the contents policy is classified as domestic, but a
buildings policy could be classified as either commercial or domestic
and could cover multiple dwellings. As I said, I recognise the strength
of feeling on this issue, particularly in light of the ongoing extreme
weather conditions, and I feel we need to take time to consider it in
more detail, although, without evidence of market failure, it would be
difficult to justify action. However, we will examine the evidence
further with the ABI and I hope to provide an update on

reply. A Written Statement would also be helpful as we move towards
Report. I should like to pursue two points briefly. I say to the noble
Earl, Lord Lytton, that there is more than one narrative
but the outcome is the same. The issue is whether the
understanding of flood risk that was apparently correct in 2008 and
2009 is still correct in 2014. I suspect that it is not, which is why I
am concerned. It would be helpful if the Minister’s note that he
will send before Report could inform us whether it is still

definition of what is high risk is now changing around us. Therefore,
people who bought in good faith properties which were not in a
high-risk

Maxwellisation is the name for the way the common law has developed of
providing a person who is criticised in a report with an opportunity to

should be in the contents of a report, both the inquiry and the
criticised are in an intolerable situation. Following freedom of
information requests, the Information Commissioner ruled in favour of
disclosing the minutes of two Cabinet meetings in 2003 prior to and
concerning military action in Iraq. The Cabinet Office—would you
believe it?—had curiously argued that the public interest in
favour of disclosure diminished with the passage of time. That is
risible. It is the original long-grass

Anderson of Swansea (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to
follow my noble and learned friend and to adopt many of his questions.
First, I shall reflect on the precise question in the Motion and then
consider whether the inquiry is likely to be judged worth
while.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000160">Perhaps
the first question can be answered briefly. It is largely contained in
Sir John Chilcot’s letters to the Prime Minister of 15 July and
14 November last year. Apparently, only in June last year did the
inquiry request that certain documents should be published to give
evidential backing to its conclusions. I make two observations on that.
First, why was the request made so late in the day? Secondly, surely it
was unrealistic of the inquiry to believe that Cabinet Office documents

<?notus-xml column=608?>and confidential exchanges between heads of state could be published. By
sticking to such a principle, the inquiry ensured further delay for a
process that began in June 2009 and was expected by some at the time to
last but for a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:41:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
<I>Guardian</I> of 29 December last claimed that a compromise agreement
had been reached between Sir John and the Cabinet Secretary that
extracts could be published in a redacted form. I pose this question to
the Minister: is that so? Was not such a deal in effect inevitable from
the
start?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000161">Many
doubts remain as to whether the length and expense of the inquiry have
been worth while. My noble and learned friend referred to the Saville
inquiry into Bloody Sunday. However long and expensive that inquiry
was, it had the merit of having a cathartic effect on divisions within
Ulster. Perhaps the Chilcot inquiry was necessary because of pressures
at the time, but many key questions have already been answered.
Certainly, every conceivable question was asked of Tony Blair, the
Prime Minister at the
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>. For some
the motive was a sort of personal vendetta against Tony
Blair—let us remember “Blair liar” and
“Blair war criminal”—but they are likely to be
disappointed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021193000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#14021193000162">I
personally had the privilege of an important vantage point. Between
1997 and 2005 I chaired the Foreign Affairs Committee of the other
place. I gave evidence to the Hutton inquiry and I visited key figures
in the Washington establishment at least twice a year over the period
between 1998 and 2005. I had one-to-one meetings with the Prime
Minister, Tony Blair, and Sir Richard Dearlove. As a result, I am
wholly convinced that Tony Blair acted with total integrity and relayed
to Parliament and the public the advice that both he and, indeed, I too
had received. There may be criticisms that he did not ask sufficiently
searching questions of the intelligence services about their sources.
Certainly the US Administration relied excessively on exiles and
partisan sources such as Mr Chalabi and the Iraqi taxi driver,
Mr Rafid al-Janabi. There was much suspicion that the US Administration
was seeking revenge on Iraq for

about the breaches of international law to which my noble and learned
friend alluded? Even if in retrospect we recognise that there was
greater weight against intervention among those international lawyers

sides of the argument for pre-emption. The inquiry would be well
advised, in spite of its excellent legal adviser, not to seek to give a
definitive 
<?notus-xml column=609?>view in this very uncertain field of international
law. What about the role of the security services? Surely that was
adequately covered in the Butler report. What about the role of the
military? It has had its lessons learnt reviews. There were some
concerns about the quality of military equipment, but surely the
general, correct view is that it was executed superbly by our Armed
Forces.</hs_para>

follow-up to the Iraq intervention is that there has been much public
revulsion against all intervention. There was the Chicago speech by
Tony Blair in, I think, 1998. There were successful interventions in
Sierra Leone and Kosovo, but following Iraq and Afghanistan, as we have
seen in Libya with no boots on the ground and as we have seen in the
parliamentary view on intervention in Damascus, there is now a very

conclusion about governance? Was there too much armchair government?
Was there a presidential-style Government with the Cabinet sidelined?
That may be so, but the memoirs of Robin Cook, no great admirer of the
former Prime Minister, suggest otherwise. What about the insights into
transatlantic relations? It was the clear strategic priority of the
Prime Minister not to keep the United States isolated; that was very
much a major factor for him. There was a great deal of evidence of that
in the US inquiries. I had a certain personal experience of the
somewhat naive views of the neo-cons in Washington when on several
occasions I met Mr Richard Perle, whom Denis Healey called the
“Prince of Darkness”. He relayed to me his view that come
the liberation, while perhaps the bells would not ring in Iraq, there
would certainly be great rejoicing and that the ripples of democracy
would flow out from Iraq over the whole of the Middle East. That was a
view which was in part accepted by the President, and the neo-cons were
then very much in a dominant position in
Washington<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:47:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

post-conflict planning? Is the inquiry likely to tell us anything
useful about that? The truth is, of course, that we in the UK played a
very secondary role in the conflict and certainly a secondary one in
the post-conflict planning. I saw that when I went to the green zone in
Baghdad and was in the office being occupied by Sir Jeremy Greenstock.
I saw the role of Mr Paul Bremer and his large component on the other
side. There were two contrasting blueprints for the post conflict. The
State Department had Colin Powell and Richard Armitage, who told me
that there was more combat experience on his floor in the State
Department than on the relevant floor of the Department of Defense. In
that department were Mr Donald Rumsfeld and Mr Paul Wolfowitz. They
were at the top of the department and said that the Iraqi army was
dissolved. As we know, the Chilcot inquiry was unable to interview key
people in the US Administration, so it has been given only a partial
view of the key players in the post-intervention scene in the United

that this long-awaited and long-expected inquiry, long delayed for good
or bad reasons, may well prove to be no more than an historic document
mainly of interest to students of government. Possibly, after an
initial flurry of interest in the press and among the public, the
waters will close over it and 
<?notus-xml column=610?>it will have as little ultimate impact as the Franks
committee report on the Falklands, referred to by my noble and learned

expectations have been raised, but it may well be that many

ask many members of the public for their memory of the political story
of Iraq, they would probably say, “Well, in the United Kingdom,
the governing Labour Party and the Official Opposition, the
Conservative Party, supported the invasion, and the Liberal Democrats
insisted on a UN resolution, which they did not get and they opposed
the war as a result”. On that kind of narrative, one might well
expect that I would be standing here wanting to find out the legal
background—what really happened in past—in order to
produce some kind of simplistic

of all, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris,
said—and we must be grateful to him for securing this
debate—it is a lot more complicated than that. Almost exactly 11
years ago to the week, on 15 February 2003, between 1 million and 2
million people came out to protest. They were not all Liberal Democrats
or anything like it. There were Conservatives like Ken Clarke. There
were liberal people, including Robin Cook, Tony Benn and many others,
who had their reservations. Indeed, within the community as a whole,
there was a great debate about this question. It was not simple, and I
have no doubt that when Sir John Chilcot’s report finally is
published it will be a thoughtful, complex and detailed report. I got
to know him very well when he was at the Northern Ireland Office
and I always admired his acuity of perception and his integrity
of conduct, and the same could be said of his distinguished
colleagues<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140211105000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000003">From my point of view,
the purpose of this inquiry is something quite different. It is to try
to understand how we got ourselves into such a difficulty in order that
we can look to the future with better understanding of how to deal with
the problems. I will give one example. At the time of the first Gulf
War, which was permitted by UN Security Council Resolution 678, there
was a great debate as to how far it might be prosecuted. Noble Lords
will well recall a lot of discussion as to whether it should actually
be prosecuted right through to Baghdad to get rid of Saddam or whether
Resolution 678 did not permit it. I had a great argument with my old
friend and colleague, now the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown, on exactly this
issue. It was my view that, with this particular guy in these
circumstances, you needed to go the whole way to Baghdad and get rid of
him. It seemed to me that to do anything other was not just a poor
reading of Machiavelli but a poor judgment of the psychology of the
person one was dealing with and the politics of the region. Paddy said,
“No, no, no. That is not possible under UNSC Resolution 678. We
cannot do that. We can just remove him from Kuwait”. Well, it is
a bit ironic that so many years later it was UNSC Resolution 678 which
was prayed in aid actually without a further activating
resolution<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:53:33"></hs_TimeCode>. If I
was so hawkish—as I would have been deemed then—in 
<?notus-xml column=611?>the first Gulf War—why would I have spoken in your
Lordships’ House in 2003 saying, “This is not the time to
go ahead with it”? It is because situations change. I will come
back to that because I believe it is the importance of the urgency of
the Chilcot
report<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:53:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the first Gulf War we had a huge coalition, there had been a clear
breach, it obviously required military intervention, and it would have
been possible to prosecute it through to the end. In the intermediate
years, the Clinton Administration and others had tried to find
negotiated ways of moving things forward. Indeed, as I said in your
Lordships’ House on the occasion of that debate, there was a
suspicion that the weapons inspectors were being put in place simply to
try to produce a justification to return to Resolution 678. It seemed
to me that it was not going to end well. It was not going to resolve
the problems of the region and stabilise
Iraq<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:54:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000005">How
does that relate to the situation now? Noble Lords will recall that
Parliament, in debates in the other place and here, made an
extraordinary decision that set the Prime Minister and the Government
back on their heels on the question of Syria. It was a watershed
decision, in my view, in that a Prime Minister and a Government had
decided that they wanted to undertake a military intervention, and
Parliament, with the overwhelming backing of the people, said,
“No. That is not a direction in which we want to go”. It
seems to me that this puts up for serious exploration our whole
approach to military intervention as to when and how it should be
undertaken. Should it always be with military force or are there other
ways in which we should intervene? Should we ever be doing it on our
own? Should it always require a UN Security Council
resolution<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000006">These
are very serious questions, but not for the past—of course they
are interesting for the past, and, as the noble and learned Lord said,
perhaps for some students of history in the future. They are important
questions for us in the present and over the next few years, not to
apportion blame but to see if mistakes and misjudgments were made, and
I think everybody is clear that there were, and to try to prepare
ourselves—but not to deal with the last war. One of the mistakes
often made by military commanders and politicians is that they
prepare themselves better to fight the last war over again. Our job
ought to be to become clearer about the changing dynamics of the Middle
East and of other regions in order to better make judgments about how
we, as a country, play our role in that complicated region and
elsewhere in a time when military strength is no longer any guarantee
of military
success<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T19:56:44"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
why I believe that we need the report with some urgency. The situation
in the Middle East and in other places is developing very quickly. We
are uncertain how to proceed and we need to understand whether and how
mistakes were made so that we can find a different way of

one problem is civil servants being wary about what things should be
redacted and what things should not. I was reading just yesterday a
letter by Elizabeth Wilmshurst, the FCO’s deputy legal adviser
who resigned; her resignation letter was published some time later. The
redaction made at the 
<?notus-xml column=612?>time by the Foreign Office and later released through the press is quite
interesting. I read the redaction and I read what was originally
published, and I could not understand why on earth they had bothered to
take out what they did, because it did not tell us anything that we did
not know. I was not the least bit surprised because my own experience
with many security and Civil Service documents is that when there is a
great dust-up about what to release and what not to release, more often
than not, although not all the time, when you read what is redacted,
the fact that it was kept out—and it was clear that it was kept
out—actually produced more suspicion that there was something
really serious there. When you read it afterwards, you say,
“What on earth was all the fuss

perhaps it is not that. Perhaps it is that our friends in the United
States are very nervous about some of the conversations between the two
Prime Ministers, Mr Brown and Mr Blair, and the President. I am a
friend of the United States and I think we have an extremely important
relationship, but good friends sometimes disagree honestly. Indeed, we
are not good friends if all we ever have to say is that we support the
United States. I hear this all the time with the Middle East peace
process. What is the British Government’s policy? It is to
listen to what the American policy is and agree with it. That is no
help to our friends. We need to engage in a proper public debate about
these issues and then be

very great pity that, whenever the Chilcot inquiry reports, it will be
more than 11 years since the military operations occurred in Iraq, but
that is not the issue before the House tonight. We are not considering
whether Prime Minister Blair involved this kingdom in an illegal war or
whether he is as pure as the driven snow as far as that matter is
concerned. We are not concerned in any way with the issue of weapons of
mass destruction or what was genuinely or not genuinely believed in
that regard. We are concerned only with seeking to ask the question:
why has the Chilcot inquiry been held up in the way that it
has?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140211105000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000012">The
truth is that the Chilcot inquiry has run into a massive roadblock. As
described by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, this is the
release—not to the members of the Chilcot inquiry because they
have seen them already but to the public if the opportunity
arises—of three groups of documents: 25 notes passed between
Prime Minister Blair and the President of the United States; 200
Cabinet or Cabinet-style discussions relating to the relevant matters;
and 130 conversations between either Prime Minister Blair or Prime
Minister Brown and the President of the United States. That is the
issue.</hs_para>

documents is not that they have been seen by the Chilcot inquiry but
that the Chilcot inquiry wants to use them for a very specific and very
significant purpose: the so-called Maxwellisation principle, which was
established in relation to the inquiry following the death of Sir
Robert Maxwell. In other words, a body such as the Chilcot inquiry
wants to be able to say, “We have examined all the evidence. We
have come to the conclusion that there is a prima facie case against A,
B, C and D—the finger of blame appears to point to them as
persons who ought to be criticised. But we are not going to do that
without giving them the opportunity of replying to that situation and
calling evidence if they wish”. That seems an unimpeachable
principle of
fairness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000014">However,
the Chilcot inquiry goes one step beyond that and says, “It is
not enough that we should be able to do that. We should be able to show
to the public, if our conclusions remain the same, why we
regard those persons as blameworthy; in other words, that they should
be condemned not out of the generality of our conclusions but
out of the specific evidence that is contained in these particular
pieces of documentary evidence. Unless Maxwellisation is made public
and those documents are produced and published at the time the report
is published, Chilcot will not be regarded as having full
validity”. I absolutely say amen to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000015">Who is
holding up this disclosure, which, in my submission, is utterly
essential to the fairness of this inquiry? It is apparently the Cabinet
Secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood. He is saying, “I am
opposing this on grounds of sound precedent, a precedent laid by my
predecessor” —the noble Lord, Lord
O’Donnell—“that is, the law of the Medes and
Persians”. I would challenge that completely and make the
following submissions. First, it does not matter what the noble Lord,
Lord O’Donnell, or any other civil servant in the past 1,000
years has said. It can make no difference whatever. It is not a matter
for a civil servant to decide.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140211105000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000016">Secondly, it is a
matter for the Government, as the sovereign and ultimate legal
authority, to decide, and nobody else. The Prime Minister, making a
statement on this matter last year, said that Government were
responsible for disclosure. It does not matter what pressures there
might be from the United States or the Civil Service. The Government
are legally and morally responsible.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140211105000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000017">Thirdly, a long, long
time ago when I was a law student—it almost seems like 1,000
years ago—the noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris, and I were in
the same department at Aberystwyth and we were taught sound principles
of equity. One of the principles of equity was: no man shall be a judge
in his own suit. In other words, there are certain people who should
not adjudicate in this matter. Who would be the last person who should
ever be allowed to adjudicate on the question of whether or not these
documents should be made public? Clearly, that is either Prime Minister
Blair or Prime Minister Brown. Who would be the next? You might say
someone who was the alter ego of one of the two persons. Who was the
alter ego of Prime Minister Blair? It was Sir Jeremy Heywood—one
of the main protagonists in this confused, complicated and altogether
very strange story.</hs_para>
<?notus-xml column=614?><hs_para UID="140211105000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000018">I am not saying for a
moment that Sir Jeremy is other than a fair, honourable and thoroughly
decent man, but there is a principle of law which says that justice
must be done and must be manifestly seen to be done. Unless the
Government intervene here, as it is their moral and legal
responsibility to do, this matter will fester and I think it will
contaminate and poison the whole body politic. The confidence that
people have in parliamentary democracy, already injured, will be
further
demeaned.</hs_para><hs_time UID="140211105000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000174">8.07

Liddle (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I suppose I ought to declare an
interest in this debate in that I worked at No. 10 at the time of the
Iraq war. Indeed, I sat opposite some of the foreign affairs private
secretaries whose minutes are now to be found on the Chilcot inquiry
website. I saw some of it pretty much at first hand, although I was not
directly involved with Iraq. It was not a very easy period, I can tell
your
Lordships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000020">I
do not think it is right for our debate tonight to get into the
substance of the issues that the Chilcot inquiry is addressing. It has
been an extremely good debate and the speeches, as usual for the House
of Lords, have been of exceptionally high quality, and I thank the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Morris of Aberavon, who obviously put an
awful lot of thought into what he had to say in opening the
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000021">I
will confine my remarks from these Benches to the question of delay and
the view the Government take of that delay and of the questions
relating to the disclosure that are at the heart of that delay. It is
important to be clear: as I understand it, it is not that written
evidence has been withheld from the inquiry; the inquiry has seen all
the relevant papers. The issue at stake is how much of that evidence it
can actually quote in its final report. So the question is: does the
committee base its conclusions on the public taking it on trust that it
has read the material and this is what it concludes, or is it able to
quote from the documents?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140211105000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000022">Everyone will agree
that the Chilcot process has been very thorough. If you look at that
website, you will see that far more government papers are available
than for any precedent that I can recall. The comparison with Suez,
where no one was told about the secret deal that was done with the
French and the Israelis, is very
striking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000023">However,
there are questions about the extent of disclosure. I want to see the
Iraq question and as many of these issues as possible put to rest, but
even then there are three areas in which questions of disclosure raise
awkward issues. These are questions not just for civil servants, but
for any responsible Government of any party acting in the national
interest.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000024">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:16:35"></hs_TimeCode>
think one of these questions has already been sorted out: the question
about dealing with the use of intelligence, and the worries as to
whether disclosure of anything to do with intelligence compromises
sources. I should like the Government to confirm what I think to be the
position: that in the case of Iraq those questions were sorted out in
the Butler inquiry in 2004, and that there are no new intelligence
issues arising in the case of Chilcot. These issues relate to national
security. From our Benches, as my party 
<?notus-xml column=615?>leader said only yesterday, we support greater
scrutiny of the way in which intelligence operates. There are obvious
limits as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:12:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000025">The
second issue concerns relations with our allies. The committee
wants to quote from private correspondence between the Prime Minister
and the President of the United States. If we see ourselves as
America’s closest ally there is a real question, not just of the
past but for the future, as to the obligation that places on us to
protect confidences in that relationship. On that point I am sure a lot
of people would say, “Damn the Americans”. I do not take
that view. If we are serious about our alliances—and the same
would be true of our close partners in Europe in other
situations—we do have obligations to our allies and partners.
How do the Government see that question? Time makes a great difference,
but we are talking about something that happened a little over 10 years
ago. What view do the Government take of what is a reasonable
time to disclose things that affect our closest
allies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000026">Thirdly,
there is the issue about freedom of information and what are called
Cabinet-level discussions. Whatever decisions the Government make on
disclosure as far as the Chilcot inquiry is concerned could have
long-term implications for freedom of information more generally. This
is a serious issue. My party introduced freedom of information in 1998.
We are proud of that achievement, but there were always boundaries that
had to be set. I have always thought of freedom of information, in
simplistic terms, as meaning that expert advice should be open but
confidential discussion should remain confidential. How do the
Government see this question about disclosure of discussions right at
the centre of government on the basis of papers provided?
Much of the content is now available on the website, but how do
the Government see this question of disclosure of Cabinet-level
decisions? This will have an impact on all future Governments. This is
not just about dealing with the Iraq issue. This is about whether
disclosure is going to affect the relationship between
Ministers and civil servants for decades ahead. We have to get
that

Elystan-Morgan:</Member></B> Two points arise. First, if it be the case
that information of a confidential nature between states is always to
be kept in the background, that is an end to any question of
transparency. Does the noble Lord accept first of all that many of the
thousands of documents that have been disclosed to Chilcot on the basis
that they are declassified and therefore open to publication come into
that particular area that he
mentions?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000028">The
other matter is that it appears—if the responsible press is to
be believed—that Mr Brown, in so far as his position as Prime
Minister or as Chancellor is concerned during the period from 2001 to
2009 that is covered by the inquiry, says that he has no
objection to the disclosure of any of the three groups of documents

I, like others, should admit that I am not entirely a neutral observer
in this. I was my party’s defence spokesman at the time, and I
was involved in the development of what was then Liberal Democrat
opposition to the war. Part of my reason for being so was that
I had been a relatively frequent visitor to Washington both
before and after 9/11. I met there people whom I had known when I was a
graduate student in the United States in the early 1960s and who had
become some of the leading neo-conservatives within the Administration.
It was because of what I knew of some of their underlying assumptions
and of my participation in two National Intelligence Council-sponsored
conferences in Washington, one in the autumn of 2001 and one in the
summer of 2002, that I concluded that the Bush Administration were
determined to go to war with Iraq against the advice of some of their
own intelligence analysts who knew the Middle East
well<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:19:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000032">Having
said that, I should say that this is a very different inquiry from the
Franks inquiry. It starts with the examination of the
Government’s Iraq policy papers in 2000, before 9/11, and
concludes with the withdrawal of British troops from Iraq 10 years
later. It therefore covers a much longer period than the short period
of the Franks report and deals with a coalition war in which we were
only a secondary contender. Franks was concluded in six months, but
evidence was taken in private; the report covered only the period
before the conflict; it did not publish many of the documents. I again
declare an interest: I was one of those who reviewed it very critically
on publication because it seemed to me that it had distorted the actual
situation. The intelligence community had indeed got it right. The only
mistake that it had made was in thinking that the Argentinians would
not be unwise enough to try to invade the Falklands before the winter;
it thought that it would do it six months
later<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:20:35"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:20:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000033">I
also look back at the Dardanelles inquiry, and reference has been made
to the situation after Suez. What we now have with the Chilcot inquiry
is a very much more thorough examination in which we are talking about
several thousand documents—I must correct the noble Lord, Lord
Elystan-Morgan: they have not been declassified by being released to
the Chilcot inquiry. This is an inquiry by privy counsellors; they have
access to everything that they wish to see, including intelligence
documents et cetera. The question at stake is not access; it is

thousands of documents, many of them very lengthy, and deciding how
much can safely be declassified for publication—how
much therefore can be published, how much some documents should be
redacted in part and whether there are documents which it would be
safer not to publish at all. That has taken a good deal longer than was

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> I am not informed on that matter. I
know that, last July, they hoped to be able to start the process of
Maxwellisation within a few months. That has been delayed because what
happens in a Maxwellisation process—here again I have to correct
the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan—is that those who are
mentioned in the report will be allowed to see those elements of the
report in full which carry their evidence and will be published. So
they will not see more; they will see what will be
published.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000041">This
is not, incidentally, a court of law. In no sense is this a legal
inquiry. It is not a matter, if I may quote the noble Lord, of people
against whom there is a case; it is a matter of those who may see
themselves as being criticised in the report being given time ahead of
publication to prepare their response to the criticisms. So, if I may
say so to the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, this is not a roadblock.
It is, however, an obstacle course, and that takes a good deal of time
and discussion among different government departments, which I regret
has taken longer than we hoped. I very much hope that it will be
concluded soon. The Maxwellisation letters will then be able to go out
and

publications to a publication of the final

also raise the role of the Cabinet Secretary because I know that he has
been criticised quite substantially in the press. The Cabinet Secretary
is entitled to see all the papers of previous Governments. In
the final resort, as we all know, the Cabinet Secretary only advises
and the Prime Minister can always override, but I am old-fashioned
about civil servants. Senior civil servants are servants of the Crown
as well as of the Government, and they advise in their perception of
the long-term national interest. That is what the Cabinet Secretary is
doing and I regret that there has been some rather partisan criticism
in the press about his role, criticism which I think is
unjustified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000043">The
question was also raised as to whether the Butler report covered
intelligence, so that we do not need to take it again. The Butler
report covered intelligence leading up to the war. This inquiry, which
takes us several years past the war, may well need to address one or
two other questions. I should perhaps also mention the Gibson inquiry,
which, as noble Lords will know, provided an interim report last
December on some of the issues of rendition and alleged ill treatment
of British nationals and others. A picture of various different
dimensions will come into
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000044">This

there are questions about how fast we can work towards this conclusion
and there are, as the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, said, questions for
the future. I disagree with those who have suggested that the report,
when it comes out, will be simply a historical document gathering dust.
I think that it will raise precisely the sorts of questions which the
noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, has suggested. What should be the
conditions for future intervention? How much information should be
shared with Parliament and with opposition parties in order to carry
Parliament and the public with the Government? How should we handle the
coalition aspects of interventions, given that it is highly unlikely
that Britain will be involved in any serious military operations abroad
in the future which are not in coalitions with others? There, I think,
is where the debates will

Government are well aware of the sensitivity of these issues. I return
to the questions raised by the noble Lord, Lord Liddle. What is a
reasonable time before we disclose conversations with our closest
allies and what precedents do we set if we start to publish Cabinet

Shipley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this is a probing amendment on the
rights of tenants and the problems that can arise if there is no
adequate buildings insurance in place. Reputable landlords will take
out insurance as a matter of course. However, there is no compulsion
for landlords to do that, and tenants can be particularly vulnerable if
their landlords do not take out buildings insurance. They may not be
covered for the cost of moving out or for temporary accommodation in
the case of flood. Of course, it is understood that tenants must
provide their own contents insurance. The amendment does not relate to
contents
insurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000050">The
amendment would give tenants the right to know all the facts about an
insurance policy on the property that they are renting, including
whether there is one at all. The solution to this problem is to make it
mandatory for landlords to take up buildings insurance that includes
flood risk insurance; to require landlords to tell a tenant if a
property is on the register of premises subject to greater flood risk
as defined in Clause 61; and to show a copy of the insurance policy to
a tenant on
request.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000051">I
fully understand that landlords will not benefit from the FR scheme.
However, landlords pay income tax, and I understand that they would be
able to offset the cost of insurance against income tax. I should be
grateful for the Minister’s confirmation of that and to know

principle that it was somehow at risk and that ratcheted up my
insurance premium—which, of course, I should be delighted to

do not know how that provision sits, because the terminology for
“landlord” is wide and the amendment would probably
include other properties without any streams in the garden that I might
happen to let on a holiday letting, or something like that. I can see
that tenants need to be protected in some way, but let us look at what
the protection might mean in practice. There is a flooding event; there
is insurance cover. Let us say the interior—the inhabitable
bit—of the premises is rendered incapable of occupation, not
only because of the effect of the flood-water, but also because of the
filth and everything else, causing damage to fittings, de-lamination of
kitchen units and all the other horrors. It will need a thorough
clean-out, with bits replacing, probably a renewed kitchen, and
certainly redecoration and drying out. That takes time. The tenant is
inevitably going to have to move out. He is going to move to somewhere
else. The consequential losses presumably do not cover the loss of the

shoring up then that is a consequential
loss.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000055">So with
the greatest respect to the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, I am not sure
that this amendment achieves what it sets out to do. Maybe I have got
hold of the wrong end of the stick, but the landlord’s insurance
does not enure for the benefit of the tenant. If you look at a
commercial lease, for instance, it normally has a cessor of rent clause
which causes the rent to stop being payable at a point where damage
occurs beyond a certain level, so the property is no longer fit for
occupation. But if it is not reinstated within a certain period of
time, the tenant has the option to move out and determine the lease.
The tenant, in the mean time, whether it is a business that needs to
continue its business occupation, or a tenant in residence who actually
needs a roof over his head, is going to have to move, so I am unclear
about the mechanics of how this would really work in practice, because
I do not see that it protects the
tenant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:36:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000056"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord De Mauley" PimsId="4732" UID="140211105000195" xid="1856" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000195">The

My Lords, Amendment 161ZA from my noble friend Lord
Shipley seeks to make it obligatory for landlords to hold buildings
insurance, including cover for flood risk. I can confirm to him, in
answer to his question, that the cost of insurance premiums can usually
be offset against profits for tax purposes. I am sympathetic to the
intention behind this amendment although I am not sure that this Bill
is the right vehicle for this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000057">I
note that while this amendment refers specifically to flood cover,
buildings insurance includes protection against a range of perils
including, for example, fire and theft. Although there is no legal
requirement for property owners to take out insurance for their
properties in the UK, owner-occupiers and landlords generally choose to
do so in order to benefit from the financial protection that insurance
offers. In addition, and importantly, most mortgage lenders specify
buildings cover as a mandatory requirement for providing a mortgage on
a
property.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000058">The
Government agree that it is very sensible for landlords to take out
insurance, but are conscious that the decision is a matter of
individual choice, based on 
<?notus-xml column=622?>a commercial decision to protect an investment made
in property. We are concerned that making insurance compulsory across
the board could create a regulatory burden, which could deter
investment in the private rented sector. I strongly encourage tenants
always to check with a prospective landlord that appropriate cover is
provided for the property.</hs_para>

specifically on the issue of support for tenants in the event of a
flood, we appreciate the concerns raised recently by the National Flood
Forum and others that tenants of properties not covered by insurance
might be left homeless following a flood. I note that some insurance
policies have an “alternative accommodation” provision,
but I would also like to assure noble Lords that, even if this is not
the case, tenants do have protection. All local authorities are
required to provide accommodation for households who are eligible for
assistance, homeless through no fault of their own, and have a priority
need for accommodation—into which category flood victims would
clearly
fall.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000060">As part

all residential contents policies will be eligible for cover through

not in properties built after 2009 or in band H or their equivalents. I

Shipley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the two
contributions. I am reassured in part by the Minister’s reply.
This is about tenants who have an entitlement to know whether or not
they are in a high-risk area; indeed, we have already had discussions
today about how people find that out. Tenants in private residential
properties are often on low incomes, and it is reasonable that they
should be told formally if they are renting a property in a high-risk
area. That seems to be a basic entitlement if someone signs a lease. It
is right that they should know and be given a copy of the buildings
insurance with flood cover that the landlord has, so that if the
landlord does not have that then the tenant is aware of that
fact.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140211105000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0002.htm#140211105000062">The
amendment is not about contents insurance; I fully understand the law
in that respect. However, we need to be very careful if there is going
to be a rising incidence of flooding that means that some private
tenants find themselves flooded but do not have contents insurance
because they did not think they were in a high-risk area or were not
aware of it, or thought that the landlord would cover it even though
the landlord would not be responsible for their contents insurance.
With this amendment I am seeking better clarity, given that there have
been cases in recent months where flooding has occurred and tenants
have in practice had a cost to bear. Of course there are costs involved
in moving out that fall on the tenant, not the landlord, unless the
tenant is prepared to sue the landlord. They could do that but it is
very complicated for a private tenant to do.</hs_para>

amendment of my noble friend is a tad premature, given that we have not

am particularly concerned that the amendment has the potential to give

on some internal drainage boards and local authority rate payers. For
example, if rating lists to be used were revalued, this could have the
effect of increasing special levies on some unitary and district
authorities and in turn increase council tax in those areas. The
amendment also appears to provide for the creation of a two-tier system
whereby some internal drainage boards would continue to use existing
rating lists for the valuation of urban land while others would
potentially use a different measure where those rating lists are
unavailable. This could result in different levels of charge being
levied on local authorities in different parts of the country. It is
important that a transparent and consistent approach to calculating
internal drainage board levies and rates is applied across the

Bakewell of Hardington Mandeville (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the
three amendments in this group deal with a specific area of the Bill,
as we have heard: that surrounding the internal drainage boards. IDBs
are very local partnerships, including landowners, farmers and local
councillors, which work with the Environment Agency and Natural England
to draw up plans to keep ditches and rhynes clear so that water can
flow freely, thus minimising the impact of flooding. IDBs are well
respected by local residents and these residents should be consulted on
any impending changes to their local internal drainage
board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0003.htm#140211105000077">Farmers
and landowners themselves are supposed to keep their ditches and
streams clear for drainage, but this is not always done well. Those
with river frontage have the responsibilities of the riparian owner
inasmuch as they are responsible for the banks and clear flow of the
river on their side for the length that they own. In some cases, this
duty is not exercised and is sometimes ignored. A much stronger regime
of these duties must be enforced by the IDBs and councils. The IDBs are
responsible for the rhynes. There is a clear need for IDBs to be able
to access money to keep all these channels
open.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0003.htm#140211105000078">While I
understand the need to keep council tax down to a reasonable level, if
I were to ask the residents of the Somerset Levels whether they would
rather have paid a little more council tax which went directly to the
IDBs, or whether they wanted to take the risk of being underwater for
six weeks, I am not sure what that answer would have been. However, I
do not think that it would have been not to have paid more council
tax.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140211105000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0003.htm#140211105000079">IDBs
need to have the power to act and to act quickly for the benefit of
those in their communities. I am fully sympathetic to speeding up the
process for publication of requirements under the Land Drainage Act
1991. However, any proposals for amalgamation or reorganisation of IDBs
must be consulted on with those most affected. I agree that taking nine
to 12 months for such consultation is neither efficient nor
wise and I support reducing that time. I also understand that
provincial newspapers have limited circulation. However, it is often
the case that the local newspaper might be the only newspaper that some
households read. They read it because the articles and news have
relevance for them personally. These people will not be reading the
<I>London Gazette</I>, however strange your Lordships may find
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0003.htm#140211105000080">Everything
we see on our television screens, read in our newspapers and
hear on the radio indicates that these people who have been
flooded feel disempowered and disillusioned. It would unwise to do
anything in the Bill that might increase that feeling. It is essential
that local people are able to have a say in what happens to their IDBs
and, to do that, they need to be able to access the consultation when
it takes place. Reducing the time during which an advertisement may be
placed is reasonable, so long as it is advertised in locally accessible
media, and placed in libraries, schools or other public meeting places
as well as the local provincial newspapers. There is a financial cost
to this, of course, but that is small compared to the value of local
people feeling that they are being consulted. I beg to
move.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/65CD9CA9CDC5F95D7A91B3900B06425B7AC5B23F" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2014">Tuesday,

retaining all the powers that are already in place; this is just about

consider that the requirement for the internal drainage boards and the
Environment Agency to advertise a range of notices, procedures and
orders in newspapers is inflexible, out of date—given the range
of media now available—and often wasteful of public funds. We
are therefore introducing more flexibility to the advertising
arrangements. This is in line with recent legislation, such as the
Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 and the Flood and Water Management
Act 2010, which allows relevant authorities to publish documents

drainage boards have complained that advertising in local newspapers
can be costly and that, in some areas, it does not represent best value
for money in reaching out to the relevant communities. We also
understand that some local newspapers may not be widely distributed in
rural communities, or in some cases may no longer be published. Our
changes will allow for both a wider and a more targeted distribution of
notices. This could mean, for example, distribution through the use of
electronic means, parish notice boards or, in the way that she
indicated, school notice boards and so on, while retaining a fair, open
and inclusive process.</hs_para>

the extensive local knowledge and experience of internal drainage

Earl of Lytton:</Member></B> My Lords, I tabled this amendment
following discussions I had with the Country Land and Business
Association, of which I am a long-standing member. It relates to what
might be described as a legacy issue, to do with circumstances where
infrastructure in relation to flood defence or amelioration, which
currently might fall under the auspices of the Environment Agency,
might at some juncture, through the operation of this Bill, and the
redefinition of the Environment Agency’s functions, cease to be
maintained by a government
agency<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:59:31"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T20:59:31"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0003.htm#140211105000088">The
question is: what happens with this infrastructure? It has obviously
been put in there for the reason of protecting life and property, some
of which may be agricultural, and other residential or other property.
This amendment intends to probe what the Government’s intentions
are in the circumstances in which such a situation might occur. The
Minister may say that there is no question of the Environment Agency or
the state abandoning those things to an uncertain fate. However, they
might say, “It’s going to be down to local communities to
deal with it”—and then what? How are these
obligations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T21:00:24"></hs_TimeCode> to

behind this is that these works, whether they be ditches, dykes,
sluices, banks or whatever, are very often constructed under some
regulatory or other power by a local authority, possibly historically,
and have been maintained at all times since then. However, they sit
physically on the land of a private owner. The Country Land and
Business Association is concerned that if nothing happens to them and
they fall into some sort of dereliction, under the laws of nuisance
there might be a liability on the owner, purely by virtue of being an
owner, from some other third party who invokes the benefit and the
protection of those
works<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T21:01:17"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
the sum total of what this is about. The mechanism used here, which of
course it would not be appropriate to try to work out in detail in the

the responsibilities of the Environment Agency will be reduced, as well

<?notus-xml column=630?>committed to bringing together landowners and other affected parties to
make sure that they are clear on their respective roles and
responsibilities and that they understand the range of options
that may be available to them for future management of the assets and
their likely costs, benefits and impacts. This may include options for
continued maintenance of assets by local groups and options involving
less or no maintenance. The agency will then work with all the
interested parties to help them reach agreement on how the parties
involved will take forward maintenance of the asset in the future. It
is possible, for example, for the landowner on whose land a defence is
situated to enter into an agreement to secure contributions from his
neighbours towards the costs of maintenance and repairs.</hs_para>

understand the noble Earl’s concerns about whether these

the success of any future claims against the landowner.</hs_para>

noble Earl has suggested regulations should be drawn up to set out what
actions a landowner should take in order to meet any claims of
liability. This would not be the simple clarification that the noble
Earl might have been expecting. Such regulations would need to cover
many types of assets, the type of location, as well as a list of all
possible activities that might be appropriate for their maintenance.
The regulations would need to address the range of impacts of flooding,
ranging from a garden becoming waterlogged to flooding of many
buildings and possible loss of life. Most importantly, the regulations
would need to address such complications as a flood asset being owned
by one or more landowners or a number of different beneficiaries of
different means. Such regulations would be complex and, to be
proportionate, would need to have an element of subjectivity to what a
landowner would be required to do to avoid
liability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140211105000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-0003.htm#140211105000101">For<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T21:08:26"></hs_TimeCode>

avoiding the need for litigation between landowners. For these reasons

a probing one. I am grateful to the Minister for her explanation. I am
aware of the ongoing discussions and I appreciate that this matter sort
of sits outside the Bill. I suppose that if I have a hook to hang it
on, it is the situation where somebody might be protected by such works
and finds they are no longer protected and unable to get full cover
insurance. They then go looking for the next deep pocket in order to
press a claim, so the geometry of the circumstances might

Fen in south Cambridgeshire is a case in point, where conflict has been

The

and the caravan count in January of this year showed that there were
261 caravans on the Chesterton Fen Road site but, because very few of
the premises there are “buildings”, none of these is
connected to a main sewer and the owners have each had to make their
own arrangements for sewage disposal such as small package treatment
plants, cesspits and septic tanks leading to soakaways. The development
there is close to the River Cam and, because the development is dense
and low, there can be environmental problems. I am told that lagoons
close to the banks of the river can become less than sweet smelling at
all times of the

councillors petitioned Anglian Water in September 2007 to investigate
whether it had a duty to provide a mains sewerage connection but
Anglian Water turned the request down in 2009 and an appeal was lost in
June 2011. The judgment hinged on the number of properties in the area
for which the water company had a duty to provide this service under
the Act. In short, most of the Travellers’ caravans or day rooms
did not count, so although there are more than 250 caravan plots in the
area, only 30 duty properties—houses and a few substantial
mobile homes—were considered, and the economic argument was then
that it was cheaper for these 30 to provide cesspits for themselves
than to lay on a sewer. If all the caravans had counted as buildings,
there is no question but that the water authority would have had to
provide a sewer. After all, it is impossible to imagine permission
being given for an estate of 250 houses without access to sewerage
being part of that
permission<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T21:14:42"></hs_TimeCode>.

views unemployed potential reservists going off for extended periods,
in light of the requirement that they should sign on and apply for jobs

<?notus-xml column=230?>regular basis. Presumably we should be encouraging
the unemployed to consider reservist occupations; so the question of
how that fits in with the requirement to sign on for benefits is of

the Parliamentary Answer to which I referred indicate the importance of
small and medium-sized firms as a source of reservists. The additional
payment proposed over and above the current arrangements is, I believe,
£500 a month for each month in which a reservist is mobilised.
The question is: will that prove to be a sufficient incentive for
smaller firms, bearing in mind that the impact on them of one or more
of their employees being reservists, and away from the workplace for
periods of time, could be greater than for a large firm that has more
resources, both human and financial, at its
disposal to cover for employees away on

appreciate that we want to draw the attention of employers to the
benefits to them of their employees being reservists and the positive
impact that this can have on career development, but that may not

employee away on reserve duties; there are many small employers in the

provide<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:34:00"></hs_TimeCode>. A

Palmer of Childs Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I am not happy with
this amendment. Having listened to the explanation by the noble Lord,
Lord Rosser, I shall explain why. Small and medium-sized
enterprises—I was the director of one for many years—are
concerned not so much with the money but with replacing the person. The
noble Lord, Lord Rosser, touched upon that. I do not think that money
is the problem. Giving SMEs a bit more money does not solve the problem
that a key person in a very small organisation is not there. The
argument for larger payments to smaller companies will only annoy
larger companies which are the source of reservists—or
territorials, at the moment.</hs_para>

name of the noble Lords, Lord Rosser and Lord Tunnicliffe, also
mentions the self-employed. The idea of the self-employed going into
the reserves under the new arrangements is that they will receive
£500 a month, or whatever it is, to substitute for their
self-employed earnings. That is a decision that they would need to
make, and I hope they will make it positively; but the self-employed
person is not so much worried about the £500 per month
substitute for earnings from their customers or their clients as about
keeping their customers and their clients while they are away, and
money does not solve that.</hs_para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Ministry of Defence (Lord Astor
of Hever) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the Bill proposes granting the
Secretary of State a power, by regulations, to make payments to the
employers of reservists over and above those which may currently be
made. The current scheme allows employers to recover costs incurred in
covering the work of employees who are mobilised. Those costs may
include the hiring of temporary staff or the payment of

new power is intended to allow the Secretary of State some flexibility
as to the provision to be made in regulations made under it—for
example, as to which employers may receive a payment and which Reserve
Forces activities trigger entitlement to a payment. However, the
current intention is that the regulations will authorise the making of
payments only to employers in small and medium-sized enterprises whose
reservist employees are mobilised. The Secretary of State will be
required to consult various bodies before making the regulations,
including the Reserve Forces and cadet associations and a body
representing the interests of
employers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000015">I
welcome the noble Lord’s desire to recognise that while all
employers may feel some impact from the medium or long-term absence of

the greatest effects. We listened to employers during the Green Paper
consultation and seek to reflect this concern in the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000016">Amendment
17A would allow the regulations to make provision in such a way that
the sums payable could vary depending on the size of the
employer’s business. In particular, it would allow larger
payments to be made to small and medium-sized businesses and to
employers who are self-employed. The effect that this amendment seeks
to achieve is already achieved by new Section 84A, taken together with
the amendments made to Section 85(1) of the Reserve Forces Act 1996.
Sections 84A and 85(1) already give the Secretary of State the
flexibility to provide in the regulations so that the sums payable vary
depending on the size of the employer’s business. The current
intention is that the regulations will authorise the making of payments
to employers in SMEs only. This is because larger companies are more
likely to be able to absorb the costs and disruptions associated with
absences from work to undertake Reserve Forces
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000017">We
have not made provision for the making of payments to the self-employed
in respect of their own Reserve Forces activities, as such payments are
made in recognition of the impact placed on employers. The
self-employed reservist has elected to become a reservist and so
accepted the risk of being mobilised themselves. Were we to pay them,
we would, in effect, be handing the self-employed reservist a pay rise
of up to £500 per month when mobilised. I do not believe that
that would be a good use of taxpayers’ money, or would be well
received by those reservists who are not self-employed, or by
regulars.</hs_para>

highlight what current payments we make to both the reservist and their
employer when we mobilise a reservist. Reservists are entitled to claim
for a “reservist award” and to make an allowable expenses
claim. The reservist award consists of a salary top-up—a payment
made to reservists whose military salary, when called out for
operations, is less than their civilian earnings. Reservists can also
claim for benefits in kind—benefits that have been suspended or
withdrawn by their employers while the reservist is mobilised. The
benefits covered include, but are not limited to, health or medical
insurance, life insurance, accommodation, education fees for dependent
children and the loss of a company car used by the reservist’s
dependants. The resulting payment for all these elements of the
reservist’s award, taken together, is subject to an upper limit
or cap—less their service pay—of £548 per day, or
£822 per day for certain medical officers. When, in
connection with their mobilised service, a reservist chooses to remain
in his occupational pension scheme and continues to make his employee
pension payments, any contributions withdrawn by his employer will be
paid by the

allowable expenses claim consists of additional payments for the care
of a dependent child or relative, additional expenses for the care of a
pet, additional home insurance premiums and payments for the essential
maintenance of the reservist’s main residence and garden for
security purposes to ensure that the property looks lived-in. The

to claim certain costs related to the mobilisation of an employee. The
“employer’s award” consists of up to £110
per day—in other words, approximately £40,000 per
year—which is the amount by which the following
“replacement costs” incurred by the employer exceed the
reservist’s earnings. These replacement costs are limited to pay
for, if appropriate, the replacement of the reservist, and, if
relevant, any overtime payments to existing employees and an increase
in salary for an existing employee, as well as certain non-recurring or
one-off agency fees and advertising costs—VAT exclusive only,
where the employer’s business is registered for VAT purposes. An
employer may claim the cost of retraining a reservist on return to
work, where needed, for the reservist’s re-employment. There is
no provision for additional administration costs and the extra costs of
training an external replacement for the reservist or, indeed, one of
his colleagues now doing his work. The capped amount—that is,
£110 per day—is intended to represent the quantifiable
extra costs, above the reservist’s normal pay, of employing a
temporary replacement. The employer is not, of course, paying the
reservist during their
mobilisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000021">Depending<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:43:39"></hs_TimeCode>

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, during consideration of this
Bill in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State made a commitment
to introduce in this House a government amendment on Reserve Forces
that would reflect an amendment tabled by Julian Brazier and
37 other Members of Parliament. Amendment 18 is that
amendment, inserting a new clause into the Bill. It amends the Reserve
Forces Act 1996 to place reserve associations, also known as Reserve
Forces and cadets associations, under a statutory duty to report
annually 
<?notus-xml column=235?>to the Secretary of State for Defence on the state of the volunteer
Reserve Forces<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T15:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>.

associations are community-facing organisations which provide an
essential bridge between our Armed Forces and the civilian population.
An association exists for each of 13 administrative areas of the United
Kingdom. They provide advice and support on behalf of our volunteer
Reserve Forces and cadets, work with the chains of command of the Royal
Navy, the Army and the Royal Air Force and establish and maintain links
with the

new clause recognises the importance of the receipt of independent
reports from reserve associations to ensure programme success in
growing and revitalising the Reserve Forces. The reporting requirement
that the new clause introduces is working with the grain of what the
Government are already doing. It is based on the existing non-statutory
arrangement under which a scrutiny group, appointed by the Council of
Reserve Forces’ and Cadets’ Associations, reports
annually on the <I>Future Reserves 2020</I> programme and overall
health of the reserve forces.</hs_para>

whole force concept, the reserves will become an integral part of our
future force structure, charged with delivering vital capability for
the Armed Forces and providing resilience and reinforcement. However,
we must not forget the unique and distinct nature of our reserves. They
are civilians who have also elected to serve their country in uniform.
That tens of thousands have volunteered to serve their country as a
reservist, with some 25,000 serving in Iraq and Afghanistan in recent
years, is humbling, but also a true reminder of the volunteer and
community ethos across this nation, something of which we can be very
proud.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021171000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000033">In
revitalising the Reserve Forces, we have been careful to recognise, and
put in place measures to address, the extra challenges that reservists
face in balancing their military service with their civilian employment
and, in many cases, family responsibilities. That is why, when the
Government undertook to revitalise the Reserve Forces through the
<I>Future Reserves 2020</I> programme, we focused on measures to make
reserve service more attractive to reservists and their employers and
put in place support measures for the reservist and their
families.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021171000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000034">The
performance of defence as a whole is already subject to considerable
external scrutiny, be that by the National Audit Office or the House of

that the Ministry of Defence already provides a considerable amount of
information of its own volition. The quarterly personnel report
published in November 2013 gave the numbers of trained and untrained
reservists and movements into and out of the reserve population. The
next publication 
<?notus-xml column=236?>is scheduled for 13 February. On 19 December last year, the Secretary of
State also published the indicative target figures for the future
growth of the reserves in order to reach the identified trained

target.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000036">However,
as I have made clear, the reserves are unique and, because of that, and
the importance of the <I>Future Reserves 2020</I> programme success, it
is right that we should put in place a system for independent scrutiny
of the state of the reserves as a specific entity. The new section
which this new clause seeks to insert into the Reserve Forces Act 1996
requires an annual report to set out an assessment of the capabilities
of the volunteer Reserve Forces, having regard to the duties that may
be imposed on members of those forces, which include mobilised service
under a call-out
order.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000037">Reports
must, in particular, cover the effect of the following four matters on
the capabilities of the volunteer Reserve Forces: first, the recruiting
of members for the volunteer Reserve Forces; secondly, the retention of
members of those forces; thirdly, the provision of training for those
forces; and, fourthly, the upkeep of land and buildings for whose
management and maintenance the reserve associations are responsible.
Reports must also contain an assessment of the provision that is made
as regards the mental welfare of members and former members of the
volunteer Reserve Forces. This follows a further commitment made by the
Secretary of State in the House of
Commons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000038">This
brings me neatly to Amendment 18C. The Government are absolutely
committed to improving the mental health of serving and former members
of both the Regular Forces and Reserve Forces. Noble Lords will be
aware that my colleague, Dr Andrew Murrison, carried out a review of
mental health provision within the Armed Forces. We have worked closely
with the UK Department of Health, the NHS and third sector
organisations to implement the recommendations from his <I>Fighting

government
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000039">Defence
is already very open about the mental health of the Armed Forces
population and the provisions we make to address issues. A great deal
of this information is already published in the public domain. This
includes the covenant annual report, which contains a specific
healthcare chapter, and official defence statistics, such as those
pertaining to the Veterans and Reserves Mental Health Programme.
Defence is of course also engaged with and supports ongoing independent
research programmes in the health arena, which are publicly available.
For example, the King’s Centre for Military Health Research has
been commissioned to undertake a further phase of its longitudinal
cohort study, which includes
reservists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000040">The
Secretary of State made a commitment to bring forward an amendment in
this House to require reserve associations to report annually on the
state of the Reserve Forces. Recognising the importance of the issue of
mental health, he undertook to include mental welfare provision in the
list of matters that those annual reports must cover. Amendment 18
makes provision for this. Accordingly, I do not believe  that
subsection (1) of the new clause proposed in Amendment 18C
is necessary.</hs_para>

on mental health provision for serving and former members of the
Reserve Forces, it would not be practicable to produce meaningful
financial data. In part, this is because it would be difficult to
separate this cost from the cost of provision for regulars. Also, much
of the provision for serving and former reservists is provided by the
NHS at the local level, and extracting these financial data would be a
real
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000042">With

current process for those leaving the Armed Forces or the Reserve
Forces, when registering with their GP the veteran’s NHS record
will be sent to the GP with a letter included in it that will inform
the GP that they have been under the care of the Defence Medical
Services and detailing how the GP can get the full record. Work is
being carried out to further develop our systems in the future to allow
for a summary of in-service care to be included with the NHS record
when it is sent to the civilian GP. These proposed modifications will
in future ensure that the NHS GP knows that they are dealing with a
veteran and that the veteran is automatically given a copy of the full
Defence Medical Services medical history if they decide that they
require it.</hs_para>

Veterans and Reserves Mental Health Programme. That programme is open
to any current or former member of the UK volunteer reserve and regular
reserve who has been demobilised since 1 January 2003 following an
overseas operational deployment as a reservist and who believes that
the deployment may have adversely affected their mental health. Under
the programme, we liaise with the individual’s GP and offer a
mental health assessment. If diagnosed to have a combat-related mental
health condition, we then offer out-patient treatment via one of the
MoD’s departments of community mental health. If more acute

I believe that we are taking mental health seriously. We are working
with reservists, former reservists, the medical community and other
interested parties to ensure that everything that should be done is
being done. However, I of course will welcome the view of the Reserve

to Amendment 18F, the last amendment in this group, which seeks a
report on the cost-effectiveness and viability of the Future Reserves
2020 programme. I would like to remind the Committee why we are making
these changes. There are two strands to why we are doing
this.</hs_para>

strand is financial. Defence has a fixed resource envelope and it is
essential that we deliver the maximum capability from that resource
envelope. It is true that when deployed on operations, reserves can in
some cases be more expensive than Regular Forces. However, when held as
a contingency reserves are significantly cheaper: about one-fifth of
the cost. We pay for the whole cost of a regular whether they are
deployed on operations or not. As the Chief of the Defence Staff
commented recently:</hs_para>

is no appropriate allocation of the current defence budget that could
protect or sustain a larger regular Army and still realise the sort of
Armed Forces that we need for the security challenges of the future
… But a healthy and vibrant Reserve does give you cost-effective
resilience for enduring operations. And it offers … access to a
range of skills that defence struggles to sustain within its regular
structure”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="14021171000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000049">Retaining
capabilities that we no longer require in such numbers or readiness
adds cost to defence, as does retaining full-time personnel in roles
more suitable for reservists.</hs_parafo>

budget for the Future Reserves programme is the planned spend over the
life of the programme, to financial year 2021-22, and includes funding
for such items as additional recruiting, training and spending on
infrastructure and new equipment. It also includes provision for paid
leave and pension entitlements from 2015 for reservists. Across
financial years 2012-13 and 2013-14, we have so far spent about 10% of
the additional allocation. This money is over and above the core
funding that the single services already hold for their reserve
elements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000051">That
brings me to the second argument: that what we are doing is about
capability and getting the greatest effect from the available budget.
The nature of warfare is always evolving and defence must evolve to
meet those threats as determined by the national security strategy. The
strategic defence and security report then sets out how best to
allocate defence’s resources and capabilities to deal with the
threats that we face. We are drawing down in capability areas where the
SDSR process demonstrated that we no longer need regulars in such
numbers, such as heavy armour and artillery, and investing in new
capability areas such as cyber. In September, the Secretary of State
announced the creation of a cyber reserve unit. This is about not
simply replacing the regulars with the reserves but reconfiguring our
Armed Forces for the threats that they will have to meet on our
behalf.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021171000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000052">Under
the changes, the reserves will help us to draw from some advanced
skills that are better honed and maintained in partnership with the
civil sector, such as medical or cyber skills. The benefits to defence
from medical reservists are obvious: we utilise those skills and
capabilities when we need to—on operations—but when not
on operations that medic is employed in the NHS, building and
maintaining their medical skills. The NHS also gains by having staff
who have worked in world-class trauma hospitals such as that at Camp
Bastion, where 97% of those who enter for treatment come out alive, and
where cutting-edge and life-saving techniques from the battlefield are
now brought back for use in NHS hospitals. The changes we are making
will deliver the most defence capability for the money 
<?notus-xml column=239?>we have available. We could debate for hours whether defence should be
subjected to the finance cuts to which it is subject, but the fact is
that it is and defence will have to play its part in helping reduce the
deficit.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/4F04388CCE22583F4CF1C183EEFF4983F3E6537B" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2014">Tuesday,

do not want to rehearse for too long the issues around recruitment as
we will come to these in the next group. I acknowledge that there have

Reserve trained strength numbers had decreased in the last year by 130,

rather than decreases, I do not believe a drop of 0.6% is a calamity.
It was only in mid-September that the Army launched a new recruitment
campaign based on the new reserve proposition and the latest marketing
campaign began in early January. To date, the campaigns have generated
increased expressions of interest and applications to join the
reserves, but any intake from this campaign would not be reflected in
November’s quarterly personnel report publication. Indeed, the

January.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000056">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:06:08"></hs_TimeCode>

confident that we will meet our target. The increase to 35,000
reservists is not breaking entirely new ground. In the 1980s, the
Territorial Army was 75,000 strong, recruited from a smaller
population. Our main allies rely more heavily on reserves than we do.

Amendment 18 and my Amendments 18C and 18F have one thing in
common; namely, they all provide for reports of one form or another.
The Minister has explained the thinking behind the Government’s
amendment, which, as he said, has arisen from a commitment given when
the Bill was being considered in the other place. We have no issues 
<?notus-xml column=241?>with the Government’s Amendment 18. Our Amendment 18C calls on
the Secretary of State to publish annually an analysis of the mental
health provision for members and former members of the Reserve Forces
and to report on the annual spend on such services. On that latter
point, I note that the Minister said, in effect—I appreciate
these were not his exact words—that this information could not
be provided.</hs_para>

makes provision for the transfer of medical records belonging to former
members of the Reserve Forces to the National Health Service and for
the monitoring of the health needs of former members of the Reserve
Forces. Without such an arrangement working effectively, there is a
distinct possibility of reservists going to their GP and their full
medical history not being available. I appreciate what the Minister has
already said in that context, but the reason for putting down the
amendment with this requirement is because of claims that this is not
what happens on occasions.</hs_para>

is, if anything, even more of an issue for reservists than for members
of our Regular Forces as reservists after deployment go back into the
civilian world rather than back to their units and can undoubtedly feel
isolated on occasion. Hence the importance of the Ministry of Defence
and the National Health Service knowing where reservists can be
contacted and ensuring that they get the support they need.</hs_para>

2012 showed a significantly higher rate of common mental health
disorders and post-traumatic stress disorder among reservists, with the
incidence of other types of mental illness being greater than that of
PTSD, as it also is for regulars. The study also drew attention to the
fact that reservists have much more difficulty with post-deployment
social functioning and that such difficulties appear important not only
to mental health but to fitting back into the family.</hs_para>

expecting a greater and different kind of commitment from our reserves
and we need to ensure more than ever that the advances we have made
with the Regular Forces with regard to mental illness, to
which the Minister has already referred, are also achieved for our
Reserve Forces. Government Amendment 18 provides for the
annual report from reserve associations to include that
association’s assessment of the provision that is made regarding
the mental welfare of members and former members of the volunteer
Reserve Forces but, apart from the issue of the extent to which reserve
associations would be qualified to make such a full assessment, the
Government’s amendment does not lay any requirement on the
Secretary of State to make such an assessment or to address the issue
of the transfer of medical records.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Astor, in proposing Amendment 18, made
reference to the fact that the Reserve Forces of the future will look
very different from the Reserve Forces of the past, and that, by
design, is absolutely right. However, we have to remember why we have
deployed so many members of the Reserve Forces over the past 10 years.
Following the defence review of 1997-98 led by the noble Lord, Lord
Robertson of
P<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>ort Ellen, a
certain amount of work was allocated to the Army, Navy and Air Force.
In the case of our land forces, we would be involved in one
medium-scale ongoing operation and another medium-scale operation of
six months’ duration. As we all know perfectly well, from 2003
to the present date, and particularly in that very intense period from
about 2006 to 2009, we were committed to two
considerable-sized—I do not use the words “large”
or “medium” because the definition does not fit
either—operations in Iraq and Afghanistan concurrently, well
over and above the planning assumptions that were put in place in the
defence review of 1997-98. Therefore, it was inevitable that we were
going to have to draw heavily on our Reserve Forces in order just to be
able to do what we were going to do. It was not by design; it was by
consequence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:18:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consequences of the 2010 SDSR, we have decided to reduce
significantly—and I speak particularly in terms of the land
forces—the size of our Regular Army, and we are going to
compensate for that loss of capability by having a large reserve
training force. I understand that, and in theory I could see it
working, but I have two
concerns<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:18:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=243?><hs_para UID="14021171000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000075">First—I have to
choose my words carefully because I do not want to
appear more critical than I intend—I challenge the transparency
and perhaps honesty of some aspects of that policy. What the Ministry
of Defence has done in its very constrained cash situation is
effectively to move off balance sheet some of the liability of our land
forces and put them back in the Treasury. We will deploy large numbers
of these Reserve Forces only in a future considerable-sized operation
such as that of Iraq or Afghanistan of the past 10 years. It
is when we deploy those large numbers of reservists that they have to
be paid for. They are not going to be paid for by the Ministry of
Defence because they will come from the contingency fund held by the
Treasury. So the Ministry of Defence has solved a large chunk of its
problem but has not necessarily solved our national problem. I merely
raise question marks about whether we are being completely transparent
about its shift in
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:19:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000076">My
second concern, which we have already alluded to today, is to do with
the provision of mental health support. We know that reservists when
demobilised are in a more difficult situation than regulars when they
return from operations—the facts prove that—and therefore
we are taking measures to alleviate the potential situation that some
of the demobilised reservists will find themselves in. I question the
fundamental morality of taking a policy decision that we will use more
reservists on difficult deployed operations knowing that it will place
them in an adverse mental health position. I wonder whether that is
right<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:20:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I raise
those two points as underlying concerns, albeit these amendments, at
least in part, speak to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:20:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021171000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021171000077">My
third and final point, which has been mentioned already today by the
noble Lord, Lord Astor, is that we know we will have a gap between 2015
and 2017-18, the regulars having been reduced and our not being able,
according to current plans, to increase the number of reservists. As
recently as 2011 it was still government policy that we would not
reduce the Regular Forces until we had built up the reservists. We have
changed that policy and so we are accepting risk. That risk could be
reduced by slowing down the rundown of the Regular Forces at the
moment, but I presume that the Government would say that, looking
beyond Afghanistan, from the end of this year onwards they cannot see
the prospect of another major operation and so it is a risk worth
carrying<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:21:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

mentioned the issue of risk in the past and I simply point to this as
another risk that we are taking. We have Armed Forces that are less
capable than they were and, certainly in terms of our land forces, they
are smaller than they were, and we are willingly taking on additional
risk. I raise those three points as concerns about the underlying
policy, although I agree that Amendment 18C attends, at least in part,
to the mental health

Robertson of Port Ellen:</Member></B> I would like to say a few words
in relation to some of the more general issues concerned here. I return
to the question I asked about SDSR 2015 because it concerns me that we
might be going through exactly the same kind of exercise as we did for
the SDSR that was done previously in six months. I do not want to draw
any comparisons with the one that I supervised in 1998; it lasted a lot
longer than it should have. It still managed to do so but it was
affected by the circumstances which came after it, as the noble Lord,
Lord Dannatt, said. However, it did not become outdated as quickly as
the SDSR that the new Government brought in, which quickly came face to
face with the reality of Libya after it was put in place. It focused on
2020 but was then faced with the situation in Libya as well.</hs_para>

did in 1998 established a consensus. Perhaps for the first time in
military history, the review was accepted by all the defence chiefs
both in public, as one might have expected, and in private because it
represented a view that was consensual. After the new Government came
into place, we embarked upon a consultation exercise
that made sure that all the stakeholders had an
opportunity to express a view. The Ministers, Robin Cook and 
<?notus-xml column=245?>myself, and the Permanent Secretaries in the Ministry of Defence, the
Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department
for International Development did a roadshow that went round the
country, and which also embraced pretty much every stakeholder in the
business. When it came out, it was therefore a genuine security and
defence review.</hs_para>

SDSR was, essentially, that it was a Treasury-led exercise, done far
too quickly and involving far too few elements. I fear that that is
precisely what is happening at this stage. I have consulted the
Opposition to see whether anybody has bothered to ask them about the
initial preparation or any of the discussions taking place at present,
and the shadow Defence Secretary assures me that no such approaches
have been made. We look as though we are again getting ourselves into
the trap of something being prepared at or around the next election
campaign, which will essentially be based on a Treasury view about what
the country can afford and how the rest of it fits into
that.</hs_para>

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B><B> </B>My noble friend is saying
some important things but does he agree that if the Government are
serious about producing or drafting an SDSR, they ought at an early
stage to be consulting not merely with the list of people who he quite
rightly set out—the academics, think tanks and other
stakeholders in this country—but with our allies, particularly
the United States and our EU allies? If they do not consult them, the
review that comes out may be inconsistent with the strategic intentions
and plans of our key allies. Opportunities for fruitful collaboration
or for the division of labour will be lost and it may well be that
unfortunate misunderstandings will be sown.</hs_para>

Robertson of Port Ellen:</Member></B> Indeed, my noble friend makes an
extremely good point. In many ways, it goes without saying. It may well
be that there are some discussions going on with our allies and inside
NATO about it. I would hope so, although I am a bit pessimistic about
most of these things since it becomes opaque. Part of the dispiriting
nature of the way in which the British political system works is that
you go from everything to zero quickly, as my noble friend will know
only too well from being in government. In government, you know
everything and then when you are in opposition you are allowed access
to pretty much nothing at all. Therefore, having been Secretary-General
of NATO and knowing everything that was going on inside that
organisation, it was a grim experience to then dredge the newspapers
and the occasional website to try to find out what was actually going
on. The point that is being made is that the widest possible
consultation is required, so that, at the end of the day, the review is
fixed, has traction and makes sense in the light of the international
circumstances as well as of domestic public opinion. Without that, it
will fall apart, and fall apart quite quickly.</hs_para>

to the issue of the reserves. During my time in NATO, I spent an
unhealthy amount of time lecturing some of our allies on depending on
reserve forces—in particular those countries that depend on 
<?notus-xml column=246?>conscripts. Gradually, over the years, they got the message. For
example, the last three Defence Ministers in Germany have stopped
responding to the preaching from NATO about the uselessness of their
conscript forces, and have actually done something about
professionalising their Armed Forces. There is something profoundly
wrong with a situation where, of the some 2.5 million people in uniform
in European Armed Forces, only 2%, at the moment, can be deployed
outside of national boundaries. In both Iraq and in Afghanistan, we
found the limitations that that places upon our Armed Forces. In many
ways, the problem that we are faced with today and the reliance that we
have on existing Reserve Forces, is that reserves are particularly
unsuited for some combat situations. We have used them only in
emergency or in desperation—whereas the conscript forces of some
of the countries still inside NATO cannot be deployed at all, and are
not even very good at back-filling.</hs_para>

true that we are planning to use more reserves than in the past. As I
said, we are trying to build up our niche skill supply of cyber and

equipped, trained and paid, with pensions, and be given the same
equipment as the regulars. I am trying to organise a day out for noble
Lords who are interested in this subject to a reserve unit close to
London that is paired with a regular unit. Noble 
<?notus-xml column=247?>Lords and noble and gallant Lords will be able to talk with the reserves

an NHS GP will know that they are dealing with a veteran and

about cost and viability. This is a tier 1 programme that will be
subject to the usual scrutiny by Her Majesty’s Treasury on cost.

Dannatt, asked whether payment for a large number of reserves was
transparent. We have been clear that we are reducing the regulars and
investing in the reserves. It is true that large-scale use of the
reserves could fall to the Treasury reserve; the noble Lord is correct
on that. He asked whether there was a draw-down gap. It is a risk, but
a manageable one. We cannot retain the Regular Forces on the scale of
today on the existing budget. We have to make the best use of our
resources, and the reserves allow us to do that.</hs_para>

place reserves in greater front- line roles? The reserves have

Davies of Stamford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords,
the Minister made a full and comprehensive speech under Amendment 18.
It was a very good speech and set off a kind of Second Reading debate,
which was quite interesting. I broadly agree with him. As he knows, I
utterly deprecate the reduction in our Regular Forces and our equipment
capability, which this Government have brought in, but it is even more
vital in that light that we make a success of our campaign to recruit
more reservists and to train and equip them properly. Nobody on this
side of the House in any way disagrees with the Government in that
respect or does not want to do everything possible to make sure that
that effort is a
success<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:40:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000020">However,
I want to make one comment. There is a lack of clarity and frankness
still about how we are planning to deploy our reserves under the new
system. I am very glad that the Minister did not say, although I have
heard it—and, evidently, from his speech the noble Lord, Lord
Dannatt, has also
heard<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:40:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:40:41"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>—from
government Ministers in the past few years that, “We’re
reducing the regulars but we’re compensating by increasing the
reserves”. That would be utterly irresponsible. There is no
doubt at all that in certain areas such as those the Minister
mentioned, including medics and signals experts, reservists may well
play the majority part in future combat operations. But when it comes
to the infantry it is extremely difficult—with the best will in
the world and with motivation and discipline and morale being entirely
equivalent, which is the most that one can hope for—to train up
reservists to exactly the same
level<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:41:19"></hs_TimeCode> of
confidence and alertness that the regulars have. It is therefore very
difficult to avoid feeling that, if you deploy large numbers of
reservists on combat operations, you will not have a higher casualty
rate, which would be very
irresponsible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000021">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:42:29"></hs_TimeCode>

successfully deployed on an embedded basis individuals who
have been chosen for that in Iraq and Iran, with front-line troops
going on patrol and so forth and fighting intensive warfare. The
Government need to be clear about this because reservists need to know
whether under the new regime they still have a chance of that kind of
experience. As I have said to the Minister privately, if they do not
you may not succeed in attracting the same calibre of people into the
reserves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:42:11"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
other hand, with the numbers going in both directions—the
decline in the regulars and increase in the reserves—it is not
going to be possible to deploy large numbers of reservists, because the
success of employing them on an embedded basis depends on selecting
individuals and making sure that the number of reservists is relatively
small in relation to the regulars, who are committed to a particular
intensive
operation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:42:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000022">I
want the Government to be absolutely clear about this. There should be
no beating about the bush at all. It is perfectly respectable to say
that those with medical and signal skills will not be needed the whole
time on a contingency basis in the regular forces but we will need to
draw on them—and, in any case, we need those people to be able
to exercise their own professional activities and gain skills in the
civilian sector when they are not being deployed on operations, so they
will be deployed on the front line, as they have been up to now. We
have to be absolutely clear about our intentions for reservists, and it
is really that they should not be 
<?notus-xml column=249?>deployed in high-intensity warfare. When the Minister
said—slightly vaguely, I thought, avoiding this
issue—that they would be in supporting roles,
which essentially means that they would be behind
the wire rather than outside it. We should be clear about that, but it
is probably the right solution in all the circumstances. We need
clarity, and we have not had it on that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:43:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000023">Apart
from that, I agreed very much with the Minister’s speech, which
I thought was good. This Bill is rightly generous—I do not
complain about that—to employers and reservists in the financial
incentives and protections that it sets out. However, my reason for
speaking on this clause is that I am slightly worried. This is not a
vastly or historically momentous point—far from it—and it
is not one on which I have put an amendment down, although I suppose I
could table one at Report, if needed.</hs_para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T17:14:34"></hs_TimeCode> object of

anomaly, which rightly would be closed by the proposed new clause, that
you can sack people with impunity at the present time within two years
of employment. It is right to close the loophole and I am glad that the
Government are doing so. I am very much in favour of the proposed new
clause but Clause 47(4) provides that the clause will come
into force only when the Secretary of State has declared that Parts 1,
2 and 3 of this Bill—or Act, as it will then be on Royal
Assent—have come into force. That is contained in Clause 49(1).
Th<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:46:13"></hs_TimeCode>is means that
there may be some delay between Royal Assent to the Bill and when this
provision, this protection, comes into force. As we all know, Parts 1,
2 and 3 provide for the Secretary of State to make a number of
regulations. All these regulations, in different fields, will require
consultation and take time, and the bureaucracy will spend a long time
drafting them, as it always does. During that period, any less than
fully benign employer will see that he has an opportunity, if he wishes
to do so, to get rid of any employees within two years of their

reservists take it as a matter of enormous professional pride—it
is a thing they really want—when their regular colleagues forget
that they are reservists. That does happen. You hear that from both
sides. That is a tremendously high standard to achieve. People go into
the Reserve Forces because they are prepared to put themselves through
the hell of training up to that level and to risk their lives when they
are deployed. That is the military experience they want. If they are

Rosser:</Member></B> I almost feel as if I am once again moving an
amendment after the debate on it has already taken place. Amendment 18A
provides for the Secretary of State to publish quarterly recruitment
figures and trained strength numbers for Reserve Forces against
adjusted quarterly targets. I certainly do not wish to speak at any
great length on this amendment but, as has already been said, there has
been a significant change in approach by the Government to the role of
the reserves since the increase in reserve strength was first announced
alongside further reductions in the size of our Regular Forces. At that
time, the previous Secretary of State made it clear that the reduction
in the size of the Regular Forces would take place only as and when the
reserves had been increased.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14021178000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000036">That is not now the
Government’s stance, which has changed to saying that the
reduction in the size of the Regular Forces and the Army, in
particular, is not dependent on first delivering the increase in the
size of our Reserve Forces. However, the increase in the size of our
Reserve Forces must be for a purpose and, presumably, if we do not
achieve the target that has been set within the period set, the
capability of our Armed Forces as a whole will be less than it would
otherwise have been. If that is not the case, it begs the question of
why we are increasing the strength of our reserves.</hs_para>

our Reserve Forces will have an even more important role to play in the
future, the question of whether recruitment targets will be achieved is
a matter of some importance. Last autumn, there were reports in the
press of the Army failing to attract and recruit sufficient Army
Reserve personnel, and as a result it was claimed that the Army faced
an increased risk to its structure and operational capability. If we
are falling behind in recruitment, it may take time to recover lost
ground since it is not simply a case of recruiting people. The people
recruited have to be trained before they can become fully effective
members of the reserves, and that takes time.</hs_para>

ensuring the overall effectiveness of our Armed Forces and thus about
our nation’s security. Our reserves are not simply something
that is nice to have if people can be recruited; they will have an
important and enhanced role to play in the future as part of our
overall Armed Forces strength. In view of that, it does not seem
unreasonable to provide in  
<?notus-xml column=252?>this Bill for not only the current Secretary of State but future
Secretaries of State to publish the figure that
will enable us all to know whether the targets for increasing the size
of the our reserves are being achieved and thus that the future
intended capability of our Armed Forces is being delivered in full. The
fact that this information will have to be published may also help
concentrate the minds of all those directly concerned in ensuring that
targets set prove to be targets achieved. I beg to
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000039"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-11T16:54:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Astor of Hever" PimsId="3811" UID="14021178000149" xid="1721" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000149">Lord
Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, reserves have always made an
essential contribution to national security and that contribution is
set to increase, with exciting opportunities being offered not just for
individuals but for formed units. Reserves will be an integrated part
of the whole force required for almost all operations, both at home and
abroad. To do this, we are growing our reserves to 34,900 across all
three services by 2018 and investing an additional £1.8 billion
over 10 years. The Army will grow its reserves to a trained strength of
30,000, the Royal Air Force to 1,800 and the Royal Navy to 3,100. This
is a challenging target but one that we are committed to
achieving.</hs_para>

challenging, but the planned overall numbers of trained reservists are
well within historic levels. In 1997, the Territorial Army was more
than 50,000 strong; it was reduced to around 40,000 by 2000 and, by
2009, it was down to just 26,000. We now have about 19,090 trained
reserves. We should not be surprised if growth is neither uniform nor
smooth. Given the time that it takes to train reservists, trained
strength improvement will lag behind recruitment. Reservists will be an
integral and integrated part of the whole force alongside their regular
counterparts. The Committee will no doubt be aware that, recognising
the interest in the progress of reserves recruitment, the MoD publishes
the trained and untrained strength data for the reserves quarterly. The
last figures were released on 14 November and the next set of data is
due to be released in the next few days. I am sure that noble Lords
would agree that, with such a commitment, there is no need to enact
legislation.</hs_para>

a significant number of surge activities alongside recruit partnering
projects to boost reserve recruiting and grow the reserve force. The
initial response to the new recruiting campaign is encouraging and a
number of new initiatives have been introduced. These include the
revised medical process, introduced in January, and the new online
application forms introduced this month. Both these new major
initiatives will simplify the process and are aimed at improving the
candidates’ journey into and through the application process. I
must point out that the programme is still in its early stages. The
White Paper was published only in July, and it is true there have been
some administrative issues in the process. However, we are working with
Capita and the senior Army leadership actively to address these issues.
I believe that we can work them through. Adjustments have been made to
the application process to ensure that we can continue to progress new
recruits. Marketing campaigns based on the new White Paper proposition
have just got under way; the latest marketing campaign for the reserves
started in early January.</hs_para>

stabilised its numbers and is working to ensure the retention of
trained personnel already in the reserve and reduce wastage during the
training programme by tailoring the training methods to better suit the
reservist experience. Although there is a slight reduction in the Royal
Auxiliary Air Force’s trained strength, the number in training
is the highest since April 2012. The force looks likely to meet its
end-of-year target and is seeking authority to allocate extra resources
to marketing in order to improve further its recruitment rate.
Recruiting activity itself is better co-ordinated across the three
services than in the past; this should ensure a much more joined-up
approach to recruiting. The new recruiting campaigns are delivered at a
regional level, following planning and guidance from a national level.
We are working hard to deliver the message through internal
communications within other government departments that the reserves
are recruiting and to demonstrate that the Civil Service is taking the
lead in the public sector.</hs_para>

Army started a major recruitment campaign on 16 September. The latest
reserves marketing campaign began in January this year. While it is too
early to be definitive, the early indications from this campaign are
encouraging. The length of time that it takes applicants to progress

time for the actual impact to become realised, but we are confident
that we will begin to deliver the required numbers of recruits to reach

have learnt their lessons from experience. It is very difficult to turn
the recruiting tap back on having switched it off. Maintaining inflow
is essential to maintain future operational capability and, given the

Rosser:</Member></B> Amendment 18B seeks to amend the Equality Act 2010
to prevent discrimination against reservists in employment and in
seeking employment by adding membership of the Reserve Forces to the
list of protected characteristics under the Act. The potential concerns
are fairly obvious and, if they materialised, would constitute a
serious impediment to people joining the reserves or remaining in
them.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14021178000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000057">A
clause in the Bill refers to the qualifying period of employment for
unfair dismissal related to an employee’s membership of a
reserve force, so there is obviously recognition that being unfairly
penalised or discriminated against for this reason is a real
possibility. That discrimination could also take place when being
considered for a job, since some prospective employers might take the
view that they did not wish to recruit someone purely or largely
because they would be away from their job for periods of time to fulfil
their commitments as a member of the reserves. Discrimination could
also take place against someone in the reserves already working for the
company in question, since membership of the reserves and being away
from the job for a period as a result might be the sole or major factor
in denying them promotion to a higher-level post. The purpose of this
amendment is to reduce the likelihood of this happening but it will
also give the Government, through the Minister, the opportunity to
place on the record how they intend to address the potential problems
that I have identified if they feel unable to accept the
amendment.</hs_para>

support recruitment to and retention in our reserves by ensuring that a
reservist is entitled to be permitted by his or her employer 
to take time off during their working hours in order  to
undertake training activities connected to the reserve force, subject
to the provisions laid down in the amendment, and if that does not
happen to be able to present a complaint to an employment tribunal. It
will be no help in encouraging recruitment or assisting retention if
there are doubts about whether leave for training activities during
working hours will be given by the reservist’s employer or,
indeed, if it is to be given only grudgingly. Once again, if the
Government feel unable to accept this amendment, I hope that the
Minister will be able to indicate how they see the concerns I have
raised being addressed and satisfactorily resolved from the point of

testimony to what I spoke about earlier—the complete commitment
on this side of the Committee to try to ensure that we successfully
recruit and train the projected number of reservists. It would be
intolerable if people who had signed up to fight for their country were
subject in some way to discrimination in the employment and labour

regarded as utterly intolerable. My noble friend’s amendment is

point. I think that I am right—the Minister will know the
details—in saying that similar protections are available to
members of the National Guard in the United States. We all know that
the National Guard is extremely successful at recruiting and that it
has enormous public support, including among employers, so I do not see
any difficulty of the kind suggested by the noble Baroness whereby
employers might reasonably resent such a provision. We all know that
the National Guard in the United States plays a key role in the defence
capability of that nation and is regularly deployed on operations. We

Astor of Hever:</Member></B> My Lords, we recognise and value the
contribution of reservists and need to be sure that their interests are
properly protected. Part of this is making sure that their reserve
service does not negatively affect their employment prospects. That is
why Clause 47 amends the Employment Rights Act 1996 to
remove the current two-year qualifying period for claims of unfair
dismissal where the reason for dismissal is, or is primarily because,
the individual is a reservist.</hs_para>

protection is already in place to ensure that reservists are not
dismissed as a result of any duties or liabilities that they have to
undertake, for example as a result of being mobilised. This protection
is provided by the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985,
Section 1 of which gives a reservist who is called out for reserve
service the right to apply to his or her former employer to be
reinstated after they return from mobilised service. In addition,
Section 17 of the 1985 Act makes it a criminal offence for an employer
to dismiss an employee solely or mainly by reason of any duties or
liabilities that may arise as a result of being called out.</hs_para>

White Paper was to foster an open and honest relationship with
employers. Employers of reservists make a greater contribution to
national security than others. We understand and value the commitment
that employers make. We have seen from some of the evidence
submitted—I am thinking particularly of that from the
Confederation of British Industry—that employers are wary of the
introduction of discrimination-type legislation, and that such an
approach would run counter to the partnership approach that is needed
between employers and defence. CBI members were particularly concerned
that such an approach could strain working relationships between
employers and reservists.</hs_para>

partnership approach we will: provide employers with greater awareness
and predictability of training and mobilisation commitments; streamline
the administrative arrangements to receive financial assistance when a
reservist is mobilised; introduce additional financial incentive
payments to micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; and provide
appropriate recognition of the contribution that these employers make
by enhancing our existing recognition
schemes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000067">Subsection
(1) of the proposed new clause in Amendment 18B would mean that Section
39(4) of the Equality Act 2010 would apply “as if
membership” of the Reserve Forces “were a protected
characteristic”. Surely, membership either is or is not a
protected characteristic. The advice from the Government Equalities
Office is that being a reservist would not count as a protected
characteristic as defined in the 2010 Act—in other words, age,
disability, gender reassignment, marriage and civil partnership,
pregnancy and maternity, race, religion or belief, and sex or sexual
orientation.</hs_para>

occasional calls for various characteristics to be given protected
status, particularly during the preparations for the Equality Act.
These were mostly in relation to some form of physical appearance,
ranging from extremes in individuals’ height and weight to the
way in which people may choose to dress. However, after full
consideration, the list of protected characteristics was set as already
outlined. Including reserves as a protected characteristic in the
Equality Act would be a disproportionate tool to tackle the problem and
could give rise to the same argument being deployed successfully in
relation to a number of the physical characteristics that I mentioned.
This could have the result of doubling the number of characteristics,
which would have an increased on-cost to businesses, public authorities
and the

to subsection (2) of the new clause proposed in Amendment 18B,
individuals with protected characteristics do not need to declare these

their reserve status in an application form, and this seems to work
well for both individuals and employers.</hs_para>

when in employment reservists must inform their employers of their
reserve service, except for where a security waiver—for
instance, for Northern Ireland and special forces—has been
approved by the chain of command. Despite this, many reservists have
been unwilling to tell their employer of their reserve status and so
claim to be unemployed or do not provide accurate employer details to
their chain of command. The chain of command is also obliged to write
to employers informing them of their reservist employees.</hs_para>

We hope that all employers

that this amendment envisages. However, the amendment, if carried,

of the key strands of the White Paper was to foster an open and honest
relationship with employers. The amendment would run counter to the
partnering approach that is needed between employers and defence and
could make employers more reluctant to employ reservists because of the
increased legislative burden that such an amendment would impose on
them. As part of this partnering approach, we will provide employers
with greater awareness and predictability of training and mobilisation
commitments. The White Paper gives an undertaking to ensure that
employers are informed about their reservists, subject to security
requirements.</hs_para>

White Paper also committed to notify employers of their
reservists’ training plans each year. The Civil Service is
setting an example by offering a minimum of 10 days’ additional
special paid leave each year for reserve training. We invite other
public and private sector employers to follow its lead on a voluntary
basis, without the need for additional legislation.</hs_para>

is worth highlighting that reserve service will benefit different
employers in different ways. For some, the improved skills, experience
and training of the individual reservist will be beneficial. For
others, where the reservist’s military role is close to their
civilian one, there will be more benefit from transferable skills. We
hope that the benefits that reserve service can bring to an employer
will outweigh any difficulties in allowing a reservist time off for
their
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000078">In
conclusion, it would be wrong to penalise good employers because of bad
employers, and this amendment would do just that. We want to encourage
employers to allow reservists time off for training rather than force
them to do so by introducing further legislation. A survey by the
Federation of Small Businesses of its members in December 2012 and
January 2013 found that almost 40% of small businesses would consider
employing a reservist in the future and that 7% currently employ or
have previously employed a reservist. Making it more onerous for
employers to employ reservists could have the perverse effect of
encouraging employers to seek means to avoid employing
reservists.</hs_para>

we are meeting, or will meet in the near future, the intent of
subsections (3) and (4) of the new clause proposed in Amendment 18B.

the intent of Amendment 18D is laudable, I have tried to outline the

We should bear in mind that any employers’
organisation—like any other trade association or representative
body—is always likely, when a new idea is put to it, to adopt a
defensive, cautious position and focus on the difficulties. Good
government surely does not consist of abandoning a good idea at the
first hurdle. Has the MoD explored the experience of the National Guard
in this context in the United States and, if so, could the Minister let
us know the conclusions of that
study?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Astor of Hever" PimsId="3811" UID="14021178000157" xid="1721" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000157">Lord

Act 2003 so that physical or verbal assault upon a member of the
Reserve Forces or a member of their family would be classed as an
aggravating feature of the crime and should be reflected in the
sentence handed down where the prosecution could establish that service
in the Reserve Forces was the motive for the assault. We know from
surveys of Armed Forces personnel that physical and verbal assaults on
them motivated simply by the fact that they are service personnel run
at a surprisingly high rate. On a much more severe scale, we have had a
recent example of a member of our Armed Forces being murdered on our
streets simply because he was a member of our Armed
Forces.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000088">Attacks
on service personnel, whether physical or verbal, are totally
unacceptable, do nothing to assist recruitment and retention, and run
contrary to the esteem in which members of our Armed Forces are held by
the overwhelming majority of the population, who recognise that they
are willing to put their lives on the line in defence of our
country’s people and interests. We need to do as much as we can
to reduce the incidence of assaults, particularly at a time when we are
seeking to recruit substantial additional numbers into our reserves. I
say once again that if the Government do not believe that this
amendment is the best way to achieve that objective, I hope that the
Minister will indicate in his reply whether they regard the issue that
I have raised as a real problem and, if so, what courses of action they
are taking or intend to take to address it. I beg to

subsection (7) in the amendment. Has there been any
experience that “service person” has not been taken to
include the people mentioned here? It seems a rather worthy thing to
protect people even more and make sure that they are included in the

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, when in  2007 I
chaired the national inquiry into the national recognition of the Armed
Forces, this was one  of the recommendations that we made. We
made 40 recommendations, 38 of which, including Armed Forces
Day, automatic parades for units returning from combat missions and so
forth, were accepted. Two were not, and this was one of them. The other
one was having an officer of the Armed Forces 
<?notus-xml column=262?>permanently available in the House of Commons, probably in the
Library, to inform people about any military
matters that they might have questions about. In that report, to which
I refer the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, we cited a number of cases of
grievous assaults perpetrated on members of the Armed Forces, and I am
afraid that the problem has not gone away. Over the past six years or
so, there have been other incidents which the Committee will know
about. I retain my support for this amendment.</hs_para>

feature but I think I know the explanation. It is that the protection
seems to be designed merely for members of the Reserve Forces but does
not currently exist for members of the Regular Forces. I imagine that
it is because including all members of the Armed Forces could have been
outside the scope of the Bill. I therefore imagine that my noble
friend, with whom I have not discussed this matter, had this in mind as
a probing amendment to try to push the way forward to achieve what we
really need, which is the kind of legal protection for all members of
the Armed Forces—all those who wear the Queen’s
uniform—who are prepared to lay down their lives for the rest of
us. The least we can do is to make sure that they do not suffer
discrimination or, in this case, violence, potentially, when they are
in their home
country.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-11?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_11_PT_1/3987BA5D6E3FBB81AEDAF0282785D4233026E493" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 11 February 2014">Tuesday,

these incidents have happened, but do we need legislation such as this

Davies of Stamford:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not know that I should
get into the habit of answering questions across the Floor. I would
love to be a Minister again but that has not happened to me so far. I
shall have to wait a bit longer. However, I shall of course respond to
the noble Lord. There are the normal legal protections against assault
from which he and I and every other citizen benefit. Clearly, it is a
criminal offence. However, the purpose of this amendment, as I
understand my noble friend, is to make it an exacerbating factor if the
reason for the assault is that the victim is a member of the Armed
Forces. That provides a special protection for those who might
otherwise be especially vulnerable to this kind of attack. It is
similar to the exacerbating factor that we already have of the motive,
or part of the motive, for an assault being racial. We introduced that
for a section of the community whose members might be innocent victims
of gratuitous attacks which otherwise would not occur. Therefore, there
is a complete analogy there and I think it was the analogy which,
rightly, inspired my noble friend—if I may be so bold as to
presume to answer for him—to conceive this

behaviour 
<?notus-xml column=263?>towards the men and women who have committed themselves to defending
this country, its people and its way of life, and to making sacrifices

many forms. Some of it is thoughtless or uninformed—for example,
when public services fail to take account of the special circumstances
in which Armed Forces personnel find themselves. Some of it is based on
myth and prejudice—a view that soldiers create trouble or are
unreliable customers is a misperception that we must challenge.
However, some discrimination or abuse stems from genuine hostility to
members of the Armed Forces, motivated by politics or perhaps by some
unfortunate personal experience. It is on that narrow part of the
spectrum that this amendment
focuses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021178000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-gc0001.htm#14021178000096">The

Government’s view is that there is no need for a change in the
law on these lines. The courts already have a wide power in sentencing
to take into account factors that make conduct more serious. Criminal
acts based on irrational hostility to a person because he or she is in
the Reserve Forces may lead to a higher sentence in any event. I am not
aware of any evidence of courts finding that they have insufficient
powers to give an appropriate sentence to an offender in such
circumstances, or that we have received representations from the courts
asking us to amend the law in this way.</hs_para>

the flexibility that the courts currently have into a mandatory
requirement, as the amendment proposes, may present practical
difficulties. For example, demonstrating to a court that the
aggravating factor was present and should be taken into consideration 
<?notus-xml column=264?>could be relatively straightforward in some cases, such as where a
victim was in uniform, but far from straightforward in other cases,
such as those in which the victim was a relative of a member of the
Reserve Forces. How are the courts to deal with a situation where an
offence is motivated by excessive rivalry between different sections of
the Armed Forces or, perhaps, a domestic dispute? A mandatory
requirement for a higher sentence reduces the court’s ability to
take a sensible, common-sense approach to what is really going on in
the circumstances it is examining.</hs_para>

difference between offences provoked by hostility to the work of the
victim and offences motivated by prejudice against inherent
characteristics, such as homophobic crime. Section 146 of
the 2003 Act is designed to help to change deep-rooted prejudices. It
would be quite wrong to suggest that such provisions were necessary in
relation to the Armed Forces. However, the most telling argument
against this amendment is the views of the intended beneficiaries. I am
not aware of any general desire in the Armed Forces community for
legislation of this type. The service men and women who wear their
uniforms with pride want to be respected in and considered part of
their communities, and rightly so. We should not put them in a position
where they are forced to explain why they require protection in law in
a way not enjoyed by, for example, firemen or ambulance staff. Indeed,
the amendment deals only with members of the Reserve Forces, as the
noble Lord pointed out. It would not extend to members of the Regular
Forces, meaning that rather than helping create the whole force which
we seek the amendment would separate out members of the Reserve Forces
for different treatment in law. I am not sure whether they would wish
to see that in this context.</hs_para>

the Government are complacent about discrimination against service
personnel: quite the opposite. The Armed Forces covenant has a high
profile across the whole of Whitehall and beyond. The first principle,
that members of the Armed Forces community should not suffer
disadvantage as a result of that membership, has given rise to many
initiatives which are making a real, practical difference. In the first
statutory annual report on the Armed Forces covenant, published in
December 2012, we described what we were doing to make these principles
a reality. We are working to remove the disadvantage that the children
of service personnel can face in the schools system as a result of
their mobility through the admissions code and the service pupil
premium. We are ensuring that service personnel and leavers encounter a
level playing field in access to social housing or Government-funded
home ownership schemes.</hs_para>

are working to build the links between the Armed Forces community and
the wider community to improve the knowledge and understanding that
must be at the centre of that relationship. From knowledge flows the
esteem for our service men and women that is ultimately the most
powerful way to counter discrimination. The community covenant has now
been signed in nearly 400 local authority areas, from Cornwall to the
north of Scotland, and around 60 companies have signed up to the new
corporate covenant, signifying a real determination to strengthen 
<?notus-xml column=265?>ties with the Armed Forces. I am confident that it will continue to gain
further support. The grant scheme linked to the community covenant has
allowed us to back a range of schemes that will help to put these
declarations into practice. To that, we can now add the £35
million fund created as a result of the LIBOR fines, which will support
charities with projects to help the Armed Forces and their
families.</hs_para>

Schedule 7 to the Government of Wales Act 2006 includes an exception to
the National Assembly’s competence in relation to
‘anti-social behaviour orders’. As a result, an amendment
to Schedule 7 to that Act is necessary to ensure the exception's
continuing operation following the reforms made in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021170000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-wms0001.htm#14021170000005">In line
with the devolution settlement, this amendment should have the same
scope as the current exception. Criminal justice is not devolved to the
Assembly but the exception is necessary to make clear that in
legislating about social welfare or any other transferred subject, the
Assembly does not have the competence to make provision for orders
equivalent to those first created by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.
As this Bill abolishes these orders and repeals the relevant sections
of the 1998 Act (amongst other things) an amendment to the exception
was also necessary as a consequence. The amendment maintains the
existing scope by relating only to orders that deal with the kinds of
behaviour that could have been restricted under the existing regime and
which we would reasonably regard as part of the criminal justice
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14021170000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-wms0001.htm#14021170000006">In the
Government's evidence to the Silk Commission in March this year, we
highlighted that there was some confusion as to how the current
exception should be interpreted. Since submitting that evidence, we
have concluded that the exception should be interpreted narrowly, to
mean the subject matter of orders under the Crime and Disorder Act
1998. The amendment is designed to reflect that
conclusion.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Statement"><hs_DebateHeading UID="14021170000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140211-wms0001.htm#14021170000021">Energy:

expressed concern to the Government of the Dominican Republic over the
potential impact of the Constitutional Court ruling on many people of
foreign, primarily Haitian, descent living in the Dominican Republic.
Although people of Haitian descent affected by the ruling may have a
right to Haitian nationality, the challenges of exercising that right
could create a situation in which they may be considered, de facto,
stateless. We therefore welcome President Medina’s commitment to
finding a ‘human solution’ that will avoid situations of
statelessness, including through the introduction of a naturalisation
law for those affected by the ruling. We continue to follow the
situation closely and are engaging with the Dominican government
through our Embassy in Santo

The EU is currently supporting water and sanitation programmes in Gaza
and discussions are ongoing regarding the construction of a
desalination plant, the viability of which will be determined by a
sustainable power supply. The UK recently agreed to

If donors choose to seek professional advice then they may pay legal
fees in addition to the £110 registration fee. OPG has no
