Russian carrier Admiral Kuznetsov passed through the UK’s area
of interest, en route to the Mediterranean, between 28 December 2013
and 10 January 2014. The carrier task group had openly declared its
planned deployment on social media sites. Its progress was monitored

before it commenced routine flying
operations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402035000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#1402035000024">Once
it became apparent that the task group was indeed likely to enter the
UK’s area of interest, HMS Defender, as the fleet ready escort
ship, was ordered to sail from Portsmouth to meet and escort the group
through the UK’s area of interest. This was
several days before the task group’s arrival to the north of
Scotland. The Russian task group operated in international waters off
the coast of Scotland and followed international protocols to arrange
their flying exercises. Their contact with HMS Defender was highly
professional and cordial
throughout.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402035000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#1402035000025">I

Gray:</Member></B> We are wholeheartedly relieved to hear that the
episode passed off so peacefully and so cordially, and that the
relations between the Kuznetsov and HMS Defender remain as strong as
they are. Does the Secretary of State not agree in looking to the
future—given that 48 ships have gone through the North sea
shipping route to the far east this year, and that there is increasing
fishing and increasing drilling for oil and minerals in the
Arctic—that it is terribly important for our armed services to
have first-class relations with those of Russia? I hope that this

relations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402035000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#1402035000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Philip Hammond" PimsId="3733" UID="1402035000264" xid="251" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#1402035000264">Mr

that we have very cordial relationships with the Russians and good
working relationships with the Russian armed forces, but we should not
lose sight of the fact that we cannot be confident that our strategic
interests will always align with those of Russia. We should therefore
engage and work together with them when we can, but, frankly, we should

off the Scottish coast was the second time in two years that this has
happened, yet the Royal Navy does not have a single frigate or
destroyer based in Scotland for such eventualities. Last week, the
Ministry of Defence confirmed that the fleet ready escort has been
gapped for 37 days in recent years. Why has there been a gap to the

frankly. We do not need a frigate stationed in Scottish waters; we need
good intelligence about the intentions of vessels approaching the
UK’s area of interest, and we have that good intelligence. He
talks about the number of frigates and destroyers available. He might
like to tell the House how many frigates and destroyers his Scottish

which has occurred for 37 days in the past five years. During that
period, there was no specific vessel designated as the fleet ready

could be provided, including the possibility that it could be provided
through the use of unmanned aerial systems. It is a bit rich for him to

am always considering, because I know of the representations from the
Forces Pension Society and the War Widows’ Association of Great
Britain. The difficulty is that this is not within our gift; it is a
matter for the Treasury. The very important point to make is that if
this is done for the armed forces, others will come forward.
Presumably, that is why the previous Government did not do it. One
could imagine that the widows and widowers of police officers and fire

is increasing. For instance, I believe that we now have about 30 female
colonels serving in the British Army, but the increase is still not as
fast as we would wish. Therefore, although we are now seeing the best
and brightest of our people recognised and promoted irrespective of
gender, we are working to address the under-representation of certain
demographic groups, including women. To cite an example that
illustrates our commitment, I am delighted that the Ministry of Defence
will be hosting an event on 12 March, in conjunction with other
Government Departments, to celebrate and support international

Munich, which I have made before in the House, is—I think most
Members would agree—that the mood of the public after 10 years

€6.4 million, while the figures for the functional

Met Office figures show that Somerset received more rainfall in
December and January than it would normally receive over an entire

exacerbated the situation by preventing water from flowing out to sea,
resulting in rivers overtopping their banks and flooding the
surrounding land. Floodwater has covered more than 65 sq km on the
levels and hundreds of people have been affected with about 21
properties still flooded. Some 200 people have been cut off in the
villages of Muchelney, Thorney, Oath, Stathe and North Moor. I visited

we have put arrangements in place to ensure that the local transport
needs of the cut-off communities are met. The Environment Agency,
Somerset county council and local responders under the leadership of
the local gold command are working together and have a presence on the
ground. I am grateful to those who have assisted with that—for
example, the Red Cross provided a vehicle to deliver heavy goods and
food and local fire and rescue services provided a ferry service. We
have also considered how the military could be used to help on the
ground and they remain on standby if
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T15:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402035000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#1402035000185">Secondly,
sewage and wastewater services are not available in some areas. Support
has been provided to affected properties and all necessary mitigation
measures have been put in place to guard against any public health
risks of contaminated floodwater. As is normal practice, floodwater has
been sampled by the local authority since the incident began and advice
is being given regularly by the local authorities. I urge everyone in
the affected area to heed the clear advice of Public Health England.
Since the beginning of last December, the UK as a whole has experienced
a period of exceptionally unsettled weather and there is no sign at
present of its abating. Many parts of the country have been subjected
to flooding from the sea, rivers, surface water or ground water, and I
am extremely grateful for the excellent response by the emergency
services, the Environment Agency, and Flood Forecasting Centre staff,
and the leadership shown by many local authorities in responding to the
floods.</hs_Para>

criteria are not applicable in an environment where the rivers are, in
effect, canals. We need to treat it as a unique environment and

the Environment Agency doing the dredging, and then, for future years,

by saying something that several in the House might find mildly
surprising in the context of this debate: regulation is often sensible
and necessary. It is no part of the Government’s plans or our
view of life to suggest that regulation is never useful. Indeed, like
previous Governments, this Government are presiding over an immense
amount of regulation, much of which is constructive and helpful.
Nevertheless, it remains true that what we inherited in 2010 was not
just a rational set of regulations that anybody who looked at them
carefully would have sponsored. There were all sorts of regulations
that, frankly, made no sense at all. What we set out to do in 2010 was
to review the entire regulatory scene. We have put in an enormous
amount of effort, and I am immensely grateful to those in the civil
service and outside who have helped us.</hs_Para>

we have gone through regulation after regulation, we have in many
instances discovered that there are things being regulated that no
longer exist. There are regulators doing things that no longer have any
useful purpose, and bodies that are provided for in regulations that no
longer function. We have also found that there are things being
regulated that do exist, and for which regulations are still operative,
but on which such regulation ought not to exist. I suspect that dealing
with such matters would be uncontroversial among hon. Members, and I
shall give the House two minor, slightly amusing, examples.</hs_Para>

inspection, it turned out that every time the Mayor of London or a
borough of London wanted to set up a statue to any grand figure of our
past, they had to seek, under a regulation, the specific approval of
the Secretary of State. That is clearly completely mad, so I am glad to
say that the Bill will remove that particular amusement. A second
example—it is a particular favourite of mine, as it has taken a
very long time to get this changed—is that until we manage to
get the Bill enacted so that clause 40 becomes law, I regret to tell
the House that it remains the case that it is an offence to sell
liqueur chocolates to under 16s. I can sort of see why someone had the
crazy idea to legislate for that at some point, but it does not make

He is absolutely right, and I am not talking of a few cases. We came
across—and we continue to come across—many, many cases on
which, given our way, we would certainly have deregulated, yet we found
that directives made it impossible for us to do what we would have
liked to have done. That is, of course, one of the reasons why, if
there is a Conservative Government after the next general election, we
will be seeking to renegotiate our relationship with the EU and
then—as long as the Opposition do not prevent
this—putting that to the British public in a referendum. It is
also one of the reasons why we are trying to pass the referendum Bill
right now, and we will bring it back and do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:18:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

twice balanced by things that we have removed from the statute

set the scene, the Bill is just one small part of the process. The red

constraint holds back the stream, while the red tape challenge removes
water from the lake behind the dam. In addition, and just as
importantly, we have spent an enormous amount of time and energy
focusing on enforcement, because it is not just a matter of what
regulations or indeed statutory guidance are in place, but a matter of
how things are enforced. We have been taking considerable steps to
ensure that the agencies responsible for regulation enforce in a way
that is much more conscious of the needs of our businesses.</hs_Para>

layering further domestic obligations on top of international or EU
obligations. My right hon. Friend has a pretty long and distinguished
record of involvement in this area, so let me give him an example from
the Bill. Clause 59 provides for “ambulatory references”
in international maritime regulation. We took the approach that the law
of the sea is basically formed by international agreements, and that
there is every reason for our regulation not to add to that, nor even
to qualify or interpret it, but rather simply to refer to it so that
every shipping company and captain of a vessel knows that it is the
international agreements that apply to them. That has the advantage
that we can be sure that our regulation is aligned with international
regulation, which tends to induce shipping to come to this country, and
it also simplifies the statute book. That is the kind of shift that we
are trying to achieve in many

Letwin:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend, the Chairman of
the Select Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, for raising that
issue, which is indeed important. It was a late entrant, in the sense
that it was no part of the intention of clause 47 to have the effect
that some of the media organisations are worried about. Those
organisations have been worried that the clause would obviate the need
for both parties to be in court when a court orders what is called a
production order, which typically requires, for example, a bank to
produce the accounts of a person accused of a particular malfeasance,
where those accounts are relevant to the trial.</hs_Para>

the case that the media are concerned about, a production order would
be used to ask a media organisation to produce some piece of
information it holds. Those media organisations were worried that they
would no longer have the guarantee of their day in court to contest
such a production order, because the effect of clause 47 would be to
replace the need for the existence of primary legislation governing
inter partes rules with the criminal procedure rules committee. The
media were afraid that the criminal procedure rules committee might in
some way weaken the inter partes rules. I have good news for my hon.
Friend and his Committee, and 
<?notus-xml column=40?>indeed for the media organisations—which, incidentally, I have
offered to meet later in the week or next week. As it was no part of
the intention of clause 47 to do that, we are now looking for ways
specifically to exempt journalism and all such media items from the
clause. If I may, I would like to discuss with him and his Committee
the precise drafting of that change, so that we can be sure that the
media organisations themselves and the Select Committee are content
with the changes we

not to this House. Unlike in most areas of the Bill, where I am
absolutely behind the Government, this is an area where some of the
rules are constitutionally quite important—we have just heard
one example. There might be a number of other areas, which have not
come up so quickly, where we would not want to undermine our

Letwin:</Member></B> My right hon. Friend, who obviously has an
immensely distinguished record of concern for civil
liberties—which he and I have both fought for in various ways
over the years—is right to draw attention to the significance of
clause 47. One of the things I have asked officials to look at today is
the possibility of going out to a further consultation on clause 47, to
see whether anyone else comes forward. In point of fact, because the
draft Bill went through pre-legislative scrutiny—there was a
Joint Committee of both Houses looking at it, and so on—it had a
good airing. It is probable, therefore, that other people would have
come forward already if they had concerns, but I do not want to take
the risk. I think it would be sensible to have further consultation, to
see whether we elicit any responses from others who might be
concerned. If in the course of that my right hon. Friend discovers any
other bodies that are concerned, or any groups of people who might or
should be concerned, my door is open to him to have discussions about
that.</hs_Para>

one further thing about the background before
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:34:09"></hs_TimeCode>coming to some
of the other, most important clauses in the Bill. There is a strange
state of affairs in our country, which is that although a great part of
the regulation that governs us is either in directives and then UK
legislation or in UK legislation, including statutory instruments as
well as primary legislation, a great part of the regulation that de
facto affects our businesses is not in any such place, but in the vast
reams of statutory guidance.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020325000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#14020325000042"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>These
are enormous items. I certainly cannot claim to have read the totality
of any major area of statutory guidance, because it would be impossible
for one person to embark on such a task with any hope of success if
that person was carrying out any serious set of ministerial duties.
Some of those items of guidance are tens of thousands of pages long. We
have therefore undertaken a massive programme of spring cleaning: for
instance, we are hoping to achieve an 85% reduction in the sheer volume
of health and safety guidance and
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:35:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#14020325000043">That
does not, of course, necessarily equate to a reduction in the burden of
the substance of the guidance. What it does is make it possible for
people, for the first 
<?notus-xml column=41?>time, to be clear about what the wretched stuff is trying to do. My
experience in dealing with this morass of over-verbose, under-specific
and often extraordinarily badly phrased guidance is that the people who
are responsible for enforcing it often do not really know what is in
it. We are trying to reach a point at which we do know what is in it,
and at that point we shall be able to judge whether it needs to be
adjusted. That is another important part of our activity, which is not
included in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:36:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0001.htm#14020325000044">Let

clause 1, about two thirds of the people in the country who are
self-employed will no longer be covered by the Health and Safety at

they are covered by the Act. The one third who will continue to be so
covered are those who engage in high-risk activities, which will be
specified and which will be precisely the activities that the House
would expect to be covered, such as the activities of the nuclear,

Friend said that the clause would affect self-employed people. Will it
also affect people who work for themselves through their own limited
companies? I understand why it will not apply to those with employees,

my<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:37:53"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Deputy Leader of the House, who will be leading the charge,
will give it some thought. The clause is certainly intended to cover
people who do not have employees, and I do not think that the example
given by my hon. Friend involves employees. The intent is there,

5 is a good illustration of the way in which the Bill can have positive
social effects. At present, disabled driving instructors are in the
absurd position of having to have special cars and having to undergo
special tests, even when they do not have a disability that in any way
affects their capacity to deal with emergencies or other driving
problems. The Bill will create a sensible regime under which people
will be forced to be tested only if there is reason to suppose that
such a special test is necessary.</hs_Para>

permit individuals to do the unloading unless those individuals

9 is one of my favourites because it has taken us about two and a half
years to get to this. We would have thought it was fairly
straightforward. It turned out not to be. This is about knitting yarn.
I do not know whether there is anybody in the House who feels
passionately that knitting yarn really should be sold only in
quantities of grams—perhaps the movers of the amendment feel
passionately about that. I personally do not share that passion. It

clause<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:45:11"></hs_TimeCode> 43 sums
up the whole Bill, in my view. It deals with the exhibition of films in
village halls. I am talking not about movies involving ghastly violence
and huge amounts of sexual activity, which are classed as X-rated. As
we can see from the clause, film certificates will continue to apply.
At the moment, however, if someone wants to show a Charlie Chaplin
film, they have to obtain a licence. That is astonishing, and there is
not the slightest reason for it. I know that Opposition Members have no
concern with village halls or village life, but perhaps they will
recognise that this is also happening in community halls throughout the
urban centres of our country. It would be nice if people could show
films in those places without a licence, and I am glad to say that
liberty will reign in this respect and that clause 43 will enable that
to happen.</hs_Para>

fair to say that the overall reaction to the Bill has been
underwhelming—lukewarm at best. Ministers are delighted with it,
but reading the Bill, I realised that that is because it seems to be
about removing burdens as much on Ministers as on business. By my
count, half the proposals in the Bill will take away burdens from
Ministers and the Government, while less than half will remove them
from business. This is more doublespeak: deregulation is apparently
about deregulating Whitehall, not small business. For some reason, that
reminds me of the Localism Act 2011, which has somehow resulted in
hundreds of powers being localised in
Whitehall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000123">That<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:17:52"></hs_TimeCode>

does not take rights away; the Bill seeks only better to define them.
Clause 1, for example, exempts from health and safety law self-employed
people whose work activities pose no risk of harm to others, which is a
measure supported by the British Chambers of Commerce and the
Federation of Small Businesses. Clause 2 frees employers from the
threat of wider recommendations from employment tribunals, thus
de-risking the employment process and making jobs more likely to be
created in the first place. If we can spread the Bill’s positive
vision of deregulatory reform to our neighbours in Europe and the
global economy, we will be pulling down barriers to people’s
dreams and clearing road blocks to our constituents’ ambitions,

this House declines to give a Second Reading to the Deregulation Bill
because, whilst acknowledging that removing unnecessary burdens on
small businesses is welcome, the Bill fails to recognise the social,
economic and environmental benefits of effective regulation and
contains a number of extremely damaging proposals including: the
watering down of safety protections for employees that will leave
workers at greater risk of injury, ill-health and abuse; the erosion of
protection of journalistic sources and against police seizure of
journalistic material, which threatens the basis of the free press; and
the imposition of a growth duty on non-economic regulators such as
Natural England and the Health and Safety Executive, which is
irresponsible and risks undermining their core roles; further considers
that this Bill is another illustration of a Government which is
embarking on a deregulatory path without due consideration of warnings,
including from businesses, that effective regulation is essential to
create jobs and innovation and that ripping up vital green legislation
risks locking the UK into polluting industrial processes for decades to
come, jeopardising future competitiveness, damaging the UK’s
attractiveness for green investment, and undermining new industries;
and further believes that this Bill represents a race to the bottom and
an obsession with GDP growth at any cost which is not in the public
interest.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:35:05"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="14020325000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000165"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>I
tabled this reasoned amendment because I believe that the Bill should
not be given a Second Reading. I listened to the Minister
characterising those of us who have signed the amendment as somehow
being of the far left. If that is the case, that category would have to

did not table this reasoned amendment without giving consideration to
those parts of the Bill that are welcome and uncontroversial.
Certainly, some parts of the Bill are completely fine. For example, it
is cold homes week and many MPs and charities are working hard to
highlight fuel poverty in cold homes. Scarves are a symbol of the
campaign and people have been knitting away in the past few weeks to
draw attention to the need to tackle fuel poverty. I am sure that
nobody would object to the clauses in the Bill that would remove
restrictions on the selling of knitting yarn. They will allow small and
large businesses engaged in the selling of yarn better to meet their
customers’ needs. Other provisions are similarly sensible, such
as those that would facilitate the recording of public rights of way,
and I give them my full support. Removing genuinely defunct legislation
from the statute book also makes

worry is that the basis of the Bill is incredibly simplistic and crude:
in the Government’s mind more regulation is bad and less
regulation is good, without ever questioning the kind of regulation. Is
it smart regulation? What is the purpose of the regulation? Will it
actually generate more development? Will it incentivise industry? Will
it provide industry with the level playing ground it often asks for?
Instead of this nuanced approach, we have a complete knee-jerk reaction
that says, “Regulation is bad, deregulation is good” and
proceeds in a simple
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:37:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000168">I

some specific provisions—I will outline just a few. Secondly, I
want to talk about the fundamentally flawed premise on which the Bill
is based: 
<?notus-xml column=57?>it fails to recognise that some regulation can be good for business and
job creation, as well as for consumers. Thirdly, I will say a few words
about the new growth duty on non-economic regulators, which I fear will
interfere with, and impinge on, their ability independently to carry
out crucial roles, including: the Care Quality Commission protecting
public health; Natural England protecting our environment; the Health
and Safety Executive protecting employees and others from harm at work;
or the Equality and Human Rights Commission challenging discrimination
and protecting human rights. This growth duty is just the latest
manifestation of an obsession with short-term GDP growth at any cost,
and that is simply not in the public interest.</hs_Para>

I will focus on just a few of the harmful provisions that I think
Ministers are trying to ram through in the name of deregulation. The
Bill narrows the application of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act
1974, following the 2011 Löfstedt review. The Bill effectively
exempts self-employed people from health and safety law where their
activities do not put another person at risk. On the surface, one could
ask what could be wrong with that. The problem is that the changes in
the Bill are completely unnecessary, because the only time the 1974 Act
can be used is when a person does put another person at risk. No
self-employed person has ever been prosecuted or threatened with
prosecution for risking just their own health. Right now, the law is
straightforward and it works. The Bill will create not only confusion,
but complacency.</hs_Para>

us not forget that the fatality, injury and ill-health rate for the
self-employed is already much higher than that for other sectors. Some
of the more dangerous industries, such as agriculture and construction,
have a high proportion of self-employed people working in them. There
is an obvious risk that people who control the workplace where
self-employed people work may think, wrongly, that they do not need to
be as concerned about fulfilling their duty of care to the
self-employed. The TUC has made this point clear, as have the majority
of respondents to the HSE consultation, who rejected the very option we

especially welcome the Bill’s proposal for a duty for growth. I
think it fair to say that my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has
transformed Britain so that it is once more a nation that prides itself
on trade, growth and entrepreneurship. Exports are up again, and
businesses are growing and benefiting from the fiscal and regulatory
changes on which the Government have rightly focused. It is about time
that we repealed legislation that is no longer of any practical use,
and started to recreate an even playing field for competition, business
start-ups and entrepreneurship. That is why the Bill is so
important.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley) and the
Ministers have pointed out, the Bill is one part of the
Government’s ongoing deregulation agenda. It sits alongside the
red tape challenge and what was formerly known as the one in, one out
rule, which is well known in Government circles. I want to highlight
some key aspects of the Bill, particularly those relating to
business<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:57:07"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T17:57:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000205"><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="14020325000456" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000456"><B>Guy

succinctly put it, creating jobs and giving people employment are
central to our long-term economic 
<?notus-xml column=63?>plan, and to a sustainable strengthening of our
future economy. The Bill will not only help those who are employed, but
will help people to secure employment, which is why deregulation is so

specific aspects of the Bill, but may I ask her a question before she
does so? Those of us who believe in free markets and the power of
entrepreneurs to achieve great change want the Government to do as much
as they possibly can to get unnecessary regulation out of the way.
Given her experience on the Committee that considered the draft
legislation, can she assure the House that the Government have gone as
far as they possibly could in this Bill to get rid of such

Patel:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right to ask that question. The
Government have, of course, gone incredibly far. They inherited an
appalling number of regulations from the last Government, and they are
now doing exactly the right thing. They are making good progress, and
setting the right direction of travel. We need to support them in that,
because British business in particular depends on the changes that we

Patel:</Member></B> I think that there is a correlation between what we
have heard so far today and some of the Committee’s debates. The
Committee was particularly well informed, because the draft Bill had
been published some time earlier, and because we received many
submissions, about which I shall say more shortly. What we have heard
from Opposition Members this afternoon in decrying this Bill is a
reminder to the House and the nation of their illiterate economic
approach and why so much in the past has gone wrong in relation to
regulation and lack of support for businesses in
particular.</hs_ParaIndent>

support for this Bill is absolutely fundamental. It is about jobs,

the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley) talked about the swamp of
regulation. That is exactly it. We have to move on; we have to drain
the swamp and get rid of the burden of regulation across every level
that affects SMEs, whether that involves local authorities, county
councils or health and safety bodies. These are the barriers we have to

how we can transform the way public bodies, including Whitehall,
function. Our new growth duty is an important step in changing that
mindset. This is a real message going out saying, “The status
quo is not enough any more.” For us to be competitive as a

general principles and look at the bodies that regulate. The last

increasing the burden on business, and that did nothing to stop the
increase in youth unemployment and nothing to stop this country racking
up massive amounts of debt and the stagnation in wages. Is she sure
that under this Government we can really get deregulating? Have we done
enough to get rid of some of the bodies the last Government put in

bodies in particular. In the public bodies legislation we went a long
way to reshaping that landscape. I am sure there is more to do,

mentioned that a vast number of my constituents are employed by SMEs.
Interestingly, there is a diverse range of businesses in my
constituency. Many of them come under the category of self-employment,
but they too come across aspects of health and safety regulation in

supportive of scrapping the rules for self-employed workers, whose
activities pose no harm, and of changing the landscape in that regard.

I have spoken in many business forums over the past three years. For
small businesses in particular one fact sticks out: under the last

the burden of which was equivalent to £17 billion per annum.
That is the cost of Crossrail. These are the types of costs and burdens
we have to lift from small businesses, and this Government are going
further than any British Government have gone in reducing the burden of
regulation and cutting red tape. This is all about boosting business

want to touch briefly on an emotive group of clauses: clauses 13 to 19
on the use of land. This topic came up when my right hon. Friend the
Minister for Government Policy opened the debate, and specifically the
question of rights of way. This is a very sensitive area. It is right
that this Bill provides a mechanism to allow landowners to extinguish
redundant rights of way on their land where it is appropriate to do so.
I have to say we received a great deal of evidence on this
issue—that may even be an understatement, as we really did
receive a lot of evidence. A lot of work is still taking place and
dialogue is going on with the stakeholder working group. There is a
long history here, with so many examples where local authorities and
landowners have not been able to find the right kind of outcomes and 
<?notus-xml column=66?>resolutions. The Bill reduces the burdens on local
authorities that arise from their having to consider many detailed
applications for modifications. There are so many sensitivities and so
many people and communities to please in different ways. This Bill has
thus far approached this issue in the right
way.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:10:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000225">Clause<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T16:53:48"></hs_TimeCode>
37 relates to education. We have spoken extensively today about
business, jobs, growth and young people. Our young people start off in
schools, and the clause rightly acknowledges that head teachers are the
best placed to know what is right for their schools. We are empowering
them not only to improve standards but to do the right thing in
relation to teaching, to discipline and to having control of their
budgets. We need to get rid of many of the over-zealous regulatory
burdens that have hindered them in the past. Our schools are there for
all the right reasons, to provide the necessary educational standards
for our young people to leave school with good qualifications that will
enable them to enter the employment market.</hs_Para>

on the Joint Committee was an education for me. It gave me great
insight into the extent of the existing regulation in Whitehall, and
into how easy it has been to create it. There has undoubtedly been a
culture in which creating regulations and burdens seemed like the right
thing to do, but this Government are now doing the right thing by

Walley</B> (Stoke-on-Trent North) (Lab):</Member> Having sat on the
Joint Committee on the draft Deregulation Bill,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:11:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Witham (Priti Patel) has far more experience than me. The Bill
proposes the abolition of many regulations, and it is important that
the House should take a close look at all the evidence given to the
Committee.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14020325000228" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000228"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:12:21"></hs_TimeCode>My
stance is that sound regulation is essential for a well-functioning
market economy, and that deregulation also has a place in those
arrangements. I have no time for dinosaur-like regulations that have
finished doing their job. For example, I am happy to see that clause 9
will get rid of regulations relating to the sale of knitting yarn.
There are many more detailed regulations that should no longer be on
the statute book, because they are not helping business or providing
the level playing field that it needs.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:13:02"></hs_TimeCode>I do not want to
see costly or unnecessary burdens on businesses. It is in all our
interests to have regulations that are fit for purpose, that are
properly enforced and that are properly understood by the general
public and by those responsible for complying with
them.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:13:26"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

also have to recognise, however, that regulation can be for the public
good. <hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>The Bill
contains a great deal of detail that needs to be understood. The
Chartered Institute of Environmental Health has raised the matter of
clause 8 with me, pointing out that if a consolidated list of
authorised fuels is to be published, those fuels need to be registered
under their original names rather than their brand names. That is one
example of the detailed points that need to be examined, and I have no
objection to that happening.</hs_Para>

regulations have come about as a result of lengthy campaigns to get
them on to the statute book, often by people who have been involved in
some kind of 
<?notus-xml column=67?>dreadful catastrophe. Those people simply wanted to
prevent what happened to them or their loved ones from happening to
anyone else. Those regulations can involve important aspects of health
and safety and of well-being. Clause 26 deals with the removal of the
duty to order the re-hearing of marine accident investigations. The
Government are proposing that the Secretary of State should simply have
a discretionary power in this regard. They might think that that will
be sufficient, but I ask them to consider the case of the MV
Derbyshire. We should not forget how many years of campaigning it took
for the hearing of that case to be reopened. We need to be careful
before we press the delete button for certain regulations; we need to
be very clear about what we are doing.</hs_Para>

insufficient regard to the Government’s avowed intention to be
the “greenest Government ever”. The Cabinet Office is
meant to be the all-knowing, all-seeing hub of joined-up, cross-cutting
government, but there is no sense that it used an informed,
evidence-based approach in building this latest bonfire of red tape. I

biggest objection to the Bill is the duty to achieve economic growth as

Letwin) said earlier about that. He did not give the House any clear
examples of any environmental appraisals that had taken place during
the drafting of the Bill. The clauses appear to be a blatant
attack on sustainable development, and they have nothing to do with
deregulation. They are about something completely different.</hs_Para>

Joint Committee on which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:17:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Witham served. Insufficient regard seems to have been given to
environmental appraisal throughout the clauses, and I wonder how the
Government can square clause 61 with guidance from their own Natural

that?</hs_Para>

also replace the duty to achieve economic growth with a duty to achieve
sustainable development.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:17:53"></hs_TimeCode>I am conscious
of the fact that, when the Government got rid of the Sustainable
Development Commission, they appointed the Cabinet Office as the hub

should be included in the Bill.</hs_Para>

what the coalition Government say, they cannot advocate sustainable
development if they go ahead with pure economic growth without any
reference to it. Sustainable development is a force for good,

nature’s toes in the pursuit of immediate growth, leading to
longer-term, costly and possibly irreparable ecological

have two other points to make outside of clauses 61 and 65. The Bill
proposes to remove the commitment to promote sustainable communities
from general local government responsibilities and to reduce the
requirement to consult generally over local government initiatives. We
have already heard from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:22:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) about the importance of
consultation and the links with the Aarhus convention. The measure
could lead to any proposal from local government being about only
economic growth, ignoring environmental and social considerations. We
agree to that at our peril, and I hope that it will be examined closely
in Committee. The misfit in relation to sustainable development also
appears in the proposal to lower or even to remove any obligation on
local governments to cut down on carbon-based energy use and to reduce
or to remove the scope of micro-generation. Those are valuable planks
in the shoring up of the low-carbon future for local living, striking
at the heart of the recent advice of the Committee on Climate
Change.</hs_Para>

Environmental Audit Committee, in its report on carbon budgets, found
that the Government’s voluntary approach to securing local
emissions reductions was insufficient. We recommended that local
authorities should set emissions reductions targets with progress
reports to Ministers each year. Not surprisingly, the 
<?notus-xml column=69?>Government disagreed with that, but they did
commission the Committee on Climate Change to provide advice. The
CCC’s advice was to strengthen incentives for local authorities
to act. It recommended that a statutory duty be placed on them to draw
up low-carbon plans to include a high level of ambition for emissions
reductions and increased funding to go with it. That advice has not
been
recognised<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T18:23:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000243" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000243">In
conclusion, the Government should reconsider their position on
sustainable development in Committee. They should consider how, as it
currently stands, the Bill will undermine regulators such as Natural
England, and they should think again about how local councils can be
supported to build sustainable commitments and reduce carbon emissions.
I will leave it at that as my voice is just about to give
way.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="14020325000353" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000353">6.24

the case that the coalition Government have achieved a lot. I was going

wrong: of course, Essex is not the only place where small businesses
thrive. Gloucestershire is another place—more precisely Stroud
valleys and vale. Wherever I go in my constituency, small businesses
are concerned about the perceived or actual burden of regulation, so
they need that succour that encourages them to think that there is a
way through and a way forward. Many of the specific issues that I

about the removal under clause 26 of the duty to order a rehearing of a

duty on the Secretary of State to reopen marine accident investigations
in the light of new evidence, but that duty will be abolished. My hon.
Friend spoke about the MV Derbyshire tragedy in 1980, which led to a
campaign being waged by many people, including families and trade
unions across the piece—the National Union of Seamen, as it was
at the time, Nautilus and the International Transport Workers
Federation. It was a significant victory when then Secretary of State
exercised his power to enable an investigation of that case to take
place. It would therefore be a real concern if that power were removed
from the Secretary of State, because the function is

deals with ambulatory references to international shipping instruments.
It amends the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to enable the Government to
update international shipping conventions without having to 
<?notus-xml column=73?>introduce secondary legislation. The Joint Committee
expressed concern that that will undermine and bypass full
parliamentary scrutiny. For example, there is concern in the shipping
industry—it has been expressed by the UK Chamber of Shipping, as
well as the Nautilus UK and RMT unions—regarding the
international convention for the prevention of pollution from ships,
under which changes to the sulphur emissions regime in Europe are due
to come into effect in January 2015, with progressive measures

concerns that have been expressed about the provisions on the exercise
of regulatory functions, and I say that on behalf of many people who
work in the transport sector. We are told that consultations will take
place over the coming months on which bodies will be covered,
particularly regarding the Office of Rail Regulation, which was not
included in the original list of bodies. Bodies that are included in
relation to transport include the Office of Rail Regulation, the
Maritime and Coastguard Agency and traffic commissioners. There was a
period in which market forces and economic concerns overrode safety
concerns as a result of the early privatisation regimes, but we would
not want to go back to the days when those economic concerns undermined
safety, especially in industries such as rail and shipping. As the
consultation is rolled out, I would welcome the Government ensuring
that there is full consultation with all relevant bodies, particularly
the unions, with experience of the period when safety was undermined,
especially in the rail sector, so that that can inform the introduction
of this aspect of the Bill. I hope that the Government will
think again about the drafting of the proposal, because there are
serious concerns about the conflicts that it will bring about between
considerations of safety and of economic costs.</hs_Para>

Government should approach a number of the Bill’s proposals on
education with trepidation, especially the devolution of school dates
to individual schools. There is an understanding that parents want some

their own dates and holidays. I caution the Government that parents may

measures.</hs_Para>

which sets out proposals to reduce burdens on schools, including the
removal of the obligation on employers of teachers in English
maintained schools to have regard to statutory guidance relating to
staffing matters such as the appointment, suspension, discipline and
dismissal of teachers. There is concern that that may lead to the
removal of the obligation on the Secretary of State to provide guidance
on staffing matters, which might ultimately be a threat to school
staffing regulations. If that is the case, schools will be concerned
that they will have to take individual legal advice on staffing matters
rather than adhering to what is relatively clear staff guidance and
regulations from central Government. The Government must look at the
consequences of such a broad-brush legislative proposal.</hs_Para>

for Ellesmere Port and Neston (Andrew Miller), Sir John Armitt, Dr Adam
Marshall of the British Chambers of Commerce, and Sarah Veale, who was
later replaced by Liz Snape, representing the TUC. The proposed change
is based on the approach taken in a number of other European Union
member states, including Germany, where legislation on health and
safety at work applies only to employed workers; France, where, as a
general rule, the provisions do not apply to the self-employed or to
employers themselves, except when they are directly carrying out an

self-employed in risky occupations such as construction being taken
outside health and safety law. I can assure the House that Professor
Löfstedt has made it clear that that was never, and is not, the
intention of the proposal. The clause has the support of the Federation
of Small Businesses, which believes that it will help with the
perception of health and safety law. I fundamentally disagree with the
groups who are arguing that this change will cause confusion, because
asking the self-employed, “Does your work activity pose

a first response rather than a last resort. As we have heard, they
presided over the creation of 1,500 new working regulations a year for
each of their 13 years in office, or six new regulations every working
day. That was a burden that fell on and hindered individuals and
businesses. By contrast, this Government have committed to freeing
British business of the needless bureaucracy that damages our
international economic competiveness, hinders millions of individuals
in their daily lives, and reduces the efficiency of our public bodies
and services. This Government are committed to reducing the regulatory
burden on business by 2015, compared with the target of 2010 that we

there is no objection in principle to the idea of a Bill that, every
now and then, seeks to remove the regulatory burdens that can build up.
One of the criticisms of this Bill is that many of the proposed
measures are so minimal in their impact that one wonders why they could
not have been brought forward years ago. I find it hard to believe that
it has taken the great minds of the Department almost four years under
a Conservative Government to work on the measure relating to the sale
of yarn and other similar, relatively minor measures. One would think
that this Government, who are so stated in their commitment to
abolishing unnecessary regulation, could have done that at an earlier
stage, even though such measures are
welcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000295" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000295">Some
measures are to be welcomed. The hon. Member for North West
Leicestershire (Andrew Bridgen) has mentioned the measure relating to
rights of way. They

Bill also proposes to repeal those sections of the Digital Economy Act
2010 that allow courts the power to order internet service providers to
block access to websites that infringe copyright. I understand that
those sections have never been used. Many Members made very strong
arguments against them at the time, because they felt they were
unnecessary, but we were told they were important. I confess that I was
one of the Back Benchers who rebelled against the measures and did not
support them, and now, four years later, we find out that they were not
necessary in the first place. Clearly, it is right to repeal them and
perhaps that highlights the need closely and thoroughly to scrutinise

highlights one of the problems with the way in which the Government
have described this Bill, because those measures have never been used
and are, therefore, not a burden on business. Business is not having to
spend lots of money to address the measures, because they have never
been applied to anyone. That is also true of other measures in the
Bill. I accept, however, that the possibility of a measure being taken
against a business might jeopardise its activities, so it is a good
thing to address
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14020325000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0002.htm#14020325000298">Questions

about the international marine and maritime agreements, some of which
are very important. As my hon. Friend said, both the trade unions and
the shipping industry have concerns about the effect some of the

that the Health and Safety Executive has been able to give them
guidance on how they can protect their own safety. Despite the Bill,

61 to 64 have been discussed widely by Members on both sides of the
House. They are of great concern to Labour Members. They will impose a
new duty on some bodies to have regard, in exercising their regulatory
functions, to the desirability of promoting economic growth. It is, of
course, important that regulators do not set out to impede economic
growth. However, having a statutory duty that obliges them to have
regard to economic growth in the exercise of their functions, with no
clarity as to how it might operate, will potentially interfere with
their ability to perform their statutory duties. There is a danger that
those who are regulated will attempt to use the new duty to override
the actions of the regulator. For example, a business could argue that
requiring a particular process to be undertaken before it conducts a
certain activity would prevent it from making a profit and thus reduce
its ability to grow. On the other hand, not conducting such a process
could lead to an accident or to an employee becoming ill. Which of the
competing duties would prevail and who would make that

am glad that the Joint Committee that carried out the pre-legislative
scrutiny of the Bill criticised the enabling clause heavily. It would
have allowed Ministers to scrap regulations by order, as they saw fit.
That clause has been removed by the Government, or at least
substantially amended. As originally conceived, it would have set a
worrying precedent. It was reminiscent of the Henry VIII clause that
was originally proposed in the Public Bodies Bill in 2011, which would
have allowed the Government to abolish public bodies. At least the
Government had the good sense to drop that proposal in the

do the Government need to do away with these regulations? The origins
of the Bill are rooted in the perceived need to do away with red tape
that was supposedly holding back economic growth in the dark days of
2011, 2012 and early 2013. However, what was holding back economic
growth was not the bogeyman of small but important pieces of regulation
and protection, but a dramatic slashing of capital investment, which
had the effect of stagnating and even shrinking the economy at a time
when the Government should have been stimulating the economy fiscally,
rather than simply monetarily. That was the reason for the prolonged
nature of the great recession, the massive drop in living standards,
and the dashed hopes and dreams of millions. Unemployment rose and
companies folded because of a lack of business and a lack of funds as
the banks, propped up by the Government, failed to
lend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402041000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0003.htm#1402041000030">For

modernising the structure of the Labour party might well be going on

Bill should be called the Deregulation (of previous Tory laws) Bill.
The Minister who opened the debate, despite being such a learned man,
suggested that it was undoing the ills of previous Labour Governments,
but the truth is rather different. The following clauses remove
previous Tory legislation: clauses 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17, 18,
19, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 36, 46, 47, 49, 50, 53, 57, 59 and

schedules 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 16 and 17 remove previous
Tory legislation. I am therefore in favour of some of those
changes—although not all—because they relate to
irrelevant legislation that should never have been on the statute book
in the first place. Redundant and irrelevant Tory legislation is
rightly being removed, although of course, being the Tory party, they

Friend the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley), who was struggling,
because he knew that I was right and that the clause represents an
undoing of the self-employed mountain guide’s employment
position. There is a critical flaw in the logic of the Bill. Mountain
guides require insurance, and to get it they need to demonstrate that
there is a health and safety profile, and that is relevant for those
who employ self-employed mountain guides who take people out on ropes.
By the way, I personally managed to negotiate, on behalf of the
all-party group on mountaineering, exemption from the working at
heights directive anomalies that affected that profession,
demonstrating that the way the industry works meant it was not safe to
put that application into place. I am not, therefore, on the side of
unnecessary regulation, but the protection of the employment position
of those self-employed people is fundamental.</hs_Para>

employed primarily by the Government, so it was a taxpayer liability,
although there were some private companies. The civil action was
successful because the litigators had demonstrated that appropriate
practices and procedures were not in place. If there had been proper

his foot. However, because of manual handling at work legislation and
the fact that we had applied it, the case got nowhere. That was
precisely because the legislation had created a structure with a
sensible and rational procedure, which we could demonstrate and insist

when I did—it is about cost. If regulation costs a lot and
someone is trying to make ends meet, it is difficult. However,
regulations on manual handling at work, and health and safety

Who is responsible for ensuring that the ladders going

self-employed person, without that requirement in law because of this
change, that buck—that burden—can 
<?notus-xml column=89?>be shifted. One critical thing in such a situation is having an overall
duty because then everyone is liable. When working in complex spaces,
with people going backwards and forwards carrying huge loads of
equipment, lugging it and putting it up on high, all—whether a

as we often did—ensure that the systems and the space is

move away from regulation, it will lead to civil litigation, and
exactly the same will happen with the clauses in this Bill. That is
illustrative not of a specific measure in the Bill in relation to the
mining industry, but of the principle that moving away from good
regulation creates a liability. It is not a cost saving for the
employer because that liability comes back. In such a situation, yes,
the Bill would have an impact because there is no overriding
factor—that is the point. The case of the mountain guides is a
wonderful example because the person who owns the mountain is normally
the general public. We cannot say, “Ah well, this private
landowner is responsible for this bolt coming out and this person who
has been guided up falling to their death.” That is why this

Minister for Government Policy put up the wrong regulator in the
example I cited. I personally negotiated with the previous Government
the exemption from the working at heights directive on precise
technicalities. I demonstrated that it was not safer to be
included. Despite the perception, it would not have provided health and
safety. In climbing, there are two ropes. The worst-case contingency
training did not allow for one of those ropes snapping, so the
directive was a nonsense. It was not a nonsense in terms of the
principle of the law; it was a nonsense in the detail. The principle of
deregulation should be that if regulation is not effective—when
it is useless, when it does not work and when it is outdated—it
should be removed, as has been the case for stuff going back 150
years<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T19:53:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Mann:</Member></B> The HSE does not regulate training for mountain
guides. As with any risk assessment, the responsibility for risk
assessment, given that there is a 
<?notus-xml column=91?>health and safety duty, lies with the individual. That is the basis on
which the voluntary organisations across the world and in this country
that oversee health and safety standards operate. The duty to need to
have that risk assessment, and that health and safety duty, is just as
applicable for the self-employed as it is for those employing others,
so there is no difference in that example.</hs_Para>

me cite another example of how good regulation works. The Minister said
that there were hundreds of pieces of European legislation that should
be removed, but he could cite none of them. In our business we worked
all over Europe. We had to drive lorries across Europe before good
regulation came in. If we did a job in Hungary, we had to drive through
France, Belgium, Holland, Germany, Austria and Hungary. There was
different regulation for lorries and heavy goods vehicles in each of
those countries at that time, and some of the differences were huge.
For example, we could not drive on certain roads in Austria. There were
different speeds and different specs covering what kind of vehicle was
allowed. In terms of free trade, that was a lot of regulation in many
countries, and I would suggest that there is now sensible
regulation.</hs_Para>

all the regulation emanating from Europe is to do with the single
market. The figure that I have read is 90%, but the Minister without
Portfolio is a greater expert on this than me, so I am sure that he can
confirm that. A single market requires regulations so that products can
be sold on an equal basis, and they are counter to import controls.
Import controls and regulation do not go together; they are polar
opposites. If the Conservative party is saying—it would be
useful to have this clarification—that it intends to remove a
lot of European legislation on the single market, which import controls
would it bring back in? Many economists and others would say that
import controls are a cost on business, just as civil litigation costs,
as the mining industry found, are a cost on business. Good regulation,
especially on health and safety, protects the position of the
self-employed and the employer. It is not a burden on them, but a
protection to them, as well as the worker concerned.</hs_Para>

is some good stuff in the Bill. The provisions on rights of way may
well speed up a long drawn out process and ensure that they are brought
in properly, appropriately and speedily. That may well be a very good
thing, but it would have been useful also to have dealt with regulation
on health and safety in graveyards. They are the perfect example: there
was no regulation, and 3 million gravestones, due to what many people
described as health and safety, were staked. There was no regulation
for that; it was precisely the absence of regulation that led to 3
million gravestones being staked. The House may recall that I am a
qualified topple tester in graveyard health and safety. What happened
was due to the same problem that the mining industry faced: insurance
risk. Insurers demanded action, but there was no coherent regulation
that said, “Here is what the health and safety standard should
be.” Faced with pressure from insurers, people did their own
thing—they made it up as they went along—but that is
precisely what the Bill proposes should happen in many areas. That is
the principle behind what Ministers are proposing, but the Bill will
shift the burden on to insurance companies and the courts, and that is
not protection for the employer.</hs_Para>

can give another example of good regulation that was absent for a
century but which the Government dare not include in the Bill. I am
talking about safety at football stadiums. For 100 years, there was
disaster after disaster—two at Ibrox; one at Bolton, Birmingham,
Bradford and Hillsborough—but no effective regulation. It was a
case of, “Make it up as you go along”. In 1968, a stand
burned down at the stadium of the Minister without Portfolio’s
local team, Nottingham Forest, but no safety regulation was brought in
for football or sports stadiums. Had it been introduced, it would
undoubtedly have covered wooden stands. A repeat incident
took place in 1985 in a virtually identical stand, which shows the
danger of not having effective regulation.</hs_Para>

is another contradiction with this Government. We have heard several
times about the one in, two out principle, but the precise definition
of “one in” is regulation under statutory instrument. The
Department for Communities and Local Government has handed to local
authorities regulation in disguise. Over the past year, the Government
have put a range of regulatory barriers in the way of self-builders,
but they have not classified it as new regulation. They have introduced
the barrier of pre-planning consultation fees and extra charges on
developers and new builders, and
they<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:04:24"></hs_TimeCode> have
introduced the community infrastructure levy and applied it to
self-builds, which is another form of
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:03:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
Being<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:09:50"></hs_TimeCode> a
Nottinghamshire MP, the Minister will know that in Nottinghamshire
self-building has come to a complete stop. The first local authority to
apply the levy was Newark and Sherwood, since when there have been no
self-builds. Builders are not building one or two-plot developments
because of the burdens on industry.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>have gone
further, however, and brought in the affordable housing levy for single
dwellings, meaning that in Newark a builder or a couple wishing 
<?notus-xml column=93?>to build their own home have to face those barriers and pay up to
£50,000 in new taxes. That is not counted as regulation, but I
say it is regulation and a burden on business. In Nottinghamshire, the
policy is decimating small family building companies that rely on this
kind of work, which is why there are virtually no one, two or
three-dwelling property starts in Nottinghamshire. Newark and Sherwood
led the way, and others have followed, using new regulation—new
burdens on small builders and aspiring home owners—brought in
over the past 12 months.</hs_Para>

come at this from the perspective of someone who has run a small

is pro-business, that removing good regulation is anti-business, and
that removing regulation will shift the burden to the courts and

Government are slaves to the saying, “Red tape is bad”.
Of course, red tape is bad. The Bill gets rid of much bad Tory
legislation—nearly 80% of the Bill removes Tory
legislation—that was contested at the time and should never have
come in. Labour Members accept, I am sure, their apologies and their
recompense to society shown through their being prepared to get rid of
it, but alongside those measures they have thrown in a few gems
introduced by Labour that protect workers and employers, and
fundamentally protect the self-employed and small businesses.</hs_Para>

anti-regulation, given that, as I have demonstrated with DCLG, they are
powering in taxation and burdens on small businesses in my area and
elsewhere through the back door. Their disingenuous approach needs to
be exposed. Nevertheless, I welcome the fact that a raft of bad Tory

for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), speaking for the Green party,
cited the Green Building Council, but what does that do? Of course it
is the glaziers promoting a specific type of window that is enforced on
all house builders. There is legislation that means that for those who,
like me, live in a listed building, every single window that is
repaired, however minor, should by law go for individual planning
consent, at great expense to the householder, but also at cost to the
developer. I notice that none of that kind of thing is dealt with by
this Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is a lot of talk, but when it comes to the vested interest of the Green

in this Bill. For those

Minister who opened the debate mentioned in his second or third

sensible and necessary, which also came as a bombshell. That was
welcome and—to be sensible for a moment—set the tone of
the debate throughout: that we should try to have a regulatory regime
that is proportionate and appropriate, but that any unnecessary
legislation should be removed from the statute book. We on the Labour
Benches would certainly agree with that.</hs_Para>

all—that Charlie Chaplin can be now be rehabilitated. Chaplin,
who was seen as a communist in the United States in the 1950s,
has now been fully rehabilitated into the Conservative party of the
21st century. That is welcome. The Minister said that
village halls up and down the country are happy to be able to screen
Chaplin. I have to ask him: has he seen “A Woman of
Paris”, which highlights illicit sex encounters between an
unmarried young woman and her boyfriend, who shoots himself at the end
of the film? Is this the type of film that the Minister wants to
deregulate, to ensure that it is available to the village halls and the
spinsters of old England? I do not think it should be.</hs_Para>

year, asking for any ideas for a deregulatory Bill. In many respects,
that is not necessarily a bad thing. It is good, as we have heard
several times, to have a spring clean. However, I disagree with a lot
of what the Minister said. He opened the debate by saying that health
and safety legislation was “wretched stuff”. I hope he

the Member for Wansbeck said that it serves no purpose other than to

option, but the majority of those responding to the consultation
opposed the idea.</hs_Para>

has been said several times in the debate, the Opposition are concerned
that clause 1 does not really have any tangible impact, but introduces
more confusion for self-employed people, who may wrongly think that
they are exempt from health and safety laws. No self-employed person
has ever been prosecuted or threatened with prosecution for risking
only their own health. Given that only people who pose no risk to
anybody will be exempt, I cannot see how there will be a practical
impact on business or individuals. The Health and Safety at Work etc.
Act 1974, which we have heard about, can already be used only in
circumstances where a person puts another person at risk
anyway.</hs_Para>

construction industry. Does clause 1 deal with that? I thought that the
Minister was very precise, in a vague sort of way, in his use of
language, because he said that by the time the Bill reached Committee,
“activities” would be prescribed. Is that activities or
professions and jobs? It would useful to have an idea about that,
because we are extremely concerned about clause 1. We would like
clarification, both this evening and in Committee, about which jobs
will be excluded and reassurances that protections will be in

they tell me that the main factor affecting their long-term growth
perspective is access to finance. Nothing in the Bill enables us to
take a long-term view when it comes to where businesses can obtain the
finance they need to

takes four fifths of a second for the British economy—for the
hard work and effort of millions of people and enterprises—to
generate that potential saving of £1 million a year.
I say this to Ministers, and to other Members who have spoken today: do
not insult the intelligence of Britain by describing the Bill as a
substantial piece of reforming legislation. It will not really help
businesses; it will certainly not give them as much help as they need.
For the purposes of businesses that want extra orders or secure access
to finance, or want the Government to be on their side, this Bill is
sadly
lacking<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:22:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402041000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0003.htm#1402041000109">Families
are experiencing a cost-of-living crisis, and have lost £1,600 a
year since the general election. Just a few days ago, the Office for
National Statistics confirmed that since the Government took office in
2010, Britain has faced the largest continuous fall in real wages since
records began half a century ago. However, there is absolutely nothing
in the Bill to deal with that situation.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:22:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr mentioned a 4% drop in wages in his
community in Wales. One would think that the Government would want to
do something about that in a deregulation Bill whose aim was to free up
the inspiring innovation of businesses and individuals, but not a bit
of it. The net benefits to individuals as a result of the Bill will
amount to 0.18p for every single man, woman or child in this country. I
really do think that the Government should do better than

am particularly concerned. The clause reduces the eligibility criteria
relating to the purchase of social housing, which will have an adverse
impact on the supply of such housing. Any local authority that wants to
plan for the long term will need to spend capital, and will need to
borrow as a result. The reduction of the qualifying period from five
years to three will make it much more difficult for authorities to
borrow on the back of a sustained rental stream.

The fact is that, so far as I noticed in every contribution from the
moment the debate started, we all rather accept the need for
deregulation. Everybody agreed on the other hand that there is a case
for sensible regulation in the modern world. Indeed, it is highly
desirable, but it is essential from time to time for Governments and
Parliament to ensure that what is being done is proportionate,
sensible, justifiable and does not impose unnecessary burdens on
individuals and branches of government, and on business and small
business in particular. We have gone round and round in circles and
some Members have got wildly excited about particular regulations, but
the fact is we come back to agreement on that point, and I get the

Bill has to be big enough and long enough to deal with so many detailed
areas, and it will supplement and add to that to produce a deregulatory
effect for businesses—particularly small businesses—as
well as individual citizens, local authorities and branches of
government, all of which have better things to do than to waste money
on statutory duties the reason for which no one knows, or to produce
reports that nobody reads or to have obligations for things that nobody
is asking them to give advice on. For example, school governors have to
publish advice on discipline. Our reforms will not undermine school
discipline; my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education

the Member for Stroud (Neil Carmichael) on this. I think we will need a
Bill of this kind every 10 years or so. In modern times, as a result of
single-issue lobby groups and newspaper campaigns, Government
Departments engage in ever-more legislative and regulatory activity,
sometimes for the sake of being seen to be doing something or, in the
case of the lobby groups, being seen to be demanding something new.
That has an adverse effect not only on the statute book and the
regulatory publications but on the administration of good government
and the running of any successful business. The Bill is therefore a
welcome, and drastic, attempt to change the culture and go back in the
direction of common sense and proper regulation that involves a true
public interest and to ensure that environmental standards and the
safety of workers are maintained.</hs_Para>

such things can be discussed in Committee, I have to say that an
attempt was being made to make a difference of principle that was not

Conservative Government who set up employment tribunals, introduced
employment rights and started the whole process that we now have. The
intention was to provide a sensible, accessible and low cost way of
resolving disputes and awarding compensation where some breach of
employment rights had taken place. Over the years, the system has
become legalistic. It has become almost habitual for anybody who loses
their job to bring a claim, because there is very little risk to them
and a great deal of encouragement to have a go. None of that is being

we talk to small employers about the problems of running a competitive
business, most will rapidly start raising the problem and cost of
claims before employment tribunals. The changes we propose could be
criticised for being too modest, but they are certainly heading in the
right direction. They should not invite a knee-jerk reaction from the
Labour party, or anybody else, that nothing should be done to
deregulate in that area and to remove unnecessary

on health and safety, absolutely nobody is suggesting, in this Bill or
anywhere else, that we lower standards in this country when it comes to
protecting the health and safety of the work force, or anybody else. We
are not short of regulation in that area. Most of it will remain
intact, but what is proposed here seems to be perfectly
sensible. The biggest single change is to take away the burdens of
health and safety legislation from self-employed people who are not in
an occupation that can pose a threat to other people, as will be
specified. It is absurd. Let us take a self-employed person—not
one of those self-employed contractors in the business of

cottage in the countryside in Dorset. He is a self-employed person. Is
Labour going to argue passionately in Committee that he should be
subject to health and safety at work legislation, which he is at the
moment? Of course he is not likely to be sued unless he throws a book
at somebody in a moment of bad temper, but even that is probably not a
breach of the health and safety at work legislation. He is subject to
inspection. He may have to pay regard to the guidance. I have taken an
extreme example of what should be a harmless occupation—if he is
a reasonable novelist.</hs_Para>

measure that all Opposition Members tried to make a mainstream
political point about is the growth duty we are putting on non-economic
regulators. I am not a climate change denier; the Government are in
favour of environmental protection, and the conservation of our habitat
and essential national heritage is a perfectly important objective of
the Government. It is completely over the top to describe the changes
in the Bill as sometimes threatening all that. We are saying that the
various non-economic regulators should have regard to the desirability
of the growth of the economy while carrying out their other duties.
That was described as a mad dash for casino growth and likened to our
casting away of regulation on bankers, which we did not do—it 
<?notus-xml column=103?>was the previous Government who did that. I would have agreed with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:44:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Bassetlaw had he cited that example, as it was a good example of
the importance of regulation and the pathetic inadequacy of the
Financial Services Authority when the then Chancellor gave it that
responsibility. In this case, all that we are doing is saying that
while it remains liable to follow its existing guidance—it has
been pointed out that it is supposed to regulate only where necessary
and proportionate—it is supposed to have regard to the impact on
individual businesses, and it should have regard to the growth of the
nation. Serious conservation in a highly developed, advanced economy
like ours and the protection of our natural environment have to take
account of the fact that at the same time, we hope to be a growing
economy and a powerful, modern, industrial nation. It is a question of
balance, judgement and common sense between the Government’s
economic interests and our desire to conserve what is best in our
heritage. Describing the Bill as an attack on that is
absurd.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402041000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0003.htm#1402041000142">That
shows why the previous Government’s record was pathetic on
deregulation and reducing the burdens on business. They constantly gave
in to pressures that drove them in the other direction, and it requires
a Government with clarity of purpose to get hold of the subject and
make a detailed attempt to reduce unnecessary burdens, bureaucracy and
paperwork. The printing of useless documents and general obstructions
to growth and efficiency need to be removed if that is to be a
success.</hs_Para>

Member for Stroud (Neil Carmichael) discussed what we are doing

important measures that will strengthen skills training in industry and

measures on yarn received widespread support from those in the House

which faces the same difficulty in Europe that it has always faced in
Britain, because most of the regulations are supported by some lobby or
other. The European regulations are the result of the single market. To
stay in the single market required a mass of regulations. When the then
Government pressed for the single market to be created, the British
Commissioner whom we appointed—Arthur Cockfield, I
think—came up with thousands of amendments, which were required

plan for long-term economic growth, giving particular priority to small
and medium-sized enterprises in this country as never before. We are
reviewing the range of advice that the Government give to small
businesses and the range of financial support available to them. We
have reduced the tax burden on small employers, particularly for young
employees. UK Trade &amp; Investment is concentrating on small and

Start children’s centres are there to protect and help the
youngest in our communities, to support and help families, and to
invest in the future by providing the very best start for all. In a bid
to cut its budgets even further, Somerset county council has acted
appallingly, proposing restructuring that will put the most vulnerable
at risk and plunge those in rural areas into deeper isolation. It seems
to be systematically working to undermine and undervalue the amazing
work that children’s centre staff are doing to help and support
young families in Somerset. In its flawed consultation exercise, the
county council claimed that it needed to review children’s
centre provision

“outstanding”, whereas the national average is 69%. The

vulnerable. That is simply not
true<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T20:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Before
jumping to any conclusions, I ask the Minister to ask this more

children’s centres, in Wells and Chilcompton, have recently had
an Ofsted inspection. When they received their feedback and report,

they delivered to the most vulnerable were deemed as
“good”. However, when Ofsted scrutinised the support and
data that the children’s centres received from their county
council, they were deemed as “requiring improvement”. The
county council has failed the children’s centres, not vice
versa. The county council’s consistent failures led to an
overall Ofsted grading of “needing improvement”, which
failed both the children’s centres and the children of
Somerset.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402041000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0003.htm#1402041000166">Wells

Friend on securing this important debate. She is talking about cost,
and I wonder whether she will momentarily engage with this thought of
mine? Everybody understands that the county council needs to be as
cost-efficient as possible and, on the face of it, there may be some
short-term savings to be made. If, however she looks at a town such as
Wiveliscombe in Taunton Deane, which has a purpose-built
children’s centre, with a new doctors’ surgery being
built next to it, a whole apparatus of services are available to people
in that small town and the surrounding communities, of which the
children’s centre is an integral part. There may be some
short-term savings, but my suspicion and fear is that, overall, there
will be long-term costs that are not just social, but financial, from
having buildings empty and services not fully

more<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T21:01:20"></hs_TimeCode>. In a
number of cases across Somerset, children’s centres are next to
surgeries and schools. With a universal service, it is very easy for
children and parents to get used to accessing the services that they
need on an ongoing basis. Children get used to going into the surgery

county council report has revealed that, as many contracts are due to
end in March, there is not enough time to investigate any alternative
provision. Incompetence and a lack of planning mean that provider
agencies are pulling away, and are quite rightly refusing to deliver
services on a month-by-month extension. No one can be expected to work
with such a level of uncertainty. I understand that the agencies are
handing services back to Somerset, which means further costs, because
partner agencies pay their family support workers more than the council
does and such transfers mean that salary arrangements have to be
honoured<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-03T21:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1402041000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/debtext/140203-0003.htm#1402041000186">One
of the main planks in the argument for change was the promise that
there would be 30 more front-line family support workers. However, the

ages of nought and 19. The county council had promised 30 more support
workers for children between the ages of nought and four, but it is now
watering down that service even further. The council promises one

specifically to be children’s centres will also be wasted. Those
elements will far outweigh the money that will be saved on the heating

Closing those buildings is an absolute waste of taxpayers’

to offset some of the costs of the children’s centre buildings

objective or fairly balanced, but were heavily loaded to make people
say yes to cuts and yes to cutting rural centres in particular. There
were questions such as, “Should we place resources in places
where there are more children?” That will of course produce an
answer that favours urban children’s centres. However, users in
such areas can often walk to services or take a bus, unlike children
who live in rural and isolated places in our county.

sexuality and spirituality than the services delivered by

than cutting funding and services, Somerset county council needs to
engage actively, and to value and support the vital work that
children’s services are doing in Somerset to improve the lives
of young people. What has worked well locally has been early
identification for families in need of universal services when access
to those services has no stigma attached. Many of those services will
not be available following the proposed changes. In rural areas, that
will mean that many families will not have access to any services. With
more family support workers and fewer managers to support the care,
guidance and support given to targeted families

in dealing with the huge social need that had expressed itself,

consultation said, “At the moment children’s

to the consultation, and the council was forced to change it. The
county council consistently ignored the performance of really good
children’s centres, working with outreach into the community and
with vulnerable families. One of the best examples of that in my

cannot accept that a county council should, under any circumstances, be
in a situation where child protection services were outstanding four
years ago, but are now so far destroyed—I can use no other
word—that they require direct support from Government Ministers
under special measures and, I think, will eventually have to be taken

children’s centres provide birth registration and post-natal
care. That is helpful for parents, because it provides one place for
them to go to for help and advice—everybody goes through the
door to register a birth, and they then become part of a parental
network. That can extend to help on all kinds of issues: employment,
finding a nursery place for their child and a place in local schools.

Truss:</Member></B> I want to come to the point about Ofsted. Last
week, I spoke at a meeting of the all-party group on Sure Start
children’s centres. At the moment, there is an issue with Ofsted
inspections—not with their quality, but with how
children’s centres are inspected. I am in discussions with
Ofsted, but I think it would be more sensible to look at the overall
early years support services provided by local councils through
children’s centres, rather than at centres individually. A lot
of councils are moving towards more of a network model, but the
important thing is that parents and children can access centres and
good services, and that centres reach as many people as possible. The
current model—where statutory children’s centres, but not
branch centres, are inspected by Ofsted—is probably not as
effective as a council-based model, and I think that that is pertinent
to my hon. Friend’s point. We are working on a slightly
different inspection model for precisely the reasons she
outlined.</hs_Para>

funding for early intervention from £2.1 billion to £2.5

reconfigure services in a way that suits local communities, although I
have been told by Ministers that not many applications have been

withdraw themselves during contractual negotiations, when it becomes

reasons, such as a changing market outlook or a reorganisation of their

in April 2011, the bonus is based on the council tax of additional
homes and those brought back into use, with an additional amount for
affordable homes. Each year’s bonus award is paid for six years.
It ensures that those local authorities which promote and welcome
growth can share in its economic benefits, and build the communities in
which people want to live and work. This Government introduced the new
homes bonus as a permanent part of the local government finance system.
This is the fourth year of payments on the same basis as the original
policy and the Government will maintain the bonus as an important
incentive for councils to build more houses for their communities. We
will continue to pay the bonus in the future to ensure that places that
have built houses are properly rewarded for doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020322000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/wmstext/140203m0001.htm#14020322000121">Authorities
can choose to spend the money as they see fit, from providing new
facilities, to protecting front-line services or simply freezing

Minister for Immigration (Mr Mark Harper):</Member></B> I am today

necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020322000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/wmstext/140203m0001.htm#14020322000126">In
developing these proposals, the Home Office has sought to limit most
increases to 4%. There are further targeted increases to bring
dependant fees in line with main application fees, to register as a
British citizen and some premium services. A staggered rise has been
applied to the long-term visit visa (greater than six months) with a
higher rise to the two and five-year visas to ensure the 10-year visa
stays at its current level. We are also introducing a reduced fee for
those applying to work within areas regarded as shortage occupations
and to the direct airside transit
visa.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020322000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/wmstext/140203m0001.htm#14020322000127">The
Home Office has given careful consideration to its fee levels, to
ensure they provide the funding necessary to operate effective
immigration controls and invest in 
<?notus-xml column=6?>improving service levels to customers. This is balanced against the need
to ensure that the UK continues to attract and welcome the
“brightest and best” migrants from around the world and
those that make a valued contribution to British society. Given the
ongoing need to reduce public spending, we believe it is right that we
continue to reduce the contribution made by UK taxpayers towards
delivering the immigration system by asking those who use and benefit
directly from the system to make a greater
contribution.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020322000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/wmstext/140203m0001.htm#14020322000128">For
certain application categories, we will continue to set fees higher
than the administrative cost to reflect their value to successful
applicants. This helps to provide resources to run the UK immigration
system and enables the Home Office to set lower fees elsewhere in
support of wider Government objectives to attract those businesses,
workers, students and visitors who most benefit the UK. This includes
the short-term visit visa which remains significantly below
cost.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="14020322000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140203/wmstext/140203m0001.htm#14020322000129">I
have laid regulations for fees set higher than cost. In addition, I
will shortly lay another set of regulations in Parliament for fees set
at or below cost. Further details explaining all fees changes are

estimates the potential benefits to business of improved rail

output in the North West of England, measuring in terms of gross value
added, by £1.1 billion to £2.5 billion in 2037 (measured
in 2013 prices) as a result of improvements in business-to-business and
labour connectivity in the region. This is the equivalent to an

Rogerson:</Member></B> The Environment Agency has made an assessment of
the costs and benefits of dredging the River Ribble estuary downstream
of Preston. This showed that the cost of dredging would be at least
£12 million per year. These costs are based on dredging to the
same level as the 1970s when the Port of Preston Authority previously
undertook dredging in the Ribble estuary. A similar assessment of the
costs of dredging upstream of Preston has not been made as flood risk
to properties in this area is low, meaning that dredging of the river
would be of little value.</hs_Para>

Environment Agency considers that such dredging does not represent good
value for money compared to other flood risk defences. The network of
flood defences built by the Environment Agency, its predecessor bodies,
and local authorities along the Ribble estuary downstream of Preston
cover a 10 mile stretch and offer between one in 100 and one in 200
year standard protection, depending on the location. Dredging of the
Ribble estuary may lead to possible undermining of the training walls
at Preston Docks, leading to increased maintenance costs for those
important flood risk assets.</hs_Para>

investigations into child sexual abuse by the police are an operational
matter for the relevant Chief Officer. They are supported in
operational matters through the provision of Authorised Professional
Practice from the College of Policing who will shortly be providing
updated advice in respect of investigating child abuse cases. This will
cover all aspects of the police investigation including the need for
the police to develop an identification strategy to identify victims
and/or witnesses to avoid any suggestion of 'trawling'. It will also
provide advice on arrest, charging and prosecution as well as advice on
cases where an investigation identifies a false allegation and, where

concern about safeguarding, whether in relation to an individual or a

works closely with local safeguarding agencies to ensure appropriate
action is taken in all cases. In recent years a number of inspectors
have ceased to be deployed for reasons connected with statutory notices
being served on schools they are connected with; parental complaints;
and underperformance. In addition, one individual team member has been

Featherstone:</Member></B> UK aid programmes are grounded in a thorough
poverty analysis which seeks to identify the specific needs of poor and
disadvantaged people. The UK Government invests both in programmes that
directly support people with disabilities, and in mainstream programmes
that include a specific focus on people with disabilities. The UK also

happen in different areas of the UK and different populations (such as

Efficiency and Reform Group was founded after the 2010 General Election
to tackle wasteful expenditure and reform the way Whitehall
works.  Just one example of the waste we found was that one
major service integrator was charging £30,000 to change a logo
on a web page. Other examples are detailed in Sir Philip Green’s
Efficiency Review, which found that while paper cost one department
£73 per box, another paid just

introduction of Universal Credit (UC), the Office for National
Statistics (ONS) compiled the Claimant Count from the number of people
claiming Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) from the Jobcentreplus
Administrative System. With the introduction of UC it was intended to
extend this definition to include those claimants of UC who were out of
work and subject to a full set of work search requirements. However,
initially the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have not been able
to supply ONS with this information in a way that has allowed its

assessment was that the impact of the exclusion of UC claims would be
small, relative to the overall level and changes within the Claimant
Count. This was based on the Pathfinder initially being rolled out in a
single Jobcentreplus office and for a limited range of claimants. This
assessment was supported by monitoring the change in the number of JSA
claimants at that Jobcentreplus office relative to the change in the
number of claimants of other nearby Jobcentreplus offices. Continued
monitoring of the number of JSA claimants at that Jobcentreplus office,
along with the other Pathfinder Jobcentreplus offices as UC was
rolled-out, confirmed the assessment that the impact on the Claimant
Count was small.</hs_brev>

2013 DWP published Universal Credit claimants in pathfinder
areas—experimental official statistics to September 2013. This
showed that at 30 September 2013, a total of 2,030 people
were on the UC caseload. This figure would be an overestimate of the
effect on the Claimant Count at that point, since it includes the whole
UC caseload and not just those who were out of work and subject to a
full set of work search requirements. For example, this total would
include a number of people who had moved into work and were still
eligible for UC subsequent to their initial claim.</hs_brev>

continuing to monitor the impact that the roll-out of UC is having on
the Jobcentres affected and will continue to assess whether it
considers the impact to be small or more significant in the context of
the level and changes in the Claimant Count. ONS intends to include UC
claimants within the Claimant Count once a suitable timely supply of
information becomes available. At this time it is expected that
revisions will be made to the periods since the introduction of UC to
produce a Claimant Count including the appropriate subset of claimants

total of 656 civilian staff working within the FJF have left the
Department on Voluntary Early Release terms (VERS) since 2010.
Compensation payments to these staff under the terms of the Civil
Service Compensation Scheme amount to around £23
million. However, this figure needs to be seen in the context of the
tough decisions made by this Government since 2010; we estimate that by
Financial Year 2021-22 we will have achieved cumulative savings of some
£23 billion as a result of reductions in service and civilian
personnel and greater efficiency in the conduct of non-front line

These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI)
data sourced from the 2011/12 Family Resources Survey (FRS). This uses
disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD
equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income
measure as a proxy for standard of
living.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">2.
Net disposable incomes have been used to answer this question. This
includes earnings from employment and self/employment, state support,
income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and
other sources. Income tax payments, national insurance contributions,
council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from
incomes.</hs_TableFooter>
<hs_TableFooter Justify="left">3. Figures have been
rounded to the nearest 100,000 and percentages to the nearest whole
percentage
point.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.
Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and an After
Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs are not
deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they
are.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5.
When considering the living standards of children, measures after
housing costs can underestimate the true standard of living as a family
may make a choice to spend more on rent or mortgage to attain a higher
standard of
accommodation.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6.
Conversely measures for pensioners are generally on an After Housing
Costs basis. This is because pensioners are far more likely to own
their homes outright and so receive value from housing, without having
to pay for rent or mortgage payments out of their current income. So
for assessing pensioner poverty a before housing costs basis does not
provide a good comparison of living
standards.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7.
All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to a
degree of uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution
as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in
non/response.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">8.
The reference period for HBAI figures is the financial year. For
regional figures three year averages have been used to overcome
volatility.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">9.
In Households Below Average Income, a household is defined as a single
person or group of people living at the same address as their only or
main residence, who either share one meal together or share the living
accommodation. This differs from a benefit unit (family), which is
defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any
dependent children. From January 2006 same/sex partners (civil partners
and cohabitees) are also included in the same benefit unit. A household
will consist of one or more benefit units. The figures above are based
on
households.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><I>Source:</I></hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">HBAI

considered sufficiently prepared would not be recorded on HMCTS's
central case management system in a way the data could be collated.
That level of information may be held on individual case files but even
then may require some interpretation of the judge's directions.
Manually checking every private law case  file heard in Wales
since April 2013 would incur disproportionate costs. HMCTS has produced
a new leaflet, which complements a suite of online videos to assist

would have any impact on household bills is dependent on a number of
factors, including the response of the market. If a power station does
leave the market, this should result in opportunities for other

impact of shale gas production on energy bills will be largely
determined by production costs. Though it is important to note that the
wholesale gas price is just one factor that influences retail gas
prices. Little drilling or testing has taken place in Britain's shale
deposits, so it is not yet possible to estimate how much shale gas or
oil may be practically and commercially recoverable. It is therefore
too early to make an assessment of the impact of UK shale development
on prices. Globally, there are some scenarios in a report prepared by

encouraging that UKOOG will be working with the UK Communities
Foundation independently to manage and distribute the exploration
funding in a new pilot scheme and that communities will have the lead

for residents to feed into the consultation to be undertaken by UKOOG

the gas distribution grid to be shut down, especially if gas itself can
be decarbonised through the use of biomethane, synthetic gases or
hydrogen. The Government's Heat Strategy, published last year,
envisages different sections of the housing stock being decarbonised
using different technologies and at different times. In all cases,
reducing demand for heating is the first thing to do. To meet the
remaining demand, different solutions will apply depending on
