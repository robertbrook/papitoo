Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Schools (Lord Nash)
(</B><B>Con</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, the Government believe
strongly that every child should experience a high-quality arts
education. Music and art and design are statutory subjects for key
stages 1 to 3 in the new national curriculum. The arts remain an
entitlement area at key stage 4. From 2016, our new Progress 8
accountability measure provides schools with more incentive to enter
pupils for arts subjects. Up to three can be included. Discount codes
for drama and dance are being
reviewed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000003"><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Clancarty" PimsId="2608" UID="140212154000455" xid="2038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000455"><B>The
Earl of Clancarty (</B><B>CB</B><B>):</B></Member> My Lords, I thank
the Minister for that reply and welcome the review of the discount
codes. In the light of the figures recently released by DCMS on the
value of the arts and creative industries to the economy, will the DfE
seek to reverse the continuing trend towards fewer arts GCSEs being
studied within schools? Will the Government review the discount codes
which group together many disparate GCSE art and design subjects so
that they count as one subject only towards performance tables, biasing
the tables and, indeed, schools against the
arts?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000004"><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="140212154000456" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000456"><B>Lord
</B><B>Nash</B><B>:</B></Member> I share the noble Earl’s
passion for the arts and know that it is an area in which he has great
experience. I am happy to report that key stage 4 entries for arts
subjects have not significantly changed since 2007 and currently
account for 9% of all key stage 4 entries. I assure the noble Earl that
we take discounting very seriously. We are looking specifically at how
it works as it is so important that schools are not incentivised to
offer pupils a narrow curriculum, although it is equally important that
pupils take subjects that are distinct from each other. We are
reviewing how the discount codes for dance and drama work, and we are
also considering whether to allow appeals against the discounting
decisions that have been made in other areas if there is evidence to
support reconsidering our initial
consideration.</hs_para>

It is important that we give all our students that core cultural
capital that Diane Abbott has acknowledged in the other place as being
essential, particularly for underprivileged children, to enable them to
get on in life and that we encourage more careers. We now have a number
of university technical colleges focused on the creative

Liverpool Institute for Performing Arts, which the noble Lord knows
well and whose lead patron is Sir Paul McCartney. Indeed, we have
approved it to open a primary free school, which will use the creative
and performing arts to encourage a lasting enthusiasm for learning.
Pupil premium funding is allocated to schools to decide how to improve
the outcome for disadvantaged pupils. Ofsted now inspects against this
and it will be very difficult for schools to get an outstanding rating
if they are not making good progress for their pupil premium pupils.

McIntosh of Hudnall (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, may
I recommend to the noble Lord that he looks at a report from
Professor Ken Robinson that was co-commissioned by his department, as
it then was, and the DCMS more than a decade ago? In the report
Professor Robinson explained in great detail the value of creative
education, broadly, both educationally and socially. Can the noble Lord
tell the House how relations between his department and the DCMS
currently are, because I am afraid that Professor Robinson’s
report fell slightly foul of a lack of co-ordination between them at
the time? Can he say whether his department is well acquainted with the
wide range of educational opportunities provided by arts organisations
to enhance the curriculum in the way that he

aware of the report, but she is of course vastly experienced in this
area as a former chief executive of the Royal Opera House and principal
of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. Cross-departmental working
is never a smooth affair. We had some success with my noble friend in
the Children and Families Bill, and I would be very interested to look
into this in more detail. The noble Baroness is absolutely right that
all schools should engage with wider organisations. My own school

that question. Under Labour, the number of pupils entering key academic

accounted for four GCSE equivalents—were perpetrated into the

to hear that under this Government we are back to pre-Labour levels for

friend pointed out, for households with usually-resident dependent
children. The gender balance of dependent children in these households
is affected by a number of events that occur after birth, such as the
age at which dependent children leave the parental home. As there are a
number of alternative explanations for these observations, it cannot be
concluded from the <I>Independent</I>’s analysis that
sex-selective abortions are taking place. The best available data on
which to base gender ratio analysis continue to be births data, which

abortions are an extreme form of gender discrimination. Sadly, it is
all too prevalent in sub-continent communities. The Sikh guru, Guru
Nanak, taught from day one the total equality of women; they can join

sometimes gets the better of religion; even in the Sikh community, that
sort of discrimination can take place. Will the Minister ensure that

International Day of Zero Tolerance to Female Genital Mutilation,
Ministers met with charities and stakeholders and announced a range of
measures to combat this harmful practice both in the UK and
internationally. These measures include the appointment of a consortium
of leading anti-FGM campaigners to deliver a global campaign to end
FGM. Ministers from across government have also signed a declaration to

Tonge (Ind LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the
Minister for that reply and I commend the Government on their efforts
over the past year. I also particularly commend the work of Keir
Starmer, the previous Director  
<?notus-xml column=643?>of Public Prosecutions. Does the Minister realise that
it is now more than 10 years since the all-party
parliamentary group that I chair produced a report on female genital
mutilation, but that during that time, despite many Members
of this House and the other place raising the issue, very little
progress has been made? Can he explain why over those years there have
been many prosecutions in France and other European
countries for this horrible, painful and quite disgraceful practice,
which is an abuse of young girls, while in this country we have had no
prosecutions at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T11:31:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon:</Member></B> I pay tribute to the noble Baroness
for her work in this respect, and indeed to many noble Lords across the
Chamber. Taking her last question first, I am sure that she and many
noble Lords will be aware that in France there is a prescriptive nature
to the examination of young girls across the board. At the moment that
is not something which the Government are considering initiating here.
That said, as the noble Baroness herself has acknowledged, since 2011
there has been a range of initiatives and positive steps. Perhaps I may
mention a few. In November 2012, the document <I>A Statement Opposing
Female Genital Mutilation</I> was launched, which sets out the
potential criminal penalties that can be used against those who allow
FGM to take place. In the same month the Crown Prosecution Service
launched an action plan for prosecuting cases of FGM. From the
international perspective, in March 2013 DfID announced a £35
million programme on FGM, and in June last year the NSPCC, in
partnership with the Home Office, launched a dedicated FGM helpline.
The Government believe, as do all noble Lords, that this is a heinous
practice; it is a crime which has to be tackled both outside and within
the community, and they are working with partners to ensure that that
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T11:33:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Rendell of Babergh (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, far from being almost
eliminated, the practice of FGM continues and, indeed, is on the
increase. The cause is largely because more communities are coming into
the country and bringing this culture with them. Enormous publicity has
been given to FGM lately, which one is glad to see, but that
does not deal with the basic problem. Does the Minister
agree that the best thing would be a successful prosecution, which
might have a deterrent effect? We understand that many of
the people who perpetrate FGM do not know what the law is, cannot read
about it, and believe that what they are doing is
good.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness does in this field. I agree with her: prosecutions
have not taken place. This law was on the statute book in its original
form almost 30 years ago and nothing has happened. The CPS is currently
reviewing four existing cases plus six new cases to see whether an
evidence base is there to ensure that prosecutions take place. Coupled
with that, it is important that we raise awareness of this offence out
there within communities. There is a 14-year sentence for anyone
convicted of this offence, and we are working with communities to
ensure that that message gets out very

Johnson, as the notional police and crime commissioner for London, is
running an engagement with Londoners about water cannon, explaining why
they are necessary, but his office has made clear that the response
will not change the outcome. That is, the Met has asked for them, so
the Met shall have them. In a recent letter, the Home Secretary appears
to be under the impression that a proper consultation is going on with
Londoners, but there most definitely is not. I would not want the

shall talk about three things—cost, use and potential
targets—and I will pose three questions for which I should be
grateful for an answer. In a sense, cost is not that much of an issue,
because the Met budget, although reduced, is still £3.25
billion. I have been told that the Met hopes to buy second-hand from
Germany at a cost of only about £30,000 each, so I guess that
the total cost would be about £100,000, expecting the
water cannons to last two to three years. New machines cost about
£1 million each. However, then there is the cost of training,
which must be ongoing over the years, plus storage in central London,
plus maintenance. The Met recently had to be coerced into funding a
£100,000 budget to continue the work of the Wildlife Crime Unit,
which fights international organised crime networks that traffick
endangered animals or parts of endangered
animals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000064">Your
Lordships may know that today, the UK is hosting a two-day
international conference on the illegal wildlife trade, involving two
future Kings of our country and world leaders from 50 nations invited
by the Prime Minister, but the Met police has a team of five people
going up against an illegal trade estimated to be worth £19
billion a year. If there is some spare cash in the Met budget, why is
it prioritising a weapon that it will hardly ever use over a global
economic crime with links to trafficking of drugs and people and even
to terrorism, not to mention threatening some of the planet’s
most iconic animals with extinction? I suspect that a lot of people
would rather that it was spent there than on water cannon—or
even on another priority altogether. I would be interested to know the
Government’s view about the Met’s
priorities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T11:42:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

That simply is not true of London. The sort of disorder that has

moving quickly, staying in touch by mobile phones and social media.
Water cannon would be useless in that situation, as the police
themselves have admitted. These machines are slow and not very

water cannon in Germany. He was part of a protest ride to prevent

would water cannon be used? Who would be the targets? We have been
hearing that water cannon would be rarely seen and rarely used. When
asked exactly when they would be used, the Met answers that they would
not be used against peaceful protesters and they are obviously not for
small-scale violent rioting in narrow places. They would be for people
throwing petrol bombs, who obviously would not hide themselves in a
large crowd of peaceful protesters, or the Met could pick them off, or
something—a highly speculative

Met have also claimed that water cannon could have saved the Reeves
furniture store in Croydon, but that night there were fires in Clapham,
Enfield and Peckham, plus rioting in a total of 22 boroughs. One set of
three water cannon, broken up or deployed as a threesome, might have
been deployed to one of the fires and may have got there in time to be
useful, but would the Met have been able to use them to do very much
else? That seems unlikely because of the travelling time alone, let
alone co-ordinating with local police command and the fire brigade
about the exact needs.</hs_para>

Water cannon have proved useful in Northern Ireland to keep two

much more explanation needs to be given as to how they would be of use
in public order situations including violent and non-violent
participants or in deterring very mobile rioters carrying out widely
dispersed attacks as in the 2011 riots. I am not suggesting a case

that is—or expects to be—in government to appear to look

be an operational decision for the police forces owning them. Licensing
them is most definitely a political decision, though, and doing a
Pontius Pilate on this is really not good enough. So I ask the

very ironic about the Met police justifying the purchase of these water
cannon because of the 2011 riots, when it was Met actions that
triggered the disorder. If the Met had not shot an unarmed man and had
treated the Duggan family with more respect and professionalism, those
riots may never have been sparked and the grumbling discontent of
poverty and hardship may never have broken the surface in London and
other parts of Britain. However, the Met did shoot an unarmed man, did
not treat the Duggan family well and the rest is history, but water
cannon would probably not have helped in any
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000073">We are

reservations as to why we are even talking about this. The <I>Daily
Telegraph</I>, a newspaper that I know many noble Lords will believe is
the fount of all possible wisdom on many matters, told us on 23 January
that it is because senior police officers now believe that the risks of
future protests against the Government are so great, and those protests
will be so large and difficult to control, that only the
deployment of water cannon on the streets of mainland Britain will
enable public order to be maintained. Indeed, according to the

this sort of response will be triggered. I do not doubt that there will
be public protest about the Government. There will no doubt be public
protest about the Government’s future austerity measures. But
really? So large? So difficult to control? So far beyond anything that
we have seen before? So much bigger? So much larger? More than the

Constable David Shaw, who prepared a report on behalf of the
Association of Chief Police Officers, concedes that the water cannon
would not have been a useful tactic, would not have been effective,
during the August 2011 riots. That makes sense. Water cannon are
effective at dispersing a large crowd, or at keeping two large crowds
apart. That is the experience in Northern Ireland. However, the
disturbances in August 2011 were not like that. Rioters were already
dispersed. They were highly mobile. That was the problem. The police
could not be in a sufficient number of locations quickly enough. They
could not be everywhere all of the time. They could not respond to a
rapidly moving situation, where crowds and individuals were moving from
one place to another very quickly. Why would you want a water cannon to
disperse a crowd

ACPO report cites three occasions in the past decade on which water
cannon might have been used: the Countryside Alliance demonstration in
Parliament Square in 2004; the Gaza demonstrations against the Israeli
embassy in 2008-09; and, potentially—it says
“potentially”—the student protests of 2010. On the
other hand, the Metropolitan Police are saying that water cannon would
be rarely used and rarely seen. In fact, Assistant Commissioner Mark
Rowley has given a pledge that the Met would never use them against
protests, which would seem to rule out any of the three occasions
suggested by the Association of Chief Police Officers. I am not
suggesting for one moment that the Association of Chief Police Officers
does not speak as with one voice with the senior leadership
of the Metropolitan Police on all matters, but it seems that on this
particular issue they were not entirely in
accord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T11:53:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the implications had water cannon been deployed on those occasions
cited by ACPO? Let us consider the Countryside Alliance demonstration;
a number of your Lordships may recall what that was like. During that,
there was a point when the police were concerned that the demonstrators
might break through their ranks and storm Parliament. That was a
serious situation, which was eventually resolved by conventional
policing—slightly messily, but it was resolved.
However, the only way that water cannon might have assisted
in those circumstances would have been if they had already been
deployed, in advance of the police knowing that potentially they might
lose control of the situation and that it was deteriorating. Who could
have predicted in advance that the welly-clad, middle-class,
pro-hunting brigade would be so violent on that particular day? The
only way that the water cannon could have been deployed would have been
to park them inside the precincts of Parliament, inside the
Palace of Westminster, facing outwards. Does anyone really believe that
that would have been sanctioned —in advance and on the basis of
no intelligence that anything was going to happen—by Mr Speaker
or the Lord Speaker? What sort of message would we have put out to the
rest of the world? Imagine the images of the mother of Parliaments with
water cannon firing jets of water out from New Palace
Yard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000081">What
about the student protests of 2010? The problem there was that an
unexpected—I stress that—splinter group chose to attack
Conservative Central Office. That was a break-away group which acted
unpredictably. That there would be a break-away group may have been
predictable, but what they would do and when they would do it was
unpredictable. Therefore water cannon would not have been in the right
place at the right time. Had their activities been foreseen, normal
policing could have controlled the situation—enough police would
have been surrounding Conservative Central Office. What if such
activities are not foreseen? The break-away faction is a risk in all
otherwise peaceful demonstrations, as it is mixed in with all sorts of
ordinary demonstrators who are not planning to be as objectionable.
Break-away factions are by their nature  
<?notus-xml column=651?>unpredictable—it is not possible to foresee when they will break
away—so you will not have the water cannon deployed and in the
right place at the right
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000082">What is
this all about? Is it another mayoral vanity project? Maybe I am being
too kind. What psychology is involved with a mayor who wants to have a
large hose to douse the lower orders? I suspect that the timeline began
with one of the Taliban-tendency Tory Back-Benchers, who said after the
2011 riots: “The Met needs water cannon”. The Home
Secretary, who wishes to be the next Tory leader and therefore never
says to a Tory Back-Bencher, “You are out of your tiny
mind”, replied, “If the police think they will need them,
we will consider it”. The mayor, who also wants to be the next
Tory leader—possibly even more than the Home
Secretary—but who certainly does not want to be out-righted by
her and certainly also wants to curry favour with the same Taliban
tendency, said to the Met: “Are you sure you might not need
them?”. The Met said, “Okay—we’ll think
about it”, and so the process starts. Before you know it we are
in the process of buying three clapped-out German water cannon no one
else wants, which no one knows when they might need to use, and we run
the risk of them being deployed, which would make a difficult situation
worse and further alienate those with a

my 30 years of service for the Metropolitan Police I was involved in
public order policing at every rank. I started off with the Grunwick
trade dispute, was involved in the Lewisham, Southall and
Brixton riots, and was later trained as one of a cadre of advanced,
trained public order senior police officers. Not only was I trained in
dealing with serious public disorder, but I have been involved in
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000086">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T11:59:20"></hs_TimeCode>
was following those incidents to which I have referred that the
Metropolitan Police acquired and tested water cannon at its public
order training centre, at that time in Greenwich, in the 1980s. We
found that the water cannon we had were too slow and lacked
manoeuvrability. They took too long to fill up from the mains water
supply and, once full, the water lasted only a few minutes in use. It
was decided that water cannon was not a practical option and the idea
was
abandoned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000087">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T11:59:50"></hs_TimeCode>
is one, and only one situation, where, in my professional experience, I
believe that water cannon may be of use to the police service, and that
is to create distance between large stationary crowds throwing missiles
at, or in hand-to-hand combat with, police officers who are trying to
hold a line. The only significant example I can think of, as mentioned
by the noble Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, is the Countryside Alliance
protest of 2004 where, in order to try to 
<?notus-xml column=652?>create distance between police officers and protesters who appeared to
want to invade Parliament, terrible injuries were inflicted on the
crowd by officers using batons. Water cannon might have been effective
in reducing those injuries in those circumstances. While the injuries
were regrettable, Parliament being prevented from carrying out its
democratic functions when in session would have been
worse<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:04:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000088">However,
the question has to be asked whether water cannon would have been used
in such a situation, even if the Met had them available. As the noble
Lord, Lord Harris of Haringey, rightly pointed out, the police on that
occasion were caught out by the strength of feeling and the ferocity of
the attack on their lines. They had no idea that what they believed
would be a peaceful protest would result in such a determined effort to
overrun them. If they had thought this might happen, they would have
put police cordons at the entrances to Parliament Square and across
Abingdon Street, and used a network of barriers as well as police lines
to split and contain the crowd. If the crowd had been kept at some
distance from its target, it would probably not have been so determined
to surge into Parliament.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:01:45"></hs_TimeCode> point is
this: rarely do events happen on the UK mainland where water cannon
would be useful. Those situations usually result when the police are
surprised by the ferocity of the situation, and in such situations
water cannon would not be deployed in any
event<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:04:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000089">We

noble Lord, Lord Harris, said, if they are rarely to be seen, they will
not be on standby at every demonstration in case things get out of
hand. This begs two questions: why, then, are water cannon used by the
Police Service of Northern Ireland and why is the Metropolitan Police
Service asking for them now? I come to somewhat different conclusions
on that from those of the noble Lord, Lord Harris. Water cannon are
used in Northern Ireland reluctantly when, all too frequently, the
police come under attack trying to enforce the route of a march, or
when two communities attack each other at well known, traditional
flashpoints. Such situations are, sadly, not rare and, sadly,
predictable<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:03:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="140212154000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000090">As

Hugh Orde has carried out a rapid U-turn—something a water

described water cannon as “unwieldy” and “huge

locations, such

whole premise for the introduction of water cannon is to
prevent the sort of disorder we saw in the 2011 riots. Mark Rowley,
assistant commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, who has already been
mentioned, said that water cannon would be of particular use when there
was a clear target, citing the burning of shops in Croydon during the
riots and scenes in Millbank during the student protests as examples.
The Mayor of London, in the same meeting, in flat contradiction to the
assistant commissioner, when asked about the London riots and water
cannon said that

would he have authorised their use during the student protests. Despite

us be clear, policing in this country is based on consent—on the
public co-operating with and working with the police. The police must
do all they can to appear approachable, to be as much like ordinary
people as possible, and to be citizens in uniform doing what we would
do if we had their powers and training. What they must not do is appear
to be some alien force that has so little respect that the only way
they can maintain order is by force and the use of such weapons as
water cannon.</hs_para>

cannon could usefully be deployed only in very rare situations, and
even then the police are unlikely to have them available because these

conventional public-order tactics coupled with good intelligence and
pre-planning have been and will continue to be successful. Licensing
the use of water cannon, their purchase and use on the UK mainland
would be disproportionate and damaging to the reputation of the police

intervention in the gap. I served for 10 years on the
Northern Ireland Police Authority and, as has been referred to, we

occasions. The principal purpose of having them is to provide
separation between two groups or between one group and the police. The
reason for using them is to prevent having to move one step up: to
using baton rounds, which can be lethal. Water cannon is a less lethal

character over the years. We are not in the era of “Dixon of

water cannon, but I ask the Minister to consider, in discussions with
ACPO and others, whether there would be a stock of UK-wide availability

own. They could be drawn down from time to time.

admitting that the use of water cannon has little effect on the kind of
fast, agile disorder that we have seen in London, the report gave
examples, as previously referred to, of when they could have been used.
One was the Countryside Alliance march of 2010. I bow to the superior
policing knowledge of my noble friend Lord Harris and the noble Lord,
Lord Paddick, and I am no particular fan of the Countryside Alliance
given its obsession with fox hunting, as noble Lords will know.
However, the idea that the Met, on that occasion, could have used water
cannon against members 
<?notus-xml column=656?>of the Countryside Alliance would have done absolutely nothing to
improve the perception of some on that march that it was a town versus
country issue.</hs_parafo>

would in any way have improved relations in the city to use water
cannon on that occasion, or indeed during the student
protests last year. There were those who behaved appallingly and
dangerously, and there were some who behaved violently but it was a
long way from the kind of violent disorder that we saw when cannons
were used in Northern Ireland. For example, at the protests at
Whiterock and the Ardoyne in 2005, the police were under fire from live
rounds, cars were being set on fire and missiles
were being thrown. That is a very different situation from those we
have seen in London, whether with students or the Countryside Alliance.
The scenes of protest seen in Brazil recently travelled round the world
in real time. Following the Belfast protests last year, there was a
huge fear of their economic impact and of an international reputation
being destroyed. What impact would it have around the world to see
London under siege and cannons being employed? What would be the impact
on the economy of London, or on our visitors and tourists?</hs_para>

Lady Jones, said, the costs are well documented: you do not buy cheap
cannons. However, the Mayor of London has indicated that although the
Home Secretary has declined to contribute to the costs, he will find
the money should she license the use of the cannon. Initially, there
was some expectation that other police forces would have wanted to
contribute to the costs of police cannon. That now seems unlikely.
Already one police chief, as we have heard, said that they would

Mayor of London and ACPO have failed to convince their colleagues
across the country that involving water cannon in policing
demonstrations against the

officers in London than when the Government took office and I wonder
whether local police officers think that water cannon is the better use
of police resources in those circumstances. London is a wonderful
capital city. Like all cities, it has its problems but, in terms of
policing priorities, I have not been convinced yet by the arguments put
forward that water cannon are the answer. If the Home Secretary is to
grant a licence and if the Mayor of London wants to use
Londoners’ money to buy water cannon, the case needs to be far
stronger than it is at

issue. I know that the noble Baroness is concerned and she is therefore
right to use this opportunity to raise the issue. We have heard a lot

keen to ensure that the police have the tools and powers that they need

in England and Wales is, however, firmly grounded in the principle of
policing by consent. As such, it is quite right that that the
introduction of new police tools and equipment is the subject of public
and parliamentary debate. It is for this reason that I am pleased that
the Lord Mayor of London—I am sorry, the Mayor of London, who is
not a Member of this place; I apologise for that slip of the
tongue—is engaging the public on the potential use of water

is a well established process in place for authorising the police to
use equipment and systems that, without safeguards, have the capacity
to cause harm. Tasers and attenuating energy projectiles, which we all
know as baton rounds, have both been covered by this process, which
includes a final decision on authorisation being made by the Home

process will be followed for water cannon. It would require a formal
request for authorisation from the police and the submission of
detailed operational, technical and medical information on the likely
impact of the proposed system. This would include police statements
setting out the justification for the use of water cannon and how they
will be used. It would also include police guidance on the training and
checks and balances in place to ensure that their use is effective and
proportionate. A community impact assessment 
<?notus-xml column=658?>and an assessment by the Scientific Advisory Committee on the Medical
Implications of Less-Lethal Weapons, commonly referred to as SACMILL,
would help ensure that the risks associated with their use were
properly identified, understood and mitigated. The Home Secretary would
then consider carefully the request and the documentation presented to
her before making her decision. Parliament would be notified of the
Home Secretary’s decision, and the relevant documentation would
be laid in the House

where are we in the authorisation process for water cannon? The police
have indicated publicly that they would like water cannon and are
developing the materials necessary to support a request for
authorisation. A briefing document from the national policing lead for
conflict management, Chief Constable David Shaw, sets out the way in
which the police would use water cannon, the operational gap they
consider would be filled, and the checks and balances that would be in
place. This information is publicly available.</hs_para>

said that he wants to enable Londoners to have their say
before confirming his agreement. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, as a
member of the London Assembly Police and Crime Committee, is very close
to this matter and is rightly ensuring that a wide range of views are
sought and debated. This debate is part of that process. However, in
the interests of transparency and informing the current debate, the
police have made information publicly available on the Mayor’s
Office for Policing and Crime website. I believe that some noble Lords

noble Baroness, Lady Jones, and the noble Lord, Lord Harris, asked
about the sort of incidents in which water cannon might be used. The
police have indicated that they want to have access to water cannon as
one of their tools and tactics to deal with serious and violent
disorder. The examples that they have given include defending a fixed
and vulnerable or iconic location; separation of hostile crowds during
demonstration or disorder; creating distance between police and
opposing factions; and facilitating the advance of police resources and
other emergency services to deal with life-at-risk incidents during
incidents of severe disorder. The noble Lord, Lord Empey, demonstrated
how they had been used effectively in Northern Ireland in those sorts
of instances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:26:23"></hs_TimeCode>. So
there is some value in water cannon to policing, and the police have

useful<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:26:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:26:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Jones, drew attention to the use of water cannon on the continent,
and quoted an incident in Stuttgart where injuries had been caused. It
is not accurate to compare the use of water cannon in this country with
the use in other countries, because the use of water cannon in Northern
Ireland had no reported injuries. The regulatory regime for their use
in this country would be determined by SACMILL, as I explained, to
ensure that injuries were not the consequence of their

noble Lord, Lord Empey, also asked whether there would be an
opportunity for water cannon to be used elsewhere in the United
Kingdom. I have to emphasise that the position on this is for local
police units, and we have heard that not all local police and crime
commissioners and heads of regional police forces in this country agree
with the Met on this issue. It would be unreal to see water cannon
based here in London being shipped up to deal with activity somewhere
else in the country; the timelines do not, to my mind, make that a
viable proposition. So I think that we should disabuse ourselves of

Mawson:</Member></B> My Lords, the arts are currently facing two
significant challenges: first, cuts to arts education in schools; and,
secondly, cuts in funding, especially from local authorities. This
difficult financial landscape within which arts and cultural
organisations now sit is seen by some as an irresolvable crisis. For
others, however, there are opportunities to create more innovative and
entrepreneurial approaches that can enhance and expand arts and
culture. I would like to suggest that a new, more entrepreneurial
approach is now essential if many arts organisations are to survive and
thrive. Worryingly, the evidence suggests that this is not happening at
either the pace or scale that it needs to. We must ask ourselves
why.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=660?><hs_para UID="140212154000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000124">Numerous evaluations
demonstrate that the arts have a profound impact, especially on
disadvantaged children. I know this first-hand from 30 years of work in
east London, where the largest artistic community outside New York
lives. I have worked with many talented artists and musicians over the
years, developing successful projects and business start-ups with local
children and residents in some of the poorest housing estates in this
country. Arts organisations are essential to the well-being of our
society, and let us not forget that the arts and culture industry is
also central to our economy’s well-being. In 2007, the cultural
and creative industries accounted for 7.3% of the overall economy of
this country—comparable in size to the financial services
industry. I and many colleagues working in the arts believe that a
vibrant arts and cultural sector relies on a mixed economy and that
intelligent public investment is a part of that mix. As the economy
shows signs of recovery, I hope that the Government will prudently
adopt a long-term approach and constantly review public support of the
arts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000125">What of
the present? The majority of arts organisations across this country are
struggling to adapt to the Government’s cuts in statutory
funding, especially at the local authority level. The Government
urgently need to do more to encourage and support arts organisations to
think as creatively about their business models as they do about their
art. One of the most significant changes in our society over the past
30 years is the rise of the wealthy individual. We are told
that 1% of the population now pay one-third of all income tax, yet 40%
of the cultural and creative industries receive no private investment.
While larger organisations such as the Royal Opera House and the
National Theatre, which also receive the largest amounts of
subsidy, are successfully cultivating high net-worth donors, smaller
arts organisations often do not have the infrastructure to attract this
type of donor. They also understandably feel that they do not have a
product that is high profile enough for large donors to be interested
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000126">I
understand that one of Baroness Thatcher’s regrets was that the
increase in personal wealth during her time in office did not translate
into an increase in giving. We all know that the story is very
different in the US. It seems that few British arts organisations have
the practical knowledge to harness opportunities, such as social
investing, to rethink or enhance their business models. We must help
them to broaden their appeal beyond trusts, foundations, government and
big business to focus on coming up with innovative ways to encourage
individuals to support arts and culture, through both philanthropy and
social
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000127">It
has consistently been my experience that individuals involved in
building practical projects speak far more effectively on our key
social and economic issues than many of our politicians and so-called
experts. Perhaps, then, the way to part-address our current cultural
crises is to raise the profile and disseminate the practice of arts
organisations that have been successful in taking
entrepreneurial approaches to diversify their income base. They include
organisations such as the Derby Theatre, partnering with the University
of Derby as a live venue and training centre; the Albany in south-east
London, which bids for contracted services and is now
running the library; and the Live Theatre Company
in 
<?notus-xml column=661?>Newcastle, which uses innovative development of
capital assets to provide sustainable income streams. These
organisations are bucking the trend and taking on board a more
entrepreneurial
approach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000128">I
am proud to have been recently involved in one such innovative arts
project—the Conservatoire in Blackheath, south-east London, and
here I declare an interest as chairman of the trustees. I thought that
it might be helpful if I shared with the House the journey that this
organisation has undertaken during the past year, the lessons we have
learnt and the key practical outcomes that we have delivered. I was
asked to chair the Conservatoire in Blackheath 14 months ago. This arts
charity was founded in south-east London in 1881 and is the
city’s oldest multi-arts venue, offering music and art lessons
to local children and adults. Each week, around 100 talented tutors
teach music and art to more than 1,600 people, ranging in age from six
months to 90
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000129">In
January 2013, the Conservatoire was a week away from handing over its
keys to the bank that financed it. Its core business model was
unsustainable: the margins on music lessons did not cover the costs,
the buildings were neglected and cash flow was critical. The
organisation was facing foreclosure and staff and tutors had faced
empty pay packets before Christmas. Most organisations would have
folded, but the Conservatoire was fortunate. It had a new CEO—an
American social entrepreneur called Sydney Thornbury, who invited me to
take the helm and bring in a new group of experienced trustees. We
entrepreneurs saw the problem as an opportunity for fresh
thinking.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000130">Our
ambitious plan focused on creating a sustainable business model for the
new financial landscape. It included forging a crucial strategic
partnership with City Lit, Europe’s leading provider of adult
education, and bringing together an American pyramid fundraising model
to raise the £175,000 of bridge funding that we needed to get
from the old model to the new. In just six weeks, the fundraising
campaign smashed its target, raising a total of £220,000. Donors
included an angel donor, who gave an incredible £25,000, as well
as local children who donated their pocket money. Money
quite clearly followed ideas and commitment. The fundraising campaign
enabled the Conservatoire to embark on an ambitious plan of building
works, renovation and
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000131">The
Conservatoire has positioned itself back in the heart of its community.
The community came together in an extraordinary display of support to
save the Conservatoire. Now, the Conservatoire can once again
successfully serve its community because our strategic plan has
provided us with both a long-term sustainable income model and a major
enhancement of the organisation’s offer for the community. The
new vision positions the Conservatoire as a dynamic arts organisation
reaching people from a cross-section of the community through both its
paid classes and large-scale social impact
projects.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000132">Our
plans do not stop there: we are thinking ahead. With the first phase of
City Lit classes successfully up and running, the Conservatoire is now
embarking on raising the money needed to launch
phase two of the plan. This will see the development of the final two 
<?notus-xml column=662?>studios that are necessary to fulfil its sustainable income model and
enable 300 additional classes to run, bringing the organisation to
self-sufficiency and beyond. The Conservatoire will source these funds
through both traditional fundraising and social investment loans from
individuals who want to take advantage of the Government’s new
tax incentives for social
investing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000133">The
best way to find new and enhanced national models of fundraising for
the arts is, first, to demonstrate new thinking locally. The
Conservatoire is still navigating deep waters but we hope, in time, to
connect our pioneering model to the wider legacy developments to the
north in the Lower Lea Valley. This development will, it is hoped,
inspire a more creative and entrepreneurial rethink of arts funding
nationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000134">However,
if we are to help the arts sector to survive and learn not just from
this project but from the other entrepreneurial projects mentioned
previously, the Government need to join in the grown-up, challenging
and even radical conversation that we are initiating. How does the
sector revolutionise and enhance funding models for sustainability in
the “new normal”? This is a particularly important
conversation to be had at local authority level, and we want to work
closely with the
LGA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000135">Peter

government needs to value practical people. Civil servants often think
their way into action; entrepreneurs are about learning by doing and

actively enable an entrepreneurial culture to flourish. The
Government’s new tax breaks on social investing, which the
Conservatoire plans to put to use in April this year, will do much to

this I just want to concentrate my remarks on one particular thing.
People whose lives are enriched by the arts, as they are, and people
who come to this country and enrich it because of our arts and our
heritage are all, I think, very moved by some of our greatest
buildings. One thinks of the great public buildings in London but I
think particularly of the cathedrals and parish churches of this
country. I say to my noble friend that I am one of those who is very
concerned by recent proposed changes in English Heritage. I completely
understand why the Government have decided that they want to divide
English Heritage and give it an endowment to look after the buildings
under its own control—there are some very fine and marvellous
buildings—and why they wish to have another branch, probably to
be called Historic England, which will give all the technical advice
and support and be in charge of listing and all the rest of it. But
there is a potential catastrophe in this
change<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:42:28"></hs_TimeCode> because
English Heritage’s powers to give grants to buildings which it
does not itself possess will have gone.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140212154000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000140">I have the great good
fortune of living in the wonderful city of Lincoln, which has—I
do not want to be provocative or divisive—what I consider to be
the finest of all our cathedrals, but what everybody, I think, would
agree is one of our greatest cathedrals. It costs
£50,000 a week to keep Lincoln Cathedral open, without a penny
being spent on restoration or maintenance. Over recent years Lincoln
Cathedral has been able to look to English Heritage, which is extremely
generous and helpful and has given £250,000 most years. That has
now gone. There is a real problem, and that problem can be repeated up
and down the country. Some people might ask, “What about the
Heritage Lottery Fund?”. That is a wonderful organisation and we
in Lincoln are benefiting from it at the moment in that we have had a
grant of £12 million towards a project called Lincoln Castle
Revealed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:43:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000141">However,
the Heritage Lottery Fund has its criteria, which include inclusiveness
and how many people come and what sort of people. I do not quarrel with
that at all. But what I do say is that there has to be a source of
funds directed to buildings for their intrinsic beauty, worth and
historic interest. That source used to be English Heritage; it will be
no more. I believe that, in the case of our great historic
cathedrals—we have 27 truly important medieval cathedrals in
this country, and there are 42 in all—we ought to have a
separate endowment fund, similar to the endowment fund that the
Government are giving to English Heritage for its own purposes, to
sustain our cathedrals. Any country that allowed the west front of
Wells or Lincoln, the spire of Salisbury, the tower of Durham or any of
our great edifices to be in danger of collapse could not begin to call
itself civilised, or claim that it had a proper Government of a
civilised country.</hs_para>

know that the present Government would never wish to be in that
position, but what I would say to my noble friend who is to reply to
the debate is this. We have to recognise that these buildings are of
incomparable worth, where one comes perhaps closer to the soul of our
nation than anywhere else. They demand and cry out for the sort of
support that is not currently being given but that will need to be
given in the future.</hs_para>

that the value of an art form can be measured by the wealth it
produces, having contributed £4.6 billion to the UK economy in
2011 and a wealth of provocative, engaging and beautiful moving image.
But while it is easy to quantify art that successfully makes an
economic impact, it is harder to account for the delicate ecosystem
which allows that success to flourish. A spreadsheet tells only part of

arts sector measured in economic outputs creates a bias towards certain
kinds of art, a bias towards the capital, and a bias towards large,
well funded institutions which leaves the vast majority of the arts and
practitioners of the arts behind. The November 2013 report,
<I>R</I><I>ebalancing our </I><I>C</I><I>ultural

in arts spend outside London over the past two decades. Further work by
the same authors shows that just four institutions in the capital
receive more lottery funding than do the 33 local authorities, home to
6 million people, at the bottom of the list. These local
authorities are predominantly although not exclusively in the north,
but they all cover areas that are already challenged by other symptoms
of deprivation and where current and prospective local authority cuts
are biting most deeply. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation predicts that
local authorities will have to cut any services they have no legal
obligation to provide. I think we all know that local authority funding
is disproportionately important to the artistic community outside the
capital.</hs_para>

only from a disproportionate amount of lottery funding, it receives the
greatest proportion of public investment in other ways and attracts the
lion’s share of business sponsorship and private philanthropy. I
would vigorously assert the need for world-class arts organisations in
the capital, but we must consider how to protect and deliver the same
values and benefits to citizens elsewhere. Many of them are major
contributors to the lottery through the purchase of tickets, but they
suffer a measurable deficit of benefit.</hs_para>

as the National Theatre feeds the West End, the National itself relies
on an ecosystem where talent is nurtured in regional theatres all over

the Royal Shakespeare Company and many other of our great

contributors—have honed their skills in regional theatre. What
we fund now, in all corners of the UK, will create the practitioners
and aesthetic of the future—a vibrant and ever changing
aesthetic that has made our theatre envied and loved the world over.

suggest that the communities that contribute most to lottery funds
ensure that they benefit proportionally from their distribution? Given
the enormous cuts to local authority funding at a time when their
duties have increased and their efficiency savings are largely
complete, could not Her Majesty’s Government consider making

Lord Bishop of Worcester:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Mawson, for securing this debate and I pay tribute to
the wonderful work that he has done in this area over many years, as I
do to the noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, who has similarly done wonderful
work. I claim no particular expertise, although I am passionate about
the arts—perhaps that is something to do with the fact that it
is sometimes said that many clergy are failed
actors.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000151">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:52:56"></hs_TimeCode>
is fortuitous that this debate is happening on the day of the launch of
a study, report and review by the British Academy, <I>Prospering
Wisely: How the Humanities and Social Sciences Enrich our Lives</I>.
That report makes it clear that this country’s exemplary record
in taking seriously these disciplines and the arts and learning from
them is one of the major factors which make it as civilised as it is.
They hold up a mirror to society and enable us to reflect on what makes
for a good life and a healthy society. The same is true of the 
<?notus-xml column=666?>arts in general. In an age when the triumph of utilitarianism and
consumerism sometimes seems to me to be almost complete, we need to
remember that phrase, “prospering wisely”, which comes
from King Alfred the
Great<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:53:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:53:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000152">However,
there are real difficulties, as has been suggested, particularly in the
provinces. Worcester boasts a wonderful arts organisation, Worcester
Live, which is entrepreneurial in just the way that has been commended,
but it is labouring under very difficult conditions because the green
shoots of recovery have not yet found their way into people’s
pockets. At the same time, county council funding has been reduced by
90% and there is no Arts Council funding, which, as been pointed out,
tends to go to flagship venues. That is a matter of real concern. I
suggest that one way to ease the situation would be for the Government
to consider the distribution of lottery funding, which used to be much
easier to apply for and broader in its remit.</hs_para>

the midst of this era of financial stringency. The city of Worcester
has at its centre a wonderful, imaginative new development entitled The
Hive, which is a joint venture by the city council and the University
of Worcester. They have together built The Hive, a library. The fact
that they are working together in just the sort of partnership that has
been commended is of great benefit to both the city and university in
terms of availability of publications, opening hours and sharing of
costs. It is an example of the imaginative partnership that should be
encouraged elsewhere. At the same time, partly through the generosity
of a local benefactor, there is an exciting plan soon to turn a part of
the old porcelain factory into a state-of-the-art arts centre, so that
Worcester’s fine artistic tradition can be developed yet
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000154">As
the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, made clear, churches and cathedrals are
at the centre of our cultural heritage and make an enormous
contribution to the ongoing cultural and artistic life of this country.
That is very much true of Worcester, which will be holding the Three
Choirs festival again this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:56:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000155">Despite
all the pressures that exist on funding, I hope that, as a result of
this debate, the Government will consider some of the suggestions that
have already been proffered in order to do everything possible to
encourage the arts and culture: in particular, by facilitating
philanthropy, which has benefited us very greatly in Worcester,
although it is still not as well developed as it might be; by enabling
the sort of imaginative partnerships to which reference has been made
during the course of the debate; and by looking again at how lottery
funding is
distributed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000156">Finally,
as the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, suggested, the Government should
recognise that cathedrals and churches stand at the very heart of our
cultural heritage and, as he put it so beautifully, reflect the soul of
this country. They receive no direct government funding at the moment.
The parish churches of our country, a wonderful gem, are looked after
and maintained by small numbers of worshippers. It would be good if the
Government recognised the importance of those buildings to our culture,
in the way that the noble Lord suggested, by thinking again about what
is happening with English 
<?notus-xml column=667?>Heritage. They are everyone’s heritage. It is to our benefit as a
nation that they should be maintained and

Earl of Clancarty (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, at the latest
Performers’ Alliance All-Party Parliamentary Group meeting last
month, we heard a presentation of the second Delphi study, <I>In
Battalions</I>, by Fin Kennedy and Helen Campbell Pickford. I came away
from that presentation with three concerns in particular. The first is
the key question they identified from discussion with those working in
theatre: in what ways can theatre-makers, theatres and the Arts Council
work together to help to protect risk-taking on new work and new
talent, without creating significant
expense<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T12:58:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000158">The
second concern which became clear was that the arts organisation most
at risk is the organisation of one, the playwright, the individual
artist who, if not wholly, certainly significantly provides the raison
d’être for the existence of the larger arts
organisations, the theatres and companies which facilitate new
work. That is after acknowledging that there is much
collaborative work within the theatre, as within the arts as a whole.
If that crucial individual risk-taking and experimentation is not
nurtured, the arts will not progress but
stagnate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000159">At
the same event, we heard presentations from Giles Croft, artistic
director of the Nottingham Playhouse, and from Elizabeth Newman,
associate director of the Bolton Octagon. The message that rang out
loud and clear was how increasingly difficult and time-consuming it is
to try to balance the books and bring through new work, rather than
rely on tried and tested
productions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000160">My
third concern is that it is entirely clear to those working in the
arts, if not to the Government, that there is no substitute
for public funding. Nothing really replaces what it achieves. Arts
organisations are being told to “adapt”, a euphemism for
becoming more commercial so that they may survive, but that change
means that the very thing that made them worth while in the first place
is in danger of being lost. This potential loss of risk-taking,
entirely due to a lack of funding, becomes a more critical problem the
further away we go from London.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140212154000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000161">In the year since the
regional debate on the arts introduced by the noble Baroness, Lady
Quin, much has already changed. We have had the report <I>Rebalancing
</I><I>Our Cultural Capital</I>, mentioned by noble Baroness, Lady
Kidron,<I> </I>showing that public spending on the arts is
now 15 times greater in London than in the regions. Indeed, the
Nottingham Playhouse, which is facing a possible 100% cut in grant from
the local council, is located in the East Midlands region, which this
report identifies as being the most affected. The devastating Local
Government Association report of 2012 is now joined by last
year’s equally devastating Joseph Rowntree Foundation study,
which predicts that arts and cultural funding by local councils may
fall within a few years to almost nothing, and in December we had
further local authority funding
cuts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000162">In the
short term, I am pessimistic about the discrepancy of funding between
London and the regions. The discrepancy is increasing mainly because
public funding is being cut—local authority funding, of course, 
<?notus-xml column=668?>but also the decreased reserves of core funding
that will inevitably be hoovered up by London and the bigger
institutions. Things will not change substantially until two things
happen: first, the funding cuts are reversed and, secondly, the regions
and the regional cities obtain greater autonomy, because arts and
culture will follow political power. In this sense, of course, the arts
are in the same boat as every other area of government subsidy. The
regions need to be making their own funding decisions for their own
arts production as well as services, and they need to have the money to
do so. In addition, a future Government must bring in statutory
provision for the
arts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000163">We have
a Government who are interested in the arts and creative industries as
an export product and for tourism, but are less interested in how the
arts are nurtured and produced. I ask the Minister whether the DCMS
could take a careful look at the composition of the Creative Industries
Council, which helps to formulate policy and which has both a strong
global and London-centric feel. It looks outwards but it does not back
inwards towards arts production across the whole of the UK. There is no
sense of that geography, and that is important.</hs_para>

the Minister is the same one that I posed to the noble Lord, Lord Nash,
at Question Time today. How important do the Government think arts
education in schools is as a pipeline into the creative industries,
which we hear are now worth £8 million an hour to the UK
economy? If the Government think that it is important then the DCMS
should be concerned at the continuing fall in the take-up of art and
design subjects in schools, as well as the threat that exists to arts
higher
education.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/0EE2E18BEA7F9857F6BB63D1C15E3473096B9258" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 February 2014">Wednesday,

Aberdare (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Mawson has
done well to give arts and culture a brief look-in before we rise for
the Recess. I shall focus on classical music but it is clear from the
debate so far that many of the issues are widely shared across the
cultural sector. Two weeks ago the <I>Times</I> had an article
headlined, “Orchestras gain fans but lose money”, based
on a recent survey by the Association of British Orchestras. This
highlighted concerns that real-terms reductions in funding could lead
to UK orchestras losing their place in the top flight
internationally.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="140212154000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000166">One of the strengths
of the UK arts funding model is that it is based on a mix of funding
sources. Public funding, from national bodies such as the Arts Council
and the National Lottery as well as from local authorities, is a vital
part of the mix, representing over one-third of orchestras’
income, but it is supplemented by private contributions—almost
20% of the total—while nearly half of orchestras’ income
is earned through ticket sales and other commercial activities. In the
current financial landscape, all these funding sources are under
pressure: Arts Council funding is declining, but not as sharply as that
of many local authorities; ticket income is down, despite rising
audiences; and business support is flat at best. Individual
philanthropy shows a welcome increase, but is not nearly enough to
begin to replace public funds, is concentrated in London much more than
in the regions and is often focused on specific projects rather than on
core funding.</hs_para>

debate, I have heard about challenges facing virtually all music
organisations and activities. There are concerns about the future
funding of music education and the delivery of the national plan for
music education. The quality of the training provided by the
UK’s leading music conservatoires is a key factor in creating
and sustaining the UK’s international success in all forms of
music. This depends heavily on the premium funding they receive to help
cover the shortfall between the tuition fees that they can charge their
students and the actual cost of providing that individual, intensive,
one-on-one tuition, which can be up to £15,000 or
£17,000.This funding has not yet been confirmed for
2014-15<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:05:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

bodies, such as the National Opera Studio, of which I am a
modest supporter, depend on the availability of funding and support to
develop the talents of young performers with the potential
to become the leading artists of their generation. The music
sector generally is concerned at the possible impact of planned
copyright exceptions, representing a potential shift of value away from
content creators, without corresponding compensation or
benefits.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000169">I
recognise that the Government share the desire to support the creative
sector, and also that it would be unrealistic to expect substantial
extra funding for music and other art forms from either central or
local government at present. I therefore hope that the Minister will
look into other ways of easing some of the pressures on music
organisations. First, everything possible should be done to protect the
existing level of public funding for music and arts organisations,
including from local authorities, where the challenges may be greatest.
I was hugely impressed by a recent visit to High House Production Park
in Purfleet, where the Royal Opera House is working in partnership with
other creative sector bodies and Thurrock Borough Council to plan and
deliver an ambitious cultural entitlement agenda for the borough,
including a scenery workshop, a planned costume centre, a training
centre offering creative sector apprenticeships, artists’
studios and more. What can the Minister do to encourage more such
initiatives?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000170">Conservatoires
could be helped to plan ahead with greater confidence by giving them
some reassurance about the continuation of the exceptional
funding they receive, preferably for more than one year
ahead. Young artists undergoing training should be eligible for schemes
to promote skills development and employment of young people, perhaps
by extending the Arts Council’s well regarded Creative
Employment Programme to support more initiatives such as the UK Music
Skills Academy. I applaud the Government’s desire to promote
individual philanthropy, but there is surely scope for further
encouragement and incentives, such as extending gift aid on admissions
to include arts
charities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000171">Creative
content providers must get a fair deal from copyright exceptions. Young
people interested in the creative sector need to be made aware of the
importance of intellectual property issues. The Intellectual Property
Office, in partnership with UK Music, has just launched 
<?notus-xml column=670?>an app, Music Inc, aimed at 14 to 18 year-olds for
this very purpose. What can the Minister do to encourage take-up by
schools?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000172">I
also strongly support my noble friend Lord Mawson’s plea, echoed
by my noble friend Lord Clancarty, for the Government to help the music
sector apply its own creative and entrepreneurial skills to expand its
sources of support, for example through crowdfunding or social
media-based initiatives.</hs_para>

represent a huge and valuable asset to the UK. Of course money is
tight, but with the vast array of talent available among our musicians,
schools, conservatoires, training bodies, orchestras and opera
companies, and the goodwill and support of government at all levels,
and of all of us who are passionate about the arts, the UK can surely
continue to lead the world in the range, quality and sheer brilliance

a topical and challenging question: to what extent should government

we have to acknowledge the backdrop to this debate, which is that of
course the arts make a substantial economic contribution to this
country. They make Britain an attractive place to visit, to live, and
to invest in. The noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, made a good point about
the delicate ecosystem that underpins this arrangement. It is not just
about economic advantage. A whole range of other advantages come from
our thriving arts culture, including improvements to the
nation’s health and well-being and the provision of a critical
impetus for regional economic regeneration around the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:10:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000177">However,
there is a real danger that we are taking this global advantage for
granted rather than investing in and nurturing the next generation of
creative performers and leaders. Nowhere is that complacency starker
than in the sidelining of arts subjects in the national curriculum,
which this House has debated on a number of occasions. Those subjects
are being systematically dropped by ambitious schools that want to be
seen to be performing well and moving up the league tables. As a
result, the take-up of GCSEs in subjects like music, art and drama is
falling. That is combined with a squeeze on funding for specialist
teachers in schools and the failure of alternative initiatives such as
the community music hubs to take off in a systematic way.</hs_para>

a number of noble Lords have already argued, this neglect of the arts
in schools is exacerbated by the funding pressures on local community
and regional arts centres. Those are the places where young people 
<?notus-xml column=671?>get their first real taste of watching or participating in live events.
They can inspire and thrill, sowing the seeds of a lifelong love of the
arts in young people—and in those places we find the risk takers

local councils are increasingly being forced to prioritise their
limited spending on the statutory services for which they are
responsible. Therefore, even though many of them understand the
importance of the arts as having value in themselves and also playing a
role in attracting businesses and visitors, the burden of the 33% cuts
takes an inevitable toll on the local cultural life they are able to
fund. The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:12:09"></hs_TimeCode> Arts
Council has repeatedly made the point that it cannot be expected to
plug the hole in local government arts expenditure. In any case how

substantial cuts—reduced by 30% in one year alone?</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, challenges us to find new ways to help
fund arts organisations, my answer is that he is right to pose the
question, but the prerequisite must be a greater recognition across
government of the centrality of the arts to our nation’s
success, both now and in the future. That cross-government challenge is
not being addressed appropriately by the Government at this time.
Perhaps the Minister can address that in his response.</hs_para>

is lacking is a sustainable funding model that has buy-in from all
sectors. It should include a statutory provision for national and local
government and a new definition of the role of arm’s-length
bodies and of the lottery, as well as identifying newer sources of
finding, including the role that innovative tax incentives can play.
For example, the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:13:45"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have made great play of the increased role that individuals
can play, and undoubtedly more can be done. However, all the
evidence so far points to philanthropic giving being focused on the
large institutions, with smaller local and regional organisations being
squeezed out. We could also do a great deal more to transform the
banking sector so that it better understands the role that the cultural
sector can play and is prepared to invest in those
start-ups.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000182">What
is lacking is a cross-departmental plan to look at the sector afresh,
realise the many benefits it brings in cash and in kind and underpin it
with a realistic financial strategy. The alternative is a route of
decline and frustration which will rob our economy of a great
opportunity and our young people of a vibrant, creative future. I look

concerns.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/08DAC7156CAF71D1D931031E75079596A83AC2EC" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 February 2014">Wednesday,

Gardiner of Kimble (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate
the noble Lord, Lord Mawson, on securing this debate and, indeed,
acknowledge the great practical experience that he brings to it. The
debate has been illuminating with so much expertise having been shown
across the House. Some of your Lordships have expressed 
<?notus-xml column=672?>concern about this issue but I say at the outset that the Government
strongly support the arts and culture. I hope that, during the few
moments I have in which to speak, I can demonstrate how and why the
Government feel so strongly about
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000185">Over<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:15:19"></hs_TimeCode>
the lifetime of this Parliament, the Government have put in about
£7 billion of public and lottery funding into the arts, museums
and heritage sectors. Despite necessary pressures on government
spending—your Lordships are aware of the economic climate in
which we live—the importance of the arts and museums was
recognised in the previous spending round. The DCMS provides grant in
aid funding to the Arts Council England, the British Film Institute, 15
sponsored museums, the British Library and the Renaissance programme
for regional museums. Many of your Lordships have mentioned the
regions, which I will also refer to. We also secured a strong capital
settlement for English Heritage, the National Heritage Memorial Fund
and the Churches Conservation Trust. My noble friend Lord Cormack spoke
passionately about cathedrals and I know that Lincoln Cathedral has a
very special place in his heart. I am aware of its at-risk status, so I
am very conscious of what he said. I am also very conscious of what the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester said about cathedrals
and churches<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Government are actively considering ways to support cathedrals. I
would very much welcome having a conversation with my noble friend and,
indeed, the right reverend Prelate, after this debate so that we can
have a proper talk about these matters because cathedrals and churches
are very much part of the fabric of our
nation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:16:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000186">Our
rich heritage and vibrant culture of art, film, literature, dance and
music delight and inspire the nation as well as the world. I make no
apology for saying that the UK creative industries were worth
£71.4 billion in 2012 and are, indeed, outperforming many other
sectors of our economy. The noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, with all her
experience of filmmaking, sees much going on which is of great value to
many
people<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:17:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000187">From
April 2012, we increased the share of National Lottery funding for the
arts to 20%, which I think was a very positive step. The Arts
Council’s investment programme for 2015 is now open, with
£570 million available from the Arts Council to invest in the
arts and museums in 2015-16. The Arts Council also offered an
additional fund for libraries as well as a creative industry finance
scheme offering business development support for creative industry
enterprises. In addition, the Heritage Lottery Fund has around
£375 million a year to invest in new
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:18:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000188">As
regards philanthropy, we are working with cultural organisations in
London and the regions to encourage the development of other sources of
income, including philanthropic giving and independent fundraising. In
our opinion, philanthropy is not a substitute for public subsidy but
should be seen as one element of a mixed-funding model. The noble Lord,
Lord Mawson, spoke powerfully about this mix and gave examples of
success derived from the entrepreneurial spirit and, indeed, most
importantly, from community engagement. I congratulate him and the
local community at Blackheath 
<?notus-xml column=673?>on providing such a great asset for the community and beyond. Being an
“original green”, I was very taken by the comments of the
noble Baroness, Lady Kidron, on the ecosystem because we want to secure
a future for talent across the country. The skills and apprenticeships
in the creative industries are a vital part of the next generation
being part of this great
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:19:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000189">The
department, in partnership with the Arts Council and the Heritage
Lottery Fund, established a £100-million Catalyst
programme—a private-giving investment initiative for arts and
heritage organisations. Indeed, I read the article on orchestras that
the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, spoke about, and I was relieved that a
number of orchestras have been supported through the Catalyst
endowments awards fund. I was also interested in what your Lordships
said about regional funding. I make no particular plug for London,
having so many interests outside London. I am thinking here of the
Philharmonia Orchestra, which may be based in London and gains funding,
but which spends much of its existence outside London touring, as do so
many organisations in the theatre
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:20:41"></hs_TimeCode>. The Arts
Council has invested £400 million over this Parliament in
classical music organisations. I am, however, very much aware of what
was said in that article and we need to see whether there are ways in
which we can sustain and support them in what are challenging times. I
am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare, for raising that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:20:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000190">Catalyst
has awarded more than 400 grants to help numerous organisations
strengthen their fundraising abilities and diversify their revenue
sources. The DCMS is also looking at ways in which private giving can
be increased through tax incentives. The noble Earl, Lord Clancarty,
talked of tax reliefs. The film, high-end TV and animation tax reliefs
have been vital in supporting our creative industries, and we will be
consulting shortly on a theatre tax relief, which will be helpful in
both London and the
regions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:21:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000191">Turning
to the community arts sector, there are approximately 49,000 community
arts groups in England, with an estimated 9.4 million people
participating in arts-based activities on a regular basis. I suspect
that many of those are the sorts of people that the noble Baroness,
Lady Kidron, would be thinking of. Unlocking new revenue streams can be
challenging for those organisations, and the Cabinet Office, alongside
the Arts Council, the DCMS and a group of other organisations, is
exploring the development of a fund to provide long-term social
investment capital to arts organisations. I shall certainly be
reporting back on this debate and the remarks that have been made by
your Lordships, particularly those made by the noble Lord, Lord Mawson,
on the entrepreneurial spirit and, indeed, his own experiences of
that.</hs_para>

on investment through the Cabinet Office’s existing investment

provides grants to social ventures. There are many ways in which this
Government support culture across the country beyond direct monetary
investment. To promote our exceptional arts, cultural and heritage
institutions overseas, the Government’s GREAT campaign continues
to promote 
<?notus-xml column=674?>the best of what Britain has to offer. In 2013, the total value of
tourism spend directly and indirectly in Britain is projected to be
£127 billion—9% of the UK economy. I say that not just
for the economy, as it were. I speak of it because of the employment
that it provides, and the entrepreneurial and apprenticeship
opportunities. That is the mix that we should be seeking to secure.
Culture is central to that campaign. Our iconic cultural assets are
often the most easily recognisable statement of what makes Britain

activities focusing on access to finance, skills, exports and inward
investment, copyright, and data collection. We are working with the

particularly about cuts. I acknowledge those. I understand why there is
concern. It is why many councils are looking innovatively at how they
develop services differently and more efficiently. That is why the Arts

local authorities and there are so many examples—whether you
look at the Hepworth Wakefield, the Mary Rose in Portsmouth or the City

ways to find new ways of doing things and setting up new partnerships.

make cuts and that the burdens on Defra are immense due to the
floods—burdens which are likely to be increased as a result of
climate change—but the management of our forests and woodlands

understand that the Government have categorically said that the public
forest estate must remain in public ownership, and I am grateful, but
it is imperative that the necessary safeguards are in place to ensure
that our public forests are truly secure. Establishing a body that

I recognise that the board must consider economic objectives as well as
public value with commercial freedoms while protecting the estate, but
there must be a balance, and this balance must be reflected in the

right to appeal to the Secretary of State against decisions taken by
the board of the new public body is simply not enough. They need powers
to intervene when decisions are taken by the board which are
detrimental to the public forest estate, for example in relation to
land sales. Will the Minister confirm that it is currently the

neither my party nor my friends in the forest will rest until we are

at it nationwide, over our land as a whole. But how will all this
be achieved? There is a remarkable array of agencies,
organisations and initiatives, all committed to supporting biodiversity
and sustainable growth in our woods and forests. The hope must be that
they will work together and co-ordinate their endeavours, but even more

way to ensure that development does not lead to erosion of natural
capital assets is a well designed biodiversity offsetting scheme. The
Government’s Green Paper consultation on biodiversity offsetting
is now concluded. Liberal Democrats are clear that the guiding
principle for any offsetting scheme should be that there is
a net environmental and biodiversity gain. Equally, and in contrast to
the views of the Secretary of State, habitats such as ancient woodlands
are irreplaceable, and as such should not be included in any
scheme.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="140212154000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000229">Decisions
about biodiversity offsetting are important for the future of the
public forest estate, given that it has huge potential to provide
offset sites for any market-based scheme. It is ideally placed to
deliver landscape-scale projects and the wider benefits that they can
deliver. The Lawton report in 2010 made clear that nature areas that
are linked together have a greater ecological value than similar areas
of natural environment that are broken up and separated. This view was
endorsed in the Government’s 2011 environment White Paper. Given
its importance to the future of the public forest estate, can the
Minister say when the Government will make clear their intentions about
introducing a biodiversity offsetting
scheme?</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0001.htm#140212154000230">All
three legislatures in England, Scotland and Wales are keen to see
substantial levels of new woodland planting over a substantial period.
It is important that non-market values are taken into account in
decisions about the future locations of Britain’s new woodlands,
thereby ensuring that we maximise the value for agriculture and timber
outputs, climate change mitigation and recreational opportunities. This
would make a reality of the threefold mandate, as outlined
in the core principles for the new public forestry estate of enhancing
the estate for the benefit of people, nature and the economy.</hs_para>

we do not do that, we face the danger of locating new forests in areas
that do not deliver all the benefits that society and the economy need.
We could pick locations, for example, that maximise value of timber
production but do not help tackle flooding in key catchments, or
maximise greenhouse gas capture but do not help to increase
recreational opportunities near our major urban conurbations. Such
decisions need to be looked at using the right decision-making
framework, and I therefore look forward this spring to the annual 
<?notus-xml column=681?>update from the Natural Capital Committee, set up by this Government, on
its work in ensuring that natural capital accounting is embedded in

of hedgerows and land drainage improvements, as well as domestic
building, have increased flow levels into the rivers. 30 years ago,

just dredging, though this will help, but tree planting in the upper
reaches of the system and other measures to slow flows onto the levels
down. A 5 year old tree plantation can absorb 60 times the water of

Big Tree Plant funding scheme, run by Forestry Commission England, is
giving £4 million in grants to community organisations between
2011 and 2015 to support the planting of 1 million trees, but the
question I want to ask is: what will happen after 2015? This needs to
be a long-term project that enhances the urban environment.
Anecdotally, I know of two communities that feel that their local
council positively discourages tree planting in urban areas. I hope
that local councils will be required to address this important area in
the legislation for which the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, is rightly
calling.</hs_parafo>

share a thought about the potential of woodland in addressing another
challenge—namely the acute shortage of land for burial. There
are now around 40 woodland burial sites in the UK. In my own diocese of
St Albans we have our own St Albans Woodland Burial Trust,
which is in north Bedfordshire near the village of Keysoe. It is 12
acres of land surrounded by 60 acres of
woodland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000238">There
is a very real and sensible concern, as the noble Lord, Lord Eden,
pointed out, about the economics of how all this will work—how
we are to pay for the upkeep of our woodlands as the surpluses from the
sale of timber are likely to decline because we have, of course, been
harvesting it rather effectively. In some places there is the
potential—admittedly very small potential—for a small
section of woodland to be used for green burials.</hs_para>

site, a single grave space costs £700; to bury cremated remains
cost £180. You have to be buried in a biodegradable coffin. You
can have only a wooden memorial—you cannot have stone
headstones—so eventually they will simply disintegrate and rot
way and the woodland will be left as woodland. In addition, many people
want to plant a tree in memory 
<?notus-xml column=683?>of their loved one, and for that privilege they are paying £100 a
time. In other words, they are paying to plant the forest. Some of
these sites are cared for by volunteers, so the cost is
small—just a few hours’ administration, as in our own
diocesan woodland burial site. Could this not be one small way in which
we can pay for the planting of more trees and find a modest amount of
further funding for our
woodlands<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:56:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/E6715EE8F9771D9CA620FB6379C5C17B37A61B40" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 12 February 2014">Wednesday,

Patten (Con):</Member></B> I am very happy to follow the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of St Albans in his very clear exposé of the
close links between flooding and forestry and woodlands, and I agree
with everything that he said. However, one way of mitigating flood risk
is by trees in catchment areas fixing soil and diminishing run-off,
whether they are part of the public or the private forest estate. A
great strength of the independent panel’s report is that it does
not erect a conceptual iron curtain between the two spheres in its
powerful recommendations, rather it links the public and the private
estates. I know that that is welcomed by the noble Baroness, Lady
Royall of
Blaisdon<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:56:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000241">These
recommendations are far-sighted stuff, as one would expect from
anything chaired by Bishop James—a man of great spirituality,
huge insight and equally great intellectual bandwidth, which has
enabled him to range, as he has in recent years, over everything from
helping victims in Hillsborough seek some kind of solace to his great
report on woodlands and forests with his colleagues. The
recommendations say clearly that England’s woods and forests
should be revalued for all that they provide, from recreation via clean
air and water to wildlife habitats and flood reduction. That was
prescient stuff when the then Lord Bishop of Liverpool wrote it with
his colleagues back in 2012. Living in Somerset I recognise that it was
indeed very prescient—we have much flooding but some of the
lowest acreage of woodland in southern England. Both the polders that
are the levels in Somerset and the few patches of woodland that we have
are manmade. There is no ancient forest of any sort at all. What is
there is in specimen trees, coppices and shelter
belts<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

right reverend Prelates would recognise, from every stance, planting
any tree is an act of faith. Few of us live long enough to see a
sapling in magnificent maturity in future years. However, all trees
play as vital a role in water as in carbon capture—and again the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of St Albans recognised that point.
They also play a great role in and around housing, as in open fields.
That is why I applaud the conclusion of the report, at page 58, where
it calls for planning policy and building practice

me give one such specific example which is currently under construction
at New Barns Farm on the edge of Wincanton in Somerset. Incidentally,
this is not a piece of housing development that is in my 
<?notus-xml column=684?>backyard in any way; I have no interest to declare here. More than 250
homes are to be built. I recognise that we need such homes on
greenfield sites when all the local brownfield land has gone, and I
support the
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T13:59:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The site
is on a hilltop with very steep slopes going down to the River Cale, a
small stream that after a few miles across the Blackmore Vale becomes a
tributary of the River Stour in Dorset, which itself has been subject
since Christmas to a number of red danger to life signs because of
massive flooding. When the site was first developed, it was excellently
landscaped by a local developer, the Abbey Manor Group of Yeovil. Again
I have no interest to declare because I do not know the company. Before
the first houses were even started, the company ensured that good
hedges and fencing were put in, and quite a wide shelter belt was
planted at the top of the slope. It was sited exactly where it should
be. Everything was maturing nicely before the site was sold on to a
publicly listed company called Bovis Homes. My noble friend Lord Eden
of Winton referred to the need for corporations to pay attention to
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:00:31"></hs_TimeCode> kind of
thing. Since the site was sold on, I am afraid that there has been a
spot of what one can only call environmental vandalism. Part of the
shelter belt has been cut into, trees have been cut down and failing
trees have not been replaced. Trees that were leaning have been left
until they fall over. Gardens for the newly built houses have been
encouraged to go into the shelter belt, which has led to more tree
cutting<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:00:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

days we have had a lot of celebrity visitors coming to Somerset for a
spot of grief tourism and photocalls, where people point vacantly at
things while the cameras click. My ad hoc survey suggests that green
wellington boots have mostly been sported, although we did enjoy the
wonderfully bizarre sight of Mr Nigel Farage appearing in the Somerset
Levels wearing chest waders and a jaunty cap. It must have been some
sort of fashion statement while he posed for his photographs. I wonder
whether the chairman of Bovis Homes, Mr Ian Tyler, and his chief
executive officer, Mr David Ritchie, might put on their gumboots and
come and see what their company is doing to the landscape.</hs_para>

has been happening will exacerbate rather than help to control the
run-off of water in this area of Somerset in the future. The behaviour
of this company is bad for its business and bad for its relationship
with the local authority, South Somerset District Council. I am
broad-minded: it is Liberal but it is quite a good council in terms of
planning matters. It has been having a bad time because it was given
unfulfilled undertakings by Bovis Homes to replant the trees and
maintain the woodland. That has not happened for the past three years.
This is very bad for the image of Bovis Homes in terms of meeting its
corporate social responsibilities for the environment. If only the
noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, was free of her Front Bench
duties, I would recommend the all-male board of Bovis Homes to hire her
instantly as a non-executive director to sort out its gross failures.

run-off. The whole building industry urgently needs to revisit its role

observed in this debate, the estate provides enormous benefits in all
sorts of ways: ecological, economic and, perhaps most importantly, in
terms of people. Research has shown that regular access to woodlands
leads to a healthier population in body, mind and soul. People feel
recharged by encounter with woodland. It reaches the soul in a way that
other landscapes very often cannot. It is no wonder that Thomas Merton,
the celebrated monastic hermit who lived alone in the woods of central
Kentucky, found the experience there and the silence provided by his
simple home of vital importance. He wrote:</hs_para>

Birmingham—which until recently was part of the diocese of

every shape and form is so topical and so very difficult for those who
are involved. I hope that the Minister may say something about the
general picture as well, because it all folds in
together.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000256">My
only reason for standing up is that I planted the first tree

My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, for
calling this debate. I know how passionate she is about the subject and
I say humbly that I share that passion. I thank her for her eloquent
speech. I strongly agree with almost everything she said, except of
course her scepticism about the Government’s
intentions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000258">England’s
public forests are a cherished national resource which provides
precious habitats for wildlife and natural spaces for people to enjoy,
as many noble Lords have said. We want to conserve and enhance them for
now and for generations to come. Half of the country’s
population lives within six miles of one of the 1,500 individual
forests, woodlands and other landscapes that make up the public forest
estate. That estate attracts 40 million visits a year, providing a wide
range of recreational activities for people to enjoy, from dog walking
and picnicking to mountain biking and abseiling. The public forest
estate is also a vital natural asset, providing sanctuary for wildlife,
as well as carbon storage, water improvement and flood
prevention—the importance of which we are all currently
extremely conscious, as was referred to by my noble friends Lady
Parminter and Lord Patten and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
St Albans and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of
Worcester<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:13:18"></hs_TimeCode>. The
public forest estate is also England’s largest timber producer.
It helps to employ about 40,000 people in the forestry, wood products
and paper industries, and it supports tens of thousands more jobs in
local rural economies through tourism and other commercial
activities<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:13:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000259">The
nation holds those things dear, and so do we. That is why we said in
our forestry and woodlands policy statement this time last year that we
wanted to establish a new public body, in line with the recommendations
of the Independent Panel on Forestry, to hold the estate in trust for
the nation. We have no intention of selling off the estate; nor do we
have any plans to privatise the body that manages it. Our vision for
our public forests is crystal clear. The public forest estate will be
safe under the stewardship of the new public body that will own and
manage it with a clear remit to conserve and enhance the
estate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000260">Our
forests will be better for people, better for nature and better for the
economy—that is in answer to the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Worcester. No Government can bind future Governments, so no
Government can promise that the estate will be protected in perpetuity,
but we can put the right safeguards in place to ensure that it is less
vulnerable to short-term political demands and ensure that any plans to
dispose of it in future will require further primary legislation and be
subjected to full parliamentary scrutiny.</hs_para>

progress over the past year in developing our plans for the new body.
We have held numerous meetings with interested parties including Hands
Off Our Forest, to which the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, referred, and
we are most grateful for their constructive contribution to our
thinking. We published some initial thoughts on the shape, structure
and governance of the new body last summer, and we received more than
250 helpful comments and suggestions 
<?notus-xml column=688?>on how we might improve our proposals. We have used
these to shape our plans for looking after this unique asset, and at
the recent National Forestry Forum my colleague the Parliamentary
Under-Secretary of State for Forestry, Dan Rogerson, set out 10 core
principles that we are using to underpin the new PFE management body,
which I shall set out.</hs_para>

conserve and enhance the estate for the benefit of people, nature and
the economy. The precise wording of its statutory purpose and
objectives will be confirmed in due course, although we are clear that
the new body should be focused on maintaining the quality of the estate
and the benefits that it delivers. It should be publicly owned and
operationally independent of Government. We confirmed last year that
the estate will remain in public hands, owned and managed by a new
public body with a clear remit and no day-to-day involvement from
Ministers. It should be underpinned by statute. We intend that the new
body will have its own founding legislation. We also intend that it
will have a charter, which will amplify its statutory functions and
objectives and set out how it will work with others in order to achieve
those objectives. It should be managed by experts and have access to
the best advice. We intend that the new body will have a management
board drawn from across the sectors interested in the public forestry
estate. This might include experts from the forestry and timber
business sectors as well as recreation, environmental and community
interests. It should have commercial freedoms but will be required to
protect the estate. Forest Enterprise England currently generates
around £50 million a year from its timber production and other
trading activities.</hs_para>

want it to continue to earn income from timber production, tourism,
recreation and other commercial ventures but any commercial activity
will be subject to relevant planning controls, be justified against
the wider interests of the estate and its users and be
undertaken in a sensitive way so that the long-term quality of the
estate is not put at risk. It should be able to buy and sell land, but
any land sales must be for the benefit of the estate. As the panel
recommended, we want the new body to be able to buy and sell land as
part of its everyday management role. We intend, however, that land
sales must be in line with the body’s responsibility for
maintaining the quality of the estate and that the income generated
should be reinvested in the estate. It should be a pioneer in natural
capital accounting and payment for ecosystem services, something that
my noble friend Lady Parminter referred to. We are developing a set of
natural capital accounts for the PFE. These will be used as a baseline
for assessing the performance of the new body and will help to inform
the innovative funding arrangement that we are currently exploring for
it. This will be based on a contract for the delivery of ecosystem
services such as recreation, access and biodiversity.</hs_para>

with local communities, estate users and businesses. It should have
consultation at its heart. Forest Enterprise England already has a good
track record of involving local communities in the management of the
estate. We intend that the new body should build on this track record
and be as open and transparent as possible in everything that it does. 
<?notus-xml column=689?>It should be an exemplar of sustainable forest management. We want the
new body to be widely respected and regarded as a good manager of our
public woodlands. It should build on the strengths of Forest Enterprise
England, which currently does a good job in managing the estate and has
a highly skilled and committed workforce. There is always room for
improvement but we believe that the new body should build on the
strengths of its predecessor and, over time, become an even better
trustee for our vital public
forests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000265">I
turn to noble Lords’ questions. The noble Baroness, Lady Royall,
and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester asked about
legislation. As I have said, we are working on how we might establish
the new body. Good progress is being made but our priority must be to
get things right because forestry, as noble Lords have said, is for the
long term and forestry legislation must last for many years. Therefore,
I cannot say at the moment when a Bill might be published. However, I
can say that we as a Government remain committed to allowing an
opportunity for pre-legislative scrutiny. Once a draft Bill is
published, I will of course be very happy to discuss it with noble
Lords.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140212154000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000266">The
noble Baroness, Lady Royall, asked about the prospects for Forestry
Commission staff. I can say to her that there is absolutely no
intention that there should be any redundancies. She also
asked about access. We are committed to protecting the public benefits
that are currently provided by the public forest estate, including
public access. The new management body will ensure that public access
to the public forest estate is maintained and improved wherever
possible. Current access on foot is guaranteed where the land has been
dedicated under the provisions of the Countryside and Rights of Way

noble Baroness asked about the board. We would like to see
the interests of relevant sectors, including local communities,
properly represented in the governance arrangements. She also noted the
importance of the guardians. We are in the process of determining the
final details of the guardians in collaboration with interested
parties. We are clear that the guardians will play a vital role in
overseeing the conservation and enhancement of the estate for the
benefit of people, nature and the economy. They would be drawn from
across the full range of interested sectors, including not only
forestry and business but also environment, recreation and local
community interests, to advise the new body and hold it to

suggested that a public corporation might be a halfway house to
privatisation. Public corporation classification has no bearing
whatever on whether or not a public body might be privatised. I can
confirm that we have no plans to privatise the public forest estate. We

noble Baroness asked about land sales. The body will need to be able to
buy and sell land as part of its day-to-day management role, as I have
mentioned. We intend that there should be appropriate checks and
balances to ensure that land sales decisions are in line with the
body’s responsibility for maintaining the quality of the estate
and that income generated from sales should be reinvested in the
estate. We certainly do not intend for it to sell any part of the
estate to raise revenue to sustain
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:21:48"></hs_TimeCode>. In

woodland cover is as high as it has been since the 14th century. We
want woodland cover in England to increase through planting of the
right trees in the right places for the right reasons. We also want
more of England’s woodlands to be sustainably managed to
maximise their public benefits. We believe that the current rate of
planting, of 2,500 hectares per year, can be accelerated and that an
eventual level of 15% coverage could be achieved over time. However,
this is not a matter just for Government. Conditions need to be in

Patten raised the issue of woodland in the context of new housing

the Environment Agency. Afforestation is funded where there is
sufficient evidence that it will reduce flood risk or for experimental
purposes. The Slowing the Flow project in north Yorkshire is an
example. In addition, the Forestry Commission has contributed to
various assessments of using woodland to alleviate flooding. In 2011 it
joint-funded a review called Woodland for Water, which highlighted how
woodland could contribute to reducing flood risk as well as deliver
other water and wider ecosystem benefits. That led to the development

contents of the Independent Panel’s report were truly

I would like to update the House on the progress that has been made,
both in respect of the new inquests and the new investigations. First,
I will address the inquests. Last year and within two months of the
decision by the High Court, Lord Justice Goldring was appointed as the
coroner to conduct the fresh inquests. A number of pre-inquest hearings
have already been held. The police and the Independent Police
Complaints Commission investigations are working in support of the
coroner to a timetable determined by him. The Government welcome the
fact that Lord Justice Goldring has made it clear that the fresh
inquests will start on 31
March.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000287" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000287">I have
always made it clear that the Government will support the families in
their quest for justice. As part of that commitment, the Government are
funding a comprehensive legal representation scheme. Work began on this
immediately after the original inquest verdicts were quashed, and the
scheme which is now in place will ensure that the families are properly
represented and supported at the
inquests.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000288">In
addition to the inquests, there is also the investigative process, of
which there are two elements. The first is led by the Independent
Police Complaints Commission. This is the IPCC’s biggest ever
investigation. Its principal focus is on police involvement in the
aftermath of Hillsborough. I think it is worth reminding the House that
this includes not just the role and actions of the South Yorkshire
Police, the force responsible for policing the match, but also the West
Midlands Police. The West Midlands Police had a significant role to
play in the aftermath of Hillsborough, providing support to Lord
Taylor’s inquiry, producing the report to the Director of Public
Prosecutions and assisting the then South Yorkshire West Coroner, Dr
Stefan Popper. I can therefore confirm that the experience of

more than 250 people who have never given accounts before. The IPCC is
conducting detailed analysis of every response and is following up the
evidence provided. Separately, around 400 witnesses have made requests
to the IPCC to see their original statements, and the IPCC is helping
people access those statements. In addition, the IPCC has recovered
around 2,500 police pocket notebooks. These pocket books had not been
made available to previous investigations and are now being analysed by
IPCC investigators. The IPCC has also conducted further analysis of the
242 police accounts now believed to have been

Operation Resolve team has obtained access to the best quality audio

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to and
thank the noble Lord for repeating the Statement of the Home Secretary.
It is very helpful for your Lordships’ House to be updated on
the process and on progress being made. I also welcome the fact that
the Minister reiterated the apology. We add our tribute to the
families, survivors and all those who have had to campaign for the
truth and for

years later, as the new inquests begin, the families will have to
relive that day, in granular and sometimes very graphic detail for each
of the 96. It is necessary to establish the precise details and the
truth but it will be traumatic. What action will be taken across

listened to the Statement in the other place and I should like to probe
further one issue that was raised. The Minister will be aware of the
concern of the families and the campaigners for justice that they were
subject to undercover surveillance, not exclusively but including their
phone calls being intercepted. The Home Secretary was unable to confirm
or deny those fears in the other place. The Minister will recall
discussions that we had on covert surveillance during Anti-social
Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill and the need for independent
oversight following the experience of my noble friend Lady Lawrence.
Given the circumstances, will the Government reconsider whether in this
case it would be appropriate, because it is relevant to the 
<?notus-xml column=695?>inquiry, for any and all information relating to surveillance to be made
available, including whether any requests were made to the Home
Secretary? I am sorry to press the Minister further on this, but I know
that he will understand the depth of feeling on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T14:40:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="140212154000303" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000303">The
Minister will also understand the anger over so many of the police and
witness statements being altered. Presumably, that was to hide the
truth so that they could not get the facts of what really happened on
that day. It is vital that those who gave witness statements at the
time feel able to come forward and verify their statements or take
action to put the record straight if their statements were changed.
What message or reassurance can the Minister give to those witnesses to
encourage them to come forward? To paraphrase the words of the Home
Secretary, we need these statements because we need to get to the truth
in order to ensure

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness
for her comments on this moving and complex issue. I reiterate the
sentiments<B> </B>of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary in
her response to a number of questions. She made it quite clear that she
recognised that one of the traumas of the situation that the families
now face was that they would now have to relive the moments of tragedy
that they suffered 25 years ago. In terms of positive things that I can
say, she reassured the families that additional consultation space will
be provided to ensure that families have regular meetings with their
legal teams, and further details will be shared with the family teams
in the next few days about how that will
work<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government fully recognise that the appropriate support needs to be
provided for all those involved in these inquests. The Department of

team, will work together to ensure that this is

noble Baroness rightly focused on the anxiety that was expressed in the
House of Commons by a number of Members about surveillance and the
suspicion that the police had targeted families. The Home Secretary, I
know, will reflect on what has been said in the House of Commons. She
is well aware of the sentiment on that issue, as indeed is the IPCC,
which is very much aware of that aspect of the case. It is, perhaps,
another example of people feeling that tragedy has been compounded post
the event. I suspect that the IPCC will be interested in following this

was further asked by the noble Baroness about witnesses coming forward.
As I mentioned in the Statement, a number have already done so. I will

doing this sort of journalism. Can the Minister take it back to the
Home Secretary that this is yet another reason why the press needs to
have Leveson? It might seem out of context but, frankly, this has been
going on for 30 or 40 years and Hillsborough was a particularly bad
example of an abuse of press power. That is why people want Leveson and

fact that the Home Secretary has chosen to make it in what I might call
an unprompted manner: I think the Minister will understand what I mean.
He referred to the importance of process. Perhaps I might ask him about
the reference group, which I understand has been set up by the CPS, the
IPCC and the investigation team to ensure the families’ rights
under Article 2 of the European convention. I am sorry that I was not
able to give notice to my noble friend of this question. I understand

investigation that the IPCC has ever been involved in. Right at the

priority that needed proper resourcing. I have no doubt that the
resources are available to get to the truth of this matter. The
challenge panel, which was mentioned in the Written Ministerial
Statement on 19 December, is working well. There were a number of
helpful discussions over the summer between the investigatory and
prosecutorial authorities and the families to establish the best way of
ensuring that they are kept up to speed with the various ongoing
investigations. These discussions were chaired by Bishop James Jones.
It is not so much that the reference group actually has, or even needs,
power. The power lies in those bodies which are working together with
the reference group. They are the people who actually have the power to
pursue the inquiry and, further to that, to effect prosecutions if

will need continuing support, and not only with practical things such

Wood of Anfield (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is fair to say that
MPs, journalists and campaigners have struggled to obtain information
from different agencies under the Freedom of Information Act, most
noticeably from the police, IPCC and Operation Resolve teams. In some
cases, information has been withheld on the grounds that it may
prejudice potential prosecutions—and, of course, we all
understand that. However, there are two other grounds that should cause
us concern, and I want to ask the Minister about his reaction to
that.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="140212154000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140212-0002.htm#140212154000322">First,

publication would be detrimental to future co-operation between itself
and organisations that it is either investigating or collaborating
with. Secondly, in many cases in which the police are involved, FOI
requests remain simply unanswered and ignored, in some cases for
periods stretching over 12 months. Does the Minister share my concern
about this? Would he agree that one way forward would be to ask the
IPCC and Operation Resolve teams to commit to name a date by which they
plan to publish all the evidence that they have and ensure that all the

seriously. Noble Lords will understand that there are sometimes genuine

<?notus-xml column=699?>conflicts between a wish to be transparent and open and to put material
in the public domain and the efficient achievement
of justice, with the impartiality of evidence. Premature revelation of

and express my sympathy to the families involved. There is one other
wider point of importance that comes out of this, which the Minister
touched on. I wonder whether he would agree with me that even since
Hillsborough and with the lessons that we have learnt, many people
distrust bodies investigating themselves and other bodies investigating
bodies that are only remotely removed from them. If one marvellous
thing could come out of this it would be that, by pursuing the truth in
the way the Minister has mentioned, the public might begin to get
greater confidence in investigations into

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> The noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, makes a
good point on this area of public confidence in the police, in
particular. This is a policy area within the Home Office currently
which we are taking very seriously. Noble Lords will know that the
College of Policing has been set up. A code of ethics
is part and parcel of its immediate mission
statement. It is very much in the interests of a country that is
dependent upon policing by consent that that consent can be given in
confidence that the police are acting genuinely in the interests of the
public, not of
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-12T15:00:29"></hs_TimeCode>.

McNally (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the tributes to Bishop James Jones
are well deserved but the statement by him rather ties in with what my
noble friend has just said—that the bereaved families are
“encouraged” but not “persuaded”. That is
an indication of how far we have to go in winning not only their
confidence but that of the general public in our public authorities and
the capacity to investigate them when things go wrong. I seek just one
clarification. My noble friend said that the inquest will start on 31
March. This ties in with the question about information from other
bodies. How do you prevent cross-pollution from one investigation to
another if the inquest is being held in public? Will remarks made there
impact on the Stoddart inquiry or 
<?notus-xml column=700?>revelations from the IPCC? Will they be fed into the inquest? How are
these three parallel inquiries to be co-ordinated or kept

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> You can rely on your noble friends,
particularly your former colleague as the Minister of Justice, to
tackle you on this subject. I am not a lawyer but I assume that the
Queen’s court—the coroner’s court—has the
power to seek all evidence. Its needs are the most important aspect of
the inquiry while the coroner’s investigations continue.
Clearly, information will be made available to the coroner’s
court or discovered through the coroner’s inquiry that will
inform investigations by other bodies. I would hope that that would be
the case because the whole point of the inquest is to establish the
truth about those 96 deaths, as well as to help clear the obfuscation
that has long surrounded this

Snape (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, will the Minister accept from me,
as a former chairman of a—sadly—former Football League
club, that the attitude of the police a quarter of a century ago
towards the Liverpool supporters was coloured at least partly by the
fact that there was a strong belief then that those who watched
football were somehow less worthy of the sort of policing that most
members of the public would accept—that football supporters were
there to be marched and corralled and generally to be poorly treated by
police officers from a senior level downwards? Will he also accept from
me that, regrettably, these days that sort of attitude persists in
certain aspects of policing towards those wishing to do no more than go
and watch a football

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> Amazingly enough, as somebody who has
an interesting life, I have relatively limited experience of attending
first-class football matches. However, in fact I went to see Arsenal
play Wigan in the final home game of last season. I have to say that I
found it a really delightful experience and I saw none of the things
that the noble Lord, Lord Snape, has suggested. The policing was
discreet and the stewards were in place but working with people rather
than against them, and I think that that characterises it—it
certainly characterises other sporting events that I have been to.
However, I shall have to ask the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner of
Worcester, what it was like to go to a football match 25 years ago, and
he will be able to tell me of the change there has been in recent
years. I am sure he would vouch for the fact that there has been
considerable change both in policing and in the way that crowds, who in
most cases are now seated in purpose-built stadia, are treated. It is
to be hoped that, because of those measures, there will not be a
repetition of what happened at Hillsborough.</hs_para>

groups and rebels associated with the Seleka coalition who overthrew
the President Bozizé in 2013. The rapid deployment of African
Union (AU) and French troops has led to some improvements in security,

single-tier reforms is the closure of the State Second Pension.
Contracting out of the State Second Pension for Defined Benefit schemes
– giving up entitlement in return for a broadly similar
occupational pension and payment of lower National Insurance (NI) rate
for employer and employee – will therefore come to an end. All
employees will pay the same rate of National Insurance and become
entitled to State Pension in the same way. The state pension system
will be significantly simpler as a result.</hs_para>

Government’s objectives for managing the end of contracting out
are to minimise the impacts on employers, schemes and individuals,
ensuring that the administrative processes of ending contracting out
are as smooth and as simple as possible; to ensure amounts built up in
schemes to 2016 continue to be paid; and to ensure that the
sustainability of Defined Benefit pension schemes is not undermined.
The Government is allowing private sector employers who face paying an
increased rate of national insurance to make limited changes to their
pension scheme rules to recoup some or all of the additional costs they
face subject to the will of Parliament.</hs_para>

the Government published a public consultation ‘Abolition of

Protected Persons Regulations’. The consultation invited views

rules for employees covered by the protected persons legislation. The

Government Ministers subsequently. The Government thinks it is
reasonable that issues arising from the end of contracting out for this
small number of workers should be resolved through negotiation.

Minister of State, Department for Transport (Baroness Kramer)
(LD):</Member> The Government is committed to the benefits of
competition in the provision of passenger rail services. The primary
way that it seeks to achieve this is through fair and open competitions
for franchises. There are a number of such franchises that provide
Anglo-Scottish services: CrossCountry; TransPennine; InterCity West
Coast; InterCity East Coast, which is currently being competed; and
ScotRail and the Caledonian Sleeper Service which are the
responsibility of the Scottish Government.</hs_para>

programme announced by the Secretary of State for Transport on 26 March
2013, sets out the timetable for when we expect to put these franchises
up for competition. The mechanisms that exist on the railway already
provide for competition on Anglo-Scottish routes, both between the
different franchises providing them and with other modes; and as
evidenced by the level of interest in competing for these franchises.
There is also provision in the Railways Act for non-franchised services
to be provided by open access operators such as those that already
exist on the East Coast Mainline
corridor.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Index"><?date 2014-02-12?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_12_PT_1/Index/EBD5915729417A39B546448FED8F68AF62D31E98" __version__="1.2"><Index cdate="19" cday="Wednesday" cmonth="February" cyear="2014" date="12" day="Wednesday" issue="116" maxparts="1" month="February" part="1" price="" printing="daily" session="201314" volume="752" year="2014"><tocdate col="WS49">Wednesday 12 February
