Jamie Reed</B> (Copeland) (Lab):</Member> Welcome back, Mr
Speaker. Easy access to GPs is a key part of out-of-hospital care for
elderly and frail people. Days after the election, the Prime Minister
scrapped Labour’s guarantee that gave patients a GP appointment
within two working days, and took away funding that kept thousands of
surgeries open in the evenings and at weekends. Now the Royal College
of General Practitioners is warning that 34 million patients will fail
to get an appointment. Will the Secretary of State listen to the
Patients Association, bring back the 48-hour appointment guarantee and
help older people to see their doctor when
needed?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022547000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000040"></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022547000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T11:40:11"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Jeremy Hunt" PimsId="4799" UID="14022547000296" xid="894" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000296">Mr
Hunt:</Member></B> The reason that we got rid of that guarantee was
that the number of people who were able to see a GP within 48 hours was
falling in the last year in which the target was in place. It was not
working, and that is why the British Medical Association and the Royal
College of General Practitioners were against it. In the same survey
that the hon. Gentleman quoted, the RCGP said it estimated that there
had been a 10% increase in the number of GP appointments compared with
when his Government were in
office.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="14022547000013" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000013">Maternity

group B strep and the effects of the disease. The point about enriched
culture medium testing is that it takes time for bacteria to grow in
culture, and the fact is that there is also evidence from the Royal

looked at that evidence and it has decided that it is not a test that
is effective to be introduced during pregnancy. That is the medical

explained the need: the harsh conditions experienced by working people
around the country, and the dangers that they faced if they fell sick
or could not find work. He described the insurance systems that were
provided by insurance companies, employers, friendly societies and
trade unions. He measured their efficacy and worth, identifying where
coverage was greatest and where it was most sparse. He then set out the
solution: a national insurance fund into which workers, employers and
the state would pay, to provide for medical aid for sick workers,
maternity cover for workmen, their wives and women workers, benefits
for limited periods of unemployment, and payments in time of sickness.
The provisions would be managed through the existing private
institutions, except for unemployment payments, which would be provided
by the labour
exchanges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022547000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000203">All

this account because I think it important to explain why national
insurance was called national insurance. There was indeed a fund, one
that was intended to be in surplus within 15 years of its creation, at
which point Lloyd George anticipated that additional benefits would be
made available, most likely to the families and dependants of workers.
Well, the fund did not work out quite like that, but the scope of the
scheme was expanded as he had predicted, with a major reform by the
post-war Attlee Government. Further changes in the 1970s and 1980s
continued the mutation of this great piece of legislation, expanding
its scope, scrapping the “stamp” and complicating the
rates at which insurance was paid.</hs_Para>

every turn, the link between contributions and benefit, which from the
beginning was not entirely true, was eroded, to the point where it now
barely exists. That link will become nugatory with the introduction of
universal credit and the single state pension, both considerable
reforms of this coalition Government. What remains of national
insurance is not really a contributions-based system, but a system of
entitlement whereby a certain number of years of payment entitles the
recipient to additional benefits.</hs_Para>

insurance contributions is used to pay this year’s costs of

small but important part of that is coming clean about national
insurance. I propose we call it earnings tax, because it is a tax on
earnings, but we could equally  
<?notus-xml column=166?>call it additional income tax, or employment tax. Such a change would
have no impact on people’s current entitlement or on the rates
at which NI is currently charged. It would, however, be an important
first step in the merging of income and earnings taxes, as proposed
most recently by the TaxPayers Alliance, the Institute of Directors and
the Chartered Institute for Payroll and Pensions Professionals. I
believe that such a merger would have far wider benefits; it would not
just benefit the people those organisations represent. But that
discussion is for another time. All I propose at this stage is a
twofold reform: first, a simple change of name, which would cost next
to nothing; and secondly, the merger of the national insurance fund
into general Government funds, which would save administration costs
that would far more profitably be spent elsewhere.

the benefits and pensions in the Social Security Benefits Up-rating
Order 2014, I shall deal first with the
basic<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T12:48:02"></hs_TimeCode> state
pension. Despite the current tough fiscal context, this Government
remain committed to protecting those who have worked hard all their
lives, which is why we have stood by our triple-lock commitment to
uprate the basic state pension by whichever is the highest of earnings,
prices or 2.5%. This year, as prices were greater than average earnings
and greater than 2.5%, the basic state pension will increase by CPI at
2.7%. The new rate of basic state pension will therefore be
£113.10 a week for a single person, an increase of £2.95
from last year. That means that the basic state pension is forecast to
be around 18% of average earnings from April 2014, a higher share of
average earnings than at any time since 1992.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T12:48:46"></hs_TimeCode> triple-lock
commitment means that someone on a full basic state pension can expect
to receive £440 a year more than if it had been uprated by
earnings since the start of this

pension credit, we have continued to take steps to ensure that the
poorest pensioners will benefit in full from the effect of our triple
lock. Each year, the standard minimum guarantee must, by law, be
increased at least in line with earnings. That means that the minimum
increase this year would be 1.2%. However, to ensure 
<?notus-xml column=168?>that the poorest pensioners benefit from the full cash value of the
increase in the basic state pension, we decided again to increase the
value of the standard minimum guarantee credit, in this case by 2%, so
that single people will receive an increase of £2.95 a week and
couples will receive an increase of £4.45 a week. Again,
consistent with our approach last year, the resources needed to pay
this above-earnings increase to the standard minimum guarantee have
been found by increasing the savings credit threshold, which means
those with higher levels of income will see less of an
increase.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022547000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000229">Let

SERPS in 2010, this will be the fourth year in a row that the coalition

therefore hope that when the right hon. Gentleman responds and gives
his party’s position on these motions he will clarify whether
that is still his position. He will realise, first, that RPI has now
been dropped by the Office for National Statistics as an official
statistic because of methodological concerns. So I would be surprised
if he remained committed to going back to RPI. Perhaps he thinks we
should use CPIH, as he complained that we did not have owner-occupier
housing costs in the measure that we are using. If that is his
position, he would obviously be arguing for a lower increase in
benefits this year, because at the moment the level of CPI is above
that of CPIH. Given that he was opposed to a permanent switch to CPI,
given that RPI has been dropped as an official statistic and given that
some of the other measures are lower than the one we are using, I am
slightly puzzled by his position—I am sure that by the time we

Timms</B> (East Ham) (Lab):</Member> I thank the Minister for his
explanation and confirm that I do not intend to express concerns about
the draft Guaranteed Minimum Pensions Increase Order 2014. However, I
do wish to make some comments about the draft Social Security Benefits
Up-rating Order 2014. As he has said, this is a rather thinner debate
than the corresponding ones he and I have enjoyed in previous years,
because a big chunk of what we have debated previously is now covered
by the Welfare Benefits Up-rating Act 2013, which imposed a 1% uprating
this year and next, and so is outside the scope of these
orders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022547000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022547000237">One
thing I have not entirely understood—the Minister touched on
this and I would be grateful if he explained it—is how the
corresponding order for tax credits  will be dealt with. Some
elements of tax credits uprating are not covered by the 1% constraint.
Clearly, with  so few people in receipt of universal credit, he
is  not the Minister responsible for in-work
benefits—that responsibility remains with the
Treasury—but I wonder whether he could explain how the
parliamentary process around those tax credits is to be
handled.</hs_Para>

fourth year since the announcement of the triple lock for the basic
state pension. In rhetorical terms the triple lock has, no doubt, been
successful, but, unfortunately, the reality has been rather different,
because, once again, the increase in the state pension is less this
year than it would have been if the uprating method previously used was
still in place. In RPI terms, this is a real-terms cut for the third
year in a row in the value of the basic state pension. The RPI last
September was 3.2%, whereas the pension uprating delivered by this
order is 2.7%. So in RPI terms, this is quite a big cut of
0.5%—a full half percentage point—in the value of the
state pension, which is a bigger real-terms cut than last year. If the
basic state pension had been uprated in line with RPI since 2010, the
weekly rate for a single person would be more than a pound higher than
the figure we are debating today, at
£114.21<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T12:57:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

to make is that the triple lock is frequently presented to us, as the
Minister did again today, as being extraordinarily generous to
pensioners. It is presented as some great superlative, whereas in fact
it has delivered a lower uprating than the previous formula—the
one in place before the last election—in every one of the three
years when it has been used, and in the first year it was due to be
used it would have delivered such a low uprating that the Minister
chose to override it. He was sensible to do so, but if he had used the
triple lock in that first year, the gap between his uprating and the
value of the basic state pension under the old method would now be
almost £3 per week. So it is important in this debate to put on
the record the extent to which the triple lock has delivered less than
the long-established formula that was in place until the general
election.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T12:58:19"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

change made by Mrs Thatcher when she was Prime Minister, and he makes
an entirely fair point. However, the point I am putting to him is that
he and his party, particularly the Minister, frequently present the
triple lock to us as somehow being extraordinarily generous, whereas in
practice it has provided less than the formula he has just
criticised—the one introduced by the former Conservative Prime
Minister. If that formula had continued after the 2010 general

That is only a 0.2 percentage point increase on the absolute

understood and signed up to by pensioners, was broken. That was
compounded last year, and the Government want to do it again this year.
On the other side of the coin, it is worth noting that RPI will
continue to be used for the uprating of a great many other things.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:04:21"></hs_TimeCode> Minister has

Chancellor proudly told us in his autumn statement last year that the

1% to RPI plus 0%, which mean that regulated rail fares would increase

why the Government apply RPI in that case and CPI in this. The answer,
as far as one can make sense of all of this, is that the Government use
CPI when it is useful to have a small number and RPI when they want a
big number. That appears to be the principle that has been adopted. The
result is that pensioners will see their state pension increased in

appears that, while they continue to develop late the IT system they
started out with, they are also going to develop a second universal
credit IT system, in the hope that they can get it right second time

wonder whether the Minister can help us on another matter that has just
come to light in connection with part 6 of the order on employment and
support allowance. A freedom of information request by the advice
service Benefits and Work revealed yesterday that the Department for
Work and Pensions had issued an internal memo to staff on 20 January
advising that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:10:45"></hs_TimeCode>,
owing to a growing backlog at the assessment company Atos, all current
ESA claimants would be left on the benefit without further medical
checks until another company could be found to carry out repeat work
capability assessments. The Minister of State, Department for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Hemel Hempstead (Mike Penning), frankly
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:11:08"></hs_TimeCode>acknowledged in
oral questions yesterday pressures and capacity problems at Atos and
indicated that negotiations were taking place to find an alternative
provider, but he made no mention of the suspension of repeat
assessments in the meantime, which appears to have been introduced. The
memo obtained by Benefits at Work suggests that DWP has deliberately
chosen not to inform Members of the House or claimants about this
change. Why has that been done? Can the Minister provide reassurances
to the public about the scale of the difficulties—yet another
emerging mess in his Department?</hs_Para>

scepticism about whether the system is fit for purpose. It certainly
leaves an operational vacuum, apparently pending the appointment of a
new provider. At this stage there is no indication when such an
appointment might be made. In the circumstances, it is surprising that
the Minister did not take the opportunity 
<?notus-xml column=174?>to inform the House of the situation yesterday, when there was an
extensive discussion on the matter and a number of questions were asked
about the process for replacing Atos and the operation of the work

has been significantly scaled back. Given that ESA is part of the order

changes that the Government have introduced, some of which are in these
orders, have huge significance for millions of the poorest in our

uprating of benefits to these pitiful amounts, which in many cases

Government have attempted to balance the books on the back of the
poor<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:15:35"></hs_TimeCode>. The focus

than RPI. That is why I oppose it.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:16:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Banff and Buchan (Dr Whiteford) has already commented
that another method of uprating should be found because neither CPI nor
RPI is a good way of capturing the real cost of living for some of the
groups affected by the orders. However, we do know that RPI is a more
generous system than CPI and the Government should return to that way

factors taken into account has been smaller every year since the change

inflation, wages or 2.5%. The uncomfortable truth, however, as the
Minister must accept, is that the triple lock was introduced alongside
the change from RPI to CPI, so the basic state pension increases in

April 2013, the coalition slashed the annual uplifts to a range of
benefits to 1%; I appreciate that that issue is being dealt with in
other legislation. Some of the disability benefits, such as
carer’s allowance and disability living allowance, are exempt
from that 1% cap, but employment and support allowance,
which is the primary income replacement benefit for disabled people, is
not. The Government have exempted from the cap the higher rate care
component paid to the most severely disabled people, supposedly
shielding the vulnerable from it. Unfortunately, however, this is a
deceptive sleight of hand. ESA is paid in two parts—a basic
rate, plus an additional component—and although the additional
component of £35.75 is exempt from the 1% cap, the basic rate of
£72.40 is not. Therefore, over-25s in receipt of the care
component of ESA will receive £5.11 a week less than they would
have received if it had increased in line with RPI.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>These cuts

1997 and 2010, the Labour Government reduced the percentage of people
living in absolute poverty from 28% of the population to 15%. During
that time, 2.3 million children and 2 million pensioners were lifted
out of poverty. Research from the Institute for Fiscal Studies suggests
that investment in the social security system was the primary factor
behind that reduction in poverty. By slashing social security benefits
with these orders and the other legislation that we have considered
previously, the Government risk putting some of the most vulnerable
people in society back below the poverty line, and that is on top of
the large number of people whose incomes have already been cut as a
direct result of this Government’s policy. These orders are
completely inadequate and the Government should come forward with
something that protects the most vulnerable in our
society.</hs_Para>

substantial progress. Of course, social progress often comes slowly; it
is measured in inches as well as feet, and in centimetres as well as

level at which the Minister appears set to place the new flat-rate
state pension is just above pension credit. It is that framework, which
was set for the poorest pensioners to ensure they would no longer live
in poverty, that is so important. My argument is not that
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:27:52"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

brings me to the question that I wanted to ask the Minister, which is
about pension credit. Of course it is welcome that the basic state
pension is rising by £2.95, and he was very clear that pension
credit will also rise by £2.95, but of course as a percentage
rise, the rise for pension credit is less. The danger is that those on
pension credit will fall behind relative to those on the basic state
pension.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) made. It is that,
as the Pensions Bill proceeds, the new flat-rate state
pension—as I understand it—is being set just above
pension credit. If pension credit loses its value relative to the basic
state pension in the run-up to the introduction of the new system,
there is a danger that the flat-rate state pension will be pegged at a
lower rate than would otherwise be the case. We must be clear about not
only the implications for the poorest pensioners of a lag in the
uprating of pension credit, but the implications for the flat-rate
state pension system for which

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:30:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
is widely acknowledged as an expert in this area, and questions arise
when pension credit is not uprated by the same percentage as the basic
state pension. As I said, I start to get worried when I hear the phrase
“over-indexation” because the Minister is actually
saying, “We have decided that pension credit will be uprated by
earnings unless we decide otherwise, and we have decided otherwise, so
it will be uprated by the cash equivalent of the uprating to the basic
state pension.” However, that represents a smaller percentage
increase, so we need to be aware of the wider implications of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:31:57"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:20:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022550000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022550000030">I

Friend the Member for East Ham (Stephen Timms) asked the Minister a
number of important questions, to which I shall add my own. First, does
the Minister agree that pension credit made a real difference to
millions of poor pensioners in this country? Secondly, does he agree
that it provides the basis on which the flat-rate state pension will be
pegged under his new system? If that is the case, it is important that
we debate the lesser uprating of pension credit, and I hope that the

benefit rates over the long run. In the seven years since the 2008
crash, the rate of jobseeker’s allowance has increased by more
than the growth in earnings. While people with jobs—people would
obviously far rather have jobs than not—have seen their wages
grow over that period, the rate of JSA, which I still quaintly think of

growth.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022550000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0001.htm#14022550000038">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:35:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:35:03"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T13:35:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for North Ayrshire and Arran (Katy Clark) talked about
pitiful increases and slashing benefits, but I can tell her that the
Labour Government spent £181 billion on tax credits, benefits
and pensions in their final year in office, yet in the first year of
the next Parliament, we envisage spending not £181 billion, but
£211 billion. Spending £30 billion more than six years
previously is an odd definition of “slashing”, so we need
to keep a bit of perspective in the debate. I respect the hon.
Lady’s sincerity and clearly she wishes that the increases were
greater but, as she well knows, her Front-Bench colleagues will not
vote against the orders, and that is not because of a technicality, but
because they would not allocate money for larger increases. I know that

who I met some years ago, and I do not doubt his compassion for those
in need, which is shared by Members on both sides of the House.
However, I do not think that anyone believes that people were not in
severe and urgent financial crisis before we saw the 
<?notus-xml column=180?>current network of food banks; they simply went somewhere else. The idea
of urgent financial need has not just arisen. As the right hon.
Gentleman will know, people turned to charitable sources and churches.
It was not uncommon for people to knock on a vicarage door to ask for a
sandwich, and that is not very different from a food bank—it is
a precursor to that. There were always people in urgent financial need,
and we can debate the impact of a global economic downturn on the level
of need. Church leaders who comment on such matters are sometimes
briefed with partial information. It is sometimes suggested to them
that there is a mad slash and burn on the welfare state, but I think
that they would be surprised to learn that, at the start of the next

follow Labour’s approach of making a earnings increase to the
guarantee credit because that would give the poorest pensioners less
than £2.95. In our jargon, we are passing through the full
£2.95. Far from paying less than the law requires, we are paying
more, because we put the biggest priority on the poorest

that RPI is generally, although not always,

compensate for average inflation. If society thinks that benefit rates

says that we chose CPI simply because it is lower. As of the year to
last September, we had only two possible measures to choose
from—CPI and RPI—because the other variants of CPI and
RPI were not established at that point. RPI has been discontinued as an
official statistic, so how could we use it as the measure for the
general increase in the price level? CPI is the target of the Bank of
England and an internationally standard and accepted measure. If she
thinks from a social justice point of view that benefits should be
higher, which is an entirely legitimate thing to think, she should do
that by setting them at whatever level she thinks is right, not by
trying to pretend that inflation is something other than what the

will be years when pensioner inflation is higher than the figure we use
and years when it is lower. At the moment, there are particular
pensioner price indices, but they do not include all pensioners. We
simply use one number that, on average and over time, captures
inflation, but spending patterns differ. This Government have clearly
taken steps to help people at the bottom of the pile. To counter what

same time as pension credit was implemented, other changes were
happening. For example, SERPS—the state earnings-related pension
scheme—was maturing, so each successive generation of retiring
pensioners was getting higher levels of state pension, thereby reducing
pensioner poverty, and people had longer service in final-salary
pension schemes. A whole raft of long-term trends will lead to a
reduction in pensioner poverty, so to say that it was due to pension
credit on its own, one would need to know what else would have happened
even without it.</hs_Para>

that I have described. <I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> He says
that it has happened since 1997. Had the previous Labour Government
done precisely nothing, the level of pensioner poverty may well have
fallen anyway because SERPS was maturing. SERPS came in in 1978 and had
been running for only 19 years by ’97. In each succeeding year,
more and more people have got more and more state pension under SERPS
as it matures, so as the oldest pensioners with no SERPS die off, the
newly retired pensioners come in with bigger and bigger SERPS. That
would be a long-term reason for the change, and real earnings growth
would have been another factor. It is complete nonsense to say that it
was due solely to pension credit, and he ought to know

replace lost earnings, so they cannot do their job if they have fallen
relative to earnings, as they did in almost every year of the previous
Labour Government, most notoriously when they thought that 75p was
enough for pensioners. We do not; we think that a £2.95 increase

July, just a week before the first round of negotiations began. Since
then, there has been very strong progress, with three rounds of
negotiations and a fourth round set for next month. The European
Commission has taken the unprecedented step of setting up an advisory
panel of business, trade union and consumer interests, and of freezing
any discussion on dispute resolution while it conducts consultation. We
have seen a level of political and media attention on both sides of the

very different from a deal with the US. The US and the EU both have
long traditions of due legal process. If the hon. Gentleman
looks at the representations being made by business and investors, he
will see that there is very little call for the arrangements. The
strongest advocate to date has been the European Commission, which is
why I think the pause it has put on further discussions is so
significant, although it did so only because it was put under
significant pressure by those who had concerns, perhaps including Mr

time—because of the level of interest and the level of mistrust
in the establishment, politicians and big business—this cannot
be a traditional backroom trade deal done by the elites in Brussels and
Washington. Like justice, good trade policy must not only be done; it
must now be seen to be done. Any legitimate agreement must command the
broadly based confidence that it will bring benefits to British
consumers and workers, as well as to British business. It must be
subject to the scrutiny of open debate; otherwise, there will be a risk
that bad policy will remain unchanged and that fears will flourish

want to do two things: first, I want to spell out a progressive
economic case for trade and for the TTIP, and secondly, I want to set
out four tests that I think a good TTIP deal and the Governments and
negotiators involved must meet. On the economic case and why it is so
important to the UK at present, I think that the great depression of
the 1930s was the last economic crisis that was in any way comparable
to what we suffered in 2008 with the global financial crisis and
downturn. The policies pursued by the UK and the US back in the
’30s are, I think, widely seen to have prolonged that slump and
held back any recovery. Not only were there deep cuts in public
spending; there was also a sharp rise in protectionism and a decline in
multilateral trade. Therefore, part of the reason why deals such as the
TTIP and, indeed, the EU’s recent agreements with Canada and
Korea are so important is that they avoid that default to
beggar-my-neighbour economic policies and instead look to increase
global trade through international
co-operation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:09:20"></hs_TimeCode>.

me come back to the case for why the UK needs the economic boost and
benefits of trade at this time. The size of our UK economy is still
1.3% smaller than it was before the peak prior to the 2008 global

still about 10% smaller than it was before the downturn. We also have a
high trade deficit—£30 billion in 2013—which has
remained high despite the large fall in the value of the pound compared
with the euro or the dollar during the downturn. At a time when we
still have a domestic demand problem, trade deficits can lead to
further weaknesses as income generated in the UK is spent overseas. In
turn, that puts more pressure on factors such as household borrowing or
inflated regional housing to fuel growth, which cannot produce a

recovery<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:12:44"></hs_TimeCode>. I must

the right hon. Gentleman rightly pointed out, in the aftermath of the
2008 financial crisis, politicians the world over were at great pains
to avoid the policy mistakes that followed the banking
collapse of the 1930s. Conventional Keynesian pump-priming was
continually invoked as the means of preventing a recession from turning
into a depression. Depressingly, rather less interest seemed to be
given to the equally important lessons that the 1929 to 1933 era taught
us about protectionism. The right hon. Gentleman referred to the
Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which raised tariffs drastically on
goods that were imported into the United States in a bid to protect
American jobs from foreign competition. That Act sparked a domino
effect among America’s trading partners, who predictably imposed
similar measures to protect their own economies. The result, as we all
know, was a terrific slump in world trade that devastated economic
growth and caused unemployment to soar. Only the ensuing second world
war helped to get the global economy on its feet
again.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000062">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:22:45"></hs_TimeCode>
2010, as growth remained elusive, I wrote and spoke in this House of my
deep concern that we might see a new wave of protectionist measures
being introduced by politicians who were under pressure to protect
domestic markets. The House might recall the defensive, almost
nationalistic tone of the debate as Kraft’s hostile takeover of
Cadbury was going through, particularly from the Opposition Benches. I

of the media coverage of the TTIP has focused on the trade of
manufactured goods. Rather less attention has been given to a sphere of
commerce in which the UK economy excels globally: financial and
professional services. I represent the City of London, which is a hub
not only for banking, but for a range of related service businesses
such as accountancy, insurance, consultancy, the law and pensions
management. To put into perspective the importance of those industries
to the UK, in 2012, the financial and associated professional services
sector employed some 7% of the UK work force, produced some 13% of
total economic output, contributed £65 billion in tax
and generated a trade surplus of £55
billion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000072">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:26:08"></hs_TimeCode>
City of London is strongly supportive of the TTIP, but has been
consistent in its belief that no industry should be excluded from the
partnership’s scope, including financial and professional
services. There would be benefits not only through boosted trade, but
through a reduction in the potential for the kind of regulatory
arbitrage that currently means that differences in the implementation
of financial standards are exploited, thereby putting financial
stability at risk. Some of the regulatory differences are unavoidable
because of the variations in EU and US market structures and cultures.
Others cannot be justified on prudential
grounds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000073">As
was demonstrated so painfully in 2008, we tend to get regulatory
co-operation only in times of severe crisis, when deals are brokered at
the eleventh hour to avoid market fracture. If financial services were
within the TTIP’s scope, I believe that we could design a
stable, long-term framework for the discussion and co-ordination of
regulatory issues long before we hit the next crisis point. The other
great prize is that we could create a larger, more efficient market
place for EU and US financial institutions, thereby solidifying their
leading role in global financial regulation—a market that will
get much bigger in Asia as the emerging economies of China, India and
the like
strengthen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000074">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:27:48"></hs_TimeCode>
is for those reasons that the EU has been lobbying hard for such
services to be included in the TTIP negotiations. However, there is
still stiff opposition from the US Treasury, which suggests
that the TTIP is primarily a trade pact, not a forum for regulatory
co-operation. The fear seems to be that the US might lose its
sovereignty over regulation. It must be made clear that that is not 
<?notus-xml column=195?>what the EU proposes. Nobody wants to undermine existing
regulations, even the Dodd-Frank Act. Co-ordination is quite different
from capitulation. We need sustained, high-level political engagement

potential benefits are. Quite understandably, given the systematic
undermining of the world’s political and economic elite in
recent years, which has been referred to, there is a wave of distrust
at the tenor of the negotiations that are under way. There is a common
perception that side deals are being brokered to benefit global
corporations, posing a risk to national sovereignty that might see our
independent courts being made subservient to outside arbitration. It
would be helpful if the Minister clarified his position on those
arguments this afternoon. I encourage the Government to run an even

industries such as the financial and professional services are not

international and national regulation of financial services, but it

honest and admit that when I was approached to join the all-party
group, I had little knowledge of the transatlantic trade and investment
partnership, but I quickly gained an understanding of the potential
economic significance of the deal if it goes ahead. Wales is an
exporting nation and outperforms the other component parts of the UK.
We have a trade in goods balance of £4.9 billion based on 2012
figures; by contrast, England has a deficit of £122 billion.
Despite recent setbacks in Welsh exporting figures, this potential
trade deal is hugely
significant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000088">It
is right and proper that the House of Commons debates this issue, such
is the potential far-reaching impact of the trade deal for the economy
and public 
<?notus-xml column=197?>services. If I was a Member of the Welsh Parliament, knowing what I know
now I would also be demanding a debate and Welsh Government attention.
I read today in the <I>Western Mail</I> that the First Minister is

Government have published a swish pamphlet promoting the positive
potential of the TTIP, and we will hear many speeches in favour of it
today. To add balance therefore, I will concentrate on some of the
issues that I believe policy makers at Welsh and UK level, and the EU
negotiating team, should focus on during
negotiations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000090">Enthusiasm
in Wales for the European Union values of the single market—one
of the largest trading blocs in the world—is high, as it is for
the fact that Welsh citizens are allowed to travel unimpeded
and without visas within its territories, with the rights and
protections that affords us in workers’ rights and human rights.
I have my concerns about the privatisation obsession of the EU, but I
believe the Welsh economy benefits more from being a constituent part
of the EU than from being outside it. That is why my party argues for a
full and equal voice for my country as a member
state.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000091">Coming
from that position, it is difficult to argue wholeheartedly against
building on the EU single market by developing the TTIP. The EU single
market essentially offers free movement of goods, services, capital and
labour, and the TTIP would extend the same principles for goods,
services and capital. However, putting a Marxist cap on for
a minute, the TTIP would neglect
labour—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I had to get it in.
As I will explain later, that creates a potential imbalance that
worries me and on which I need reassurance from those on the Government

further irony that the Government are trumpeting an EU-US trade deal

Cymru support the principle of affording exporters in Wales the
opportunity to further their trade with the USA. It is the largest
destination for Welsh exports outside the EU and involves 23.7% of all
trade, which naturally leads to the question of whether there is
actually a problem to solve with the proposed trade deal. Certainly, we
would support any deal that was of mutual benefit and in the Welsh
national interest, and we would want guarantees that SMEs are genuinely

<?notus-xml column=198?>afforded entry into the market with the chance to create more jobs and
grow the economy. For example, exports from local farmers in
Carmarthenshire could benefit from a favourable deal. Indeed, the

Plaid Cymru would be opposed to any deal that ended up favouring big
corporations and allowed the further hollowing out of industrial
sectors of the Welsh economy. We also have grave concerns about the

be done to increase transparency in these negotiations. I am an avid
follower of the Twitter account launched by the EU negotiating team,
but much greater effort needs to be made by the EU and member states to
explain and inform people about the TTIP. Economists at the
Munich-based Ifo Institute found that a trade deal would lead to a
13.4% increase in US income per head in real terms over the long term,
but an average rise of only 5% among the EU 27, now
28—we in Wales welcome our friends in Croatia to the EU
table.</hs_Para>

assume that the US and EU agree on a deal that would lower
transatlantic tariffs, and harmonise and ease regulations in many
sectors that are often referred to as non-tariff barriers to trade.
Trust in any trading partner is essential. That is why last year I read
with great concern the revelations that the National Security Agency
surveillance programmes had been spying on Governments in Europe, with
the help of intelligence services in the UK. The spying revelations had
the potential to derail the proposed deal, given the understandable
outrage in some European capitals. I am amazed that there has not been
more public outrage here, given the level of intrusion into private
lives. I imagine that had any other foreign Government pursued such
blanket intrusion, the UK Government would have armed the nukes. Their
deafening silence about the NSA revelations indicates a worrying
collusion aimed at sidestepping UK civil liberty protections. That is
why it is incredibly important that, at every stage of the negotiations
on any deal, there is full transparency and accountability, and that
all groups are allowed input. This is a matter for all EU nations and
regions, not just the leaders of a few select large and economically
powerful states within it.</hs_Para>

Trade Ministers agreed on a mandate for the European Commission to

want to start by saying that I believe in free trade. I subscribe to
the goal of global trade that is both free and fair. Achieving that
goal, however, is a slow and grinding process. In my view, it will be
many decades before there is any meaningful World Trade
Organisation-led, top-down framework that we could call global free
trade. Why? Because the parties range from the richest to the poorest
nations on the planet, from the prairie farmers of north America to the
subsistence agriculture of sub-Saharan Africa. If we truly believe in
free trade, 
<?notus-xml column=201?>however, we should use the building blocks that we have today. The
European Union is the world’s largest market and we are part of
it. It is the biggest building block in this equation.</hs_Para>

these numbers: EU GDP is 19.4% of world GDP, and US GDP is 18.9% of
world GDP. Together that is nearly 40% of the worlds productive wealth,
but between us we still maintain some of the most stringent tariff and
non-tariff barriers to trade. Below the wire, under the barrier, 30% of
the EU’s stock of foreign direct investment is in the United
States, and 29% of the US’s FDI is in the EU. This is,
therefore, a no-brainer. If we can create free trade across the
Atlantic, with Canada as well of course, and have the transatlantic
trade and investment partnership, that has got to be good for world
trade, good for the United States, good for Europe and good for
Britain. There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>

TTIP negotiations will not be easy. There are too many vested interests
and we have heard about some of them already: in agriculture, the
public sector, transport and financial services, to name but a few.
However, the prize is so great and the balance of power so favourable
to a deal that I am optimistic we can achieve it. Outside the EU, the
cards are stacked against us. Heaven forbid, it would be difficult
enough to get a deal with the EU if we had just left it. Of course,
some Eurosceptics would argue, in spite of the hard facts, that we
would still be better off out and better off negotiating our own free
trade deal with the US alone. That is, frankly, a fantasy. Can the UK
afford to squander such a strategic and economic opportunity? I believe

the material value that the UK derives from our membership of the EU,
but the leverage and influence that we can only exercise by playing the
lead role within it. This is a fact. The UK has accomplished so much

agreement that could undermine their rights and an opportunity lost to
support our friends in the unions in the US. The US has ratified only
14 of the 190 International Labour Organisation conventions, unlike EU
member states who have ratified them all. I understand that with this
anti-union Government and the pull of the US Republicans we are
unlikely to see the inclusion of rights to organise, rights to bargain
collectively or as a last resort rights to strike, but there are some
rights that are applicable across the EU, such as those on information
and consultation, agency and temporary workers, and health and safety,
which we could and should see included. If nothing else, the deal
should not lead to a watering down of workers’ rights. I am
pleased that the EU is consulting with an advisory group of trade
unionists, non-governmental organisations and employers, and that the
Department for Business, Innovation and Skills is involved in a similar
process. I hope that those in charge of negotiations listen to these
groups, who I am sure will be keeping a close eye on labour rights, and
act on their
advice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000134">Many

Governments should be able to decide if and when industries should be
returned to public control. As has been said, a key anxiety is that if
the NHS is not exempt from the TTIP, corporations will use the
agreement to force more large-scale privatisation following
implementation of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 in England and
Wales. What if a future Government or local authorities decided to
return transport to public ownership? These measures could limit the
ability of local or national authorities to use public money to achieve
social and environmental outcomes through their supply chains.
Decisions such as this should not be based on free trade. We need to
retain our ability to run EU member states as we see fit, rather than
as multinational corporations see fit.</hs_Para>

Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) on introducing the
debate, and on the manner in which he did so. I think it refreshing to
have a debate about first principles and about how we might create
future wealth, rather than about how we might spend it. We have learnt
from history that trade—and free trade in particular—has
enabled us all to make ourselves richer. We do not have to be convinced
about how interdependent the world is when we observe that the tsunami
in Japan caused shortages in one or two of our car factories. That

international

have been through a difficult economic time, comparable in many
respects to the 1930s, but in terms of public policy, politicians in
most western countries have acted in a very good way, and have kept
their economies moving forward. On the whole, they have done a pretty
good job of tackling what I think was a major difficulty in 2007-08. A
few years ago, I should have said that the forces of protection would
be far more on the march today than they have been. I think that that
is because the vast majority of our fellow citizens and constituents
now recognise the benefits of international trade. We have seen the
success of Jaguar Land Rover, which has exported 80% of its
output—£13.7 billion—much of it not
only to the United States but to the far east. That shows how we are
creating wealth and jobs, and how the British economy can benefit from

TTIP has huge potential. The CBI has rightly described it as a
“global economic game changer”. It can create more jobs
here in the UK, improve the wages of British workers, and deliver a
better deal for our consumers, but only if we get it right. As we have
heard, according to some assessments the potential gain to British
output is between £4 billion and £10 billion, equating to
between 1% and 3% in exports. We must, however, be cautious about the
overall figures, as they have been questioned by some leading
academics. My right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne has
been asking for an area-by-area assessment, and I think that such an
assessment would allow Members to sell the deal to their constituents.

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000156">Given
that the European Union and the United States account for 40% of global
economic output and that their bilateral economic relationship is
already the world’s largest, the opportunities are clear for all
to see. Between them, they contain more than 800 million consumers, and
the TTIP has significant potential for them as well. It is clear from
the helpful briefing sent to all Members by Which? that there will be
big prizes for them if we can get this right. Opposition Members
strongly support the principles behind the negotiations, and hope that
their objectives—job creation, better wages, higher standards
and consumer benefits—can be realised. That, indeed, should be

first key test is the ability to deliver jobs and growth, with which I

Members. Thirdly, the aim should be to achieve the highest possible

wages. Fourthly, the agreement must allow leeway for national
Governments to act in their own interests.</hs_Para>

four key tests, we will monitor closely the negotiations between the EU
and the US, and the UK Government’s input into them. Likewise,
we want the benefits that businesses experience to be passed on to
consumers, whether through increased choice or reduced prices. It is
rather puzzling that we have a Government who extol the virtues of the
opportunities that the TTIP brings, yet ironically argue at the same
time that we must leave Europe. Frankly, the TTIP is a shot across the
bows for Tory Eurosceptics—a gang that the Minister has never
been part of, for which he should be commended. The hon. Member for
North Dorset (Mr Walter), who is not in his place, said
clearly that it is in the UK’s interests to stay in the EU. I
hope that the Minister will echo that when he responds to the debate. I
firmly hope, however, that the UK is in the room for the
negotiations and not carping from the room next door. This issue is far
too important. That is why Labour will make the hard-headed, patriotic
case, founded on the national interest, both for Britain in Europe and
for change in Europe. To take up the benefits of an EU-US deal fully,
we must be part of the EU.</hs_Para>

me turn to some of the concerns that right hon. and hon. Friends have
raised. First, they raised concerns about the ISDS aspects of the
proposals, which have been well publicised and documented. Labour MEP
colleagues and our sister parties in the socialists and democrats group
in the European Parliament voted to scrap that mechanism, but they have
faced an uphill battle in the EU Parliament dominated by Conservatives
and a minority of MEPs. Therefore, we will continue to push for the
need for effective and necessary transparency to be
included in the final deal. As the BIS study 
<?notus-xml column=208?>conducted by the London School of Economics found, the ISDS would have
little or no economic benefit and carries significant political risks.
It is welcome, then, that the EU Trade Commissioner has decided to
consult on that, which will give stakeholders an important opportunity
to raise their concerns and increase the transparency of the deal. My
right hon. Friend the Member for Wentworth and Dearne
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:18:34"></hs_TimeCode>mentioned War on
Want, which has rightly campaigned on the matter and I hope that the
Minister will be robust in having the ISDS removed from the TTIP
negotiations. Can he update the House on his current thinking on that
and whether he will press strongly for that to be
removed?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000165">Secondly,
as my right hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham) has said,
we are clear that the NHS must not be included in any agreement. In
fact, all public services should be removed. In the UK, the demands of
a 21st-century care system require integration. Markets are not the
answer to the delivery of today’s health care. That would
deliver something unwelcome in the form of fragmentation. The
Government need to be clear on that, as they have sent out mixed
messages to date. In response to my parliamentary question on

congratulate the right hon. Member for Wentworth and Dearne (John

debate on this important subject. I welcome the fact that the vast
majority of Members have spoken out in favour of the prospects of a
trade agreement between the EU and the US, which we believe will be of
great benefit to this country. I hope that the debate might serve the
purpose of publicising the virtues of trade agreements between the EU
and the US, as several hon. Members have said. I can assure Members
that it is not for want of trying. I am afraid that the media in this
country probably find the virtual consensus that exists between the
main spokesmen in this debate one of the things that makes it less
newsworthy. However, an agreement could be of enormous importance to
the future of our economy.</hs_Para>

Clarke:</Member></B> I will give way shortly. I will merely say that
the fact that we have this near consensus in British politics helps to
give the UK a leading role in the negotiations. It is one of those
areas where, despite our, at times, slightly tricky relationships with
the EU, the UK is acknowledged to be the member state most in favour of
open trading relationships. It is known that the UK’s position
is not dependent on the position of one political party but extends way
across the political threshold. My role, at the request of my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister, is to ensure that British interests and
influence are brought to bear both in Washington and Brussels as the
agreement goes ahead. It will be of huge value to achieve this, but let
no one be too complacent about the prospects of getting a comprehensive
agreement. It will not be easy, but I believe that the prospects are

concerns. That is the key reservation that is being expressed. A lot of
Members say that they are in favour of a TTIP but are extremely worried
that it will affect our ability to set standards, and it is important
that we address those fears. I genuinely believe that they are
unfounded, but it is feared that people are getting conspiratorial and
somehow plotting to reduce farming, food safety, health and
environmental standards on both sides of the Atlantic. The fact is that
the British Government are convinced that a trade deal is not the place
to raise or lower standards for the consumer, for the environment, for
health and safety, for employment or for farming and food safety. Those
are matters for the legislative authorities on both sides of the
Atlantic to decide for themselves. On neither side of the Atlantic is
anyone proposing to undermine those standards.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) drew our attention

the US, I find myself having to reassure people that we are not trying

in the Democrat party who are close to the labour unions, I have to
reassure them that our labour market standards on this side of the
Atlantic are as good as, if not dramatically better than, those in the
United States, even if our pay rates are not so high. The issues are
not the same between us as they are between, for example, the United

neither side of the Atlantic is there any weakness in the lobbying from
NGOs and others on all these issues. The negotiators on both sides of

the British Government—have no intention of allowing our own

we need to keep up the momentum and make progress. If we do not achieve
this deal by the end of 2015 or early 2016, we will not get there at
all because the politics will take over. That is the history of trade
deals. We would all have preferred an arrangement like the Doha round,
under the auspices of the World Trade Organisation, but since that has

brings me to the question of transparency. No one is hostile to the
idea of being transparent. The EU is a union of 28 nation states and
Governments, all of whom have their own Parliament, and the desire to
share information among Parliaments and the public is considerable.
There is a dilemma, however, in that there is a conflict between that
arrangement and the negotiating positions. There is no doubt that our
American friends negotiate very hard indeed. They are pretty hard-nosed
people when it comes to negotiating the detail, and we cannot send our
negotiators into the chamber with all their bottom lines, their
ambitions and the mandates they have received from their member states
revealed. We need to get that balance right, but the instinct of
Commissioner de Gucht and Commissioner Barnier—and certainly of
the British Government—is to be as forthcoming as possible, so
long as we are not simply feeding information to lobbies that want to
try to put a spoke in the wheels.

and then I will give way. First, let us remember that trade deals do
benefit consumers, which is why consumer groups such as Which? are in
favour of this trade deal. It is protectionist providers that resist
such deals. Quality, choice and the price for consumers are improved
where there is a good trade deal, and those with the best products and
services tend to win out in trade deals. The ISDS clause is not a
novelty; it is not some new threat that has emerged. Such clauses have
been put into most trade deals for years and years. I have heard the
familiar examples of odd claims that have been made in actions around
the world, but these clauses have not had the effect that has been
described.</hs_Para>

there are 3,400 of these clauses inserted in trade deals globally. The
EU and its members have 1,400 ISDS clauses in various trade deals, and
the UK has 94 ISDS clauses in our existing bilateral treaties. We have
twice been challenged under ISDS for standards alleged to break our
treaty obligations, but so far no British Government have ever lost a
case under ISDS. What we have done is successfully brought claims
against other countries; we have had slightly more success there,
because the point of an ISDS is to underline the value of the total
agreement by making sure that no individual investor or business can be

case was cited of Slovenia—somebody, perhaps
the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:30:45"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr (Jonathan Edwards), said
Slovakia—and my understanding is that it was lost when, as a
result of local lobbying, that country went back on the deal it had
just done to open up its health insurance market. That cannot be done,
but no ISDS takes away the right to legislate from a Parliament; an
ISDS gives rise only to a quicker and cheaper means of resolving
disputes if there is some suggestion that a Government are breaking the
agreement. Some say, “No European Union Government or the USA
would ever do that”, but one of the big ambitions of those on
this side of the Atlantic is to open up the public procurement market
in the US. In some states of the US it is open, but in others it is
not; some states do 
<?notus-xml column=213?>not measure up to WTO standards at all. Far be it
for me to express the faintest doubts about the approach of politicians
in some smaller US states or some EU states, but public procurement
sometimes takes on a pork barrel element when the contracts are being
placed, as opposed to when the tenders are being issued.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022578000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000193">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:30:17"></hs_TimeCode>
think there could be some advantage, some reassurance and some pressure
against people cheating in public procurement contracts if it is known
that there is an ISDS clause. Of course it is quicker and cheaper, and
it is arbitration and not litigation, but again the argument of those
against ISDS is, “Why don’t you just go to law? There is
a perfectly good legal system in the European countries and in the
US.” I can say only that the US does have a perfectly good legal
system, but it is expensive and it can be extremely long, as one sails
through either the state courts or the federal courts trying to resolve
a dispute. People have said that the advantages in all this agreement
are as much in the area of regulatory coherence —with far more
regulatory coherence stopping unnecessary convergence in our
recognition of regulatory standards—than they are in tariffs,
but small and medium-sized countries are not going to go into these
markets if they are taking on the risk of having to go in for expensive
litigation against American authorities that are plainly not complying
with their terms of the treaty. Similarly, there are states in the EU
where American investors would be most reluctant to sail in if they
were relying entirely on the fact that they can take to the legal
process in some southern European countries to challenge the bona fides
of local officials over whether they were complying with the agreement.
I will go no further, but the British have always put these clauses in
our trade deals and the US normally puts them in its trade deals; 3,400
of them are in place and they have made a reality of free trade where
it would otherwise not have
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:34:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Clarke:</Member></B> Obviously, I understand the doubts being
expressed, because some extremely respectable lobbies and
non-governmental organisations—some consumer groups, some aid
lobbies and some sections of the trade union movement—are
raising all these fears. I genuinely think that they are mistaken and
that their arguments, if they are too successful, will not benefit
employees, consumers or anybody else, which is why I am trying to rebut
them. Those who have spoken—I do not think anyone would be
offended if I described them as somewhat of the left of the broad
political spectrum, which does not mean that they are unacceptably or
extremely left—are getting the wrong end of the stick. The
ordinary man and woman have a great deal to benefit from this TTIP. To
make it less effective by excluding an ISDS would not
help.</hs_Para>

Clarke:</Member></B> I realise that a broader issue underpins those
fears, which is the extent to which there is scope for private sector
involvement in our national health service, and that is part of a much
bigger argument that I have taken part in for 30 years. I was not aware
that a distinction was drawn between British, French and German private
sector participation and American participation in our national health
service. I can assure the hon. Lady that nothing in the agreement would
open up access to the national health service beyond what is already
permitted, and what was permitted under the previous Government.
Overseas suppliers are already able to offer hospital services and
health-related professional services through a commercial presence
here. The important thing for anyone who engages in the provision of
professional health services and health care companies in this country
is that they have to comply with UK standards and regulations in just
the same way as British health care providers, and, as I say, those
standards will remain under the sovereignty of this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:37:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:37:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000198"><Member ContinuationText="Mr John Spellar" PimsId="781" UID="14022578000492" xid="555" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000492"><B>Mr

Gentleman was asked a question regarding the involvement of
micro-businesses, but the note from the Library states that the average
cost of an arbitration case is $4 million per party, about 82% of which
is legal fees. The panel members can claim a daily fee of $3,000 a day
plus expenses, and billing rates for arbitration lawyers run up to
$1,000 an hour. Only major corporations will therefore be able to
participate in this. I am not detracting from the main thrust of his

and the fast-track arrangements. As my right hon. and learned Friend
knows, President Obama, in his State of the Union address, called for
fast-track arrangements. The next day, the Democratic leader in the

Democratic Leader in the House of Representatives, turned it down only
last week. Was my right hon. Friend being a little sanguine in his

Clarke:</Member></B> I said only that the timing of fast track
authority would have an effect on the timing of any agreement. I follow
these matters closely. Obviously, they are utterly beyond our control.
This is a political issue in Congress. There is more support in both
Houses of Congress for a trade agreement with the EU than I can
remember in my political career, but people have reservations and of
course many people in Congress would rather see all the details before
they approve it rather than give too early authority. The problem is
that no one will ever settle a negotiation with a US Administration on
the basis that Congress might be able to suggest detailed amendments to
it afterwards as a condition of approval. It would be improper for me
to start offering opinions about how it is going to go with the United
States, but the timing of fast track authority is a little uncertain.

the TTIP. As my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Mr Buckland)

covers 47% of the world’s GDP and about 30% of world trade. If
we can get a proper comprehensive agreement, we will set standards that
will guide future trade agreements that will inevitably involve China.

on to the big challenge of deciding how China should be accommodated in

play any significant role in this kind of problem if it suddenly
decided to revive the mediaeval kingdom and start leaving the United

United Kingdom economy that is modern and competitive —as ever,
opening possibilities for us. A confident United

it is clear from many of the articles that have been written and from
some e-mails that we are receiving that we may have to take the debate
back to first principles, starting by explaining why free trade is not
only a good idea but why it has been a major driver in the removal of a
massive number of the world’s people from poverty during the
past two centuries, particularly during the past 30 years. The mass
migration of hundreds of millions of people in China, the development
of Chinese cities and infrastructure, and the raising of the Chinese
people’s living standards have been awesome. That does not mean
that I am oblivious to many of the faults, problems and stresses in
Chinese society; given my political history, it would be surprising if
I was. However, everyone must recognise the seismic shift that has
happened on the back of the world’s freer trade
environment.We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:46:34"></hs_TimeCode>
must also consider the effects of that shift on wage distribution and
the environment in other countries, and understand that generally
protection does not benefit the worker or the consumer; mainly it
benefits the monopolist, the corrupt bureaucrat or the profiteer and
black marketeer.</hs_Para>

I have said previously, the argument about free trade goes back over

often, the debates on this subject have been focused on and posed as a
choice between either the US or the EU. This agreement clearly shows

interested in doing a deal with the EU—and not just about trade.
A lot has been made in the defence field about the so-called
“pivot” of the US between the Atlantic and the Pacific
going from 50:50 to 60:40 in favour of the Pacific—by the way,
that is still a huge presence from the world’s only superpower.
The transatlantic alliance has served us and a stable world extremely
well, and reinforcing it would be important in its own right.
Agreements between the EU and the US, Canada and Japan make a much
better context for maintaining a liberal trading and political
environment, because although I have acknowledged the huge Chinese
achievement I would not wish to see the economic and political muddle
of China dominating the international trade scene. In particular, I
would not wish to see the arbitrary use of state power against workers

the Member for Paisley and Renfrewshire North (Jim Sheridan) raised
that issue. That has been the particular concern of the American unions
about the impact of the North American Free Trade Agreement, including
the agreement with Mexico. However, having met representatives of those
unions, I know that they have considerably fewer reservations about a
deal with the EU, because of the higher level of protection for
workers, consumers and the environment that we have in the EU. Indeed,
the level in the EU is higher than in some southern states in the US.
Only recently, we have seen a massively funded and vicious anti-union
campaign against representation in Volkswagen’s plant in
Tennessee.

years ago when I interviewed Ralph Nader, the consumer activist and
occasional presidential candidate, about the North American Free Trade
Agreement, he told me that even though Congress was set overwhelmingly
to back the treaty, he was convinced from his discussions with members
that few of them, if any, had bothered even to read the text. He
eventually offered a substantial prize to any member who was willing
publicly to answer 12 simple questions about NAFTA. Following a long
pause, a strongly NAFTA-supporting Republican, Senator Hank Brown of
Colorado, accepted the challenge and reserved the Senate Foreign
Relations Committee room for the ordeal. The cameras and journalists
were there and, to everyone’s amazement, he answered each of the
12 questions correctly, but when he had finished, he turned away from
Ralph Nader to the cameras and said that having read the treaty, which
he had not previously done, he realised just how awful it was, so he
chose to do a U-turn and to vote against
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:52:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000220" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000220">At
this stage, we do not have a huge amount to go on regarding the TTIP
but, whatever one thinks about it, it clearly has serious implications
and it merits close scrutiny. On the whole, free trade agreements are
about lowering barriers to trade—that is their
purpose—but, compared with the situation in other countries,
there are relatively few barriers to trade between the EU and the US,
so the main focus must be standards and regulations, with the goal of
trying to harmonise them. However, it is hard to imagine that the
process will involve any key standards going up; on the contrary, I
suspect that we will see a spiral
downwards<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:53:37"></hs_TimeCode>. We
only have to read several of the publications put forward by some of
the most substantial big business lobby groups to see that they are

happen at the expense of democracy. My concern is that the proposed

undermine democracy. Under those mechanisms, companies wishing to
challenge a national regulation could effectively bypass the usual

Regulating will remain the responsibility of the authorities that
already regulate. The only claim that can be made through the ISDS is
that the state has gone back on its treaty obligation. Therefore,
unless in the course of negotiations some agreement has been entered
into to change regulatory standards on either side of the Atlantic,
there is no way our existing rules on food standards or anything else
could be challenged by some American company that suddenly decides that
now that we have signed a TTIP it has the right to try to change the
rules. What we are trying to get rid of is unnecessary regulation and
the duplication by regulators on either side of the Atlantic of
processes designed to reach the same public objective. That is the kind

great deal of concern has been expressed about multinationals,
particularly their ability to use investor-state dispute settlement
procedures where the nation’s regulatory framework is deemed to
be a barrier to free trade. There is a huge amount of concern that this
treaty could be yet another device that is used to thwart the wishes of
Parliaments, as democratically elected bodies, to make decisions,
particularly in relation to public services. We have heard a number of
references to the health sector, which, in England in particular, is
very politically contentious at the moment because of this
Government’s attempts to open the health service up to enable
private providers, many of which may well be US multinationals, to
enter the sector. However, the concerns raised about these provisions
in relation to the health service are equally valid in relation to many
other aspects of the services and utilities on which the public rely,
whether they are currently in the public sector or the
private sector.</hs_Para>

I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:04:34"></hs_TimeCode> am very aware
of that because in North Ayrshire and Arran the Scottish Government
have spent many millions —indeed, tens of millions—of
pounds in restructuring the ferry services that serve my constituency
so that CalMac, a publicly owned body in Scotland, could take part in a
tendering exercise that some private organisations also took part in.
At the end of that procedure, we ended up with exactly the same ferries
providing exactly the same services between the ports in my
constituency. That example is relevant because of the European
procurement
regulations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0002.htm#14022578000240">Many<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:09:53"></hs_TimeCode>
of the concerns raised today could already be seen as problems when it
comes to decisions being made by democratically elected bodies about
public services. Genuine concerns are being raised about the ability to
use public procurement to achieve social and environmental outcomes,
and about whether the provisions of this partnership treaty could
restrict the ability of Governments —whether they are the UK

the concerns being raised by Opposition Members about whether we are
signing up to something that, while it may result in huge benefits for
this country, may have a lot of devil in its detail and may cause huge
problems and restrict the democratic ability of this House and, indeed,

to this debate, I received a number of e-mails from constituents who
are finally becoming aware of the issue of the TTIP, and that is no bad
thing. The all-party group, which has been in existence for almost nine
months, has held two debates and conducts regular meetings, so at least
it is making sure that the issue is debated in a transparent manner in
this Parliament. It is important that we discuss such issues as
regularly as necessary and that we touch on the serious concerns that
have been raised by a number of
Members<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:07:56"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
clear that those who have spoken reflect a spectrum of opinion on this
very important issue. I might not necessarily agree with everything

this open

the current situation, this is an opportune moment for this second
debate. A stock-taking exercise is taking place and there are question
marks over the possible threat to the fast-track process, which will
come as no surprise to those of us who travelled to Washington in
October and early November, where the confidence of the British embassy
was not reflected in our discussions with American Congressmen, who
were very concerned about signing or agreeing any fast-track procedure
prior to the mid-term elections this November. This is, therefore, an

also need to be aware of the need to maintain momentum, because I am
concerned at the number of scare stories I read in the press and
certainly in my e-mail inbox. We need to address them, because it is
important to make sure that our discussion is not just open, but
honest. One of the scare stories I received in an e-mail said that the
treaty would create no jobs or 
<?notus-xml column=223?>economic development, which is a risible claim.
We have received evidence from the TUC, the CBI and the
Federation of Small Businesses, all of which highlight the
treaty’s potential. More importantly, individual companies,
including small businesses and farming unions in Wales, see the real
opportunities for job creation and economic benefit from such a treaty.
It is therefore important, whatever the views of Members, that we
highlight the fact that the potential for job creation is very
real.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000247"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Roger Williams" PimsId="4622" UID="14022578000516" xid="638" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000516"><B>Roger

a level playing field for food producers. The Farmers Union of Wales

impact of the treaty on the Welsh food

Friend the Member for Richmond Park (Zac Goldsmith) is no longer in his
place. On the regulatory burden in relation not to the food industry
but to the automobile sector, which would undoubtedly benefit from a
TTIP agreement, Jaguar Land Rover—a huge investor in our
manufacturing base—has highlighted the regulations on airbags.
It has to insert different panels and dashboards into its vehicles for
the American market, because airbags in America have to work on the
basis of people not wearing a seatbelt, while those in the European
Union do so on the basis of people wearing a seatbelt. That leads to
extra cost, and it is a disincentive for trade. We could certainly
benefit consumers by dealing with such regulations, which seem to have
no purpose whatever, except to add cost and possibly to create extra
employment for health and safety experts on either side of the
Atlantic<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:12:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

story that I should mention is the one about these agreements bringing
no advantage to consumers. Anybody who has listened to Which? would be
hard pressed to conclude that no consumer would benefit from such a
trade agreement. When people argue that consumers will not benefit from
free trade, there is something important to bear in mind: I find it
very odd that the very people who make that argument do so by sending
me e-mails from iPads manufactured in China or from Samsung telephones
manufactured in Korea. They are quite willing to use the advantages of
free trade to communicate their concerns about free trade, which puts
them in a very odd

key issue about which I am seriously concerned is how the national
health service is again being used as a political football in this
debate. I want to state on the record that nobody can outflank me in
supporting the concept of a health service free at the point of use for
those in need. Somebody whose family has needed the support of the
health service, as mine has, would never not support the concept of a
free health service. However, the mere concept that American companies
accessing the health sector in the United Kingdom is somehow different
from European ones doing so is very
odd<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000254" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000254">I
simply do not get another of the arguments in relation to people being
so concerned about the involvement of private companies in our health
service. Ever since the instigation of the NHS in 1948, the most
respected part of the health service has been the traditional GP
surgery. That is a robust private sector initiative within the health
service. The issue is not about whether doctors make a profit because
of their work, but about whether they offer patients a good service. I
would be very comfortable with American companies delivering medical
services, provided that those services are of a very high standard, are
in tune with United Kingdom regulations and, more importantly, are
delivering good patient care. Surely that is the issue. It is a
pedantic view that any private involvement is simply wrong. We need to
challenge that view. We need to be honest about the way in which the
private sector adds value to the health service. We should reject the

Lavery</B> (Wansbeck) (Lab):</Member> A number of people have said that
there must be a good business case for the transatlantic trade and
investment partnership. I think that we need much more than a good
business case. I am concerned that there are huge inherent dangers in
the TTIP for many working people and for public services in the UK. My
major concern is that the trade agreement has the potential to dilute
workers’
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000262">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:17:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:17:55"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) said twice that people are
scaremongering with regard to the TTIP. He must not mix up
scaremongering with people taking a different view from
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000263">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>
are two major problems with the TTIP. The first is labour rights and
the second is investor-state dispute settlement, which we have
discussed a lot this afternoon. I listened carefully to the Minister.
He said, basically, that ISDS is ineffective. If it is ineffective and
has not been used as much as everybody thinks it has, why is it in the
agreement at all? That is a simple question. Why do we have ISDS if we
do not need
it<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:19:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000264">The
proposal is that the TTIP would establish in law the right of
multinational corporations to sue nation states in a special
court through investor-state dispute settlement if the nation’s
regulatory framework is deemed to be a barrier to free trade. Of course
that is concerning. It should concern everyone in this House. ISDS is a
one-way street by which corporations can challenge Government policies,
but neither Governments nor individuals are granted comparable rights
to hold corporations accountable. Opinions suggest that these clauses
could thwart attempts by a future Government to bring a health service
back towards public ownership—again, that issue has been
discussed at great length today.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022578000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000265">It has been
said time and again that there are major concerns about the potential
impact the TTIP could have on the future of the NHS, and on the way the
wider public sector is organised in the UK. There should have been a
clear exemption, particularly for the NHS but also for the public
sector more widely, in the negotiated mandate agreed by the European
Council. Given the implications of the Health and Social Care Act 2012
on the commissioning and organisation of health services in the UK,
there is a clear danger that major private health care corporations
will be looking for opportunities within any TTIP agreement to force
further large-scale privatisation.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022578000266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000266">There is an
additional danger in the proposed inclusion in any TTIP agreement of an
ISDS. Both the EU and the USA have respected and strong legal systems,
and there is no justification for creating a mechanism to allow
corporations to bypass the usual legal process to launch expropriation
litigation should a UK Government 
<?notus-xml column=226?>attempt to bring elements of the health service, or other parts of the
public sector, back under direct public control.</hs_Para>

are also extremely important. As I think has been mentioned, the US has
ratified only 14 of the 190 International Labour Organisation
conventions —among the lowest in the world. It has ratified only
two of the eight core conventions dealing with forced labour, child
labour, freedom of association and discrimination. It has not ratified
conventions 87 or 98, and is almost certainly in breach of both,
according to the ILO freedom of association committee.</hs_Para>

basically states that congressional Republicans will agree to a TTIP
only if the extension of any workers’ rights is ruled out before
the TTIP is agreed in its entirety. If that is the case, it will be
interesting to see what the EU has to say. I would have thought we
would have understood that discussions would take place without any
preconditions, and if there are preconditions—if that is what
the Republicans are saying—perhaps we in the UK have little to
concern ourselves
about.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000270">Many
of those in US unions see a labour chapter in the TTIP as potentially
opening up a European-style social model and worker dialogue with
employers, which in some parts of the USA I think would be seen as a
huge advantage. That has been explained clearly by the Communication
Workers of America and the United Steelworkers. Organisations that have
been terribly supportive of a TTIP that would enhance labour rights
within the framework include the American Federation of Labor and the
Congress of Industrial Organizations. The American Federation of Labor
has a loud, clear voice and a mandate of 11 million
workers.</hs_Para>

Pawsey</B> (Rugby) (Con):</Member> It is a great pleasure to speak in
this important debate and I add my congratulations to the all-party
group on EU-US trade and investment, and to the right hon. Member for
Wentworth and Dearne (John Healey) and my hon. Friend the Member for
Aberconwy (Guto Bebb) on securing this debate. I am pleased to
contribute to this debate because, along with other Members from across
the House, I had the opportunity to visit the United States in November
as part of the British-American parliamentary group, with a visit
focusing on the TTIP negotiations. I confess that prior to that visit,
like many Members and people across the country, I had a lack of
awareness about the negotiations. I was aware that something was taking
place, but frankly I could not have said what TTIP stood for. On the
visit I was particularly interested in the impact on small businesses,
having run a small business before coming to this place. I represent a
constituency in the west midlands with a resurgent motor industry, so I
was also keen to see the impact on that sector.</hs_Para>

takes two parties to make a deal. Across the House, I think we have
seen broad enthusiasm for the TTIP, and that is reflected across the UK
and the EU. Generally, I think there is less enthusiasm in the US. Part
of our 
<?notus-xml column=227?>role is to understand the anxieties and fears of people in the US and
consider how we might persuade them to come to a deal. In Washington,
we met politicians from both parties. We also went beyond Washington to
meet officials in places such as Philadelphia and Delaware. We raised
with the Governor of Delaware the possibility of public procurement
being included in the TTIP and becoming available for countries outside
the US. I have to confess that the Governor’s principal concern
was jobs. Indeed, we heard concerns about jobs across the piece from
all of the organisations we spoke to.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022578000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000273">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:24:40"></hs_TimeCode>
met the American Farm Bureau Federation and spoke about the
opportunities for its produce in the UK. It expressed concern over
geographical indicators: it would not be able to call its hard cheese
“parmesan” in the UK market, as it is able to in the US.
It also has concerns regarding the accessibility of its largely
genetically modified foods in the UK. We met the American Federation of
Labor and the Congress of Industrial Organizations. Perhaps I might
reassure the<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:26:28"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery), who has just spoken, that labour
organisations in the US see the TTIP as an opportunity to bring
Europe’s higher labour standards to the US, rather than allowing
for transit in the opposite direction.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022578000274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000274"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:26:51"></hs_TimeCode>Throughout
our discussions we heard about the need for a fast-track authority in
the US that provides an unamendable resolution. The Minister talked
about whether the granting of the fast-track process would affect the
timing of a deal. I think it goes further than that. In the absence of
fast track, it is highly unlikely that any deal will ever be made,
because without a fast-track process any vested interest that believed
it was threatened by the TTIP could derail an agreement. President
Obama has made it clear that he would like to see a fast-track
negotiating authority, but this remains unresolved. Indeed, we were
shown a letter from 22 Members of Congress addressed to the
President stating that they would not agree to cede constitutional
authority to the Executive through the approval of a fast-track
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:27:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000275">We
found a real shortage of awareness about the TTIP in the US. It is
important to recognise that in November, when we were there, the US
Government had just had their first shutdown as a consequence of the
stand-off between the parties on the budget. That in itself had led to
the postponement of talks. There was also a preoccupation with the
Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. More than once in
meetings we heard people say that Obamacare was sucking the oxygen out
of all other policy discussions in the US.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022578000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000276"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:28:22"></hs_TimeCode>My
impression of how Americans see the TTIP talks is that they are
bothered that they have more to lose than they have to gain. They have
a massive prize that they believe they are being asked to give away:
access to the biggest and most successful market in the world. They
need reassurance that if they allow access to their market, there will
be something in it for them. There is a feeling that in earlier trade
agreements—perhaps the agreement between Canada and
Mexico—US negotiators had given too much away and that that had
led to “Buy American” campaigns. The concern of opponents
is that the TTIP might give too much away and that that will lead to
labour
losses<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T16:29:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Pawsey:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a fair point, but the
perception of politicians was that the “Buy American”
policy kept jobs in the United States and prevented them from being

maximised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000279" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000279">The
US does not always give things away and there is not a gung-ho attitude
to the free market. Regular reference was made to the 1920 Merchant
Marine Act, otherwise known as the Jones Act, being a great example of
how America can be protectionist when it wishes to be. That is the
legislation that requires all goods transported by water between US
ports to be carried on US-flagged ships constructed in the US, owned by
US citizens and crewed by US citizens. So the US can be protectionist
and prevent other countries from gaining access to its

we want to achieve the permanent rebalancing of the economy more
towards manufacturing and export-led growth, expanding markets for our
goods and services and removing barriers to trade are essential.
According to the OBR, two thirds of all UK growth between 
<?notus-xml column=229?>mid-2010 and 2015 was expected to stem from rising exports and business
investment, but the most recent estimates indicate that less than a
fifth of the growth over that period will come from those sources, and
there are 300,000 fewer people working in our manufacturing industries,
compared with 2008. This is adding to the United Kingdom’s
growing problem with productivity. The proposed transatlantic trade and
investment partnership that this House is considering today is vital to
realising the vision of a higher wage and more highly skilled economy.
As we know, this is an agreement that will expand global trade, not
take trade away from other parts of the

know that exports are likely to rise by 6% in the EU and by 8% in the
United States, but we must recognise that this agreement has to benefit
all in our societies, not just those at the very top. Reducing tariffs,
securing regulatory convergence and aligning technical trading
standards could make a family of four in the EU up to €545 a
year better off. It could boost GDP in this country by up to £10
billion a year, according to the Government’s own impact
assessment, and create up to 400,000 jobs.</hs_Para>

communications and data services across the Atlantic and improving the

consumers from this agreement, but there will be areas where retaining

right hon. and learned Member for Rushcliffe (Mr Clarke) used his
formidable powers of advocacy to try to persuade the House that there

least, he was not entirely successful. He was right to point to the 91
agreements of a similar nature in bilateral investment agreements that
we have signed with other countries, but perhaps he missed an important
point. This agreement would bind 28 member states, which at the moment
may have different standards in all these areas. We should do nothing
in these negotiations to undermine the crucial role that the European
Court of Justice plays in ensuring equal standards across the European
Union.</hs_Para>

article 226 of the EU treaty permits member states that have breached
treaty requirements to be brought before the ECJ for infraction
proceedings, which bind all member states. The problem with the
arbitration anticipated in some drafts of the negotiations is that it
would not bind all member states: it would simply bind the parties to
that individual dispute. We should emphasise that, in these
discussions, the ECJ should be the final arbiter—the binding and

the TTIP with confidence, but I agree with the Minister that we should

constituency in the House, but on his agility in rightly focusing
Members’ minds on the dynamics of the Scottish debate and how
important it is to us. The Minister responded to the hon.

them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000296">I
want to focus on farming, food production and consumer rights, because
they affect my constituents dramatically. As I said to the Minister in
an intervention, 
<?notus-xml column=231?>a good deal will be marked by how we ensure that the rights and needs of
our farmers—our primary producers of food, and of excellent
food—are protected, aided and abetted in the negotiations. There
is no doubt that we produce the best traceable food in the world. It is
a £20 billion-plus industry and an essential trade, and in my
part of the United Kingdom it is the most essential trade. It is a
mainstay of business and employment. It is the one sector in which our
productivity is increasing annually. I believe that last year our food
production increased by an average of about 12%. That is a
Chinese-style proportion of growth. We need to keep a careful eye on
it, and ensure that it
continues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000297" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000297">The
fact that we produce the best food in the world makes that food not
just worth protecting, but worth exporting. It is clear that people
want to buy our food and drink products. In my constituency, for
example, the Bushmills distillery produces what I am told is the finest
whiskey in the world. The Minister will have sampled it many, many
times. That distillery employs 102 people in my constituency, but 90%
of what it produces is exported, and the vast majority goes to the
United States of America. Last year, its trade increased by 14%. Such
growth must be encouraged, and must be seen as a major opportunity in
the TTIP negotiations.</hs_Para>

urge the Minister to think of the 85,000 people in our community who
are involved in agri-food production, and to ensure that they and their
rights are put at the top of the agenda, because that affects consumer
confidence. We can say to our consumers, with strength and authority,
that we know what they are consuming because it is traceable. That is
one of the advantages that we have as an island nation, and we must use
it to our advantage, because it makes our food a very desirable
commodity. We need to ensure that food that is imported to the United
Kingdom meets the same exacting standards as the food that we produce
here. One way in which we can do that is to ensure that labelling is
accurate, so that when we, as consumers, go to the supermarket, the
local butcher or another local shop, we can see for ourselves what has
been imported and where it has come from.</hs_Para>

farmers in the United States have a significant cost-of-production
advantage over many farmers in the European Community. US farmers bear
a lighter regulatory burden; they have a different approach to animal
welfare, and they have a very different approach to animal traceability
in their food production. They use hormones, and their environmental
legislation is very different from ours. We must take cognisance of
that in any trade negotiation. Trade must mean ensuring that imports
are produced to equivalent standards, and that product labelling
clearly distinguishes between different production methods in a way
that is meaningful and not misleading. The Minister spoke about red
lines. We do not have to reveal all the red lines; this should be a
priority, and we should be aware of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022578000302" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/debtext/140225-0003.htm#14022578000302">The

US would be in a position significantly to increase the volume of beef
exported to the UK. That could damage our significant industry. We need

poultry sector should be treated as a sensitive sector. Why do I say
that? Since 1997, American poultry has not been allowed to be imported
into the European Community because of pathogen reduction treatments.
Those treatments mean that we do not believe that consumers should eat
American poultry. If changes to the PRT rules result in an increase in
poultry imports to the EC from the US, we need to take a careful line
on that and ensure that we put our poultry industry, which is one of

should be extremely cautious about the whole process that has been put
before us. If anyone has looked at the experience of the free trade
agreement between the US, Canada and Mexico, they will quickly see who
benefits and even more quickly who loses as a result of it. The people
who lose out are those who are on the margins of society, those who are
vulnerable and those who are open to great exploitation. Thus, farm
workers in Mexico have lost their jobs in favour of high-tech farming
imports from the US and US companies have moved across the border to
Mexico to exploit lower wages. Mexican trucks are not allowed to drive
into the US beyond a short distance from the border. There are a lot of
restrictions. It is not an equal power relationship. It is a very
damaging power relationship. The agreement is unpopular in the US and
Canada, but it is also unpopular with many people in Mexico, who see
themselves as losing out as a result of that.</hs_Para>

give that as an example. We should be extremely cautious about the
claims that are made. When the North American Free Trade Agreement was
reached, it was claimed that there would be several million new jobs as
a result. The result has actually been the loss of about 1 million
jobs. The same exaggerated but unsubstantiated claims about jobs and

concerns have been raised about working conditions, health and safety
at work conditions and environmental protection. I am sure that all
those companies that are busy lining up to destroy union organisation
in the USA would want to do exactly the same on this side of the
Atlantic. Various Members have mentioned environmental protection and
environmental conditions. In the US, there are far fewer environmental
protection 
<?notus-xml column=234?>measures—there is much more genetically modified food on sale and
in regular supply, for example. Are we to destroy many of
the hard-fought and hard-gained social advantages across Europe in
relation to farming systems, to animal protection and welfare and to
health and safety, in favour of a free-for-all for those big companies?

They show Merseyside’s intended allocation from the EU to be
€318 million—€116 million more than
Ministers propose. I suspect the Secretary of State may say that the
allocation methodology was not found by the Court to be flawed, even
though the judgment found that the allocations were unlawful. They were
unlawful because Ministers: failed to comply with the public sector
equalities duty; failed to avoid discrimination against those in our
ex-industrial areas; and failed to consider the consequences of using
criteria that took no account of the respective economic needs in all

colleagues in their interventions who talked about gerrymandering, or
the arbitrary attempt to include the Chancellor’s constituency.
It is very clear that the Court found that the decisions were not
arbitrary in that way. They may not have produced the satisfactory
political outcome from Opposition Members’ point of view, but
the Court did not uphold the argument that there was any form of
irrationality or disproportionality in the
decision.</hs_Para>

among the parts of the country with the greatest need, which was
reflected in their higher funding. In 2007, they were reclassified as
phasing-in regions because the indicators showed, although the levels
were relatively low, that there had been considerable economic
progress. Their recategorisation as phasing-in regions between 2007 and
2013 was designed to avoid the steep and sudden cut in EU funding that

is in this country a large gap in educational attainment between
children from richer homes and those from poorer homes as measured by
eligibility for free school meals. As the Minister has said on a number
of occasions, closing that gap is a moral imperative. I am proud of the
Government’s commitment on that front, and of the fact that
every time Ministers discuss raising standards in education the issue
is always both increasing overall attainment and closing the gap
between rich and poor. There have been many initiatives on that matter,
and I am sure that there will be more, but probably the biggest change
of all is how the pupil premium structurally funds schools. That has at
least three effects. First, it ensures that schools in disadvantaged
areas are better resourced; secondly, it funds specific programmes and
interventions; and thirdly, it makes pupils who are eligible for free
school meals more attractive—as it were—to
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000008">The
key problem is that opportunity in Britain is still not evenly spread.
Much continues to depend on the type of family and income bracket that
someone is born into. Of course, today we are discussing the fact that
opportunity also has much to do with where someone is born. There are
several aspects to that, and I am going to touch on three. First is the
straightforward fact that there is variation in attainment for
disadvantaged children both within and between regions, and that seems
to happen differentially for primary and secondary phases. Secondly,
there is the perhaps counterintuitive problem of being born poor into a
relatively wealthy area. Thirdly, there is my main focus:
outperformance at the top end and the increasing exceptionalism of
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000009">I
will talk first about the overall variation within and between regions,
although we must be careful when we talk about regions because, in a
sense, they are not really anything—they are just administrative
constructs; geographical niceties. Nevertheless, there does seem to be
some sort of regional pattern. If we look at the proportion of children
who get five or more GCSEs at grade C or above, including English and
maths, we see that there is significant variation between regions. That
variation is more marked, however, in children eligible for free school
meals. On both counts—children overall and disadvantaged
children—London tops the table. Versus the rest, it is ahead by
3% overall and by 16% for disadvantaged children
specifically.</hs_Para>

to look at this issue at the regional level—for my hon. Friend,
that would be Yorkshire and the Humber—and in other cases it
makes sense to look at individual local authorities. Sometimes we must

general and on average, if a child lives in a richer area they are more
likely to go to a school judged good or outstanding by Ofsted than if
they live in a poorer area. Ofsted’s report last year,
“Unseen children”, highlights that point well. The report
shows that the gap between the proportion of schools judged good or
outstanding for leadership and management in the poorest parts relative
to the wealthiest parts is biggest for primary schools in the
south-east and east midlands, and biggest for secondary schools in
Yorkshire and the Humber and the north-east. It is interesting that the
report highlights how different areas have the biggest gap for primary
and secondary schools. The area with the starkest difference is
probably the north-east, which has the biggest gap of all between the
proportion of secondary schools judged good or outstanding for
leadership and management, whereas for primary schools it is the top
performer in the entire country. The blended average of those two gaps

number of questions arise on within-school underperformance. How should
the pupil premium be used? If a school has relatively small numbers of
disadvantaged children, what is the best way to use pupil premium
moneys to benefit them? We know that, in general, whole school
improvement programmes tend to disproportionately benefit the better
off—although they may be beneficial overall, they are less
likely to be beneficial in closing the gap. When a school has smaller
numbers of disadvantaged children, specific, targeted interventions
become quite difficult. Interventions are presumably not targeted at
pupils because they are entitled to free school meals—that would
be both difficult and rather divisive, and not something we would
want.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000020"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:40:00"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Ian Mearns" PimsId="5706" UID="14022545000097" xid="1090" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000097"><B>Ian

Schools are entitled to a pupil premium for children receiving free

neighbourhoods. Because of housing tenure and type, lots of youngsters
who are not entitled to the pupil premium or free school meals but who
are still in relatively low-income and deprived households live cheek

have as many educational problems as the youngsters entitled to

The hon. Gentleman touches on something that I was about to mention.
Entitlement to free schools and other measures of disadvantage are
often correlated with certain clear indicators that children are less
likely to do well at school, particularly those involving the home
learning environment—whether there are books at home
and  so on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022545000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000024">Clearly, at
system level, it makes sense to use the gap between free school meal
recipients and others to chart our progress. Although entitlement to
free school meals is not a perfect measure, it is the best we have in
terms of accuracy. However, now that we have the new progress measure,
which tracks the progress of each attainment group at entry and as they
go through school, I wonder whether, particularly in secondary school,
it would make more sense to use that as the primary measure in closing
the gap, so that when students arrive at secondary school, whatever
their prior attainment, we ensure that all schools are stretching all
children to the best of their abilities.</hs_Para>

numerous questions about between-school and between-area
underperformance. The most obvious is how to get the best leaders and
leadership support into the places where they are needed most, and how
to incentivise great teachers into the areas that need them most. As I
mentioned earlier, there is a vexing pattern. Certain areas are good
either at primary or secondary, but not both simultaneously. Sorry; I
should not say that they are not good, but hon. Members know what I
mean. The proportion of schools judged good or outstanding is in
primary or secondary, but not both.</hs_Para>

that this gives me an opportunity to say that within the south-east,
Hampshire is an exception. I pay tribute to John Coughlan and his team.
Hampshire is rated relatively well in both primary and secondary
education. Overall, if all regions could reach their own internal
benchmark—in other words, whether they are outstanding at the
primary or secondary level, if they could get the other phase of
education up to the same level—that would mean many thousands
more pupils were attending a good or outstanding
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000027">Turning
to London, I have already mentioned the gap at GCSE level between
London and the rest of the country, and how London outperforms
considerably when it comes to poorer children. In fact, it starts a lot
earlier than GCSEs, and the effect persists a long time after age 16.
It seems that in London, even before school begins, poorer children
outperform children in the rest of the country at the early years
foundation stage, to the extent that one can talk about a
three-year-old outperforming. They pull away as they progress to infant
and junior school, and by the time they reach age 15 and 16, they are
almost 50% more likely than children outside London to get five or more
good GCSEs, they are twice as likely as disadvantaged children
elsewhere to go to university and, depending on which numbers one looks
at, they are perhaps up to four times as likely 
<?notus-xml column=43?>to end up going to a Russell Group university, although the numbers are
still small—one in 25 rather than one  in 100.</hs_Para>

There was a thing called the London challenge. Whenever the
outperformance of London comes up, the most obvious thing to
say is, “London does well because of the London
challenge.” Is that true? I have absolutely no doubt that the
London challenge has been beneficial, and it is also true that there is
a fuzzy boundary around it. In the period from about 2000 until now,
many initiatives have either happened first in London before spreading
elsewhere or been specific to London. They may or may not have been
merchandised as part of the London challenge, but in a broader sense it
could be said that they were.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022545000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000029">But—it
is an important “but”—there are a number of
reasons to believe that the London challenge is not the sole or primary
cause of London’s educational outperformance. The first and most
important reason is that the year in which London’s GCSE
performance caught up with the rest of the country was 2003, the year
when the London challenge started. By definition, all the kids who did
their GCSEs in 2003 had spent their entire life not in the London
challenge. Politically, 2003 was a good year to start a programme
focused on making London better, because from there everything was
going up. The second reason is that after the initial London challenge,
when it was extended to Greater Manchester and the black country, it
did not translate as well. There were some improvements in performance,
but not nearly on the same scale as in
London.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/00A07BBB4ED6F5B59ACECB0AB3B4D50966130E8E" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2014">Tuesday

London’s outperformance, people say, “Oh, they get more

that for deprivation, we discover that the difference is not quite as
big as it at first appeared. In other words, when comparing the high
number of free school meals in London with those in the rest of the
country, the funding premium is not quite as large, although costs are
higher in London, which is why there has historically been higher
funding<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:51:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000038">If

people have told me that class sizes in London are smaller, but they

country, except at key stage 3. There is not a higher proportion of
teaching assistants. Teachers are paid more, as are people in lots of
occupations and professions in London, because of London weighting, but
the difference in pay for the average London teacher versus the average
teacher elsewhere is less than advertised. According to the ads,
someone can earn up to 25% more as a newly qualified teacher in London,

is different? I shall come to some of the things
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:52:02"></hs_TimeCode> the hon.
Member for Gateshead mentioned. First, all sorts of things about the
city are different compared with other parts of the country. The
employment market is different, as he rightly says, which manifests
itself in different ways. There are differential rates of unemployment,
and youth unemployment in London remains concerning. 
<?notus-xml column=45?>In addition, there is the visibility of opportunities. If someone is
travelling on buses and underground trains, they will be interacting
with all the adverts, the people and all the rest of it. There is the
cultural capital of the city—the museums and art
galleries—and the pull factor of more university places. There
are more university places per head of population in London than in
other cities, and most people travel only a short distance from home to
go to university. Everything is nearer. That helps with school

“Capital Mobility”, the report by the all-party group. I
did not realise he had also read the sheet of paper in front of me,
which states that many of those things were also true when London was
the problem child of British education, before it became the poster

population make-up of London is one massive change and a massive
difference. London is diverse on a scale unknown in the rest of the
United Kingdom—indeed, unknown in most of the rest of the world.
London’s state secondary schools are now 32% white British by
ethnic origin, and the statistic for kids just starting secondary
school is extraordinary: 48% do not have English as their mother
tongue. An even more surprising statistic is that children with English
as an additional language come very close in performance by GCSEs to
children who have English as their mother tongue, and in London they
beat them—in GCSEs in London, children who do not speak English
as their mother tongue very slightly outperform those who do. That
raises difficult
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:55:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000043">I
do not want to pre-empt tomorrow’s Committee meeting, at which,
sadly, I will not be able to join my Opposition compadres, but I know
the Minister will be appearing before the Committee to talk about the
performance of white working class pupils. It is true that all ethnic
groups do better in London than they do outside—spectacularly so
in the case of children of Pakistani origin. There is a 14% gap between
the performance of pupils of Pakistani origin in London versus the rest
of the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:55:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000044">There
are other relevant differences in London, some of which might be driven
by differences and diversity in ethnicity and religion, such as larger
families and older, better educated mothers. Surprisingly, it is
estimated that parents in London are slightly more likely to be married
than parents outside London. It is slightly odd that we can only
estimate that, but that is another question altogether. There are more
families with a 
<?notus-xml column=46?>parent at home. There is less use of formal child care, slightly lower
participation in free school provision, and slightly more use of
tutors. One would normally associate such things with lower educational
attainment, particularly in terms of early years participation, which
again raises important, difficult and challenging
questions<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:56:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000045">What
is different and what might we be able to have an impact on, given that
we cannot have much impact on the composition of the population? London
teachers are more diverse, more likely to have been educated abroad,
more likely to be full time, and, before somebody says it, a bit less
likely to have qualified teacher status—given the sorts of
numbers we are talking about, I do not think that that is particularly
relevant<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:57:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000046">Teachers
are also a little less likely to be on upper pay scales or the advanced
skill scale and more likely to be on the main pay scales. Within the
London challenge, there were various recruitment initiatives, which
included addressing housing problems. One of those initiatives was
Teach First. Opinions vary and sometimes teachers get wound up if we
bang on too much about Teach First, but Teach First teachers can have a
positive, disruptive impact as they come into schools, observe existing
teachers, bring ideas of their own, swap things around and so on. Some
48% of Teach First teachers are still in London, and I think there is
an opportunity to spread that scheme more
widely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000047"><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:58:11"></hs_TimeCode>There
was a big focus on leadership in the London challenge. It was about
supporting leaders in schools and ensuring that they were paid
properly. As an aside, primary schools in London are on average a lot
bigger than primary schools outside, and I wonder whether that means it
is possible to afford more by way of leadership. Alongside that support
and remuneration was intense scrutiny and what people close to the
London challenge operation would describe as verging on ruthlessness to
ensure that schools were being run absolutely as well as they could be.
That was all facilitated by an intense use of data and what are called
families of schools, whereby someone could compare their school to
others in similar circumstances, so they could see what was really
possible<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:59:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000048">London
also over-indexed greatly on sponsored academies. Compared with the
rest of the country, London is much more likely to have sponsored
academies. That relatively small number of schools had a
disproportionately larger impact on the overall performance of London
as a whole, because the results tended to go from very low to very
good.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T09:59:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000049">Where
does all that leave us? I should like to put a number of things to the
Minister. I do not pretend for a moment to have all the answers, or
even most of them, but some things are obvious challenges. First, on
attracting the best teachers, we know that most people stay in their
home region. That puts a premium on marketing intensely the teaching
profession to high performers within the areas and regions where they
are most needed, at school-leaver level and university graduate
level<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T10:00:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/1ECC7DB7480CBAD3DEED456EED83689B7C1C4C0D" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2014">Tuesday

there has to be a big opportunity for Teach First outside London. That
is happening, or starting to happen, already. There is now a focus on
Bournemouth, which is welcome. We need to bear in mind why 48% of Teach
First teachers were in London. One reason is that the programme started
there. Another is that, of course, young people like to move to London;
that cannot be changed very much. Another big factor is the network 
<?notus-xml column=47?>effect: knowing that other new graduates are doing the same programme in
schools relatively nearby and so having social and
support networks. Some co-ordinated,
geographically-focused expansion of Teach First would be
smart<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T10:00:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000051">There
are always questions in some schools about what the pupil premium can

Alongside attracting the best teachers, there is also the matter of
getting top leadership to the areas where it is needed most. In that
regard, I look to the growth of initiatives such as Future Leaders. I
wonder whether the incentives are enough. Can those be looked at, to
ensure that they are sufficient and that they persuade people to go

turn to geographical patterns. There can sometimes be an over-supply of
national education leaders in areas away from schools where their

improve that situation by using technology, for

are some specifics from the London challenge. Are we using data enough
outside London—particularly in identifying families of schools,
so that each school can compare itself with others? Although the term
“sub-regional strategies” always gives me a bit of a
rash, I wonder about the role of system-wide leadership. When I am
talking to teachers and head teachers about the London challenge, they
always talk about the person who led it and his assistant and immediate
team. I wonder about the balance that must be struck between individual
school autonomy, which I am a great supporter of, and having a sense of
shared ownership and system
leadership<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T10:03:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000057">I
started by commending the Government’s twin approach to
education, in respect of raising overall attainment and narrowing the
gap. It is right that we do both; it is no good equalising performance
around some sort of acceptable average. A lot has been done, but the
gap is still wide. There is much more to do in our quest for the
combination of social justice and economic efficiency, which is social
mobility or opportunity for
all<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T10:04:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022545000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022545000058">There
is a lot going for us in that quest. We have unprecedented amounts of
data at our fingertips as well as international benchmarking and case

However, quite a lot of questions remain. As I said, I certainly do not
have all the answers and I am concerned that some of the answers do not
yet exist. However, we need to keep asking questions, including about
how one area of the country can learn from another. That is the focus

hon. Friend the Member for Stockton North said that Ofsted has talked
about young people being lucky or unlucky, which triggered a thought,
if the Chamber will indulge me, about my own background. I feel
extremely lucky, because both my parents left school at 14, which was
not unusual for the working class in my parents’ era. My father
was an immigrant from the west of Ireland, although that part of
Ireland was still part of the United Kingdom when he was born, and my
mother was the daughter and sister of coal miners in the south Wales
valleys. They both left school at 14, but I feel lucky because they
both cared about education and thought that it was an extremely
important opportunity. My father was taken out of school by his father
to go on to the farm at a time when his teacher wanted him to stay on
to get more education, so I feel lucky generationally.</hs_Para>

Llanwern steelworks and phoned up to get my A-level results, it was
much to my surprise that I had done so well. I went back to take the
sandwiches from the canteen to the gang, and one of the men with whom I
was working said, “You ought to go to Oxford.” That was
the first time anyone had ever said that to me. I had completed my

is extremely important. In a sense, the debate is about regional
disparities, rather than class or ethnicity, although those factors
obviously play into it a great deal, as the hon. Member for East
Hampshire said. Those disparities also play into the Select
Committee’s report and its inquiry into the performance of white
working-class boys. It is worth considering for a moment why white
working-class boys are not doing as well as they should in our
education system. Perhaps it is a misnomer to talk about white
working-class boys in this context, because it is often as much about
the parents’ background and their low educational attainment as
it is about income. It is also about worklessness and such factors
within families.</hs_Para>

Gentleman talked about how the migrant factor plays into this issue,
particularly in London. Perhaps many such families look at the school
system with fresh eyes and high hopes compared with parents who had a
bad experience of the school system. They might have gone through in a
low set and absorbed a feeling that school was not valuable to them or
that they were not valued by school. They might then have transmitted
that on to their children, which would be a factor. I think we can all
agree that parents’ behaviours and attitudes matter in this
debate. One thing we should consider is how we best influence parents
and the role that the Government can have in raising parents’
aspirations and encouraging good parenting on education. We have to
consider policy on parents and not just policy within the four walls of

gap between the richest and poorest students narrowed between 2003 and
2011. We have to monitor the gap closely to ensure that it does not
widen once again. The report shows that schools play a part in that, as
does excellent teaching. Having good and outstanding schools is an
important and necessary method of ensuring that we close the gap,

morale matters. I said that in a recent debate in the House, although

the detail of the programme for international student assessment report

morale is high and teachers feel valued—it is not necessarily
where they are the best paid—pupils perform better. The Sutton
Trust has shown that it is particularly important for disadvantaged
pupils that we have high performing teachers. Will the Minister commit
to publishing the data collected during the 2013 teacher work load

interests of all the children in that particular area. That was the
lesson from the Ofsted report, which should be returned to and should

means an uplift, for each disadvantaged young person who receives it,
of £1,300 in primary education and £935 in secondary
education. That makes, and will in future make, a massive difference to
the schools with the additional
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000049">Contrary<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T10:49:32"></hs_TimeCode>

Member for Cardiff West suggested, that is on top of the existing cash
protection per pupil. It is happening at a time of austerity in the
public sector, which would have been necessary whichever party was in
power, and when we have been deliberately controlling the cost of
schools by keeping down their biggest cost—teachers’
salaries. That has not been popular with teachers, but it has enabled
us to contain costs while putting in additional money. Hon. Members
will be aware from visiting schools that the ones that receive a lot of
pupil premium money, because they have many children who qualify for
it, notice the difference even in the present tough times. In Redcar,
for instance, where the local economy has never properly recovered from
the recession of the 1980s, I have visited schools where 80% or 90% of
the young people are entitled to the pupil premium, which enables
teachers and head teachers to transform their

which we now allocate funding for disadvantage go beyond the pupil
premium. They include area-based methods and prior attainment, a factor
that many local authorities use. It is not only through the pupil
premium that we channel money into schools. However, I am serious when
I say that we are keeping under review the question of whether in
future we should have a different way of targeting money at
disadvantage.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T10:48:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

whether that is sufficient. It is worth keeping other options in mind
for the future beyond the current Parliament. I was interested in his
comments about the Netherlands experience of targeting 
<?notus-xml column=59?>money towards children whose parents do not have strong educational
qualifications. We should not assume that we have the perfect method
for allocating disadvantage funding at the moment, and should seek
constantly to build on what we do and improve

performance of disadvantaged pupils has improved across the country
since the coalition Government came to power in 2010, and it improved

aspiration among young people in London being higher, for which there
is some evidence. There is also a different ethnic mix in London,
compared with much of the rest of the country, with a greater
proportion of London pupils from high-performing ethnic groups such as
Chinese, Indian and Korean. There is also important and impressive
performance by many ethnically Pakistani and Bangladeshi children, who

known, London schools are better funded, but we need to be careful
about drawing easy conclusions from that. Part of the headline

levels of funding on average. As my hon. Friend pointed out, however,
London has less experienced teachers and larger, rather than smaller,
class sizes, although it has more sponsored academies, which have been

university want to be located in our biggest cities. I am delighted
that Teach First not only has doubled in size since 2010 to become the

have a number of objections to the proposals, as do the London borough
of Sutton local authority and many other interested parties. The first,

an important consideration, particularly for some of the people who use
the services. Sutton has a stable and settled population, and around
the town centre there is a large elderly population. Those people are
being told that they must now climb to the top of the hill to use the
remaining post office in Grove road. I should stress that Grove road is
part of Sutton’s one-way system, which allows the high

the sort of buggies used at airports, to transport people up and down

town, which need to be able to bank their money at the end of the day.
The convenience of having a post office in the heart of the retail
district was important to those businesses, for safety and security and
their ability to carry on with business
operations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000077" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000077">Another
concern raised was that traders want easy access to parcel services. As
the proposals would close a post office in a major shopping mall, a
further issue is the loss of footfall and potential loss of trade. Post
offices are often important anchors in such facilities. The impact is
not just on the general public but on the business community and the
town
itself.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000078">I
referred earlier to the Post Office putting its own convenience ahead
of the public’s, and I hope the Minister will be able to help by
getting some information from the Post Office and possibly Royal Mail.
The Grove road Crown post office is leased from Royal Mail, on what I
understand are very favourable terms—part of the reason why the
Post Office wishes to consolidate activity at that site. However, the
site is a valuable piece of real estate. Although at present there is
nothing, to my knowledge, in the development pipeline, its location
next to Sutton railway station must make it a candidate for
consideration by Royal Mail as to whether best use is being made of the
site in the long run. The future of that site is a real question, as is
the impact there would be on provision of Crown post office services if
the site were to be disposed of and redeveloped in future.</hs_Para>

turn to the St Nicholas centre post office itself. My understanding is
that the Post Office walked away from negotiations about renewing that
site’s lease despite the flexible approach being adopted by the
owners of the  St Nicholas centre. I hope that the Minister

negotiations might be reopened.</hs_Para>

faces an unwelcome consultation about the loss of its post office. I
think that there is a case for keeping both Crown post offices; I know
that is what my constituents would prefer, but I am sure that I am
going to be told the economic costs of doing so and just how expensive
Crown post offices are. However, if there is to be a merger, the Post
Office must put the needs of its customers first. Maintaining a Crown

minimum the Post Office seeks to do.</hs_Para>

requests to the Minister are as follows. Will he assure me that
customers will be put first, and in the event of a
merger the best location for the post office will be the Post
Office’s priority? Secondly, will he press the Post Office to
re-engage with the owners of the  St Nicholas centre and to
discuss options with Sutton council and with me? Thirdly, will he
clarify the safeguards and guarantees that are in place already or
could be  put in place should the Grove road Crown post office
become the candidate for the new merged and expanded Crown post office,

is one reason why we made a commitment to provide almost £2

committed to ensuring that the post office network is sustainable in
the long term. That is particularly important following the closure

Hancock:</Member></B> I cannot give my right hon. Friend good news on
that today, but I am sure that his point will be noted. We all care
about post offices because they are critical to hundreds and thousands
of small businesses and the many millions of customers who use them
daily for the diverse range of services on offer in the branches. I
agree that local people of all ages and backgrounds regularly use post
offices for mail and access to finance. The Post Office is living
through a period of technological change and it is vital in a world of
new technology, and to a positive and sustainable future, that it can
provide those services while allowing post offices to remain a hub for
local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000089">I
turn to the proposals for the Sutton Crown post office. The post office
network is diverse and of the existing 11,800 branches only around
360—the Crown branches— are directly owned and operated
by the Post Office. The rest are operated by independent business
people—sub-postmasters—who play a key role. The 360 Crown
branches represent only a small proportion of the total number of
branches, but they are important to the network as a whole because they
tend to be larger and to earn the greatest revenue. However, they also
have the highest costs, and they have been responsible for a
significant proportion of the Post Office’s losses in recent
years. Bringing the Post Office into a sustainable long-term position
involves trying to ensure that we get a grip on those
losses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000090">Last
year, the 360 Crown post offices lost a total of £37 million
throughout the country. Those losses are not sustainable, which is why
the Post Office is working hard to tackle them. Probably the best way
of doing so is through increasing revenue, which is a mark of a
rejuvenated post office network. In a similar vein, costs must be
reduced, and that includes the Post Office working with its employees
and stakeholders to introduce new technologies.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="14022546000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000091">We
are investing about £70 million in 300 branches to make them
more attractive to customers and to identify savings in property costs.
We are making a short-term investment to ensure that costs are brought
under control and revenue is increased to ensure that the Crown post
offices come into balance. Those activities will deliver considerable
benefits, but expanding revenue alone is not enough, so the Post Office
is exploring the possibility of franchising about 70 Crown post offices
and merging around six Crown branches. That brings me to
Sutton.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000092">We
must make the post office network sustainable for the long term. The
Post Office is considering merging two branches in Sutton, which are
less than half a mile apart. As my right hon. Friend said, the
consultation is still open. The situation is unusual because normally
there is only one Crown post office for any given area. Due to the Post
Office’s franchising and merging activity and the imminent
expiry of the lease on the High street Crown post office, it is
reviewing the configuration of the Crown post offices in the
area.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000093">Merging
the high street and Grove road branches will bring the benefit of more
investment in the single Crown post office that will remain under the
proposal 
<?notus-xml column=66?>that is out for consultation, so there would be advantages for customers
as well as the obvious challenges that my right hon. Friend highlights.
The merged branch will have considerable investment, and it will be
refurbished and modernised with a brighter environment. It will have
new technologies, an additional counter and a private consultation
room. It will offer a wider range of services than are currently
available at the high street branch, including an external cash machine
and identity services, allowing customers to apply for passports and
driving licences more
easily.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000094">The
high street Crown post office costs around £2 to operate for
every £1 of revenue that it brings in. The Grove road Crown post
office costs £1.50 to operate for every £1 of revenue
that it generates. I am sure my right hon. Friend will understand that
those costs are not sustainable. If the two branches are merged, the
Post office will not only make its business more efficient but will
protect services for the long term and make the branch sustainable,
which is vital for local communities, customers and small
businesses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022546000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022546000095">I
understand that the Post Office considered several options before
proposing the merger and it was decided that the current proposal
offers the maximum benefits, so it is out for consultation. My right
hon. Friend asked about negotiations with the landlords of the high
street premises. The Post Office has obviously approached the current
landlords but has not been able to negotiate a renewal rent that is
better value for money than the current proposal to retain Grove road.
Those conversations have taken place, but I cannot say whether there is
more to be done. Discussions have taken place, but were not concluded
successfully. Under the plan, customers will continue to have access to
Grove road’s large Crown post office, which will be improved,
but the merger also plans to eliminate the losses incurred in the
branches, making them more sustainable and the whole post office system
in Sutton more financially viable for the long term.</hs_Para>

Friend, the council and Post Office management is right. Everybody

have secured this important debate and thank the Minister for
attending. I will declare an interest at the top and state that the
Land Registry has its largest facility in the UK in my constituency of
Swansea East. That provides a substantial number of jobs and plays an
important role in the socio-economic life of Swansea East and the

23 January, the Minister announced plans to launch a consultation on
ending the Land Registry’s status as a trading fund. The
consultation exercise proposed two things: first, that Her
Majesty’s Land Registry be separated into an office of the chief
land registrar and a service delivery arm; and secondly that the
service delivery arm be transferred out of the civil service and become
a company, either a Government-owned company—a GovCo—or a
private or quasi-private
company<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:31:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022559000007">Currently,
the Land Registry, as a trading fund, is entirely self-funding and
therefore no drain on the Government purse. Furthermore, year on year
the service makes a surplus, which is passed on to the public by way of
reduced costs for usage of the service and by way of providing the
Treasury with significant
income<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T14:31:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022559000008">The
Public and Commercial Services Union suggests, and I agree, that only
by keeping the Land Registry’s trading fund status can the
service maintain its necessary independence, impartiality and
accountability. I also believe that the status of the organisation as
it stands offers best value in providing a land registration service to
the public. Given the success of the current service, not to include in
the consultation a proposal to retain the current trading fund status

executives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022559000009">Let
me give some background. The Land Registry has been a non-ministerial
Department since 1862. It was established as an Executive agency of the
Lord Chancellor in July 1990 and as a trading fund in April 1993. The
main aims and functions of Her Majesty’s Land Registry are set
out in the framework document of 2008. As with other non-ministerial
Departments, the Land Registry’s functions have always been
entirely statutory. It has no prerogative powers. The Land
Registry’s main statutory functions are to keep a register of
title to freehold and leasehold land throughout England and Wales, and
to provide the statutory service of registering, on a daily basis, the
many thousands of new titles and dealings with land. That includes
registering mortgages, changes of ownership and many other legal
interests.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022559000010">There
are many challenges for the future. I repeat that the Land
Registry’s managerial dilemma appears to be what sort of company
the Land Registry should become—a GovCo or a private
enterprise—but where is the evidence that changing from a
trading fund to any sort of company would meet the Department’s
objectives? None has been provided. The current system is tried,
tested, evaluated and proven; and as the old adage goes, if it

its greatest asset. As a public service, the trust that has always been
placed in it assures the public that it is independent and has
authentic credentials of honesty. It is entirely focused on its service
to users and not distracted by profits, outside interests or political
interference. Given that it provides the state guarantee of title, it

remember that all public services are and should be much more

changes. I would like to look in detail at any future primary
legislation that governs the operation of the Land Registry. Although
it may not be fashionable,  I think that there must be a degree
of ministerial 
<?notus-xml column=74?>accountability for the activities of the Land Registry—the
Minister can take that as my direct consultation response. It is too
important an operation and piece of our national life to be
disregarded. There should be some form of—circuitous, if

Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0001.htm#14022559000046">I

buy the concept that delivering a public service in a different way is

what is good for the taxpayers, the work force and the wider community.
Nevertheless, when considering an important function such as the Land

must also be a strong business case for the different model—the
GovCo. They probably will not want to do so today, but in future the

would like to make a few other brief points. We must have an open and
transparent procurement process for things such as IT. I am sure that
the Minister is mindful of that. We should not have any sweetheart
deals if we are looking into new IT procurement. If people transfer
over, we must also ensure that the Government are mindful of TUPE in

work force and for business. As I say, however, I currently reserve my
judgment. Let us extend the consultation and have a proper debate based
on facts. We have a duty to all stakeholders and I expect the
Government to rise to the challenge and robustly put their case for any
future changes. I look after the interests of my constituents in

period under the previous Government during which a number of us who
were involved with land registries in our constituencies had meetings
with the then Minister, Michael Wills, to express our concerns. The
economy was then in a downturn and the Land Registry was finding things
quite difficult financially, for a whole range of reasons, but the
position has now changed, as has the potential trading position. As the
hon. Member for Peterborough pointed out, there is potentially now
scope for money to go back into the Treasury, because the Land Registry

arm—comprising around 30 staff—and having a commercial

the moment, we do not have clarity—indeed, there is quite a lot
of confusion out there. It is partly due to the compressed nature of

approval for the Land Registry board to go ahead with a target
operating model, which could lead to a significant rationalisation or
downsizing of the organisation. However, we do not know what is in the
TOM, as it is not public. It is difficult for people to make a
submission to a consultation when the ground rules are not properly

but more than 90 people have got in touch with me, and I am encouraging
them all to feed into the consultation. From my perspective, this is

Cities report flagged up the fact that Plymouth is probably in a
slightly different situation. Our peripherality makes it difficult for

we have about 100 highly skilled IT people there. Plymouth has no
capacity to soak up those people if they are not employed at the Land

wake. The Treasury is still baulking at offering the MOD freedoms and
flexibilities. The union PCS says in one of its briefing notes that it
assumes that the ability to vary pay will depend on the model chosen.
At the moment, the Government’s own model, chosen by the MOD, is

accountable to a Minister. It would set only the fees of the statutory

debates under the previous Government we argued that of course it is
open to any Government to review the administration of a service, but
that they should not throw out the baby with the bathwater. If a
service provides high standards of professionalism, brings income to
Government—which is unusual for any Government
service—and is respected not just in this country but throughout
the world, the last thing to do is destabilise it with rushed or
hurried reform. To give the previous Government their due, they carried
out an exercise, and exhaustive consultation was carried out over a

destabilises an organisation. A professional with a family, whose job

line of work, and I fear that that is what will happen. The

difficult circumstances, in the trough of recession, the Land Registry
still brought money to the Treasury, covering its costs and making a
contribution. There was a short period of deficit, but that was
overcome as soon as the economy began to lift. The Land Registry has
won the respect of every professional body, and there is now an
alliance: I am the chair of the Socialist Campaign Group, which is in
that alliance with the Law Society and the other groups that are coming
forward. That shows the breadth of the support. Yet again, however, an
attempt is being made at
destabilisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000101">What
is the motivation? We know what it is. As to the hedging of bets about
the various consultation options, I am sorry, but there is one option
that the Government want to pursue. It was in the report obtained by
the PCS in a freedom of information request: the 2012 KPMG report,
which said that the GovCo was the best way forward, to make it possible
to move on to full privatisation. My concern is that that is the
Government’s motivation; an attempt is being made at full
privatisation, which will result in the siphoning off of the profitable
areas of the service, job cuts, and the undermining of workers’
conditions of employment. The result of that will be to undermine their
professionalism as well. The Government need to come clean about their
long-term objectives, because, if they do not, the suspicions will
remain. I should rather that they would publicly state that those are
their intentions now—to follow the KPMG recommendations for full
privatisation. At least then we could have an honest debate. At the
moment I do not think that the debate is honest, and as a result
suspicion is building. Suspicion leads to lack of confidence in the
organisation and further

them. Why are 150 years of public service about to be thrown out? I
think it is because of an ideological commitment to privatisation. I
cannot think of any other reason. Any other Department would want to
keep the Land Registry in-house because it is such a successful
organisation. Any other Minister would be proud to represent such a

shall come straight to the point and talk about the Government-owned
company being part-way to privatisation. That is what is on the agenda,
and we should stop beating about the bush, and say it plainly.
Privatising the Land Registry would be nothing short of daylight
robbery. It would rob the taxpayer of millions of pounds. The Land
Registry currently brings in close to £100 million a year. It
makes a profit and does a good job. Why on earth would anyone want to
hive it off to the public sector? It is madness to steal that money
from the public purse.
<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>What would
happen afterwards? We would stuff it into the pockets of private
contractors; and what would they do? They want to maximise profits, so
they would put up prices, and hike the fees for the customer. Of
course, who is to say that this Government would not be wilfully
incompetent and sell off the Land Registry at a bargain basement price,
just as they did with the Royal Mail, depriving the public purse of the
true value of this
asset<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:29:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000112">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:29:48"></hs_TimeCode>
are facing loss of income, potential privatisation and potential hikes
in fees—and a monopoly—if we go down the route of a
Government-owned

Part of the argument for privatisation is always that competition will
be a good thing and that prices can be driven down, but this is an
invaluable asset, looking after the land assets of the country, and it
is a monopoly. What would we have if that were put into private hands?
There would be profiteering, just as we see with some energy companies,
which have managed to make six into one—a
monopoly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:30:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000113">It
makes no sense to privatise the Land Registry, and that is before we
come to the issue of trust. Currently, it has a customer satisfaction
rating of 98%. Hon. Members have said that everybody would be overjoyed
if their organisation had that rating. People can trust the Land
Registry precisely because it is a public body. They know it is
impartial. How can we possibly say we are surprised when there are bank
scandals and when people whose job is to make money try to make money
in all sorts of ways? Exactly the same situation would arise if the
Land Registry were privatised. There would be conflicts of
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>. Would
we be surprised, then, if shilly-shallying were going on or there was a
lack of
integrity<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:31:04"></hs_TimeCode> and,
potentially, corruption, if people want to use such a strong word?
People want there to be the utmost integrity in land transactions, but
feel that the door would be left open for precisely the type of
behaviour I have mentioned if it were put in private

is another issue: data protection. I am advised by the PCS that there
would be nothing in law to prevent a private company from selling on
personal data to buyers who wanted the information. I think we have all
had a gutsful of this, with information here and there, and
people’s details being sold on. The last thing people want is
yet another source of data leaking out into places unnecessarily. I
feel strongly that these are good reasons why we would not want the

course, to maximise profits, private companies would look to reduce
labour costs, worsen terms and conditions and make jobs more insecure.
It would be harder to attract high-quality staff and there would be a
greater turnover of staff, leading to loss of expertise 
<?notus-xml column=84?>and low morale. I make no apology for wanting to protect quality job
opportunities: I do not want to see a race to the bottom. But much more
than that, I do not want a poorer service. High turnover of staff, loss
of morale and lack of expertise would result in a much poorer
service<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:32:37"></hs_TimeCode>. That is

point of moving some public sector jobs was precisely to offer quality
job opportunities in a range of locations, where perhaps there had not
been such opportunities because some main industries had closed down.
What do we find in those areas? These are prestigious jobs that people

with local rates they are good jobs. As has been mentioned, in some

people are being
lost<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:33:27"></hs_TimeCode>. That

good for Government finances and for the Budget deficit. I accept that,

the Member for Hayes and Harlington (John 
<?notus-xml column=87?>McDonnell) asked the Government to come clean on whether the GovCo is
the preferred option for ultimately getting to privatisation.
What is the Minister’s preferred option? In
the interest of greater scrutiny and transparency, will he publish the
KPMG report, as has been asked? If he does not have a preferred option,
how on earth does he know how the perceived benefits of greater
flexibility to deliver, greater focus on service delivery and more
flexibility on pay, recruitment and the provision of other services,
will be achieved? How will the outcome of the short consultation affect
the Government’s thinking? If there is overwhelming support from
stakeholders for maintaining the status quo, will the Minister pledge
to ensure that that will be the Government’s policy? What
happens after the consultation? There will be a period of Government
consideration, and then presumably, if necessary, legislative changes
will be outlined. Does the Minister anticipate that something will be
in the Gracious Speech before the next Session? Does he ultimately
think that legislation will have to be enacted before the next general
election<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-25T15:44:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000142">The
big theme of today’s debate is what problem the consultation is
trying to solve. As we have heard time and again, the Land Registry
does not seem to be a failing and inefficient organisation—quite
the reverse. If the Minister thinks otherwise, perhaps he will say so.
It is required by statute that income from fees charged to customers
covers all the Land Registry’s expenditure. There is no burden

23.4%. Many good private sector organisations would kill for such a
return on capital employed. Net assets approach £0.5 billion and
the cash-flow position at year end is positive, with
£472 million cash in the bank. This year, the Land
Registry paid a dividend back to the Treasury of £26
million. Under no possible criterion could the Government claim that
there is a need for private sector financial rigour to be injected into

well-functioning property market is critical to the UK economy.
Ensuring that the market functions properly has long been one of the
Land Registry’s main tasks. It recently celebrated a landmark
150th year and continues to be a cornerstone of property ownership in
England and Wales. It undertakes a range of functions and
responsibilities that are critical to the property market operating
effectively. In the past, successive Governments have been at pains to
ensure that land registration procedures keep pace with a dynamic and
rapidly-changing property market. As we look to the future, it is
important that the Land Registry is able to modernise successfully and
move into the digital age. The Land Registry already provides a number
of services through digital channels, but it is looking to become a

its ambitious new business strategy is focused on a number of areas:
the digitisation and re-engineering of its core registration services,
which should reduce processing times, risk of error and the costs of
those services; playing a wider role in the land and property market,
including being able to take on other adjacent registers; and
maximising the reuse of property data for the benefit of the wider
economy. Reduced processing times, errors and costs, and wider services
and better access to public sector data, will all bring significant
benefits for customers and make it easier to register land in England

Wales.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000157">The
strategy also reflects our broader digital, efficiency and
modernisation aims and as such is a key priority. The experience of
other countries in modernising their property services makes a
compelling case for us to realise those benefits at an early stage. A
number of other countries and states have already successfully
digitised their land registries, so it is important that England and
Wales do not fall behind where there are useful lessons that could be
learned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000158">Before
I turn to the commercial models, I will say something about local land
charges. The Land Registry is looking to become the sole registering
authority for local land charges, a job that is currently undertaken
separately by each of the 348 local authorities. The benefit of the
Land Registry providing a single central solution is that it would
result in cheaper, quicker and more standardised services, so avoiding
the current postcode
lottery.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000159">Commercial
models dominated the debate. The hon. Member for Swansea East fairly
asked: “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?” I will
reply directly to that. Of course, the Land Registry is profitable, but
we have a responsibility 
<?notus-xml column=90?>to review continually whether the business can drive further benefits to
its customers and the wider market by driving digital by default
services, which could deliver lower-cost services and reduce processing
time.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000160">The

models. Following that, there should be a number of benefits through a
greater focus on service delivery, greater operational flexibility and
a more clearly defined relationship with Government. Central to any
change in the commercial model is the guiding principle that we must

document is to introduce a new Land Registry service company that would
have responsibility for the performance of the service delivery
functions. There would be a separate office of the chief land registrar
retained within Government primarily to perform the regulatory and
fee-setting functions. It is also envisaged that the indemnity
arrangements will continue to be state-backed. The new company, if we
choose to go down that particular road, could focus on delivery. Its
ability to carry out additional activities would no longer be narrowly
constrained by legislation. It would be outside the civil service and
would have greater flexibility on pay and

such a new company, should we move forward with the proposal to create
it following the consultation. A number of models are being considered,
but the oversight that will be retained by the office of the chief land
registrar would ensure that Land Registry companies and the integrity
of the register would be protected irrespective of ownership. Models
being considered include a wholly owned Government company, a joint
venture and a contracting-out model. It is Government policy to assess
options for moving assets to the private sector where there is no
longer a strong policy reason for continued public ownership or where
there is potential for an asset to operate more sensibly and
efficiently in the private
sector.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022559000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/halltext/140225h0002.htm#14022559000164">I

under each scenario. Looking internationally, a range of commercial

nothing, that will still place the channel below shopping and music

the animation industry even over the past six months since the tax
credit was introduced. We hope to have some news shortly on our

which runs until March 2017, the Government made £40 million
available, £25 million of which has been allocated to the
development of the local TV transmission network. That work is being
undertaken by Comux, which was awarded the local TV multiplex licence
by Ofcom in January 2013. The remaining £15 million has been
allocated for the purchase by the BBC of the local TV content that will
be generated. Detailed arrangements for the distribution of that
funding have now been agreed with the BBC executive. That investment
will give local TV the best possible chance of establishing itself
against the ever increasing choice that viewers have, whether watching
on traditional linear channels or watching catch-up and downloadable

certainly would not seek to give the impression that I thought that S4C
was somehow an idiosyncrasy. What I meant 
<?notus-xml column=97?>was that S4C is a unique channel for Wales. It represents something like
£100 million of annual investment in Welsh language programming,
much of which is of an extraordinarily high quality and is exported
around the world. However, that leads to difficulties in trying to find
an appropriate slot for local

initial bids were being sought for licences, the slot was at channel

we want to see it move up the EPG rankings where possible. As slots
have become available I am delighted that local television has moved up
the rankings and that Scottish and Welsh local television channels have
moved from channel 41 up to channel 26. But there is a debate going on

anomalous for local TV to have a different channel slot in different
parts of the UK. It means that local television is less prominent in
Wales and Scotland, and causes problems for local television in
developing promotional activities collectively around a single channel
number. But local television was not coming into a greenfield site. We
need to balance the needs of important services that already exist in
Wales and Scotland and currently occupy the channel 8 slot. There is

Consumers”, which we published last summer, that it is important
that public service content should have prominence on TV platforms, in
order to achieve our wider broadcasting objectives, but the
Communications Act 2003 makes it clear that Ofcom rather than
Government should determine the appropriate level of prominence. The

Northern Ireland, because the channel 8 slot used there for local

significant changes.</hs_Para>

have seen the slot change as we have encouraged Freeview to push local
television up the rankings when slots became available. The hon. Lady
will have worked out that if we publish a consultation in March, there
will be a period of consultation and then decisions about making
changes will have to be taken. There is no way I can offer any kind of

£70,000, which instead of putting them in band E puts them
nearer the top end of band C. One can imagine the frustration when my
constituent’s bill and those of several of his neighbours
arrived showing that their properties were in band E, particularly when
some of his neighbours appealed against that decision and had their
appeal granted, dropping to band D when other neighbours’

England, the main role of the Valuation Office Agency—or the
VOA, as we all know it—is to provide the valuations and property
advice required to support taxation and benefits. There are eight
bands—A to H—and every single one of the 23 million
properties in England that are subject to council tax is assigned one
of those bands by the VOA. They are based on the open market value as
of 1 April 1991, as my hon. Friend mentioned.</hs_Para>

band has a range of values. For example, band D is for properties
valued between £68,001 and £88,000 in 1991. That
highlights that a property could have  its value changed and
still not change bands. It could  be valued at £87,999
and be in band D, then it could be 
<?notus-xml column=102?>reassessed and revalued, and considered to be worth
£70,000—more than a 10% change—but still stay in
the same council tax band. That could be one reason why residents can
see no change in band despite a review on value, but I shall come back
to that.</hs_Para>

valuation date of 1991 means that all properties, including newly built
properties, are valued on a fair and consistent basis. That applies
equally to all homes, regardless of general fluctuations in the
property market since then. The banding system provides a link between
the value of a dwelling and the level of council tax. Homes will vary
according to a range of factors; some are obvious and some not so. If
we think about the value of a property that any one of us may own, its
age and size will all have an effect on the value, as might the level
of modernisation and improvement. That can again lead to a variation in
valuation between two properties that, at first glance, may look very
similar— or, indeed, the same.</hs_Para>

at the property details for a property, and then looks at sales that
took place on or around the valuation date of 1991. Sales from around
that time on comparable properties are the strongest indicator of
value. As the bands cover a range of values, many different types and
styles of property can fall in the same band. Equally, fairly similar
properties can fall into different bands, depending on their value in
1991. For example, if the band level is £68,001, the property
could be in a different band for the sake of being £10 or
£15 apart in value, in theory.</hs_Para>

the same properties. I appreciate that that can be frustrating for

Friend rightly pointed out, there can be inconsistencies. Taxpayers can
at times find themselves living in properties, new or old, that seem
identical or even smaller than a neighbour’s that is in a lower

been made to it, or there are changes that are not clear at first. Even

a difference in valuation.</hs_Para>

identical properties nearby. I can understand why that would be

council tax payers believe that their band is incorrect, they can
contact the VOA with their concerns—I appreciate that there is
an issue with that, which I shall come to—and the VOA will
review a property’s banding and amend it if the evidence
suggests it is incorrect. While I am here on the record—this is
not so much for my hon. Friend’s benefit—I want to be
clear that council tax bandings can be challenged in two ways. First,
the council tax payer has formal challenge rights in the first six
months of either becoming the taxpayer of a property, or against a
change made by the VOA, or where a material reduction in the value of
the property or locality has happened since council tax was
introduced.</hs_Para>

tax payers do not have those formal rights, taxpayers can have their
band reviewed by the VOA for free, if there is something to suggest
that the banding might not be right. The VOA uses its statutory duty to
maintain fair and accurate bandings as the means to provide a free
banding review service, which applies to all occupiers, whether or not

point clear because I know that some agencies out there—an
increasing number of companies acting as agents—are promising
council tax payers that they can get their bands reduced. I want to be
clear: although some of those are charging up-front fees, I am keen for
taxpayers to know that they can approach the VOA directly to challenge
their banding. Full details are on the VOA’s website.</hs_Para>

the Member for Sherwood, that that is where the crux of the issue in

The Northern Ireland Office had sought confirmation before sending the

PSNI that they had been. As has been made clear  by the legal
proceedings relating to Mr Downey, an administrative scheme to deal
with so-called “on the runs” was in operation from around
September 2000. It was devised by the previous Government. The details
were not fully set out to Parliament, though the scheme was referred to
in July 2002 in the answer to a parliamentary question given by the

is an offence for parents of school registered pupils to fail to secure

has attended as regularly as the job permits, and (c) where the child
is at least six years of age, that the child has made at least 200
attendances. With the aim of improving the average poor school
attendance and levels of attainment for pupils from of Gypsy, Roma and

currently placed in YOIs and secure training centres (STCs), as well as
some currently placed in SCHs. We anticipate retaining some specialist
custodial provision for the very youngest and most vulnerable young
people remanded or sentenced to custody by the courts, but our vision
is for secure colleges to cater for the vast majority of young people
in custody. The average cost of a place in youth custody is around
£100,000 per annum. Secure colleges will achieve ongoing savings
by operating at a significantly lower cost per place than the current
average, while allowing withdrawal from more expensive and inefficient
provision. The larger sizes of secure colleges will allow a broader
curriculum and range of services to be provided at a lower cost,
without any compromise in the safeguarding of young people. The MOJ
will not be able to confirm the annual cost per place until it has
completed the operator competition for the pathfinder secure
college.</hs_Para>

Wright:</Member></B> The proposed resettlement prison model for women
prisoners stems from the National 
<?notus-xml column=250?>Offender Management Service's review of the women's custodial estate.
Part of the outcome of the review was that all women's prisons should
be designated resettlement prisons in order to make sure that women
prisoners in every establishment have access to resettlement services.
Most resettlement prisons for women prisoners will serve more than one
Contract Package Area (CPA) so that as many providers of probation
services will have access to their area's cohort of prisoners as is
operationally
viable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022583000906" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140224/text/140224w0009.htm#14022583000906">The
model developed for the women's estate, which allows multiple providers
access to most establishments, will mean that the majority of women
prisoners will be provided resettlement services by the same provider
who will provide statutory rehabilitation support upon release. For any
women prisoners who are not accommodated in a prison to which their
home provider has access, there will be a host lead provider, who will
be responsible for preparing resettlement plans, delivering immediate
requirements and engaging in pre-release planning with the women's home

to Operation Safeguard arrangements, there are occasions where
prisoners may be temporarily held overnight in police cells. These
occasions arise from a number of factors, including late court
sittings, which can compromise the contractors' ability to deliver the
prisoner to prison prior to the reception closure time. 
<?notus-xml column=254?>They largely consist of situations where escort contractors are unable
to transport the prisoner to a suitable prison following a court
appearance, due perhaps to inclement weather or failings in the
transport network or because we have sufficient space but the places

Listener scheme (Listeners are volunteer peer supporters who are
selected, trained and supported by Samaritans, to listen and offer
confidential emotional support to prisoners in distress) is recognised

which there are tough sentences available. Every report of rape is
treated seriously and all investigations and prosecutions are conducted
thoroughly and professionally. Tougher sentences are available to the
courts for those who commit these offences, including a new mandatory
life sentence for anyone convicted of a second very serious sexual or
violent crime. The proportion of offenders sentenced to custody has
been around the same level for the last five

Offences that fall within this category can be dealt with either in the
magistrates court or the Crown court. The defendant can elect the trial
court. If the defendant elects to be tried in the Crown court, the case
is automatically committed to the Crown court. Where the defence ask to
be dealt with in the magistrates court then it is for the magistrates
to decide whether this is
appropriate.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons
for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were
dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more
offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed.
Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the
offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty

sentences do so because of their history of previous offending. Under
the Government's proposals in the Offender Rehabilitation Bill
offenders serving sentences of less than 12 months will in the future
be released with licence conditions and subject to additional
supervision. These reforms are designed to address the unacceptably
high levels of reoffending and the prevent the public from being

Direct comparison with previous year's mortality, prior to 2011, is not
advisable. There was a decrease in the number of deaths, with an
underlying cause coded as 'Cardiovascular Disease'. However, a large

vascular dementia, which was coded as underlying cause CVD (167.9)

satisfactorily addressed and this had been briefed to the relevant RAF
personnel. Recommendation 95 was considered closed, as were all of the
recommendations arising from the Tornado Airworthiness Review. This,
together with the passage of time since 1998, may explain why no copy

should add that in the 18 years since the Tornado Airworthiness Review
Team reported, the Mk10 ejection seat has been the subject of a
mid-life upgrade programme, in the late 1990s, and an extensive
modification programme from 2007 to 2010 that introduced many
improvements. The Mk10 ejection seat in its current configuration is
much improved as compared to 1996. As you are aware, further
improvements are now being made as a result of the tragic accident to
Flt Lt Sean Cunningham in November

Maude:</Member></B> Civil servants can, but are not compelled, to
declare their ethnicity. As a result, we don't hold sufficient
information to give an accurate response. The civil service is,
however, committed to harnessing the ambition and potential of its
staff, whoever they are. In addition to initiatives such as the Summer
Diversity Internship Programme, which specifically targets those of
minority ethnic or lower socio-economic background, it is a key
component of the civil service talent strategy to ensure that all
talent development schemes are accessible to all those who show the
ability and aspiration to make a difference to the civil
service.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-25?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_25_PT_1/591AF76FC82BCE704B00356A191A3F26F72F7653" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="25 February 2014">Tuesday

Vara:</Member></B> A more diverse judiciary is important in retaining
the public's confidence and trust in justice, and better reflecting the
society it serves. This Government has made a number of changes through
the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that we believe will promote judicial
diversity. We have introduced part-time working in the senior, courts,
including the Supreme Court, we have enabled the equal merit provision
for judicial appointments to allow protected characteristics to be
taken into account where two applicants are of equal merit, and a
statutory duty for the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice to
encourage judicial
diversity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022590000613" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/text/140225w0001.htm#14022590000613">Magistrates

McVey:</Member></B> My Department will run a pilot exercise in March to
test possible improvements to the success rate of the decision
assurance call. The pilot will aim to increase the success rates using
text messages, with a text message being issued prior to the decision
assurance call to give a stronger message to the claimant that it is
important to take this call to prevent a gap or delay in payment. A
follow up message will be issued after the second unsuccessful call to
advise of the need to claim JSA immediately so that benefit payments
can be made where employment and support allowance is to be disallowed.
The results of the pilot will be monitored and evaluated to ensure that
improvements can be successfully rolled out nationally. In addition
guidance improvements have been made to increase the success rate of
calls.</hs_Para>

statements against the details provided at the time of application. The
Commission continued to recommend that returning officers should verify
the personal identifiers on all returned postal voting statements, and

Willetts</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 24 February 2014]:</I> The
Government supports a dynamic research environment in the UK, including
the creation, where appropriate, of new research institutions. Funding
provided through the £300 million UK Research Partnership
Investment Fund has supported the establishment of new research
institutes, including the ‘National Structural Integrity
Research Centre’ at Granta Park and the ‘Energy
Safety  
<?notus-xml column=329?>Research Institute’ at Swansea University, as well other major
strategic research partnerships between universities and business and
charities. The establishment of a new Postgraduate Institute is part of
BIS' ambition for strengthening the role of the National Physical
Laboratory through its links with academic partners. In addition, BIS
has provided strategic support towards the establishment of new
research centres and institutes, and campus developments, where these
have been prioritised by the Research Councils and address critical
areas of new challenges or build on existing areas of strength for the
UK, such as the ‘Higgs Institute for Innovation’ at
Edinburgh
University.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="14022590005372" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm140225/text/140225w0004.htm#14022590005372">Following
