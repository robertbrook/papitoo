the report is that there can be a tenfold variation in the take-up of
innovative new medicines that have been approved under the NICE

for clinical commissioning groups to fund those treatments, as I
understand it, what sanctions can be taken against commissioning groups

go to their clinical commissioning group or, indeed, to NHS England and
ask for the matter to be specially looked at. However, it is
important to understand what these figures are and what they are not.
They are not intended to be, and do not claim to be, a statement of
whether certain drugs are being underprescribed or overprescribed in a
particular area. One has to drill down into the reasons. In fact, when
one does that, for most of the groups of medicines where it was
possible to compare observed and predicted use, the report shows that
use has increased over time, and we are introducing additional tools to
allow the NHS to get to the heart of the reasons for variations in
local
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:08:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

commissioning groups. The previous year’s report on appraised

appraisal, where, if favourable, there is a clear funding direction for
the NHS—in other words, it must fund the drug if the doctor
thinks that it is appropriate for the patient—and a clinical
guideline, where NICE issues best practice advice for the NHS. There is
no funding direction attached to that. However, clinicians are expected

weakening. Strong communities are shaping their own destiny across
England, and we are supporting people in their efforts. The
Government’s localist approach, for example, gives more power to
communities and local councils, and communities are seizing the
opportunities offered. One of our flagship programmes is the National
Citizen Service. This year, 90,000 young people will deliver a
community project through this
service<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:15:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000021"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Phillips of Sudbury" PimsId="181" UID="14022779000492" xid="1827" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000492">Lord
Phillips of Sudbury (LD):</Member></B> I am grateful to my noble friend
for that reply. Is it not the case, however, that one of the key
factors in what is clearly a declining community vitality in this
country, is the ever increasing volume of legislation pouring forth
from this place, which tends to undermine and confuse the ordinary
citizen, and is still running at the rate, after repeals, of about
10,000 pages of new statute law every year? That is more than I have
been able to discover in any country in western
Europe.</hs_para>

committed to removing unnecessary bureaucracy. Speaking specifically
about DCLG, since 2010 it has enacted legislation which has, as I have
already said, empowered citizens and local communities. The Localism
Act 2011 is a good example. In January of this year, my right

indeed met the Red Tape Challenge target to find 3,000 regulations to

point. It is important to ensure that the opportunities that are
available to young people are shown to them. If we look at the take-up
of the National Citizen Service, when it was launched in 2011, there
were 8,500 young people involved. In the 
<?notus-xml column=1007?>current year, there are 90,000. Next year, it will go up to 120,000. The
estimates are that by 2016, 150,000 young people will be part of the
National Citizen Service. It shows that when a scheme works for the

stretching and related to their career paths and realistically based on

My Lords, there are four times as many 18 to 24 year-olds looking for
work at the moment as there are in the 16 to 17 age group. Yet the
Government’s policy on apprenticeships for 19 to 24 year-olds is
to ask employers to pay half the costs of the learning framework. Many
businesses, especially SMEs, will pause before taking on an apprentice
because of this. Does the Minister agree that if this requirement were
to be removed, it would hugely encourage many more young people to get
into apprenticeships as well as giving them much more of a chance to
succeed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:25:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Ahmad of Wimbledon" PimsId="5907" UID="14022779000516" xid="2117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000516">Lord

opens the debate, it may be helpful if I give a little guidance. This
debate is not time-limited. I hope that we may use some of our
Thursdays for Government-led debates where the House is not constrained
by our normal, rather short time limits. There are 25
speakers today in our Syria and Middle East debate. Were Back-Bench
contributions to be kept to around 10 minutes, it would allow debate on
our later business to commence at about 6.30
pm.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000070"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="14022779000541" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000541">The
Senior Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local
Government &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness Warsi)
(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the situation in Syria and its impact on
neighbouring countries continues to be bleak and disturbing. It is
already the greatest humanitarian disaster of the century. Some 5,000
Syrians are dying each month, 2.4 million people have been forced from
their homes, 250,000 are trapped under siege and the bombardment of
civilian areas continues. Yet finally, we saw on Saturday the first,
tentative, steps of progress when the United Nations Security Council
unanimously adopted the UK co-sponsored Resolution
2139.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000071">As my
noble friend Lord Wallace of Saltaire informed the House earlier this
week, this resolution—the first time the Security Council has
come together to act in response to the deteriorating humanitarian
situation—demands an immediate end to the violence, the freeing
of besieged areas and the unimpeded delivery of humanitarian aid to the
whole of Syria. It rightly condemns terrorist attacks and, in line with
Britain’s policy over the past three years, places its weight
behind efforts to seek a negotiated political settlement and the
implementation of the Geneva
communiqué.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000072">Although
the passage of Resolution 2139 represents a significant diplomatic
success, it will have an impact and relieve the suffering of
Syria’s starving people only if it is applied fully and
immediately. That is why we are working closely with UN agencies to
press ahead quickly with the delivery of aid to hard-to-reach and
blockaded areas. In parallel, we call on the Assad regime to comply
fully with the resolution. We are clear that we will return to the
Security Council and take further steps in the case of non-compliance.
Yet it 
<?notus-xml column=1014?>saddens me that, in stark contrast to the approach being taken by the
national coalition, there remains no sign of the Assad regime having
any willingness whatever to allow the political transition demanded by
the Security Council. Indeed, the UN and Arab League envoy, Lakhdar
Brahimi, has laid responsibility for the failure of the Geneva II
negotiations clearly at the door of the
regime<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:21:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000073">UK
support to the Syrian people within Syria itself and to refugees in

now turn to other key countries across the region, starting with Iran.
The interim agreement with Iran came into force on 20 January and is
being implemented. Meanwhile, the E3+3 and Iran met last week to start
negotiations on a comprehensive agreement aimed at ensuring that
Iran’s nuclear programme is, and always will be, exclusively
peaceful. The talks were constructive and will continue in mid-March in
Vienna. We continue to expand our bilateral engagement with Iran. Last
Thursday, we and Iran brought protecting power arrangements to an end.
This is a sign of increasing confidence that we can conduct bilateral
business directly between capitals, rather than through
intermediaries<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T11:21:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000075">We
will continue with these step-by-step improvements in our bilateral
relations, providing that they remain reciprocal. We are, for example,
working together on ways in which to make it easier for Iranian and
British citizens to obtain consular and visa services. However, the
House should be under no illusion that the challenges remain
considerable and, until a comprehensive solution to address all
proliferation concerns related to Iran’s nuclear programme is
found, existing sanctions will remain intact and will be enforced
robustly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:04:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000076">Syria’s
closest neighbours, Lebanon and Jordan in particular, have both been
greatly affected by the continuing instability in the region. As a
result, almost one in five of Lebanon’s population is a
registered refugee, while Jordan has the dubious honour of being home
to the second largest refugee camp in the world. The UK is contributing
more than £110 million to assist each of these nations with the
humanitarian emergencies that it faces. It was a subject that I
discussed at length with the Jordanian Foreign Minister on 9
January, and we continue to co-operate closely. However, the worsening
humanitarian crisis is compounded by violence not just in Syria but
also in Lebanon, where the UK is providing assistance to increase
border security, and in Iraq. The Government and, I am sure, all sides
of the House, condemn the recent deaths and violence across the region
and urge all sides to unite to find political solutions to the
challenges being
faced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000077">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:05:43"></hs_TimeCode>
Iraq last year, we saw the violent deaths of more than 8,000 civilians,
and 300,000 people have been displaced from the west of Iraq since the
beginning of this year alone. Here again, it is vital that inclusive
political process accompanies counterterrorism operations. The upcoming
parliamentary elections will form a key 
<?notus-xml column=1015?>part of that, by offering the people of Iraq an opportunity to
demonstrate their political will, make their voices heard and set a
clear mandate for the new Government. It is therefore vital that the
elections are free and fair and held on
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000078">More<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:06:20"></hs_TimeCode>
broadly, in terms of regional security, we must never lose sight of the
importance and centrality of the Middle East peace process to the lives
of millions of Israelis and Palestinians and to international peace. In
the past month, more than 30 Palestinian protesters were injured by
Israeli live ammunition, while two Israeli soldiers were injured. Both
Israeli and Palestinian security forces have foiled terrorist attacks
on Israel, allegedly planned by individuals in the West Bank. Attacks
by settlers on Palestinian property also continued. Progress towards
peace and a two-state solution is desperately needed, and the efforts
by US Secretary of State John Kerry to agree a framework for
negotiations offers a unique opportunity to secure lasting
peace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000079">In<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:07:00"></hs_TimeCode>
Egypt, the third anniversary of the revolution was marred by the death
of 100 protesters, as terrorist groups brought their terror campaign to
Cairo. Having seen three Governments in the three short years since we
witnessed such scenes of jubilation, the Egyptian people have yet to
find the stable, democratic, representative Government for whom they
fought, capable of tackling the vast political and economic challenges
the country faces. However, the referendum on the draft constitution,
held last month, was an important milestone on the political road map.
It allowed millions of Egyptians to express their opinion through the
ballot box and brought renewed hope for the presidential and
parliamentary elections due to be held before the
summer<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:07:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000080">Similarly,
the challenges facing the people and Government of Libya, as they seek
to build a secure, prosperous and democratic country after four
decades, remain serious, but we are firmly committed to supporting them
in whatever way we can, including by helping reform the police force,
army and prison service to ensure that they are accountable, comply
with basic standards of human rights and tackle corruption. However,
while we must not lose sight of the progress that Libya has made over
the past two years, we welcome the recent elections for a constitution
drafting committee and the recent statement by Libyan Justice Minister
Marghani about Libya’s willingness to co-operate with the UK and
US on the Lockerbie case. It is still clear that political divisions
within Libya continue to hamper progress
overall<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:08:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The
conference on Libya in Rome on 6 March offers all Libyans the
opportunity to renew their commitment to a single, inclusive political
settlement. The UK looks forward to taking part in the conference and
will continue to encourage other nations to provide the international
support that Libya needs on issues as varied as political transition,
governance and arms and
ammunition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000081">I
turn to where the Arab spring began. Tunisia continues to overcome
significant obstacles and continues its democratic transition. On 26
January, it achieved an important and historic milestone: the adoption
of a new constitution that embodies the fundamental freedoms called for
by the Tunisian people. The UK 
<?notus-xml column=1016?>will continue to offer support to the Tunisian Government, both through
our own Arab partnership programme and through the EU and G8, to ensure
that Tunisia can sustain and build on its achievements so far, and can
continue to be an inspiration to others struggling for freedom across

me now turn to the Gulf states. I had the honour of visiting Saudi
Arabia and Oman last week, to discuss—among other
things—religious tolerance and other regional issues. The UK has
an incredibly strong relationship with our Gulf partners. More than
160,000 British nationals live and work there. We work together across
a wide range of issues. The Gulf is vital for our energy security and
for countering the terrorist threat, and it is one of our largest
global export markets.</hs_para>

our concern at the instability and turbulence in the Middle East. On
Syria, we work with Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE as part of the
London 11 grouping, and Gulf nations contributed generously to the $2.4
billion raised by the recent Syria pledging conference in Kuwait. We
work with Gulf countries to enhance regional security, for example by
responding to the security situation in Yemen, particularly with Saudi
Arabia with whom we co-chair the Friends of Yemen
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000084">We are
delivering aid work in Afghanistan in conjunction with our colleagues
from the UAE; supporting Bahrain through its ground-breaking reform

region which has seen huge instability and violence, Yemen’s
progress so far has been commendable. The UK welcomes the recent
conclusions of the National Dialogue Conference and applauds the spirit
of co-operation and compromise that allowed participants to reach a
consensus. However, millions of Yemenis are still living without food,
shelter or water. The UK is the third largest donor of humanitarian aid
and DfID has committed £196 million over three years to support
development. However, the security situation in Yemen remains dire. The
UK has been working with the Yemeni Government for a number of years to
help them disrupt al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula and to help deny
al-Qaeda a haven in Yemen for the future. The UK now urges progress on
the next stages of Yemen’s transition, which includes the
drafting of a new constitution, implementation of the NDC outcomes,
timely organisation of a constitutional referendum and transparent
elections.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022779000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000086">In
opening this debate it is clear—and it will become increasingly
clear as the debate unfolds—that the situation in the Middle
East continues, despite the odd glimmer of hope, to give grave cause
for concern. The UK continues to be extremely active across the
region—bilaterally and multilaterally through the UN and EU, and
with allies—to deliver urgent humanitarian assistance, to
bolster security and to provide forums in which all parties can work
towards sustainable political settlements.

is a period of great change and great challenge in the Middle East,
right the way across the region from the Maghreb and north Africa
across the Levant and into the Gulf states. When I was first a Minister
in your Lordships’ House some 17 years ago, many a debate about
the region was focused on the hostilities between the Israelis and the
Palestinians and the wider potential conflict throughout the Middle
East. We then referred to the Middle East peace process because there
was only one peace process anybody had in mind. Now of course that
spectrum of conflict both within and between the states in the region
is so much more complex and widespread and, of course, it is drawing in
global players who have their own very significant agendas about their
relationships with the Middle East.</hs_para>

sectarian conflict within the states of the Arab League, the hugely
increased tensions between Iran and its closest neighbours and the
growing and seriously deep concerns of the Gulf states about the role
of Iran within the region are absolutely apparent to any visitor who
goes there. There was, of course, a time when any opening conversation
with a Minister in one of the countries of the Arab League was about
the Israeli-Arab conflict. Now the issue at the top of its agenda is
Syria, and Iran’s role in the Syrian conflict and sustaining the
Assad regime through its support for Hezbollah and the spread of
sectarian extremism.</hs_para>

for the enfranchisement of civil society, for democracy, and for
written constitutions that enshrine the rule of law and human rights,
including of course the rights of women. This debate has singled out
one country for special concern, and rightly so. Syria is in a dire
position, as the Minister illustrated, with 5,000 of its citizens dying
every month, 24,000 people under siege and 2.5 million Syrians now
refugees in neighbouring countries, particularly Jordan and Lebanon,
both of which are showing real stress under the strain of their own

violence, the lifting of the sieges, and access for aid. It also

the OPCW has said that only 11% of the stockpile of chemical weapons

clear focus on the impact of the Syrian conflict in Lebanon and
Jordan—very different as they are politically but which share
the same common burden of the huge influx of refugees. The role of
Hezbollah, particularly in Lebanon, appears to be increasing and
strengthening. In supporting the Assad regime, Hezbollah appears to be
locked into an increasingly vicious series of revenge attacks from
groups linked to al-Qaeda, which involve innocent bystanders who have
been the victims, including many young people and some children.

further development in the Middle East this week that needs
discussion—the resignation on Monday of the Egyptian Prime

importance, not only in terms of stability in the region but the impact
that they have across all the neighbouring countries and, arguably,
globally. I understand that we are expecting a new Cabinet to be
announced this weekend, under ex-Housing Minister Ibrahim Mahlab as
Prime Minister. President Adly Masour, I understand, remains and some
17 Ministers are expected to retain their portfolios, but it would be

important. It is not only political reforms that so many Egyptians want
to see, but almost as importantly, they want economic reform. The
interim Government have said that they wanted to reform the hugely
expensive subsidy regime, reduce the budget deficit and stimulate the

fair. There may be some common aspects, such as the high youth
unemployment, the desire for the growth of civil society, the
increasing sectarianism, and, in many countries, the thirst for

could rise to 4 million by the end of 2014. Within that overall crisis,

the Syrian people. The UK has given £241 million in aid to
support the population of Syria, as well as £263 million to
Syrian refugees in neighbouring countries. Food is being provided, I am
told, to 130,900 people, and the UK has funded 71,500 medical

relief which receives little publicity is from neighbouring
Israel—a surprise to many people. Israel has given medical

Israel will rise in the next year.
Through<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:26:01"></hs_TimeCode> liaison

Israel has been working in partnership to support Syrian refugees in

has so far tried to keep a low profile in the Syrian conflict, and I
apologise to it if I am raising that profile somewhat today. Given the
high level of anti-Israel sentiment in the region, overt Israeli
support for any party could be used to discredit it. I echo the
Minister’s comments about the work of Secretary of State Kerry.
I only hope and ask that the UK Government do all they can to support
his efforts to bring both sides to the negotiating table to make big
compromises. That is still a chore that we should be helping Secretary
of State Kerry to achieve.</hs_para>

equally bad options in Syria of the Assad regime on the one hand and
al-Qaeda and Islamist movements on the other. It is clear that no one
knows what to do to end this conflict. Therefore the focus has been to
try to support moderate elements in the opposition as much as possible
and to provide aid to regional allies such as Jordan, which is bearing
the brunt of the social, political and economic consequences of Syrian
refugees. There are half a million Syrian refugees in Jordan and the UK
Government should be concerned not only for these unfortunate refugees
but for the undermining of the Hashemite Kingdom, a long-time friend of
Britain. The growing threat from radical jihadists who have been drawn
to the Syria conflict should create new impetus for co-operation
between Israel and the Arab states in the region. The West would do
well to develop and encourage regional frameworks for countering the
challenge posed by the
jihadists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000109">What
I have tried to add in this debate is that everyone is appalled at the
humanitarian crisis, even those whom Syria has previously attacked. We
hear of assistance given, some of which has been given largely below
the radar, but it must continue. The Minister referred to United
Nations Security Council Resolution 2139—although it seems long
ago, it was passed only on 22 February—which sets out the need
for humanitarian assistance to Syria. There are very many people
trapped in besieged areas in Syria and there are large numbers of
refugees in Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Iraq and Egypt. Three-quarters of
those refugees, we are told, 
<?notus-xml column=1022?>are women and children. I hope the Minister will say what the Government
are doing to support the need for access to these besieged groups to
provide urgent humanitarian relief. Aid must go across borders because
it is not going to come from within Syria itself. So my two final
questions for the Minister are: how do Her Majesty’s Government
hope to assist in the humanitarian effort, and how can the fighting be
stopped? Unless there is a ceasefire and cessation of hostilities
within Syria, the killings and traumas are going to carry on and the
humanitarian disaster that we are witnessing will

Stirrup (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, as we debate Syria and the Middle
East today, it is clear that we have witnessed and continue to witness
a significant degree of political and social upheaval across the
region. To that extent, the cards are up in the air, but we can have
little control and less certainty about where they will eventually
fall. This naturally poses some serious challenges to the formulation
of a coherent UK policy in the Middle East. If we are to develop and
maintain a credible strategic approach to the dynamic and complex
challenges of the region, we need first a comprehensive analysis of the
context and then a clear focus on those issues that are most important
to our own security and prosperity. I do not mean to diminish the
importance of moral and humanitarian concerns—we should continue
our efforts in this regard—but as a nation we have limited
resources and influence. It is therefore crucial that we identify our
own policy
priorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000111">The
context is surely an unravelling of the post-1918 settlement that was
intended to tidy up the detritus of the Ottoman Empire. Britain and
France, of course, have their fingerprints all over this settlement.
Consider Syria. The Ottomans ruled it for just over 400 years until
1918. The San Remo conference of 1920 placed Syria-Lebanon under a
French mandate while, incidentally, putting Palestine under a British
mandate at the same time. Syria became independent in 1946 but had no
settled constitutional or political base. Between 1946 and 1956 the
country had 20 different Cabinets and four different constitutions. The
turmoil in Syria today is only the latest episode in a drawn-out
process that has its roots in the end of Ottoman rule in
1918.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000112">We now
see long-buried fissures reappearing across many parts of the region.
We see tribe pitted against tribe, Muslim against non-Muslim, Arab
against non-Arab, authoritarian against libertarian and, perhaps most
significantly, Sunni against Shia. Indeed, the last division is one of
the most polarising and potentially one of the most dangerous.
Overshadowing all this is the regional competition between Saudi Arabia
and Iran. This, of course, encompasses some of the fissures that I have
mentioned—Sunni/Shia and Arab/non-Arab—but the degree of
national animosity and the pursuit of regional political dominance take
the problem to a new level and the competition is increasingly being
played out in
Syria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000113">The
political upheaval in Syria is different in nature from many of the
others that we have seen elsewhere in the region. In places such as
Libya and Egypt, the impetus for change came from, or quickly
gravitated 
<?notus-xml column=1023?>to, those in the cities and centres of population. In Syria it came from
those on the periphery, particularly the impoverished and
drought-ridden agricultural communities, and was directed against those
at the centre. So change was more difficult to achieve, particularly
since survival of the military leadership was more closely tied to the
survival of the regime. Even so, it looked as if Assad could not last,
but the intervention of Hezbollah changed the
outlook.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000114">Given
the support of Iran and Russia, it is now hard to see how Assad could
be removed in the near term. Given the support of Saudi Arabia, Qatar
and to some extent at least the United States, it is hard to see how
the regime could achieve a decisive military victory over the
opposition groups. The most likely outcome in Syria is either
degeneration into a Somalia-like failed state or division into a number
of warring baronies. Neither outcome is palatable from a wider security
perspective and both are likely to perpetuate large-scale human
tragedy. Without substantial international intervention, for which
there seems little or no appetite, it is hard to see a plausible
alternative.</hs_para>

key sets of negotiations continue: on the Middle East peace process and
on the Iranian nuclear issue. Both are likely to reach some sort of
conclusion, whether satisfactory or not, later this
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000116">These
then, are some of the key features of the regional context. With so
many challenges and so little clarity on the likely outcomes, where
should the UK place its own policy priorities? I should like to propose
three areas. Top of the list, I suggest, should be the Iranian nuclear
issue. The consequences of failure on this front for the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty and for long-term security within the region
are likely to be extremely serious and to have a lasting effect on the
UK’s own security. The ongoing negotiations are therefore
critical. Of course, we have to negotiate well if we are to achieve the
right outcome and, of course, we must take nothing on trust. Any
agreement has to be verifiable. There will inevitably be different
views on what constitutes a bad deal or a good
deal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000117">I want
to focus on two short-term issues that seem to me of fundamental
importance in this whole process. The first is the sustainment of the
agreed sanctions regime. As negotiations continue and some restrictions
are lifted, there is a clear risk that sanctions as a whole will start
to unravel. There will be a temptation for some countries or companies
to jump the gun in order to gain a competitive advantage over their
rivals. That risk cannot be entirely eliminated, so it will have to be
managed. It will require strong and obvious resolve on the part of the
major economic players to take firm and painful action against
transgressors. The UK and the EU more generally will have an important
part to play
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000118">The
other issue concerns the question of where we go if negotiations fail.
What is plan B? In such situations there is often a reluctance to
consider plan B at all in case this is taken as a belief that plan A
will not work, but such precautionary thinking does not need to be
public. We can and should be discreetly considering what options are
open to us if it proves impossible, even with more time, to reach a
comprehensive settlement. 
<?notus-xml column=1024?>This will involve some difficult decisions, but leaving them to the last
minute risks making the difficult impossible. Of course the implicit
existence of a plan B could help to focus minds on reaching
a satisfactory agreement in the first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000119">The
second policy priority, I suggest, should be our relationship with
Saudi Arabia. This has suffered over recent months, not least because
of divergent views over Syria and concerns about the negotiations with
Iran. However, Saudi Arabia remains the pivotal country in the Gulf
region and is of considerable economic importance to the UK. Given the
differences in our societies and cultures, the relationship is never
going to be an easy one. It will require hard work, a degree of
tolerance on both sides and, above all, constant and clear
communication. The relationship is too important to the UK and its
interests for us to neglect it. How closely are the Saudis being
consulted on the negotiations with Iran? What we might consider a
satisfactory outcome might look very different to Saudi eyes. Although
we cannot give them a veto over the process, attempting to deal with or
mitigate their concerns must be a key policy objective for the
international community as well as for
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000120">The third
priority should be to contain, as far as that is possible, the wider
regional consequences of a Syrian conflict. Jordan matters to us as an
old friend and it matters to Israel because of the latter’s
concerns over strategic depth, so it is key to wider regional
stability. However, Jordan is being weakened and undermined by the
conflict in Syria. As others have mentioned, the large number of
refugees is putting great stress on the already weak economy. There is
no doubt that the social impact of what is going on in Jordan as a
result of the conflict in Syria is having enormous repercussions for
the regime there. Therefore, support for Jordan, for its economy and
for its political development should be a key part of the UK’s
policy in the
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000121">There
are of course other malign international repercussions of the war in
Syria. The Lebanon is being seriously affected. Perhaps one of the most
worrying consequences is the growth of an ungoverned space straddling
the Syria-Iraq border and the implications for radical Islamist
terrorist groups. For example, the recent activities of the so-called
Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant demonstrate the risk of such an
ungoverned space. The group poses serious dangers to the future of both
Iraq and Syria and potentially further afield. Containing this risk
will require some sort of governance over the affected area. For this
reason, if no other, the feuding baronies outcome in Syria that I
described earlier, while unpalatable, would certainly be preferable to
a Somalia-like failed state. Another wider consequence of the Syrian
situation is the return of radicalised and battle-hardened jihadis from
the conflict zone to their home states. Saudi Arabia is increasingly
concerned about this issue and the implications for its own security.
It also affects us here in the UK. In many ways, this is a challenge
for domestic rather than foreign policy, but it is a challenge
nevertheless.</hs_para>

other important issues, such as the Middle East peace process, that I
do not have time to cover, but many of these, while crucial to the 
<?notus-xml column=1025?>UK, are beyond our power to influence directly. As I said at the outset,
the proliferation of challenges within the Middle East and the limits
on our ability to confront them should force us to a clear-eyed
analysis of UK priorities. Naturally, some may disagree with those that
I have proposed, but in my view such an analysis is essential if we are
to take a coherent and strategically informed approach to the many
dangers that we face, rather than simply wringing our hands about
them.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/DE2A893A3D20014B5AB8AF63CD96133C112F6634" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2014">Thursday,

December 2002, I was called to 10 Downing Street for a clandestine
meeting with the Prime Minister’s appointments secretary to talk
about the possibility of my going to the See of Wakefield. When I
arrived, I was terrified that my cover might be blown, since television
cameras surrounded us and, indeed, I followed Andrew Marr through the
security gate. The cameras were, of course, not for us but for
President Assad, who was paying an official visit to the then Prime

persuading the Queen to confer a knighthood on the Syrian
leader.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000125">I
begin there because we now, as they say, find ourselves in a very
different place. For some time, the UK, alongside other western
countries, has been backing the so-called Syrian national coalition, an
association of most unlikely bedfellows whose only cause for unity is
opposition to the Assad regime. That is, even with the typical vagaries
of international affairs, an extraordinary volte face.</hs_para>

since<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:45:26"></hs_TimeCode> the
intervention in Libya, originally styled as a humanitarian crusade,
became fairly swiftly a policy aimed at regime change, international
relationships have shifted significantly. It was of course that policy
change, more than anything else, which assured the West of a more than

bloodshed in Syria to a swift

summer, with the discovery of Syria’s use of chemical weapons,
the western nations were faced with another critical decision. Did the
enormity of that terrible abuse of human rights and inhumanitarian
behaviour deserve a powerful intervention from the USA, the UK and
other North Atlantic allies? We all know the denouement of that crisis,
and many of us may be proud that this Parliament, by offering us the
opportunity to debate the issue, was almost certainly instrumental in
making certain that no western nation intervened in that way at that
time<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:46:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000128">Where
does that leave us now, as this tragic war enters its fourth year?
First, all analysis of civil wars suggests that wholesale military
intervention from outside the country will lengthen the war. Indeed, as
we continue to see, even Iraq has still not thrown off the shackles 
<?notus-xml column=1026?>of the internecine strife with which both this country and the USA
engaged so controversially just over 10 years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:46:44"></hs_TimeCode>. To answer
my question as to where that leaves us is itself fraught. It does not
leave us, as some simplistic analyses suggest, with either Assad or
al-Qaeda. Nor does it leave us with any clear sense that our support
for the Syrian national coalition has done anything to bring closure to
the conflict, or even any clear resolution of the situation which
continues to claim so many lives. It does, however, leave us with a
displacement of people on a terrifying scale. In January 2014, the
United Nations published figures showing that within Syria, 6.5 million
people are already internally displaced and in desperate need. A
further 242,000 are under siege, with more than 2.4 million people in
external refugee camps.</hs_para>

more than 2 million refugees, that indicates that the future of Syria
lies to a large degree outside the country. That is true not only
because of displaced persons but because of the vested interest of
powerful nations from both the East and the West. Russia, China and
Iran all have interests outside Syria which need to be included in the
equation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:48:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000130">Let
me return to my question again: where does that leave us now? It does
not point us to a religious conflict—despite the destruction,
since the beginning of the conflict, of so many of the ancient
Christian Syrian communities: Assyrians, Melkhites and Antiochene
Orthodox. Of course, the suffering of Christians pales into
insignificance when compared with the suffering of the wider Syrian
community as a whole. No, this is not a religious but a political
conflict, and the only positive way forward must be a political,
humanitarian and diplomatic strategy. As we have already heard, the
challenges are immense, but the fact that Syria’s future lies to
such a degree outside its own borders puts a great moral responsibility
on countries like our
own.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000131">With that
in mind, where might Her Majesty’s Government find leverage?
There is no doubt that leverage within the regime in Syria and, indeed,
within the myriad of opposition groups, is very limited. I have already
hinted at the problems of unqualified support for the Syrian national
coalition. It is almost, by definition, a western-selected coalition
and therefore does not represent widespread support on the ground
within Syria. So, to take a rather contrasting approach, removing
international support both for the regime and for opposition groups is
a policy which may lead to more possibilities of leverage from the
West. Russia, China and Iran’s external interests were alluded
to earlier.
Removing<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>
international support in both directions—that is for the regime
and opposition groups—will, of course, not end the civil war in
itself. It may, however, help starve the conflict by reducing the
resources which continue to fan the flames.</hs_para>

this, will Her Majesty’s Government support efforts to bring
about reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia in order to offer a

Stirrup, referred to these various tensions, pressures and axes within
the region. Will Her Majesty’s Government also, as I have

elsewhere in the region—in Jordan, for example—where vast

Howell of Guildford (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is clearly
difficult to comment effectively on all the countries that we are
considering in this debate, but I begin by observing that there is a
dreadful similarity in almost all of them, where government and
authority—sometimes legitimate, sometimes tyrannical—are
losing their grip and/or are under intense challenge. Power is
fragmenting: it is not being neatly transferred to new dawns and new
bodies, but being fragmented into the street. The monopoly of
state-armed power by which the authority was hitherto upheld has been
fractured. That is what is happening. It is a new pattern and one has
to ask why this new force is anything different from revolutions and
rebellions in the past.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022779000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000135">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>
answer, of course, lies in technology. It lies in the tsunami of new
weapons that are in the hands of minorities and which, with very few
people, can inflict enormous damage on traditionally and classically
armed formations. I am thinking of the improvised explosive devices
which have done so much damage in Afghanistan, of endless decoys, of
shoulder-held missiles which can be purchased in the international arms
souk. I am thinking even of homemade drones. Hezbollah managed to get a
drone aloft which it had put together itself. These are just the
beginnings of a massive miniaturisation of weaponry which makes the
vast military machines with which the 20th century tried to equip
itself increasingly vulnerable. That is one aspect.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022779000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000136">Second<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:54:36"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
and even more powerful, is the fact that the street is empowered. The
rebels and the rebellions are empowered by an information revolution of
an intensity and an organisational capacity impossible to envisage in
the past. It is completely new. It gives connectivity through the 7
billion mobile telephones in the world. Half of the entire planet is on
the world wide web. This gives an organisational capacity to minorities
and to those challenging authority on a scale we have never seen
before. We have only to think of what happened when Mohammed Bouazizi
immolated himself in Tunis. Within hours, and certainly within days,
the entire street population of the whole of Arabia was militant,
aggravated and activated.</hs_para>

this is a new pattern—a completely new pattern of power,
distribution of power, dispersal of power and fragmentation of power
has emerged. That is what we are seeing in the Middle East at the
moment. In all cases, attempts to crush by conventional force by
shooting down the enemy—shooting down the rebels and so
on—have not worked and are not working. They did not work for
Assad, although he may survive. He may just hang on but he certainly
will not win and will never get back the country that he began with. It
did not work in Egypt and did not really work with the wretched Gaddafi
in Libya, which with all his weapons and money he failed to control. It
has not worked in Iraq, where the rate of slaughter has got worse and
some thousands and thousands are continuing to die. Indeed, although we
are not discussing this today, it 
<?notus-xml column=1028?>quite obviously has not worked for President Yanukovych in Ukraine. He
thought that he could use force to suppress the opposition and the
challenges but he soon found, as other dictators and indeed democratic
Governments have found, that force does not work any more. The old
pattern of crushing and bringing in the tanks is now not the weapon
that it was.</hs_para>

more from my noble friend Lord Lamont on Iran, as he is a great expert
on that field, but even in Iran the trembling elements of protest are
rumbling away. That is the universal pattern so instead of the order
that one hoped was going to come with orderly protest and cries for
liberty, we have on every side chaos. The old saw is that a revolution
devours its children. Of course, in Syria we have seen its children
devouring each other in the most horrific ways, with a savagery which
is almost unimaginable in times of what we thought was peace.</hs_para>

against rebel brings me to a second point which I want to share with
your Lordships, which is the colossal complexity of all the situations
with which we are dealing. I will give only two examples. In Syria,
al-Qaeda controls the small but important oilfields, which produce
about 100,000 barrels a day or probably less. What do they do with that
oil? They refine it crudely and sell it to President Assad. Wait a
minute—can that be right when he is on the other side and
fighting them? Yes, it is right: they are selling refined oil so that
he can drive his aeroplanes. The bargain is that he has agreed not to
bomb the areas controlled by al-Qaeda. That is just one example of the
extraordinarily labyrinthine nature of the situation we are dealing
with.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022779000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000140">Then
there are the points that the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, touched on
with great authority regarding Hezbollah in Lebanon. Lebanese politics
have always been immensely complicated but now we have an extraordinary
situation in which Hezbollah, which used to be the state within a state
and seemed to be a challenge to Lebanon’s unity, is itself under
attack and being protected by the Lebanese army from suicide bombers,
some Sunni extremists and, to some extent, al-Qaeda. They are attacking
it because it is backing a different side. It is backing Assad and
they, with Saudi and Qatari support and a continuous flow of weapons,
are backing the other side. The difficulty of saying, “Let us
have priorities. What should we do?” is vastly multiplied by the
fact that we do not really know who is on which side in many of these
areas. The complexities are far greater than the simplicities which we
hoped for when we talked about the Arab spring, and how that would
bring new Governments, new liberties and new democracy. I am afraid
that it is not going to be like
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000141">The
third point which I want to mention is the energy aspect. Energy issues
obviously run throughout the whole Middle East situation but there are
some new factors, which I think have not been mentioned. I do not know
whether they are recognised in London at all. However, in the east
Mediterranean vast new gas reserves have been identified. In the case
of Israel, the reserves have been found and are being used. They have a
very significant effect on the whole pattern in the area. Cyprus and
Israel want to work together to develop them. Lebanon, when it manages
to get a 
<?notus-xml column=1029?>Government and some kind of laws in place, wants to develop its
resource. Turkey is interested in the enormous gas resources around the
south of Cyprus. Cyprus itself now has north and south Governments, who
are rather readier to talk to each other than they have been for some
time.</hs_para>

is a completely new pattern on the chessboard of the east Mediterranean
and I hope the United Kingdom authorities will play a constructive part
by supporting Turkey’s aspirations. Turkey is facing
instabilities and problems on the street; it still wants to get into
the European Union, and it is not feeling very happy about the way
things are going. The acquisition of gas resources by Israel is
changing its attitude as well to what can be done in the way of
supplying gas, certainly to Jordan and Palestine. Indeed, it has
already signed contracts, oddly enough, to supply gas back to
Egypt—the other way around from the pattern that used to exist
five years ago.</hs_para>

Kerry was saying much the same thing the day after. That is a most
profound point. He was talking mainly about the Ukraine, but it applies
just as much to the whole Middle East and all the troubled areas we are
looking at. We can think in terms of the EU working collectively in
some areas very effectively—not always, but sometimes—but
the truth is that a much wider coalition of the willing, not just of
western powers and the usual suspects of the old NATO world, is needed,
embracing the rising powers of Asia and the big players of Africa and
Latin America. These areas have just as much say, responsibility for
and interests in the Middle East and its stability as we do. It is
worth remembering that most of the oil of the Middle East now goes

local issues and integrated into the community, yet still with strong
central governance. In this context, we also discussed the hundreds of

people must have a robust, sensitive, patient, long-term system for
listening to, hearing and responding to those voices. They are now

also touch briefly on the continuing disgrace of Israeli settlement
policy on the West Bank. I doubt whether under the rules I am required
to disclose an interest, but I nevertheless declare, as I have before

the Syrian civil war have been committing unspeakable crimes against
the Syrian population, and the resulting humanitarian crisis engulfing
not only Syrians but Palestinians in their refugee camps is widely
acknowledged to be one of the worst we have seen for some time. The
Government’s approach to this, as reflected most recently in the
Foreign Secretary’s Statement three days ago, has been to call
for a political transition in Syria, which is shorthand for the removal
of the Assad leadership from government in Damascus. Is it surprising,
in these circumstances, that the Syrian Government’s
representative in the latest round of talks should have refused to
discuss “transition”?</hs_para>

Damascus should be the number one priority was reached at a time when
it was forecast, however misguidedly, that the Assad Government were
about to fall. The situation is now very different. Not only has there
been a significant change in the military situation; attempts to put
together a moderate rebel group that might take part in any future
transitional Government have proved notably unsuccessful, with 
<?notus-xml column=1032?>the Syrian national coalition in a state of confusion, if not chaos. The
extreme Islamist movements, largely consisting of foreign extremists
infiltrated into Syria and financed by our friends in the Gulf, are now
proving to be the only effective military opposition to the Assad
Government. In these circumstances, should it really be our priority to
work for a transition, when the resulting Government might turn out to
be considerably more dangerous, both for our interests and for those of
the Syrian people, than the present secular Government in
Damascus?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000159">The
Foreign Secretary has argued that our top priority is a political
solution to end the Syrian crisis. Surely we must all say amen to that.
But I would argue that the only way to achieve such a political and
diplomatic solution is not to keep pressing for a transitional
Government in Damascus, with all that entails, but for all of us,
including our partners in the European Union, to work with
Syria’s friends and supporters, namely the Russians, the
Iranians and the Syrians themselves, to achieve an immediate ceasefire,
if only to relieve the humanitarian

great deal has been said in recent weeks about the involvement of
Hezbollah in Syria, and this no doubt explains the reported aggression
by the Israeli air force against targets in southern Lebanon earlier
this week. But I think that we should distinguish between, on the one
hand, attempts by a Shia organisation in neighbouring Lebanon to
protect the Shia-backed Government in Damascus against Sunni extremism
and the continued external involvement, on the other hand, of the Sunni
Gulf states in what I have repeatedly described in this House as a
Sunni-Shia, if not Arab-Iranian, war—an involvement which is

is a lot of argument about whether President Rouhani is a reformist in
the Iranian sense, but it cannot be denied that he has the support of
the reformist element. His Cabinet is very similar to that of President
Khatami. President Rouhani has certainly unleashed in Iran an enormous
feeling of optimism on the part of the population of expectation and a
great rise in business confidence. The Government frequently
say—and I know that many people believe—that only
sanctions have brought Iran to the negotiating table. I would say that
that is only partly true. They have had an effect, but it was public
opinion, the election and the election of President Rouhani that
changed the policy. If the election had gone the other way and
Mr Djalili, the previous nuclear negotiator, had been
elected, there would have been no change at all.</hs_para>

revolutionaries are ageing and it is moving into a post-revolutionary

revolution alive, and we have to be very careful that in our dealings
with Iran we do not make mistakes that strengthen them. But Iran has
the capacity to evolve without violence and further revolution, whereas
I could not express that view about all the countries in the Gulf. Some

have the same capacity to evolve into something more akin to a western

it is also an authoritarian state whose record on human rights is
extremely bad. We did not flinch at every meeting that we went to from

The West is right to press Iran on human rights, but it is an issue
that should be kept separate from the nuclear issue, which is a prize

considerable benefits to the region and the

discussed the nuclear issue with Foreign Minister Zarif and he
professed that he was not very optimistic about the outcome of the
talks. I think that the greatest difficulty in the talks is going to be
over the objective set out in the initial agreement to reach a mutually
agreed definition of a nuclear programme—that is to say, what
scale of enrichment should be allowed, if it is to be allowed, in Iran.
One can see the gulf in thinking when you consider that Iran currently
has 20,000 centrifuges, but in a recent article in the <I>Financial
Times</I> Mir-Hossein Mousavi, another previous Iranian nuclear
negotiator, pointed out that broadly 100,000 centrifuges are
needed—it depends what type they are—for one nuclear
power station. Iran has 20,000 at the moment. The other day Wendy
Sherman said she could not possibly see why Iran needed 20,000
centrifuges. Of course the West is concentrating on reducing the number
of those centrifuges, yet paradoxically it looks as though it wants
Iran to reduce the number of centrifuges to a limit which would enable
it to produce a nuclear weapon but not to actually power a power
station. That does not seem a very sensible approach. I think it would
be much better if the West did not concentrate on the number of
centrifuges but actually concentrated on transparency, inspection, the
additional protocol, the right to go throughout the country and to make
undeclared visits. That will be the way in which agreement might be
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000183">We
spent a lot of our time discussing the nuclear issue but we also
discussed the Syrian situation. I agree with everybody who has
described that as an absolute humanitarian disaster and I do not for
one minute defend the position that Iran has taken. However, Foreign
Minister Zarif and others repeatedly said to us—they never
mentioned Assad—that they felt the only way in which the
situation could be resolved would be through a political solution which
led to free elections. I regarded that just as a formula which they
trotted out but I notice it is a formula that they use on every public
occasion. I suggest that we take them at their word. Of course the idea
of elections is light years away in the present situation but we ought
to be 
<?notus-xml column=1037?>trying to create that situation. By involving Iran we would be more
likely to do that and create a path in which elections could be the
ultimate destination.</hs_para>

regards Syria in exactly the same way that Saudi Arabia and the United
States regard Bahrain. They regard it as a very important and strategic
interest. They regard Syria as the route to Hezbollah and recall that
Syria was of course the only Arab country that supported Iran during
the Iran-Iraq war. I was in the Middle East when the recent unrest
first began in Bahrain and I recall that a very well-known senior
American politician made it quite clear to me that there would be no
change to the regime or fundamental political change in Bahrain. He
just said, “We have interests there,” meaning, of course,
the fleet. That is exactly the attitude Iran has towards Syria. I think
Iran’s links towards Hezbollah and Hamas, which occupy a very
different space on the political Islam spectrum, ought to be looked at
in the context of Iran’s own security concerns. It regards its
links with Hamas and Hezbollah as assets. Iran has a very weak air
force. I think it was General Petraeus who said the other day that the
entire Iranian air force could be wiped out by that of the UAE in one
afternoon. Therefore, alternative sources of
firepower—asymmetric responses—are very much part of the
strategic thinking. It was once rather brutally put by Mr Larijani, the
speaker of the Majlis, who said that if there is an attack on Iran,
expect Israel to be in a wheelchair. In other words, the response will
come from south

about sanctions and the way in which they are being applied. I hope
that we will be very careful during this interim phase. I cannot for
the life of me understand why, when we are moving towards a situation
in which we want full diplomatic relations with Iran to be restored, we
will not allow the Iranian chargé in London to open a bank
account. How is an embassy meant to operate if it cannot have a bank
account? Yet the Government simply refuse to give any help on this. The
banking boycott is causing a lot of ill will in Iran. One of the
concessions made in the interim deal was on humanitarian goods such as
medicines. Lots of supplies of medicines, which are in great demand in
Iran, are not getting through because, although they are allowed to be
supplied, there is no access to banking facilities. The West seems to
be giving on the one hand and taking away with the other. All this of
course is due to US banking sanctions being imposed informally by the
back door on our own banking industry. If we wish to frustrate the
supply of humanitarian goods let us do it openly, not with subterfuge
and methods that are hitting ordinary people. We always said that we
did not want the sanctions to hit ordinary people but that is precisely
what they are doing because of the boycott being imposed, largely
informally, by American authorities threatening banks in the
UK.</hs_para>

with Iran is only 50:50. It is in the balance. Anything could upset it.
It could be upset in the United States or it could be upset in Iran. It

she has handled this incredibly difficult issue over the past few
years. I should also put it on record that the Library note on the

first want to focus the Minister’s attention on Libya. I have
had some talks with representatives of the Libyan Government, and it
has been clear to me that it is almost impossible for them to achieve
stable government without dealing with the problems of divisions within
the security services—the police and the army. As the Minister
will know, there is a series of armed groups who claim or try to be the
police force or the army for the country. Perhaps our Government have
done so but we ought at least to explore the option, possibly with NATO
and the European Union, of putting some of our experienced military
officers in there to try to help disarm and merge the various groups,
and try to create at least one major police force or armed unit. Unless
we do that, I cannot see how a stable state is going to emerge. The
European Union, ourselves and NATO have some experience in that we know
about how to negotiate between competing groups, get them to give up
arms and introduce other stabilising forces. I conclude my comments on
Libya by saying that unless we do something along those lines, it is
hard to see how that country can progress to a more stable
state<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:39:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:39:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is not with any great pleasure that I remind the Minister of my comment
in the summer last year—she was good enough to acknowledge that
it might come true—that the talks about Syria would almost
certainly fail. I thought that they would fail, not on the humanitarian
side—I recognise what the Government are doing on that and it is
very good—but, as perhaps the debate has already indicated, we

arms going to the various opposition groups in Syria, but the Iranian
and Russian arms going to the government side—to the military,
in fact—are profoundly important. The reason they are
particularly important is that Russia is a sophisticated power with
satellites, so it is not only arms being provided: there is good reason
to believe that it is also providing intelligence to the Assad regime
and military about the whereabouts of the various forces. Of course,
Assad has an air force and it is no surprise that the barrel
bombs—even though they might go astray at times and hit targets
either deliberately or not deliberately—are targeting those
areas about which it has

the Russians will necessarily want to see Assad stay in power, but I
think they have a very real interest in ensuring that the military
stays in power in Syria. That is why the Russians work closely with it.
The Russians have a military base in the area and they want that base.
Russians have arms contracts with the Syrians and they have always made
it very clear that they will continue to supply according to those
contracts. There is no dishonesty about it from the Russians’
point of view; it is just that they believe—and they are not
entirely wrong on this—that if they do not back the Assad side,
then it will be a failed state. The problem with the Russian position
is that we are either facing a military state or a failed state, and
neither of those is a particularly attractive option.</hs_para>

other way around, with the military controlling Assad—is winning
more ground than various opposition
groups<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:42:11"></hs_TimeCode>. That is
really why I said a year or so ago that I believed that the talks would
not succeed: because as long as the regime in Syria thinks that it can
gain ground through military advances, it is not in its interest to
engage in talks. That is why I found myself in agreement today with the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, about a plan B. I do not have any
suggestions about what that plan B should be, but I
understand—the noble Lord, Lord Wright, mentioned
this—that if it is true that the Russians are determined to keep
the military in control of Syria, rather than the various other
opposition groups, then, frankly, that is what we might have to live
with in times to

weapons of mass destruction are not used by the Syrian armed forces. It
is in Iran’s interest, not least because it was on the receiving
end of weapons of mass destruction from Saddam Hussein. From the
Russian point of view, it is because its world image is so awful, but I
do not think it is true to say that the Russians do not have an
interest in making sure that the military stays as the primary force in
Syria. That points to a military dictatorship of some type, except in

alerted. I am sure most of us remember this. I was on the staff of
Christian Aid at that time and I recall that thousands of people were
accommodated with British families and that it was an efficiently run
operation. What a contrast with Syria today. Here we have nearly 2.5
million refugees in four neighbouring countries, many overcrowded and
undernourished, and thousands applying for resettlement in Europe. They
have little prospect of returning home and yet European countries are
not exactly jumping forward with offers. The UNHCR is asking for 30,000
places this year and 100,000 long-term. Our Prime Minister said three
weeks ago that we must act urgently 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>but we have negotiated a figure of only 500 out of the 18,800 places
offered by 20 countries. Germany alone is said to be receiving 11,000.
Here we may remember for a moment Chancellor Merkel’s powerful
appeal to European nations to work even more closely together, and this
applies to asylum as much as everything else. It is true that in the
year up to last September the UK accepted 1,100 Syrians refugees, which
is the third highest number after Germany and Sweden, and the Home
Secretary says that 3,500 are already in the UK. But none of those was
actually invited; they somehow managed to get here after an exhausting
journey of weeks or
months.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000203">So
what has happened since the 1970s? Wars and massacres continue and the
suffering and risk from chemical weapons is equally serious, if not
more so. Was there anything special about the Vietnam War and Pol
Pot’s Cambodia, or about the vulnerability of the Vietnamese who
took to sea to persuade us to be more hospitable? Syrian families are,
if anything, more easily adaptable to British home life, and their
standard of living in many cases was previously comparable to that of
many people in the UK. I cannot answer these questions. I know that the
level of immigration is now much higher than it was then and that that
has affected our sense of hospitality. A combination of migrations from
eastern Europe and the troubles of the Middle East and north Africa
have generated new fears in the minds of some of us that this country
is losing its intrinsic character and culture. These fears, of course,
are groundless because we have absorbed migrations over many centuries
and indeed we depend on them. None of that should affect our attitude
to genuine refugees who are in a quite separate category. They are not
deliberately choosing a new life elsewhere but are reluctantly fleeing
war, persecution and hunger.</hs_para>

Williams of Baglan (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, we are holding this
debate almost three years since the outbreak of the civil war in
Syria—a war that has already claimed the lives of more than
100,000 people and left in its wake more than 1.5 million refugees.
Despite the length of this conflict, the international community has
struggled to contain the war, let alone bring an end to the violence
and restore peace to Syria. In the length of the conflict, its nakedly
sectarian nature and the inability of the international community to
reach a consensus reminds me all too often of the war in Bosnia between
1992 and 1995, where I served with the UN. Then as now, we struggle to
bring humanitarian relief to the victims of the war and, despite all
the hopes after the Yugoslav wars that a new era in the international
management of conflict had dawned, 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>those hopes have been dashed. Those hopes gave rise among other
developments to the doctrine of the responsibility to
protect—R2P in shorthand. The sad fact is that we have been
unable adequately to protect the people of
Syria.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000206">The
dangers of the conflict spreading to neighbouring countries, and
especially to Lebanon, have been noted by many speakers this afternoon.
On a visit to Lebanon a few weeks ago, I found UN colleagues anxious
about the growing sectarian violence within the country and the
extraordinary burden of more than 1 million refugees, equivalent to a
quarter of the Lebanese population. Can one imagine 15 million refugees
arriving in the United Kingdom and how we might cope? I pay tribute to
what our Government have tried to do to help the Lebanese and to the
extraordinarily able and energetic Ambassador Tom Fletcher and his
staff in Beirut. Despite their efforts and those of many other
countries to help Lebanon, the trends are not good. There have now been
at least five bomb attacks on the Shia district of Beirut, Dahieh. The
country’s second city, Tripoli, is wracked by periodic but
sustained violence between the majority Sunni population and an Alawite
minority openly supportive of the regime of President Assad and his
Lebanese ally, the Shia militia Hezbollah. A few days ago there was an
Israeli air attack on an alleged Hezbollah convoy. There have also been
assassinations—above all of the former Finance Minister and
leading moderate, and a personal friend, Mohammed Chatah, whose death
by murder on 27 December last year I
mourn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000207">Hezbollah,
deemed by many to be the most heavily armed non-state actor in the
world, was born during the 1980s Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon
and played a considerable role in prompting the eventual withdrawal of
Israel from Lebanon. Its focus now is elsewhere: fighting fellow Arabs
and fellow Muslims in Syria, who have dared to challenge Assad’s
regime. That action, strongly supported by Iran, has left an Arab world
dangerously divided between Sunni and Shia, which will take many years
to heal. I hope that, in their necessary dialogue with Iran on the
critical nuclear file, the Government and our colleagues in the P5, as
well as Germany, are taking issue with President Rouhani and warning of
the dangerous course that his Government’s allies are following
in the Arab world. I should be grateful if the noble Baroness could
clarify
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000208">I take
this opportunity to welcome the two rounds of talks held in Montreux
and Geneva under the able chairmanship of the veteran UN diplomat
Lakhdar Brahimi. Of course it is disappointing that more was not
achieved, but we should take some comfort from the fact that the talks
did not break down and that no party walked out. Moreover, between the
first and second rounds in Geneva, the head of the Syrian National
Council delegation, Ahmad Jarba, visited Moscow, where he was received
by the Foreign Minister of the Russian Federation, Sergei Lavrov. This
was certainly not welcomed in Damascus. Russia is now in the unique
position of being the only P5 member with relations with both sides of
the conflict in Syria.</hs_para>

efforts need to be intensified. I believe that it was foolish in the
extreme that the Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, seemingly had to
withdraw his invitation to Iran to participate in the Geneva peace
talks. If there is to be a negotiated settlement, diplomacy has to be
inclusive, not exclusive. I have always believed that the model in this
regard was the hawkish and viscerally anti-communist Secretary of
State, John Foster Dulles. In 1954 in Geneva, he was appalled at the
prospect of shaking hands with the Chinese statesman and Foreign
Minister, Chou En-Lai. In colourful language not appropriate in your
Lordships’ House, he refused to do that. The point is that
Dulles sat in the same room with representatives of a Government that
the US had been fighting for the previous three years in Korea. If
Dulles could do that half a century ago, the West should have been able
to do so a few weeks ago in
Iran.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000211">This war
has seen appalling acts of violence, cruelty and brutality that, in
many cases, almost certainly amount to war crimes. Before Syria, it had
become accepted that the international community would not tolerate
such crimes. In the Balkans, we saw the creation of the International
Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia. I myself testified against
former President Slobodan Milosevic, as well as the commander of the
Yugoslav army, General Perisic. A special tribunal was formed for
Sierra Leone, which has seen Charles Taylor indicted and tried. Above
all, there has been the formation of the International Criminal Court,
which has seen, among others, President al-Bashir of Sudan
indicted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000212">It
cannot be that Arabs and the Syrian people are less deserving of
justice. As a P5 member we have a duty towards them. I would welcome
any thoughts that the noble Baroness might have of government thinking
in this regard. The Special Tribunal for Lebanon, which this Government
and their predecessor have strongly supported, is now conducting a
trial, in the absence of the accused, of the suspected killers of Prime
Minister Rafik Hariri and others in 2005. I ask the noble Baroness
whether any thought has been given to extending the mandate of that
court to look at the murder of Mohammed Chatah, who was killed in an
almost identical fashion, by a massive car bomb, only a few streets
away from the 2005
killing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000213">In

Marlesford (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, as the world recovers from the
deepest, longest and most diffused economic crisis since the Great
Depression of the 1930s—I should emphasise that the recovery has
been slow and erratic, with the resumption of growth and prosperity
remaining fragile—another cloud threatens global stability and
security. This cloud—and it is a deepening and darkening
cloud—is jihadist terrorism against large areas of the world.
Although aimed primarily at the West, few areas remain entirely

most notable and fearful threat is that it is becoming joined-up
terrorism. The fundamentalist Islamism from which it stems is widely
diffused through not just much of the Middle East but also north,
central and east Africa, China, India, Pakistan, Afghanistan and the

are a coalition of the Taliban, al-Qaeda, al-Shabaab, Boko Haram, the
Syrian Islamic Liberation Front and a number of other splinter groups.

be an exaggeration to say that it threatens peace on the scale of the
Cold War but, significantly, on jihadist terrorism, all five permanent
members of the UN Security Council are in the same camp. Thus, there
should be hope of using the UN to authorise measures, thus legitimising
them in international law, to reduce the threat—perhaps

to a loose alliance of about 20 rebel groups who now appear to be
dominated by the ultra-Islamists. Their victory would lead to a
repressive theocracy. It is no coincidence that Israel, whose policies

Israel-Palestine situation is entering an even more serious phase. It
continues to drop its poison into the region and more widely, providing

Israel, however, the West Bank is not a top

Prime Minister Beblawi and the Foreign and Interior Ministers. Perhaps
most importantly, we had two hours with the Defence Minister, Field
Marshal Sisi, who is also head of the armed forces. We were told we

Islamic caliphate, and introduced a new Islamic constitution in

serious was that Morsi arranged for some 600 Islamist fighters to enter

threats against tourists are intended to sabotage a crucial element of
Egypt’s very fragile economy. By December 2012, Egypt’s

From early 2013, violent street protests, with many killed, resulted in
the army trying to get Morsi to hold a vote on his policies as things
went from worse to worse, with massive unemployment and no means to
reduce extreme poverty in the country. In July, the army stepped in to
remove him. An interim, mainly technocratic, Government was formed. The
Muslim Brotherhood was banned as a terrorist organisation. This was

Mubarak. Sisi is likely to stand and my own impression is that he would
make an effective leader of vision and integrity. The fact that the

found Bahrain’s judicial system very open and transparent. I
will give your Lordships an example. On one of my trips to Bahrain, I
had to transfer power of attorney to my Bahraini partner and a legal
document had to be signed in the presence of a judicial magistrate.
When I went to sign the document, the magistrate asked if I had read
it. I explained that I had not as the document was in Arabic, a
language I am unfamiliar with. He told me that I could not sign that
document if I had not read or understood it. He then called on a
translator to go through the document with me line by line. Once he was
satisfied that I had read and understood the document, he allowed me to
sign it. This is but one example of a personal experience that

critical steps that Bahrain has taken in the past two years,
particularly in addressing allegations of human rights abuses. Bahrain
was the first country in the Gulf to establish an independent ombudsman
at its Ministry of Interior. This was a recommendation of the Bahrain
Independent Commission of Inquiry, which was set up to investigate
allegations of police misconduct and improper treatment of prisoners.
In fact, reform has gone beyond what the commission recommended and
Bahrain maintains a zero-tolerance policy towards torture. The
commission has already investigated more than 80 complaints, many of
which have subsequently been referred for criminal investigations. The
recommendations contained in its report on the infamous Jaw prison are
currently being implemented by the Ministry of Interior. Jaw prison has
been notorious since its creation, particularly with regard to
political prisoners, as many noble Lords will be aware. However,
following the report, with its 18 recommendations on how to improve the
situation in the prison, things have improved
greatly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000230">The
introduction of the special investigations unit is another recent
institutional reform. This unit at the Bahraini
Attorney-General’s office, which was originally tasked with
ensuring that allegations of torture and mistreatment during the events
of 2011 were investigated thoroughly and that those responsible were
held accountable, has become a permanent prosecutorial body to
investigate and prosecute all instances of torture. It has investigated
more than 150 complaints, some received directly from victims and
others proactively gleaned from social media. Of these, 30 have

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, like other noble Lords, I am grateful
to the Minister for obtaining this debate and for introducing it with
such a helpful scan of Syria, the Middle East and north Africa. I draw
to the House’s attention my registered interests in the region,
particularly in trying to deal with conflict in the
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000238">Many
noble Lords have picked on a number of particular countries in which
they have a special interest or concern. That is a very appropriate
thing to do in the context of this debate, but I shall take a line
directed by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup. He pointed out
the need for us to have a clearer strategic approach to understanding
the problems of this region. While it is true that the same thing is
not happening in every country in the region, something is nevertheless
happening in the broader region and we need to understand it. We need
to evolve and develop our own way of addressing the problems.</hs_para>

Lord, Lord Stirrup, has directed us to three issues: Iran, when he said
that he hoped our Government and others would maintain some progress
and momentum in dealing with the 
<?notus-xml column=1050?>nuclear question; relationships with Saudi Arabia; and containing the
Syrian problem. I shall start with the last of those issues.</hs_para>

the very start I cautioned against any kind of military intervention in
Syria. I said that it seemed to me that the internal problems were not
amenable to our engagement and resolution and that what was critical
was to try, in so far as possible, to limit the spread of the
developing disorder and chaos. Part of the process of doing that is to
try to give support to Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey—a front-line
country which has been mentioned a few times in this debate but which
has perhaps not received as much attention as it deserves as a NATO
ally that has engaged very thoughtfully in this situation. The
Government have put a substantial amount of money, time and effort into
giving support, perhaps particularly in Lebanon and Jordan but also in
Turkey. We had the Deputy Prime Minister of Turkey here a week or so
ago and he welcomed the assistance that has been given. This is very
important. It is one of the positive and constructive things we can
continue to do and where we can continue to give a
lead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0001.htm#14022779000241">I am
afraid that when the question of military engagement arose the
Government seemed to jump with much too great an alacrity to agree
despite the bad experiences that we have had with it over some time.
Why was that? I have the impression that “engagement”
seems to be seen in military and force terms, and that much of our
foreign policy seems to be a matter of “Let’s see what
our American colleagues say and give them as much support as
possible”. In fact, on some issues—particularly the
Israel-Palestine question—that is the answer I have received
when I asked officials at the Foreign Office what precisely is our
policy. “We will wait and see what John Kerry says, we will wait
and see what happens, and then we will support it”. Of course
one wants to support one’s friends, but you are not a terribly
useful friend if the only thing you have to say is, “I agree
with Nick”. It is really rather important to say, “I hear
what you say and I am sympathetic to it but here’s another
perspective”. When it came to dealing with problems in my part
of the United Kingdom, our friends in the United States were perfectly
capable of taking a very different line from Her Majesty’s
Government and, in the end, helpfully
so.<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:24:52"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022779000242" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000242">Therefore the notion
that one might take a slightly different view or have another
perspective is not an unhelpful thing; frequently it is a very helpful
thing. We should inevitably have a different perspective from the
United States, not least, of course, because of our long history in
many of these regions, especially the Middle East itself; but
particularly because the United States is coming as the only superpower
and we are coming from a very different perspective of having limited
power, but substantial understanding. At least, that was the case in
the past.</hs_para>

perspective can we bring and what kind of strategic approach can we
increasingly develop? The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, talked
about Iran on the one hand and Saudi Arabia on the other. He and other
noble Lords have indicated also that these are not allies; that in fact
they see themselves 
<?notus-xml column=1051?>very much as competitors for hegemony in the region and also,
incidentally, with Turkey. If we are going to maintain relationships
with both of them, perhaps we can make a useful contribution. It has
been mentioned that Russia is the only member of the P5+1 that has
relationships with both sides in the Syrian context and therefore has a
very special role.</hs_para>

lesson we need to learn in our strategic approach: that it is important
for us to maintain channels of communication with as many sides as
possible in all these problems. It is not helpful for us to line up
behind one side or the other—and not only because we frequently
appear, ultimately, to pick the wrong side, although that is a good
reason in itself. If you are not a real powerhouse, then the power you
can bring is your capacity for relationship and communication. A great
deal can be achieved if we can use the relationships we have had in the
past and others that we develop as time goes on in order to
play a particularly useful role. We have fallen down on that. I hope
that the Minister will be able to encourage us that the increased
investment of money and resources in the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office will help us increase our communication with all sides. That
will mean taking political risks and having more political
openness.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022779000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000245">The
second thing is to deepen our knowledge and understanding of many of
these areas. Before I came to this area of work, a quarter of a century
or so ago, I harboured the notion that our Foreign Office was far and
away the most knowledgeable, understanding and sophisticated
organisation of its kind anywhere in the world. However, the more I got
involved and the more time passed, the more I found myself becoming
rather disappointed. I found that it was increasingly inward-looking
and not frightfully interested in advice, understanding or experience
from others outside the service itself, including from
parliamentarians, and that because of that it developed a kind of
groupthink about what was actually happening that frequently was not
very well informed by understanding.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022779000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000246">I will give noble Lords
an example. There has been an assumption for quite a long
time—although we are not of course the only country that makes
this mistake—that when engaging in countries that have conflicts
going on in them, it is key to identify the social and economic drivers
because those countries are rational actors, operating in their own
best interest. That is simply nonsense. They are devoted actors,
frequently acting in ways that are not in their best social and
economic interests. The more deeply they are embroiled in conflict, the
more they act not on social, economic and power values, but on what one
might describe as sacred values. I do not mean religious values, but
values that transcend best social and economic interest. There is lots
of research in this area to show that that is not just some kind of
airy-fairy notion; it can be measured and described and it affects the
way we act. For example, in a situation of that kind the notion from
outside would be, “Put some more money in and that will help to
oil the wheels”. Not only does that not help the situation, it
frequently makes it worse—first, because people react very badly
when the things that are important to them are couched in monetary
terms; and secondly, because frequently all you do is increase 
<?notus-xml column=1052?>or even create a context of corruption, as there is a whole lot more
money around than people can properly cope
with<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:34:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000247">It
seems that we have a capacity to use historic understandings and
relationships and a devotion to these kinds of issues that
will deepen our understanding—and understanding is one of the
things that this country can bring to the party. The noble Lord on the
Opposition Front Bench knows well how much British counsel, in its
deepening of understandings, has frequently helped us to understand
these things and engage in a much more constructive
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:35:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000248">The
third element, with which I will finish, is that we need to come with a
capacity to learn from others in our engagement with them. For example,
in working with folks in Tunisia I was struck by the remarks of Sheikh
Ghannouchi from the Muslim Brotherhood, who said that you cannot create
a democracy simply by having elected structures if you do not have a
culture of democracy and a culture that develops all that is necessary
for liberal democracy. He is right, yet for decades we have very
rapidly brought in institutions based on our experience, and are
surprised when the whole thing falls to
pieces<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:36:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000249">The
noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, referred to the Enlightenment. That was
not a light that was switched on and which suddenly enlightened us, but
something that took not just decades but centuries of painful
emergence. Perhaps that tells us something about what is happening in
that region. However, we also ought to be prepared to learn not only
how it really is in some other places but how it might be better for
us. There are things about the way in which we deal with our economy in
which we depend entirely on monetary values. In some of those countries
they are trying to develop an economics based more on community values.
We cannot only contribute; we can also learn, not just in the context
of this debate but in our engagement with those who are living in such
terrible

Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, when contemplating the
recent course of events in the Middle East: Syria’s seemingly
unending agony, Egypt slipping back into a military-dominated regime,
and Libya struggling to cope with post-Gaddafi chaos, it is far too
easy to succumb to pessimism and to allow it to persuade us—and
perhaps even to justify—the merits of detachment and inaction.
One can hear from time to time in this country when discussing this
region the mutterings of little Englanders who say,

say that that is easy, but it is quite misguided, even in terms of a
narrow definition of our national interest, let alone of the stake we
have, as a permanent member of the Security Council and, as with the
rest of Europe, as a close neighbour of the Middle East, in that
region’s future stability, security and prosperity. After all,
for the foreseeable future we will depend on that region for a
substantial part of our energy security. It is the origin of a large
proportion of the illegal immigrants flooding into Europe, and it
represents an all too present threat to us of a new wave of terrorism.
All that is without counting the risk of a new regional

diplomatic
means<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>.

of the Syrian peace talks in Geneva last month were, mercifully, low,
so we can afford to salute the persistence and ingenuity of the
UN’s mediator, Lakhdar Brahimi, to whom other noble Lords have
referred, without appearing to be totally Panglossian. Brahimi has, so
far, kept in his hands the slender thread—a very slender thread
now—of a process that could lead to a transition to a post-Assad
Syria. He has managed to bring some modest relief to the beleaguered
citizens of Homs, but he needs help and much wider and stronger
strategic international backing if he is to move beyond that. I agree
with others who have said that the short-term priority should be to
bring humanitarian relief to the citizens of many other
places—to Aleppo and parts of Damascus, in particular—who
are being starved into submission and bombarded with weapons whose use
in crowded, inhabited areas must surely constitute a war
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000254">Last
week’s unanimous Security Council resolution was, of course,

with a little scepticism about how much humanitarian relief will
actually get through. I would be grateful if the Minister would say
what we are going to do to press the regime in particular, but also, of
course, the other combatants, to let humanitarian relief through.
Should we not be thinking of ways to increase the pressure on the
regime if it does, indeed, block the application of that resolution? Is
any thought at all being given, for example, to suspending Syria from
its membership of the United Nations General Assembly, a course that
was taken with South Africa and with Serbia in the past and which did a
great deal to sober those regimes up and bring home to them that they
were at real reputational risk, to put it
mildly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000255">Secondly,
I shall say a word about the oft-derided Middle East peace process.
Perhaps because the spotlight is no longer on the principal
participants in that process, the talks between the Israelis and
Palestinians, to which the US Secretary of State is so laudably
devoting a high priority, seem marginally less hopeless than they have
often appeared in the past. Perhaps it is finally dawning on the two
sets of protagonists that they can no longer count on the unquestioning
support of their external backers. The fact that Prime Minister
Netanyahu has been criticised for even contemplating the possibility
that some Israeli settlers might find themselves living in a
Palestinian state is surely a welcome first and a sign that some new
thinking may be starting to
percolate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000256">Are

we, and they, be prepared to put on the table in response to an Iran
that could satisfy the international community durably and verifiably
as to the peaceful nature of its nuclear programme? That is, what would
the end state from our side of that negotiation look like if the
Iranians came to the end state that they would want to see on their
side? What, too, are we doing to set out the case to those in the US
Congress who are contemplating action that could shipwreck the whole
process? What action are we taking to bring home to them our hope that
they will stay their hand and give diplomacy a chance? We should, after
all, be under no illusions.
If<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:45:25"></hs_TimeCode> diplomacy
fails with Iran, the risk of a conflict that could draw in other
regional players and those outside the region would be real, and the

advocated a two-state approach as the only one likely to achieve
sustainable peace between Israel and its neighbours. Our visit was
three months after the Muslim Brotherhood had made an assassination
attempt on ?afez al-Assad, and his response was then to align Syria
with Iran. King Hussein declared Jordan’s support for Iraq. One
week after we met Assad, he was in Moscow signing a mutual
friendship treaty. Depressingly, as my noble and gallant friend Lord

rights record remains appalling. Saudi Arabia, referred to in this
debate as our strategic ally in the region, also commits egregious
violations of human rights and remains one of the deadliest exporters
of global terror. Back in 1980, Syria was expelling journalists and
massacring dissidents. Surely the failure to see reform, change and

“Afghanisation” of Syria, with vast tracts falling under
the control of dangerous jihadist groups, would hardly represent
progress. We need to hear much more from the Government, and with much
more clarity, of assessments of each of these various factions which
are largely at war with one another. Describing them as the opposition
conjures up images of a coherent and united group akin to opposition
groups in parliamentary democracies. We should be very wary of using
such descriptions. Take ISIS. It is said that al-Qaeda has cut its
links to one of its most deadly affiliates, ISIS—the Islamic
State of Iraq and al-Sham. There are also unverified reports, as we
have heard, of a possible military confrontation between Hezbollah and
ISIS. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what assessment she has made of
the continuing use of ISIS suicide bombers, the territory it controls
in north-eastern Iraq and its use of radicalised recruits, especially
from the United Kingdom? I refer to recruits such as Anil Khalil
Raoufi, a British Afghan who was studying engineering at the University
of Liverpool and was recently killed in fighting between rebel groups.

January last year, our Prime Minister visited Algeria—the first
British Prime Minister to do so—and I accompanied him as his
trade envoy. After the horrors of its war of independence, that country
suffered a brutal Islamist takeover more than 20 years ago. Some
150,000 people were killed amid scenes of unspeakable depravity, and
this has scarred the memories of Algerians collectively. Today,
quietly, we have a remarkable bilateral relationship, and a security
and defence compact. A massive desire exists there to learn English and
our trade has increased appreciably. Because of its energy wealth,
Algeria is spending heavily on both its physical and social
infrastructure, and I hope that British business will benefit from
this. EU monitors will be present for the elections. It is an enormous,
diverse country with extremely porous borders. We can only hope that

Muslim Brotherhood, we were assured of its commitment to attract
investment, to root out corruption and to protect the minorities. As a

to win—which, of course, is exactly what happened. Many voted
for it simply to achieve change, but felt in some instances that the

but there remain significant differences of outlook and Turkey is
completely opposed to a future federal structure for Syria. By
contrast, other parts of Syria are effectively being controlled by
various Islamist groups imposing arbitrary justice and their view of
how life should be lived. The stalemate is completed by the resilience

of us must have pondered many times what Russia's objective is.
Initially, it was declared to be the protection of the diversity and
secular character of Syria. In practice, entirely the reverse has
happened. President Assad, who sold himself as the protector of
secularism and of the minorities, has actually brought about their
destruction in many instances. The Russians have been offered
continuing military, intelligence and commercial engagement, yet it
seems that their position essentially remains fixed. I can only
conclude that they wish to be seen to stick with their friends, and to
make the contrast, fairly or unfairly, with other nations that have
interests in the region.</hs_para>

decimation of its ancient Christian community, many of whose members
fled to Syria. The Christian culture is now increasingly being
marginalised at best, and destroyed at worst, in the region. Some years
ago, my very dear friend the Archbishop of Aleppo and I were travelling
in his car. He said, “Richard, do you think we will be here in
50 years’ time?”. I replied, “Sadly,
and frankly, no”, to which he responded, “I fear you are
right”. Last year he was captured—a wonderful and
charismatic figure, and a good friend of the Church of England. His

Turner of Camden (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for
introducing this debate. It is very timely. Earlier in the week, we had
the government Statement on Syria and other issues, and we have had
another statement from the Minister this morning. Of course, we are all
appalled at what is happening: 5,000 civilians dying every month;
thousands of refugees in surrounding countries, sometimes in awful
conditions; and children wounded and dying, ill and often starving.
“What can we do?”, we ask. “Can this carnage be
stopped<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:06:59"></hs_TimeCode>?”.</hs_para>

clear that the Government are in fact doing quite a lot. Finance and
aid are being provided, and other Governments are being
urged to do likewise. We have undertaken to take in some Syrian
refugees. The UN Security Council has unanimously passed a resolution
calling for aid, opposing terrorist violence and calling for an end to
the carnage. “But what more can be done?”, we
ask.</hs_para>

is clear, however, is that military intervention is simply not an
option. The Commons decided against it and there is no indication that
other countries would agree to it. I support that entirely. I was
against the intervention in Iraq from the very beginning. What is the
point of getting rid of a dictator if those who take over afterwards
are just as bad, if not worse? This is what has happened in Iraq, where
there is still an unacceptable level of violence—and this after
a military intervention resulting in thousands of
deaths<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:08:09"></hs_TimeCode>. Work has
to be done with the international community and in particular with the
EU, the US and Russia. There has been some evidence that, despite its
problems in Ukraine, Russia is willing to try to bring pressure to bear

kind of eventual

very difficult matter. I was most interested to hear what the noble

<?notus-xml column=1061?>the regime has been assisting the Syrian regime in the current crisis.
The new President is allegedly more moderate, but the human rights
situation in the country continues to be bad, with many public

UN-protected camps in Iraq at the moment—Ashraf and
Liberty—but, unfortunately, because the present Iraqi regime has
extremist links with the Iranian Government, members of the camps have
been subjected to harassment and there has even been violence in which
some of them have been killed. A number of us protested about this at
the time and we continue to do so. I know that from time to time the
Government have raised objections about what is happening to these
vulnerable people. People in the Ashraf and Liberty camps are entitled
to protection and I hope that our Government will continue to press the
Iraqi and other Governments on that

to this as an indication of the many complexities existing in the
Middle East. People struggle for democracy and for the rights that we
take for granted, particularly for women. Traditions and culture are
difficult, and it takes a great deal of courage. I hope that we will
continue to assist those who democratically aim to achieve change. In
that respect I commend the Minister who recently made a speech in which
she urged tolerance on the two major competing groups in her own

what is happening in Syria, that is very important indeed and I thank
her for making those

as I said earlier, more international activity, pressure and aid are
necessary to bring an end to the dreadful carnage in Syria. An
immediate ceasefire, as recommended by one noble Lord, should be tried

suffering so badly. I support what the Government have been doing, but

Carlile of Berriew (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank the
Minister for initiating this very important debate and for doing so
with such concise clarity. I remind the House that I am the joint chair
of the Parliamentary Committee on Iran Freedom and that in a
professional capacity as a lawyer I have advised on connected matters.
I am aware that a lawyer stepping into a foreign policy debate may be
about as welcome as the converse in your Lordships’ House.
Nevertheless, I want to raise some issues on Syria, Iran and Iraq,
following on from the comments just made by the noble Baroness, Lady
Turner, with whom I
agree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000295" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000295">As far
as Syria is concerned, as I was thinking about this debate I reflected
on Syrians I have known in my life. They have been almost entirely
clever, enlightened and resourceful people. Then I reflected on the
experience of one of my daughters of being in the sixth form at a
school in central London with a popular and very able young student of
Syrian origins 
<?notus-xml column=1062?>who is in fact now the wife of President Assad. So some of these issues
of Syria come very close to our own experience and they are a shock to
us as well. It is indeed shocking that a country full of great history
and future potential should be ripped apart by the events that we
observe daily. The outrages of the Assad Government are there for us
all to see and wholly unjustified. However, we must be careful what we
wish
for.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000296">My
noble friend Lord Howell illustrated the complexity of the political
situation in Syria. The rise of heretical, violent jihadism there,
clearly financed and fuelled by the Government of Iran, presents a real
danger if there is to be regime change in Syria at some point in the
future. I also agree with what was said earlier: it is not for us or
for the Americans to determine what sort of regime they have if there
is a change in Syria, because our models are not necessarily suitable
for them, and I agree entirely with the realism expressed earlier by
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, on that
subject.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000297">It
is, of course, in the end for the people of Syria to determine what
Government they have, but whatever enabling we do must be aimed at
increasing the prospects of sound, enduring government—not
necessarily a western model—preferably secular but, above all,
pluralist and with a secure and internationally compliant legal system.
We all want to welcome Syria after a very long time back into the
family of nations with whom we can walk together, whether in the United
Nations or
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:15:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000298">I
turn next to Iran. Of course, I support, as I suspect everybody in this
House supports, the attempts to negotiate and negate the threat of
Iranian nuclear ambition. I share the assessment of the noble and
gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, on the importance of that process. I agree
with my noble friend Lord Lamont that it is important that there should
be business contacts, and they should be legitimate and carefully
scrutinised. Equally legitimate and important are sanctions where there
are appalling human rights breaches. Although other countries in the
world have similar levels of breaches of human rights, few countries
with the civilised traditions of Iran have such a high level of human
rights breaches. We see these breaches daily. More than 600 executions
have taken place in Iran in the past six months, most of them in
public—hanging people from cranes. Many of them have not
committed criminal offences that we would recognise. Some of them are
merely political dissidents. As recently as last Wednesday we heard an
announcement by the Ministry of Intelligence and Security in Iran that
appeared to commend cutting off one hand and one foot of a prisoner.
Surely those are practices that we not only condemn and abhor; they
should feature in our negotiations with Iran if there is to be any
genuineness in that
process<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:16:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000299">Nor
should we allow the impression that President Rouhani is some kind of
Iranian Gorbachev—a view that I believe is gathering credence.
He is not. His personal history as head of the security apparatus over
many years belies that assertion and the conduct of his Government does
not support that proposition. Can the Minister assure the House that
the strongest possible representations are being made to the 
<?notus-xml column=1063?>Government of Iran that these human rights abuses are not acceptable and
that one cannot simply look at the nuclear issue on its own? If Iran is
to be accepted into the family of nations, to which I referred earlier,
those human rights abuses have to be dealt with. My noble friend Lord
Lamont referred to the large number of American PhDs in the Iranian
Government. Even American PhDs allow one to understand that hanging
people in public from cranes for non-criminal offences is simply not
acceptable in a country that is negotiating with the western
world<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000300">Finally,
I turn to Iraq, particularly to the residents of Camp Liberty, and
formerly of Camp Ashraf, as mentioned earlier by the noble Lord, Lord
Maginnis, and the noble Baroness, Lady Turner. There are Iranian
dissidents in refuge in Camp Liberty in Iraq. They are persecuted
daily. This week they have been refused access by officials of the
Iraqi Government to medically prescribed therapy. In the past they have
been refused access to communications; they have been refused access to
water; they have had their defensive walls removed from around their
premises; there have been more than 150 assassinations there; and they
have been unprotected by the Iraqi Government. One well understands the
difficulty that the Iraqi Government face in relation to terrorism in
that country, but it is absolutely clear that Prime Minister al-Maliki
for this purpose is a client of the Government and regime of Iran. That
is why the residents of Camp Liberty are not being
protected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000413">They
do not want to stay there; they wish to go elsewhere. I have been to
Albania to meet some of them because Albania has allowed some 200
former Camp Ashraf residents to settle there. I have heard genuine and
moving testimonies from individuals. Most of them are middle-class
business and professional people, not firebrand revolutionaries. Quite
a few of them are old. They need to be treated on a humanitarian basis.
We are not treating them that way at the moment, nor are many other
countries. It is ironic that Albania is doing so; it is one of those
Governments that are treated with a good deal of disdain by the
Governments of the European Union. The residents have a complete lack
of protection. They are supposedly being looked after, to an extent, by
the United Nations, but United Nations officials—like
Macavity—are never there when critical events occur. As a

urge the Minister to declare very clearly to this House this afternoon
that the United Kingdom is in the forefront of international efforts to
save the lives of the residents of Camp Liberty and to give them a safe
haven elsewhere. I believe that Prime Minister Maliki does not wish to
remain a client of the Government of Iran but he needs an awful lot of
help if he is to be able to separate himself from the wishes of that
Government. If the Iranian regime has any interest in persuading us of
its earnest in meeting our concerns over nuclear and other issues,
surely the small question, in quantum terms, of the residents of Camp
Liberty is one on which they could demonstrate their earnest at no risk
to themselves and gain the respect of the rest of the world for their
change and their humanitarian approach. I ask our Government to use

Luce (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to follow those noble
Lords who have spoken in rather more strategic terms about the Middle
East. As we have been reminded, it is nearly 100 years since the
break-up of the Ottoman Empire—an empire that gave considerable
autonomy to Arab people in return for loyalty and for the payment of
the inevitable taxes. However, in the past 100 years, the Arab world
has undergone dramatic changes. If you look at the history of the Arabs
over centuries, I think that today they are at their lowest ebb

past<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:22:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000303" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000303">As
we have discussed so much today, Syria has become the cockpit of
regional tensions, exacerbating many of the undercurrents of tension
that already existed in the Middle East. The civil war there is just
another human tragedy of stark proportions. Currently, as I think we
have all agreed, there is a military stalemate after three years of
conflict. It is interesting to observe that since 1945 the average
length of civil wars has been 10 years. In the Lebanon, of course, it
was something like 15 years. In terms of deaths, there were 120,000
deaths in that time in the Lebanon. That has already been overtaken in
Syria. Then we have the country fragmentation in Syria broadly into
Sunni, Alawites and Kurds—who, of course, constitute something
of a challenge to the boundaries since there are some 25 million of
them in the
region<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:23:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000304">The
human tragedy of the refugees, of the internal displacements and of the
suffering of minorities such as the Christians, has provided a serious
challenge to the neighbouring states of Turkey, Lebanon, Iraq and
Jordan. Beyond that, we see Syria being used as a proxy battleground by
Iran and Saudi Arabia, vying for regional hegemony. We have all talked
about Sunni-Shia tensions and conflict. One is reminded of some of the
Christian wars that we saw in Europe, and of the infinite capacity of
religions to divide within themselves.</hs_para>

Sunni-Shia background, and her stressing that violent sectarianism is
anti-Islamic is an extremely important message to get across. I very

opposition to the destruction of the jihadis. We see China’s

about: dialogue with friends and exchanging views about our common

have done on the humanitarian side: £600 million is a
substantial sum of money. I fully support what we are doing. I

come to the question of Iran and Saudi Arabia; my noble and gallant
friend Lord Stirrup referred to this strongly and powerfully. There has
been a long history of mistrust between the West—certainly
Britain—and Iran. The nuclear discussion going on now provides
us with an opportunity to reduce that mistrust on both sides through
the negotiating process. Of course, we all hope for an agreement that
is as watertight as possible. I hope that some of the ideas that the
noble Lord, Lord Lamont, produced on that will be taken on board by the
Government to create confidence to move to a comprehensive

that, the question is whether Iran intends to be constructive or
destructive as a power in the Middle East. Its support for Assad in
Syria, and for Hezbollah, and the recent evidence of the use of
Hezbollah explosives in Bahrain, seriously undermines any hope of
stability. Kissinger once said that Iran would have to decide whether
it is a nation or a cause. The key to progress after a nuclear
agreement—in the hope that there will be a nuclear
agreement—will be that Iran will not only take a more
constructive line on Syria, but will enter into dialogue with Saudi
Arabia.</hs_para>

strongly, not only on Iran and Syria but 
<?notus-xml column=1066?>also in the Gulf. The British Government have pursued a very positive
policy of developing good personal relationships with the leaders in
the Gulf, through the Gulf Initiative. They are constructively helping
maintain the momentum towards reform in the fields of corruption, an
independent judiciary, representative institutions, and systems of
governance and accountability—systems that take into account the
history, culture and traditions of those

investigate police misconduct and setting up an independent national

preceded Islam. Therefore, those who in the name of Islam kill others

counterproductive. Already, Iranians are suffering. People are dying on

Bach (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Her Majesty’s Opposition
welcome this debate very much indeed. The Government are to be thanked
for finding time for it. The Minister should be congratulated on her
tour d’horizon at the start of this debate. She has been widely
praised, and rightly so, for the work that she does in this field both
in this House and outside. I am happy to join in with that praise. We
agree with much that the noble Baroness has said on behalf of Her
Majesty’s Government and when we come to those matters on which
we do not agree, a bit later in my speech, I am sure that she will take
note. This is not just a debate to hear Her Majesty’s
Government’s views or even those of the Opposition but to learn
and hear from all Members of this House, wherever they sit. We are
particularly blessed with expertise and what I would call good sense in
this field of foreign affairs. We have had further proof of that, if it
was necessary, in abundance today.</hs_para>

of thanks to those responsible in this case for the note and the
briefing pack from our own Library in the House of Lords. I do not know
how many noble Lords have had the opportunity of reading it. Even if
your Lordships do not have it now, it is well worth picking up from the
Library as it is well written and clear. It has been of considerable
help to me and, I suspect, to other noble Lords who have had the chance
to see it. My noble friend Lord Soley mentioned

tragedy that continues in Syria is of course the background to this
debate and it reaches over to many countries throughout the Middle
East, whether Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq or Turkey. That is obviously
because of the huge influx of refugees escaping a barbaric civil war,
while others are brought into this conflict by proxy, interest or
design. Syria is centre stage in this debate. Noble Lords have rightly
talked about other Middle Eastern countries in their speeches, so I
will make a couple of comments on these before concentrating, in what I
hope will be a fairly brief speech, on the Syrian question. Of course,
in some ways these distinctions are somewhat artificial as what happens
in one country—in this case particularly Syria—affects so
many others.</hs_para>

all I have to say from the Front Bench is that we fully back Secretary
of State John Kerry in his search for a negotiated settlement. We know
that the Government back him too. We particularly admire his

much to be regretted. We urge Her Majesty’s Government to
continue to give solid support, as we are sure they will, to the Kerry
initiative.</hs_para>

clear—her experience and knowledge of Egypt is obviously very

dealing with civil wars, the ordinary people of Syria. The number of
those who have died, fled to neighbouring countries or been displaced
in their own country is very hard to take in. I am grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord Alton, and other noble Lords for giving us those

refugees continuing to arrive and with economic, political and social
problems of their own, must never be underrated by us. In this

British Government have been generous in the aid they have provided,

also been right to back the Geneva II process. Congratulations and
great thanks are due to Ambassador Brahimi and others for the
incredible efforts that have been made in that regard. Although the new
rounds of talks met with really no success at all earlier this month,
no one believed that progress would have instant results. Indeed, the
agreement made in the first round, on evacuating innocent citizens, was
potentially of some significance, and it needs to be referred to.
However, our belief on this side is that it is essential to set up, as
a matter of some urgency, a contact group made up of countries that
have a stake and interest in the war in Syria. At the moment, a proxy
war is taking place. Surely if we want to see a realistic chance of a
ceasefire—and all noble Lords 
<?notus-xml column=1070?>want to see that happen—it is vital to bring together the United
States, Russia, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and other countries. Many
noble Lords spoke of this. Many noble Lords also urged that Russia
should be more a part of any talks that take place with regard to the
Syrian war. Many suggested that Iran also should play a part. Saudi
Arabia, obviously on the other side, should do so, too. I noticed
particularly that the Foreign Secretary said in another place on Monday
that he was not opposed in principle to such a group. To us it seems a
sensible and timely action. Britain would be particularly well placed
to instigate such a move and we think that it should happen soon.

of this in my opening remarks, more than 9.3 million people are being

which now stands at £600 million, which is three times the size
of its response to any other humanitarian crisis. Our support has
reached hundreds of thousands of people across 14 areas of Syria and in
countries around the region: Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq and Turkey. UK aid
supports food and water for millions of people, as well as medical
consultations. However, the right reverend Prelate was right to ask how
we can move from this towards a ceasefire. That is why we were so
strongly supportive of the Geneva II process. As I said at this
Dispatch Box before, that was the only show in town—the only

delays are affecting the timetable for the removal of chemical weapons,

regime’s responsibility to comply with the UN Security Council
resolution by eliminating all its chemical weapons, materiel and
equipment in the first half of 2014. The resolution imposes binding and
enforceable obligations on the regime to comply, with the threat of
action under Chapter VI of the UN charter if it does not. It also
stipulates that those responsible for any use of chemical 
<?notus-xml column=1072?>weapons must be held accountable. So that is a binding and enforceable
obligation with which the Syrian regime has to comply, and there will
be further action if those deadlines are not met. It is interesting to

capacity to remove that material, but OPCW has said that Syria has

Northover (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, with the leave of the House, I
beg to move the six Motions standing in my name on the Order Paper en
bloc. Both this House and the other place overwhelmingly supported the
passage of the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act. The Bill was fully
debated in detail, passed through all its parliamentary stages with
overwhelming support in both Houses, and received Royal Assent on 17
July 2013. The passage of the Act was a historic moment, delivering, at
last, full legal equality for lesbians and gay men in England and
Wales. As such, it is a 
<?notus-xml column=1076?>hallmark of the fair and inclusive society that we all wish to see. The
Act, quite simply, extends the important institution of marriage to
same sex couples, ending the unfairness which has prevented people from
marrying simply because of their sexual
orientation<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000366" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000366">Noble<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:09:19"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords will recall that in our debates during the Act’s passage,
some were worried that it would change the nature of marriage in some
way<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:09:32"></hs_TimeCode>. However, we
made it clear then, and I am happy to make it clear again now, that the
Act does not affect marriage as it currently exists between
opposite-sex couples in any way at all. Nor does it affect the
understanding of marriage held by many religious organisations and
individuals that marriage should only be between one man and one woman.
The Government entirely accept and respect that view of marriage, and
the quadruple lock of religious protections in the Act ensures that no
religious organisation or representative can be compelled in any way to
participate in the marriage of a same-sex couple against their
beliefs.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022779000367" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000367">The
Act does not change marriage but simply opens it up to more couples;
that is the basis on which it secured wide agreement on all Benches in
your Lordships’ House. The statutory instruments we are
considering today simply give effect to the matters we have already
agreed in the Act. These six affirmative instruments, along with the
six negative instruments laid on 23 January and 13 February,
are concerned only with the practical implementation of the
Act’s provisions that will make marriage a reality for same-sex
couples in England and Wales.</hs_para>

each of the affirmative instruments in turn. The Marriage (Same Sex
Couples) Act 2013 (Consequential and Contrary Provisions and Scotland)
Order 2014 does three main things. First, in Schedule 1, it
makes amendments to primary legislation that are consequential on the
coming into force of the 2013 Act, the Civil Partnership Act
2004 and the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 2008. These
amendments give effect to the central aim of the 2013
Act—that the existing institution of marriage should be extended
to same-sex couples. That general position is achieved, in the main,
through provisions in the Act which we refer to as the
gloss—Section 11(1) and (2) and Schedule
3—which provide that references to marriage in existing law will
be read as including the marriage of a same-sex couple, and a reference
to a married person is to be read as including a reference to a person
married to someone of the same sex.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022779000369" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000369">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:12:33"></hs_TimeCode>,
in some cases there is also a need to make a consequential change to
the law to ensure that the correct result is achieved so that the
marriage of same-sex couples has the same effect as the marriage of
opposite-sex couples. This is the case where there are historical
gender-based differences and we need to equalise provision between
married opposite-sex couples in order to treat all married people in
the same way. In some cases we are also correcting minor omissions made
when the Civil Partnership Act was brought into
force.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022779000370" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022779000370">We have
always been clear that there are exceptions to this general approach,
where for practical reasons married same-sex couples will be treated
differently from married opposite-sex couples. In these cases we 
<?notus-xml column=1077?>therefore need to make provision that is contrary to the gloss in order
to achieve the right result, so the second thing that this order does
this is to make contrary provision in Schedule 2. This approach is
needed where the Government’s policy is that married same-sex
couples should be treated in the same way as civil partners rather than
married opposite-sex couples, and where historical gender-specific
provisions are to be maintained. For example, we agreed this approach
during the passage of the Act in relation to pension survivor
benefits—although noble Lords will recall that we also committed
to reviewing that position, and I will return to that review later.
Schedule 3 to the order then makes textual amendments to existing
provisions where this is needed to make the effect of the law on
different couples completely

to the registration for the solemnisation of same-sex marriages of
formally shared religious buildings—that is, those with
agreements under the Sharing of Church Buildings Act 1969—in
Schedule 1 to the Act. These regulations apply the agreed approach in
the case of religious buildings that are informally shared. They deal

enable marriages of same-sex couples to take place in informally shared
places of worship according to religious rites other than those of the
Church of England and Church of Wales, but only if the governing

given consent to the building being registered for the marriages of
same sex-couples. Sharing religious organisations can give consent to
the use of the premises for marriages of same sex-couples by other
sharers while still refusing to conduct such marriages themselves, and
they can withhold their consent to the registration of the building if
they wish, in which case no marriages of same sex-couples can take
place there. The regulations also deal with the process to be followed
where a religious building that is registered for the marriage of
same-sex couples becomes shared, or where a shared religious building

Marriage of Same Sex Couples (Use of Armed Forces’ Chapels)
Regulations 2014, which set out procedures for the Secretary of State
to register and cancel the registration of Armed Forces’ chapels
for marriage of same-sex couples. The regulations provide that, before
applying to the Registrar General to register a military chapel for
marriage of same-sex couples, the Secretary of State must consult the
relevant governing authority of any religious organisation that makes
significant use of the chapel. When considering whether and when to
make an application, the Secretary of State must take into account
various matters, including a same-sex couple who wish to have their
marriage solemnised in the chapel and the rights of the religious

where one of the parties is a member of the Armed Forces, a civilian

has given consent in writing. The couple will need to nominate the part
of the United Kingdom according to whose law they wish to marry. It
allows religious rites to be used, but religious ceremonies for
same-sex couples can be conducted only if the relevant religious
organisation has opted in and the authorised person is willing to be

for the couple to nominate the relevant part of the UK under whose law

touch briefly on some issues that are not covered in these instruments
but in which I know that some noble Lords are particularly interested.
First, some have asked when couples who are in civil partnerships will
be able to convert their civil partnership into marriage. Our priority
has always been to ensure that same-sex couples who are not currently
in a civil partnership and who have been waiting to marry in order to
formalise their relationship are able to do so at the earliest possible
opportunity. I am delighted that we are now doing that earlier than we
anticipated, so that the first same-sex weddings will be able to take
place on 29
March<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:20:22"></hs_TimeCode>. We
understand that some couples in a civil partnership want to be able to
convert their civil partnership into a marriage quickly, and we are

working hard to implement the provisions in the Act which, for the
first time, will allow people to change their legal gender without
having to end their marriage, where both spouses want the marriage to
continue. Again, we aim to do this before the end the

the Government to undertake three reviews, and the House might find it
helpful to know about the progress on these. First, Section 14 of the
Act requires us to review whether non-religious belief organisations,
such as humanists, should be able to conduct legally valid marriages of
both same-sex and opposite-sex couples. As part of the review, we will
work with interested belief organisations, including the British
Humanist Association, and will carry out a full public consultation on
the issues involved. We expect to publish a report setting out the
outcome of the review by the end of 2014, as required by the

Section 15 of the Act requires a review of the operation and future of

would say to me that it is not right to let this moment pass without
reflecting on some of the not so positive changes in the law that have

would be in prison for seven years for the speeches that we make today
or for the speeches that we made during the passage of the same-sex
marriage Bill, and there would be life imprisonment for many of us who
are gay. Publishing the names of gay activists in the national
newspaper as a way of inciting violence and endangering the lives of
those brave men and women is disgusting and we should all condemn it.
Also, for the gay men and women in India, the High Court’s
decision to recriminalise homosexuality must be a real blow. We should
think, too, of the gay men and women in Russia who are being violently
victimised by new laws.

have done this, if not at the same time, at least no more than a few

are coming to the end of a very long legislative journey. It began in
2002 when my noble friend Lord Lester drafted the first civil
partnership legislation, which was withdrawn but was then swiftly taken
up and adopted by the then Labour Government, for which they deserve
enormous credit. It continued with my right honourable friend in
another place, Nick Clegg, in early 2010 stating his position that
there should be equal marriage. He was closely and swiftly followed by
David Cameron, who deserves enormous credit. My redoubtable colleague,
Lynne Featherstone, notwithstanding the fact that this was not in the
coalition agreement, announced in 2011 that there would be a

through that process so ably by the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell of

recent discordant note, from the House of Bishops Pastoral Guidance on
Same Sex Marriage, issued on 15 February. It was a somewhat dispiriting
announcement, and we have to accept that for our colleagues who are
members of the Church of England and the Church in Wales, their road to
equal treatment will be longer and tougher than they had perhaps
expected. I say to the bishops that the default position in the
legislation throughout our discussions was that those religions that
did not wish to recognise or to celebrate same-sex marriage would not
have to do so. At every point that was conceded. Throughout our debates
on the subject, those of us who believe the church’s position to
be wrong held our peace, and we have still not had that

the bishops will understand and respect that even in these statutory

dialogue with those members who do not yet formally support them. The
noble Lord, Lord Alli is right. The legislation for those of us who
have the great luck to live in this

an interest in that I have been in a civil partnership since the very
first day it was possible. My husband and I were incredibly proud when
we were able to do that. We had planned the ceremony for 12 months
previously but, ironically, the delays in this House delayed our
ability to set the date that we wanted, which was on my birthday. As it
happened, my birthday fell on the day when civil partnerships came into
force, so we were able to do that. However, my husband has said to me
in the strongest possible terms, “Why can’t we get
married? It has been in the papers, it has been announced and our
families are ringing us up. My niece and nephew spoke to me only last
week and asked why we can’t get married”. At one point,
my husband suggested—my noble friend Lord Alli knows
this—“Let’s get divorced so that we can get
married”; I managed to put him off. Some friends of ours who had
been in a civil partnership—again, my noble friend Lord Alli
knows these people—were so confident and so proud that they
proposed to each other on Christmas Day, invited 
<?notus-xml column=1084?>all their friends from New York to come over in March and even booked
the hotel. Then they discovered that they would not be able to marry

do not want to be churlish because it is fantastic news that the date
has been brought forward. It is fantastic that we will see the first
same-sex couples getting married so soon. However, I must associate my
remarks with those of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. Why does it take so
long to organise allowing people to convert their civil partnerships
into marriage? I am pleased to see the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell,
who did such a fantastic job in pushing the Bill through Parliament,
here. She knows that I raised at the very first stage the question of
when we would be able to have a ceremony to convert our civil
partnerships into marriages. She gave me those assurances and I know
that the assurances are there. Will the Minister, in her response,
please do more than say, “We hope by the end of the
year”? Will she set a date as quickly as possible? It does not
matter when that date is. We are like other people who get married in
that it takes a bit of planning—in my husband’s case, a
lot of planning—and we need to book things. So will the Minister
please set the date, so that I can set the

the fact that the statement was issued on 14 February.

different.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000003">The
next thing to say is that, without any sense of disloyalty to the
college to which I belong, there was a variety of opinion on how we
approach the problem. It is a problem because we are dealing with a
very long tradition, set out in the Book of Common Prayer. For a church
that has a tradition that now goes back 450 years in what it
has been saying about marriage, to move in a significantly different
direction is a significant shift. There will be a variety of opinions,
but that is an
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000004">The
second issue refers to what the noble Lord, Lord Alli, was touching on.
We are part of a worldwide communion. One very difficult thing for a
worldwide communion is somehow to balance being sensitive to different
cultural values in different places. By different cultural values, I do
not mean repressive measures being passed in Acts by Governments, which
none of us would support. That puts us in a particularly difficult
position, because all the time we are trying to ensure that we listen
to what people here are saying and what people’s consciences
here are saying but, at the same time, to stay with the
communion.</hs_para>

in a different place from where we are, and we are not going to take a
hard line on this at the moment”. We have not yet got to that
position in the communion. For me to stay other than loyal
to the House of Bishops’ statement would be more than
irresponsible, because I know that one real concern is that it is not
just about us and the Church of England, it is also about the Anglican
communion. That is a key issue, and may not have been made quite as

Minister notice of a few questions, some of which have already been
asked today. First, of course, how soon can the conversion of a civil
partnership to a same-sex marriage take place and what timetable might
achieve that? The Act provides for same-sex couples seeking to convert
civil partnerships into marriages to do so, as well as for an
opposite-sex married couple 
<?notus-xml column=1087?>to remain married where one of the partners wishes to change
gender—an important matter which we dealt with last summer.
These are provisions which the update says should come into force by
the end of the year. I would be grateful if the Minister could give
some indication of when further necessary legislation will be brought
forward, as well as providing an update on when we might expect to see
these provisions come into force.</hs_para>

of the Scottish Act, if a trans person living in England or Wales
wishes to get married and wants to ensure that they could not later be
subject to spousal veto when applying for gender recognition while in
that marriage, they could well be able to circumvent this process by
opting to get married in Scotland—but why should they? Can the
Minister explain whether a couple whose marriage was registered in
Scotland but who subsequently lived in England would be able to apply
to the sheriff courts for their interim GRC, or will the Government
review and revise this entire area so that they do not need
to do so?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000019">At

legal jurisdictions, including Scotland, allow gender recognition
without requiring the consent of the trans person’s spouse. We
discussed this issue during the passage of the Bill but it is not
covered, obviously, by these orders. Does the Minister at least accept
that this issue does not sit well with the drive for equality for all
groups? Will she therefore seek to continue working on this to make the
changes that trans people want to see?</hs_para>

year. However, is a consultation going to take place? As far as I am
aware, as yet there is no public consultation being issued by the
Department for Work and Pensions. Given that there are only 18 weeks
left between now and when the review is supposed to be complete, what
is going to happen and how might that consultation take place? Indeed,
if it is to be launched, can the Minister offer an assurance that the
Government will not simply be listening to the occupational pensions
industry, which will quite clearly have strong and shared financial
interests in this report saying one thing, and that there will be a
consultation which listens to and consults independent

over the past week following the conclusion of a case under the
Employment Appeal Tribunal, which found that it was legal under
European law for employers and pension scheme trustees to

adopt different positions towards the marriage of same-sex couples. If
the results of the consultation favour the beliefs of faiths that do

automatically trump the other, as it has done elsewhere in this

made if there are two different faiths using one building or chapel and

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to all the noble Lords
who have contributed to this debate. I thank the noble Lords for their
tributes, their thanks and, above all, for working together on this. It
has been incredibly heart-warming to work on this Act and to be taking
through these SIs now. As my noble friend Lady
B<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T18:03:57"></hs_TimeCode>arker has said,
what a joy it was to wear the pink carnations of the noble Lord,
Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T18:03:59"></hs_TimeCode> Alli, and
to go outside and be serenaded by the London Gay Men’s Chorus.
It really was a tremendous joy. Extending marriage to same-sex couples
is about righting a historical unfairness. The principles and arguments
for doing this have already been fully debated and supported by both
Houses and the Act is on the statute book.</hs_para>

remember that there were majorities for this legislation in every group
in this House. My noble friend Lord Jenkin reminded us of that. They
may also remember—I analysed it at the time—that there
was a very interesting gender difference in our voting patterns. Among
women who voted at Second Reading, 83% thought that the Bill should
proceed, while 17% dissented. May I suggest to the noble Lord, Lord
Collins, that he consider us all as bridesmaids? I am sure we would
enjoy it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000031">I
noted the generosity of spirit that was shown, especially in the later
stages of the Bill, by those for whom this legislation was a very
difficult challenge. I commend them for that generosity of spirit. I
echo what the noble Lord, Lord Alli, said in this regard and what the
right reverend Prelate has just said.</hs_para>

hope, when I introduced this debate, these orders simply implement the
decisions we made during the passage of the Act. They make sensible
arrangements for the treatment of marriages of same-sex couples in a
range of legislation. I went over the details in my
introduction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000033">I
shall address some of the points made by noble Lords. My noble friend
Lord Jenkin asked me to provide more detail on what processes and
procedures are required before couples can convert their civil
partnership into marriage, and I heard what the noble Lord, Lord
Collins, said about his husband’s anxiety that we proceed
extremely speedily. Briefly, the procedures and processes that we are
looking at are changing various IT systems used by the General Register
Office. I realise that this is not very romantic information, and
neither are the other bits here. There is also delivering guidance and
training to operational staff for making legislative changes and
designing new application forms and certificates. Although these things
are under way, I know that noble Lords will appreciate that they all
take time. The conversion process will ensure that the rights and
responsibilities of a couple in a civil partnership are
protected—so do not get divorced—when they convert their
relationship into a 
<?notus-xml column=1090?>marriage. The effect of the conversion will be that they will be treated
as if their marriage started on the date that their civil partnership
was formed, although it sounds as if the noble Lord may be celebrating
two dates in future. This is important for the couple, so we need to
ensure that the new legal and administrative arrangements work
properly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000034">My
noble friend Lord Jenkin asked whether further orders will be required.
I can confirm that various further pieces of secondary legislation will
be required. I am sure that noble Lords look forward to discussing
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000035">My noble
friend asked about delays and about when people in a civil partnership
die before they have managed to convert their relationship into a
marriage. We completely understand that couples in this difficult
situation want to be able to fulfil their dream of being married, and
we are working hard to make that possible as soon as we can. I remind
my noble friend that the legal rights of such couples are assured by
their civil partnership, so there will be no practical detriment to
them by being civil partners rather than a married couple. However, we
hear what noble Lords had to say. We are glad that they are pleased
that we have managed to bring forward this date, and we are working
very speedily to address the other issues. I will certainly feed back
the points that noble Lords have made, especially the one made by the
noble Lord, Lord Collins, that he needs to know what the date might
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000036">The noble

survivor benefits that I mentioned in my introductory remarks. I can
confirm that the review is under way and the terms of reference have
been published in the Libraries of both Houses. The Department for Work
and Pensions and the Treasury are assessing the costs involved with any
changes to the arrangements in public service and private occupational
schemes. I spoke to my honourable friend Steve Webb about this the
other day. They are also making arrangements to consult external
stakeholders in line with the requirements of the Act. I assure the
noble Baroness that these stakeholders will include representatives of
the LGB community and trade unions as well as pension trustees,
industry bodies and parliamentarians with a key interest in this
review. We are continuing to make arrangements over the next few weeks
so that the consultation begins in March. There are a number of issues
that it needs to cover and a final report will be published on 1 July.

noble Baroness also asked about a transgender person who might seek to
marry in Scotland and whether they would be subject to a
“spousal veto” when applying for gender recognition. She
flagged up a difference in the Scottish legislation. She asked whether
a couple whose marriage was registered in Scotland but who subsequently
lived in England would be able to apply to the sheriff court for their
interim gender recognition certificate and whether we would review that
area. From the outset I will be clear that there is no spousal veto in
the Act that we passed. Regardless of a spouse’s views, all
applicants will be able to obtain their gender recognition. The
Scottish system will work in a very similar way to the English system
in most respects: couples who wish to stay together following gender
recognition will each need to complete statutory declarations to that
effect. If a statutory declaration is not received from the non-trans
spouse, the gender recognition panel will issue an interim gender
recognition certificate, which will enable proceedings to be brought to
end the marriage.</hs_para>

Act differs from our own Act in that applicants in a marriage
registered in Scotland will have the option of applying to the sheriff
court for their full gender recognition certificate before their
marriage has ended. Applicants in England and Wales will have to wait
until their marriage is ended to obtain their full certificate. In
those circumstances there will be no automatic entitlement to a new
marriage certificate and the non-trans spouse will be able to use the
issue of the interim gender recognition as a ground for divorce
indefinitely.</hs_para>

matrimonial proceedings depends primarily on whether a couple is able
to establish the necessary connection with the country in which the
couple is applying. In England and Wales the jurisdiction rules are set
out in the Domicile and Matrimonial Proceedings Act 1973, as amended by
the 2013 Act. In every case it will depend on the couple’s
circumstances as to which court will have the jurisdiction to hear the
proceedings. Following implementation of our Act, I assure the noble
Baroness that we have committed to monitor the position and we will
continue to consider very carefully any further evidence that
trans-stakeholders and, indeed, anyone else affected
provides.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022795000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000042">The
noble Baroness asked me about a situation that may arise in Scotland in
which civil partnerships or civil unions established in a foreign
country are converted to a marriage in Scotland and whether they will
be recognised as marriages in England and Wales. The Scottish
Government will be consulting on this issue and we will of course work
very closely with them to ensure that the law across the UK is coherent
and help them to implement their own Bill. It is too soon to anticipate
what may happen as a result of that.</hs_para>

asked about guidance and training in support of the Act. A
wide range of public and internal staff guidance is being produced by
various organisations, including the General Register
Office, the Department for Work and Pensions and NGOs such
as the Equality and Human 
<?notus-xml column=1092?>Rights Commission, Stonewall and Citizens Advice. The guidance covers a
range of practical, legal, operational and other issues and
is aimed at a variety of audiences. We are confident that there will be
sufficient information for those wishing to marry, register buildings,
appoint authorised persons and so on, to find out what they
need to know. For example, the General Register Office has produced and
is producing a variety of guidance and training materials in different
formats for registration staff in local authorities, in addition to
information and guidance on how to register buildings to faith groups
and the public. I pay tribute to Ben Summerskill, as did the noble
Lord, Lord Alli, for his indomitable work in that area. Stonewall has
produced guidance for same-sex couples considering marriage and
converting their civil partnership to a marriage, which covers their
rights and responsibilities and the steps that they need to take when
arranging a marriage, and the Equality and Human Rights Commission will
also produce a range of guidance. I hope that the husband of the noble
Lord, Lord
Collins<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T18:15:02"></hs_TimeCode>, will

military chapels, the noble Baroness asked me if it is possible for a
veto to be exercised as regards what happens within a military chapel
for a same-sex couple. With the exception of chapels which are
consecrated, the Secretary of State must be able to exercise their
discretion, so there can be no absolute power of veto over the decision
on registration. However, the regulations are clear as to the matters
to which the Secretary of State must have clear regard. Important
considerations will be the views of the religious organisations that
are significant regular users of the chapel, and the availability of a
chaplain who is willing to conduct the wedding of
a same-sex couple and who belongs to a religious
organisation that has opted in. Currently, none of the religious
organisations that license chaplains to serve with the Armed Forces has
announced its intention to opt into the marriage of same-sex couples.
The 2013 Act is clear in requiring the consent of both the religious
organisation whose rites would be used and the minister of religion
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T18:16:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022795000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-0002.htm#14022795000045">In
drawing to a close I will return to the reasons we so
overwhelmingly agreed the passage of the Marriage (Same Sex
Couples) Act last year. The removal of the final barrier to full
legislative equality for lesbian and gay people by giving them access
to the institution of marriage is a moment we can all be proud to have
been part of—and that has certainly been echoed today. We have
done this in a way which protects and promotes the religious freedom of
those who believe that marriage can only be between a man and a woman,
and of that we can also be proud.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T18:16:37"></hs_TimeCode> am confident

that there is an effective regulator of charities. We had the welcome
news this week from the Charity Commission that the income of charities
in England and Wales has risen by almost £3 billion and now
surpasses £61 billion. That is a lot of public money
sitting in trust, and the organisations to which it is entrusted have
the right to show that they are worthy of that
trust<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000005">Today’s
debate is an opportunity for Members of your Lordships’ House,
with their long and distinguished experience in these matters, to think
about ways in which we can rebuild confidence in the Charity
Commission’s regulation of charities. It is not an opportunity
for another bout of the favourite sport of bashing the commission.
Noble Lords will remember that last year the commission appeared before
the Public Accounts Committee, which asked the National Audit Office to
review the commission’s effectiveness as a regulator and report
back. The PAC produced a report written in characteristically scathing
terms. It is a shame that the precision and forcefulness of its
forensic examination and questioning was followed by a set of rather
unclear and unhelpful suggestions for the commission. It would have
been more helpful if the PAC had given a clear indication of exactly
how it wished the commission to fulfil its functions in
future<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:03:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

report, the <I>Regulatory Effectiveness of the Charity Commission</I>,
was published on 4 December, along with its report on the
commission’s handling of the Cup Trust. Those reports do not
make for easy reading but they make plain that the problems that the
commission now faces are longstanding and are not the fault of the
current officers of the commission, or indeed their immediate
predecessors<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:03:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000007">It
is helpful to look briefly at the history of this issue to understand
why some of those underlying problems have arisen. In the mid-1990s,
charities grew substantially as providers of public services under
contract. In 1996 the NCVO produced the Deakin report, which stated
that in order to have a vibrant voluntary sector there had to be robust
regulation, a clear role for the regulator and a clear legal framework
within which the regulator and charities could operate with confidence.
In 2001 the NCVO returned to the issue and produced a report entitled
<I>F</I><I>or the</I><I> Public Benefit</I>?, which, again, stated the
need for a clear legal framework and, in particular, for there to be
clear guidance about what is and is not a charity. That led to the 2004
Charities Bill. Many of your Lordships sat in this room throughout 2005
during the passage of that Bill and had yet more discussions on key
issues such as: what is public benefit? I have to say that the decision
of Parliament to leave the matter of what is public benefit to be
decided by case law presents the commission with an ongoing and
enduring problem in delivering its role as a
regulator<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:05:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the position where the commission has had its budget reduced by
one-third and, as ever, there are arguments about the way in which it
has gone about pursuing particular cases. However, it is clear that we
need to help the commission to recover ground and confidence. I work
with lots of organisations, and the best of them—it does not
matter which sector they are in: public, private or voluntary—do
three things: they have a clear vision of what they are trying to
achieve, they have the information that they need to fulfil that
vision, and they have excellent relationships with other organisations.
Were we to look at the commission in terms of those three issues, that
might help us, the Government and the commission to see our way
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:06:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

a lack of clarity about what the commission’s job is. Following
the strategic review of the commission a couple of years ago, everyone
has now agreed that its principal role is to be a regulator; that is
the unique role that it can fulfil. However, what do we want it to
regulate—simply charity law, compliance with charity law, or the
increasingly individual charities? In certain parts of government, I
think that there is a view that we should have a de minimis regulator
along the lines of the FCA, which simply regulates compliance. I do not
think that is right. We have the most advanced, complex and vibrant
voluntary sector in the world, and we need a regulator that is much
more proactive about setting standards of good governance and trust. We
need the Charity Commission to regulate within that
framework<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

relationships with other organisations, I have always had a feeling
that the commission is a somewhat distant and aloof organisation. In
these 
<?notus-xml column=371?>times of straitened economics, the commission needs to be far more adept
at developing good strategic relationships with other organisations. It
ought to proactively signpost charities and the million trustees who
use its services to go to other organisations for top-quality
information and advice. It has always been reticent about doing that in
the past.</hs_para>

principal issue on which there could be a steer from government is the
relationship between the commission and other regulators. The report
into the Cup Trust has shown clearly that HMRC was at fault. From the
beginning, it was clearly an issue of tax evasion and should have been
dealt with primarily by HMRC, with some assistance from the Charity
Commission on its areas of specialism. In future, that is what the
commission should do with all regulators. The onus should be on other
regulators, and the Charity Commission should be a specialist back-up
point<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:08:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000012">In
the very little time remaining, I want to say one thing. The budget of
the commission has been cut; we all hear about that endlessly. The
Government should make one piece of investment: in the
commission’s digital strategy. I am sad enough that I use the
Charity Commission’s register all the time. It is incredibly
clunky; you have to really know what you are looking for. In this day
and age, it does not answer the strategic needs of anyone—of
government or of the sector. The single most important thing that could
be done to encourage public trust in charities—that is what this
has all really got to be about—is to require any organisation
that calls itself a charity to have the most simple of websites, on
which it must have its annual report, its governing document, its
latest accounts and its statement of activities. If the Charity
Commission were in a position to actively promote digital transparency
throughout the sector, far fewer problems would end up at its door. The
noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, was absolutely right. There
are 175,000 registered charities, and a greater number of very small
organisations that call themselves charities but are not registered.
The commission alone cannot police every one of them but, with the help
of the Government, who are currently pursuing their own digital
strategy, it can drive up standards of transparency and accountability.
I hope that we will focus on that
today.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/BDFE49B6895383E2C943AF47CEFCEE57538B1433" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2014">Thursday,

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:32:23"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I must
first declare an interest. Members of my family remain within the
religious group which has been the subject of much controversy with the
Charity Commission, namely the Exclusive Brethren. I thank my noble
friend Lady Barker for securing this debate. It is clear that the
future effectiveness of the Charity Commission will involve the
investigation of charities such as this. This needs resources, and
clearly £137 per charity is not sufficient. As one pays for the
issue of court proceedings and to get a passport, I do not think that
there is anything objectionable in the Charity Commission charging for
the services it offers.</hs_para>

leadership of William Shawcross, I believe that the commission is more
effective and a new day is dawning. In what may seem to colleagues 
<?notus-xml column=372?>like an Oscars speech, I thank him and Kenneth Dibble for their unique
finding concerning the alleged group which I have mentioned. They
found,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="14022777000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000258">“on
balance, that there were elements of detriment and harm which emanated
from doctrine and practices of the Brethren and which had a negative
impact on the wider community as well as
individuals”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="14022777000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000222">The
actual doctrines and harsh disciplinary practices were the issue this
alleged church had to address. It was made to amend its trust deed, and
will be reviewed in a year’s time to see if its behaviour has
changed. This finding is an important acknowledgment of the mental,
emotional and financial suffering of ex-members of this group, which is
controlled from Australia by universal leader Bruce Hales. I thank
ex-members of the group who bravely came to Parliament recently to tell
their testimonies. The mental health implications were obvious to
colleagues of living in a system where people are told, “We will
do the thinking, you do the doing”. In this system people risk
being separated from their family if they even own a phone from
Carphone Warehouse, or go away to university. People work for a
Brethren-owned company, so for some gaining their freedom meant losing
their home and their job as well as members of their family, even their
own
children.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14022777000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000015">I
previously called for a church-led inquiry, as I was aware of the
wonderful pastoral support being given to ex-Brethren in many churches.
However, I was naive. As my noble friend Lady Brinton and I stuck our
heads above the parapet others ducked for cover, perhaps sensibly.
Sadly, the Christian lobby fraternity have clearly brought this group
under their umbrella, despite my repeated requests not to do so. I
quote from the Evangelical Alliance in November
2012:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14022777000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000247">“This

2014, it was called a Brethren church by the Christian Institute.
Neither of those groups has thanked the Charity Commission for exposing
the victims’ stories, nor made them available for their many
supporters to read. Nor are my speeches or those of my noble friend
referenced. This does not reflect the Christians who support these
groups, who I believe would give—even sacrificially—to
help ex-members, particularly those who need legal fees to obtain
contact with their children who remain in the group. Christians must
always condemn groups such as this one, where there are allegations of
racism, persecution of homosexuals and separation of families. They
must never reserve criticism only for the Charity Commission’s
assessment of the public benefit
test.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14022777000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000016">However,
a more effective Charity Commission will mean more work for the
Government and for HMRC. The following issues arise from this effective
investigation. Are the Government really content with a public benefit
law which allows a group causing such detriment and harm to be a
charity? Is this decision being considered by the Department for
Communities and Local Government for its cohesion implications? Just
imagine if there were allegations that imams dealt out such sanctions
if their people did not purchase their mobile phone from a company
whose directors were also the mosque committee, so that their calls
could be monitored. I have seen such
technology<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:14:48"></hs_TimeCode>. Is

chilling of all, this group runs its own schools. It does not recruit:
you are born and educated into it. If this group is not a
church—which I maintain strongly that it is not—then its
nature is a matter of serious concern. As a friend of the Charity
Commission, I believe that it needs to show that its annual review has
teeth. As the right honourable Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Public
Administration Select Committee, asked of Mr Shawcross, the changes for
this group should be not superficial but

congratulate the noble Baroness on securing this debate. She will not
be surprised to see that the usual suspects are gathered here
today—that is, those noble Lords with an interest in and
commitment to the charitable sector. For most of us it is a commitment
of many years’ standing. I certainly remember the Deakin

us can therefore deny that the way in which the Charity Commission has
been operating in recent times has been a cause for concern. The series
of reports mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, make dismal
reading. The PAC report of 5 February this year concludes in
no uncertain terms that the commission continues to perform poorly and
is failing to regulate charities effectively. The reasons for this have
been well rehearsed. It has been too slow; too reactive rather than
proactive; too narrow and legalistic in its approach to regulation;
and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker, clearly stated, there has been
confusion about its primary purpose. Is it there to support the
voluntary sector or to protect the public
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:17:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000022">In
addition there has been a constant problem with resources. Is the
commission being asked to do too much with too little? Undoubtedly the
commission, like much of the charitable sector, has taken a severe
financial hit in recent times and has had to reduce staff
drastically<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:17:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000023">Much
controversy has surrounded the commission, not helped perhaps by
changes of personnel at the top. The appointment of a new chief
executive—which I understand will shortly be
announced—will be of the utmost importance. It is vital that
this person has the skills and experience to enable the commission to
fulfil its important role, to be clear about its mission and to provide
authoritative leadership, especially in developing strategic
alliances<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:18:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000024">It
is certain that, in spite of the controversy, there is universal
agreement within the sector that it needs an independent and effective
regulator which focuses entirely 
<?notus-xml column=374?>on charities. For example, trusts and foundations which give grants to
other charities have to give due diligence, and the less the Charity
Commission does the more the trusts and foundations have to do. So
there may be duplicated effort using donated money rather than the
public money which enables the Charity Commission to do this kind of
due diligence on which trusts and foundations and others who give money
were habitually able to rely. It is vital that we continue with
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:18:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000025">Therefore
the Charity Commission’s move to take firmer, swifter action
with the few charities which offend—we should remember that,
although there have been serious cases, few charities offend—and
its desire to enhance further its legal powers has met with nothing but
support from the charitable sector. Better use of data, as the noble
Baroness reminded us, and closer working with HMRC are also moves in
the right direction. The Government would be well advised to banish all
thoughts of merger with HMRC, should they have such thoughts, which I
hope they have not. If the Charity Commission continues with its
programme of reform and delivers the changes it is promising, the
Government must do their part to ensure that they provide realistic
funding for this important—indeed
vital—organisation.</hs_para><hs_time UID="14022777000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000278">1.19

as there is zero tolerance of homosexuality in the Brethren, and the

Lord Bishop of St Albans:</Member></B> My Lords, I will not reiterate
what has already been said about the levels of underfunding of the
Charity Commission. There is great concern that the vital work that is
going on needs proper support if we are going to develop this very
important sector in our country. A number of noble Lords have spoken
about the need for proper
resourcing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000034">I
want to comment briefly on the group of charities that are described by
the Charity Commission as excepted charities. These include not just
churches and chapels but charities that provide premises for some types
of schools and Scout and Guide groups, and charitable service funds of
the Armed Forces. It is very significant and helpful that Her
Majesty’s Government have decided to extend exception from
registration for a further seven years beyond 31 March 2014. It is
unclear whether there are any plans afoot for an orderly transition to
registration in the lead-up to 2021. Of course, to some extent
inflation will reduce the number of excepted organisations and other
charities as they reach that £100,000 registration threshold,
but 
<?notus-xml column=376?>unless some queuing system is agreed in advance, at the end of the
seven-year extension there is a real possibility of a
logjam.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000035">That
is just one of the reasons why we need to ensure proper funding. The
commission has the responsibility to offer, as well as
regulation—which clearly is needed and for which we are very
grateful—advice and support. There has been a question about the
focus of the work. Certainly, my experience of being involved with many
charities is that with increasing legislation and, indeed, litigation,
many people are deeply worried about taking on trusteeships. If we are
going to see this grow, surely we need to ensure that we have proper,
adequate support.</hs_para>

a charitable point of view, if we want authoritative advice? Expecting
umbrella organisations such as the NCVO to replace the commission is
simply unrealistic. None of them has sufficient clout to do the job. In
my own sphere of work, the Churches’ Legislation Advisory
Service tries very hard to provide sound advice to member churches but
it can never have the detailed expertise and knowledge of the

about churches organising hustings at election time. The
church’s provision of venues plays a vital role in the
democratic process. At each general election for many years now, my own
cathedral in St Albans has hosted hustings. It is by far the largest
hustings around: without exception, all the candidates turn up and a
very large number of people gather for the event. Many people who take
part say it is one of the few times that they come to a hustings in the
traditional sense, where there is real cut and thrust and argument and

Snowdon of the Institute of Economic Affairs has carried out extensive

charity pursuing its objectives. He rightly calls such groups
“sock puppets”. They prey on the good nature
and trust of the British public because government departments and
councils are camouflaging themselves as benefactors. Snowdon found that
a shocking 27,000 charities are dependent on the
Government—or, more accurately, on taxpayers—for more
than 75% of their income. That has to have a big impact on the

Phillips of Sudbury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble

issues that it seeks to cover are immense and deep, so I am going to
have to be as selective as everyone else. I declare my interests, which
are in the register: I have been a charity lawyer for 40
years, and I suppose I have had as many dealings with the Charity
Commission in that time as anyone alive. I want to come to their aid,
though it has many shortcomings. I have one point, which I know is a
dangerous one to make but it is at the root of those shortcomings, of
which I have been the victim over the years: it is grossly
under-resourced<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:33:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000048">The
noble Lord, Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:33:28"></hs_TimeCode>
Hodgson, made that point, as did the NAO. It is fruitless for any of us
to go on saying, “They must do this better,” “They
must do that better,” “There must be better inquiries,
more inquiries, more of this and more of that”. In its report,
the NAO says that in the past six years the commission’s income
has declined by 40% in real terms. None the less—like everyone
else—it makes a list of recommendations, more than half of which
require greater resources of men and women. The lawyers in the Charity
Commission oversee more than 330,000 charities. Half of those are
registered, but more than half are below the levels for registration.
They all have to be registered. They are ruled, governed and led by
volunteers. I hope I do not misconstrue what the noble Lord, Lord
Borwick, said, but the charity sector is essentially and at its heart a
volunteer movement. That is its ethos. That is why altruism is still
the central legal purpose of charity. You cannot conceivably do what it
is asked to do.</hs_para>

NAO made a huge number of recommendations, over half of which need
extra resources. The legal department, where I was, has only 10 to
12 lawyers. My firm, one firm of solicitors, has over
10 to 12 charity lawyers. What sort of farce is that? They
do their best and on the whole they are jolly good, but they are
pathetically underpaid. Any good lawyer can go out of the Charity
Commission any day of any week and get paid two to five times more than
they are paid at the commission. How can we ensure that it can
therefore recruit the people that it needs, let alone extra people, to
do the job, which—I could not agree more—is so

end by emphasising how important all this is, and that the funds that I
am talking about—the actual resources—are but a drop in
the bucket compared with what the voluntary and charity sector does.
Frankly, without the charity sector, this country would be in a
profound mess; it is in enough of a mess. We live now according to
money, sex and celebrity. The charity sector is wonderful
counterbalance to the phenomenal materialism that engulfs us now, with
1 million unpaid trustees. Think of that: over half the adult
population giving of their time willingly and lovingly in a country
that is parched of those characteristics. I therefore, like my noble
friend Lady Barker, do not emphasise the shortcomings of the
commission. Of course it has them—I could give your Lordships 10
things that it could do. However, it must have more support and help.

Best (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the question I am posing and
attempting to answer in this debate is, “Are there lessons for
the Charity Commission from the parallel activities for the regulation
of non-profit housing associations, most of which are
charities?”. The Homes and Communities Agency regulates
so-called registered providers and nearly three-quarters of these are
“exempt charities”, operating outside the Charity
Commission’s regulatory
powers</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000052">Two
aspects of the arrangements for the voluntary housing sector seem worth
considering for the wider charity sector. First, would it help to copy
the model of having an ombudsman to resolve complaints from service
users? Ombudsman services cover many industries—financial
services, telecoms, electricity and water companies, and legal
services—as well, of course, as most public services. However,
only a minority of charities, like the charitable housing associations,
are covered, because they come under a specialist ombudsman service.
Just as the Housing Ombudsman takes a load off the shoulders of the
HCA, I suggest that a charities ombudsman could relieve pressure on the
Charity Commission by sorting out the everyday service disputes that
can prove so arduous and time-consuming.</hs_para>

declare my interest, at one remove, as chair of the council of the
Property Ombudsman, which deals with private sector estate agents and
managing and letting agents. This experience has led me to the view
that ombudsman services—independent redress schemes, free to the
consumer and service user—can be very valuable. An ombudsman has
teeth in being able to make awards—usually financial
compensation—when a complaint is upheld, in being able to
publicise bad behaviour and, where appropriate, in passing on its
findings to the regulator, in this case to the Charity Commission. Let
us have a charities ombudsman.</hs_para>

relates to the concept of co-regulation, which, I feel, the Homes and
Communities Agency is taking to a more refined level than the Charity
Commission. The co-regulation approach brings together the regulator
and the regulated. It encourages the organisation that encounters a
problem, which may be governance-related, to take it to its regulator
as early as possible and to discuss a mutually acceptable way forward.
In place of hoping that the regulator will never find out about the
problematic issue, the board—the trustees—shares the
burden and gets the advice of the regulator.</hs_para>

is not a mechanism for discovering criminal intent or gross misconduct
but, for those cases where things have gone wrong and the trustees are
well intended, co-regulation can sort out difficulties in an atmosphere
of mutual trust, not defensiveness and hostility. It requires the
regulator to assist the organisation to take steps to put things right
and to keep in close contact. This contrasts with the regulator
standing back and not coming down from on high in a heavy-handed
manner. Direct intervention need happen only in extreme cases. I
believe that the Charity Commission is heading in this direction and,
from experience of seeing how co-regulation can work, I commend an
acceleration of that process. If the way for the Charity Commission to
increase its effectiveness is by taking 
<?notus-xml column=380?>forward the two suggestions I am making here, perhaps by raising some
part of the funding from an annual levy on the charities themselves,
that might be a price worth paying for a better service for charity
service users and for the charities themselves.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this debate.
Given how important the charities sector is for the country, holding
regular debates on aspects of charities law and charities regulation
seems to be one role that the second Chamber might usefully consider as
particularly valuable for itself. These are immensely complex issues,
as we all know. We have inherited charities law as developed over the
past 400 years, and it continues to adapt. I have spent some
time looking at public benefit issues and think I am persuaded that if
we were to define “public benefit” now, in statute form,
we would find ourselves having even more legal cases about the edges of
public benefit. I am therefore persuaded that allowing it to evolve
through case law is very important, in particular, for those elements
of charities which are concerned with religion. For the first 300 years
of charities law, it was almost entirely concerned with charities
associated with the Church of England or, after some time, with a
number of non-conformist churches. That eventually included a small
number of Jewish charities and, as we all know, it now extends over a
much wider area, in which the questions of what religion and belief are
have come to be very much part of where we all
are<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:46:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022777000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000063">I will take on the
question of the Preston Down Trust case, which went before the
tribunal. One of the things I think I have learnt is that using the
charities tribunal, which was intended to save money and time, has now
become a very expensive legal activity. It was felt more useful
therefore to negotiate. We have negotiated an agreement which will be
reviewed after a year and we will see where we are then. The noble
Baroness is well aware of the intensive lobbying that there was on both
sides, including by a number of MPs from within her own
party—not always, I think, necessarily wisely. However, this is
now in train, it will be continued, and a review will take
place<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000064">To
come back to where my noble friend Lady Barker started, this is an
important sector which has a gross income of £61 billion,
although I suspect that contains a certain amount of double counting
because some charities give money to other charities. It includes more
than 160,000 different charities, although 1,000 
<?notus-xml column=382?>are the most important and account for the largest amount of spending.
As the noble Lord, Lord Borwick, said, the sector has become much more
professional, and in certain ways some of the larger charities have
become a good deal more ruthless, which is part of what I discovered in
the extensive consultation I had with large charities over the
transparency of lobbying Bill. It is a much more professional sector
than it was. Reading through the evidence given to the PAC and others
shows that the Charity Commission has been going through a change of
culture from one in which you automatically assume that almost everyone
in this sector is full of good will and altruism and that the role of
the Charity Commission is to be helpful and offer advice, to one in
which we recognise that a small number of charities, whether small or
large, test the limits or are involved in actual fraud, and that the
Charity Commission has therefore got to be a less trusting regulator.
Questions have been raised by a number of noble Lords about whether it
can do that and whether its resources are too small. Reading through
the various reports and the evidence given, it is quite clear to me
that if the new Charity Commission board and chief executive can make a
strong and positive case for additional resources, the Government will
look at it very carefully. Whether some element of charging for larger
charities becomes part of that larger package may be for a further
debate on another occasion, but we recognise that resources are now
extremely stretched and that the clear regulation we need requires to
be strengthened.</hs_para>

transition is an important part of this, as the noble Baroness said.
The Government have provided a further £500,000 of capital
spending to the Charity Commission to assist in moving towards an
easier digital openness strategy. As a trustee of a couple of musical
education charities, I agree strongly with the noble Baroness that
simple provision in digital form of accounts, declaration of public
benefit and all the things that one needs to do, as well as advice to
trustees, is exactly what one needs. When I went around the Charity
Commission’s website last week looking for a simple definition
of public benefit, it was not as easy to find as I had hoped and
expected, so there are improvements to be

scheme. It issued guidance about such schemes at an early stage in the

lobbying Act, I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Borwick, on a number
of issues, but I also disagree with the noble Baroness, 
<?notus-xml column=383?>Lady Hayter. I have learned a great deal about the shift in a number of
big charities towards campaigning, but campaigning has always been part
of what charities have done. One of the most impressive discussions I
had was with the dementia trust, which has managed by campaigning to
raise public awareness of the importance of the issue—to raise
the quality of understanding of an extremely important public issue.
That is entirely legitimate and desirable in the public debate. The
idea that charities should not have a campaigning dimension is
something that I hope we all accept is not
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:52:49"></hs_TimeCode>. Let
me reassure the right reverend Prelate that the Act in no way affects
hustings in the run-up to the 2015 election. A great deal of
exaggerated concern was put out during the passage of the then Bill
about what it might do. If you read CC9—I must have read it 15
times in the last year—it is entirely clear that it is not
affected by that Act, and that churches will continue in
their extremely valuable role in public education that they have in
this respect.</hs_para>

hope that I have now answered a number of the issues raised. Why not
charge charities? The question is out in the open. Needless to say,
charities do not respond with much enthusiasm to that suggestion. The
Government are looking at the question of how we provide the resources
needed for regulation. I have also discussed public benefit. We all
have a concept of public benefit. Happily, no one today has mentioned
public schools—that is out there as well. Public benefit can be
provided in a range of different ways. Case by case, you look at the
sort of public benefit being provided, but it has to be public. The
noble Baroness will know that, in religious cases, those religious
bodies that do not open some of their facilities to a broader public
and do not provide wider benefit to a broader public are therefore not
accepted as charities.</hs_para>

executive remuneration, the noble Lord, Lord Borwick, said that he
regretted that the new chairman of the Charity Commission had offered
some criticism. Charities are in the public sector and in the public
view, so they need the respect of their members and people who give
money. During the consultation on the transparency of lobbying Bill, I
remember being told by representatives of a large charity that it is
important that the charity should maintain its reputation because the
people who give small sums of money need to know that it has that
reputation. That is part of the reason why charities need to be aware
of the dangers of becoming overly professional and corporate. Some of
our big charities have edged a little far in that
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T13:55:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000072">On
the question of co-regulation, raised by the noble Lord, Lord Best, the

the return of stolen art, including Holocaust education in the national
curriculum and appointing a special envoy for post-Holocaust issues.

special year for the UK I have to tell the Minister that survivors need
action as well as memorials. They need action to combat the resurgence
of anti-Semitism in Europe and they need help to reclaim their cultural

theft in history. The Nazis, and in some countries the communists, took

of the issue of looted art, most recently through the discovery of a
hoard of art in a Munich apartment. But it is not just art. Before the
war, Poland was home to more than 3 million Jewish citizens, 90% of
whom were killed and their properties occupied by others. There are
thousands of

must be tended to, otherwise it will fester for ever. Poland is a
success story of modern Europe but more than two decades after it
became a democracy, the failure to make restitution still blights it.
An entire people—killed or forced out—was dispossessed.
Poland’s success is built in part on the property of others.
This is a property issue like no other. The stolen homes stand for the
remembrance and recognition of the history of the Jewish population of
Europe and the contribution of Jewish people to the culture and
businesses of the countries they once lived in. Museums and tourism to
the sites of former concentration camps do not begin to restore that
memory. Survivors living in poverty may well ask why Governments
contribute to the preservation of the Auschwitz site but not to the
relief of their situation. The claims of the survivors need attention
to demonstrate that Europe was not made lawless by the atrocities of
the Second World War but upholds the law.</hs_para>

the only European country not to have enacted comprehensive legislation
and settle the claims; indeed, it has retained communist
nationalisation laws despite urging by international organisations and,
most recently, by US Vice-President Biden. Many survivors live in
poverty while their property is inhabited by the now free and
democratic citizens of their former country of residence. The fact that
Poland was a victim country itself does not remove the obligation to
restore stolen property from which its citizens continue to benefit.
But ultimately, it is not just about art or property; it is about
recapturing people’s history. The art that hung on their walls
and the houses where they lived are part of the legacy. If we allow the
theft of an entire generation of a people’s culture, it is as if
they had never existed. That is why the achievement of restitution must
be the Government’s priority this
year<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:04:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000081">In
making this a priority, the Government will be fulfilling their
obligations under the terrorism declaration and guidelines of 2009 and
2012. The declaration was signed by 47 countries and called for support
for the welfare of 500,000 Holocaust survivors and restitution of
wrongfully seized property. This was the culmination of many post-war
international conferences on this issue. However, progress is slow in
central and eastern Europe, for example Romania. The greatest failure
is Poland. There are about 90,000 surviving claimants to property of
whom the majority are non-Jewish. On at least 13 occasions, Poland has
drafted legislation and then shelved it. It puts every obstacle in the
way of claimants in its own courts and makes unrealistic demands of
proof, given that those who were killed were unlikely to have left
title deeds
behind<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:06:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Its
Government are acting in rejection of Council of Europe, US Congress
and European Parliament resolutions, in contravention of the first
protocol of the European Convention on Human Rights and of hopes held
out prior to it entering the European Union. There are survivors here
listening to us as we 
<?notus-xml column=386?>speak and they would say that their experience of claiming and being
rejected has led them to believe that Poland is waiting for all the
survivors to die out. They do not want total compensation. They do not
want the eviction of present inhabitants, but a restitution and
reconciliation commission to be set up by Poland modelled on the one
that worked well in Austria. Such a commission could distribute a small
percentage of the lost value from a fund donated by the Polish
Government, with realistic requirements of proof carried out
expeditiously.</hs_para>

is nothing new. In 2001, Austria established a general settlement fund
to resolve all remaining issues. The Government set up a three-person
claims committee to receive claims using relaxed standards of
proof—for example, the 1938 property records, witness statement
and birth certificates. The Austrians put $210 million into the fund
and more for insurance claims. Claimants no longer had to take legal
action at their own cost. The committee dealt with 20,000 claims
relating to 240,000 individuals before closing its work.
Bulgaria<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:07:46"></hs_TimeCode> had a

year, Holocaust remembrance needs to be refreshed and remodelled for
future generations. There are already countless memorials around the
world. There is a veritable tourist industry in trips to the sites of
former concentration camps. In this country we have three Holocaust
museums, memorial days and sophisticated education programmes. There is
much to be gained by viewing “Schindler’s List”
and reading <I>T</I><I>he</I> <I>Hare with Amber Eyes</I> and <I>The
Diary of Anne Frank</I>, but these efforts are not an excuse for not
taking the more difficult actions that survivors need. Moreover, all
the conferences and education have failed signally to hold back the
resurgence of anti-Semitism that we now see on the continent of Europe:
the Islamist attacks on French Jews; the rise of Jobbik in Hungary and
Golden Dawn in Greece; the marches in Lithuania; the resurrection of
the blood libel; the antics of footballers and Dieudonné; and
Holocaust denial and sales of the forged text, <I>The Protocols of the
Elders of Zion</I>. Although the number of incidents reported by the
Community Security Trust is down a little this year, it has only
returned to the levels of 10 years ago and the totals cannot
take account of the anti-Semitism so evident on social
media.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000084">The
European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights reported on Jewish
experiences of anti-Semitism in eight European nations in 2013: 76%
said that there had been deterioration in the past five years and 21%
had experienced an incident. I suggest to the Government that we need a
vigorous search for, and return of, looted art, and use of the remedies
that already exist in law to stamp on the anti-Semitic actions and
words that are suffered every day. As chair, they should call on Poland
and other countries to honour their commitment to the democratic
principle of property rights. There is a case for the creation of a
European commissioner for post-Holocaust issues modelled on Sir Andrew
Burns’s role, and a pan-European effort to provide
some degree of remedy for the great  injustices of the past so
vividly remembered today in this

Government take up the chair as anti-Semitism is again rising in many
places, as we have just heard. It is often excused as criticism of
Israel or support for animal welfare as, again, religious slaughter of
animals is attacked—or, as we have recently seen in Denmark,
banned altogether even though no Jewish religious slaughter is
undertaken there. The latest is that circumcision will be brought into
question. The sight of young men making the quenelle gesture in front
of concentration camps and before the Western Wall in Jerusalem
demonstrates how the message of the Holocaust risks being lost only 70
years after being revealed to the world after the Second World
War<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:11:41"></hs_TimeCode>. My simple
message to the Government is this: please use every opportunity to

of what happened, and to reiterate that anti-Semitism and any form of
discrimination will not be tolerated.</hs_para>

the USC Shoah Foundation and the Holocaust Centre in Nottingham, which
does wonderful work in educating our young people on this subject. This

I fear for the future, for a time when there are no Holocaust survivors
left to tell us what happened to them and when the Holocaust appears to
many to be just another history lesson. Those who deny what happened
are very clever. Even now there is distortion as to what occurred.
Unbelievably and shockingly, there is blame on the victims; there is
denial of the extent of what took place. Many records have been kept
and the USC Shoah Foundation is dedicated to making audiovisual
interviews with survivors so that their message is preserved for all
time and never
lost<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000089">I
have a fear that in the future—not in this century but
beyond—those clever and despicable people who deny what occurred
will dismiss these archives and the harrowing, grainy films of the
camps and survivors as computer-generated films that were the product
of clever film-makers. That is why educating every generation about the
Holocaust and keeping it alive is so important.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:14:39"></hs_TimeCode> creation of
Holocaust Remembrance Day, taking place around the world on 27 January
each year, has become a fitting reminder of what horrors took place
within the lifespan of so many of us. Many people born long after the
war are taught what happened and are shocked at the murderous acts that
occurred as a barbarous attempt at racial cleansing.</hs_para>

Wills (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Deech, on securing this important debate. In recent
years a huge amount of important work has been done, including by the
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, to ensure that the memory
of the Holocaust remains alive for generations which increasingly have
no contact with anyone who lived through those terrible years, and it
is important that it does so. However, memorialising can distance and
weaken the power of example and of history, and the Holocaust should
never become dusty and remote history. The lessons that it teaches us
about the fragility of civilisation and the repeated need to shore up
protections against savagery need to be taught and learnt generation
after generation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022777000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000092">However, that is made
harder when open wounds remain and, as we have heard, some still do.
Restitution is important because, while nothing can undo the evil that
was done, it at least recognises that evil was done. The material
recovery of property, as the noble Baroness said so persuasively,
matters less than that recognition, the recovery of that heritage and
the bearing of witness to the fact that such evil was done. Without it,
the wounds will always remain raw.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022777000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000093">Of course, the
restitution of assets is not the only way for such recognition to take
place. The German artist Gunter Demnig, for example, has created the
concept of “Stolpersteine”, small memorials positioned in
places associated with the victims of Nazism. There are now hundreds of
them in Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, Hungary and other
European countries commemorating, among others, Jewish, Roma,
homosexual and Christian victims of the Nazis.</hs_para>

restitution of assets still has a crucial part to play in this process,
not just for the victims of the Nazis, because the people of central
and eastern Europe suffered from not only their tyranny but that of the
communists. As the noble Baroness so compellingly argued—and I
associate myself with everything she said—it is regrettable that
Poland remains the only major European nation without legislation on
the restitution of assets stolen during the Holocaust. As we have also
heard, more needs to be done to make restitution effective in Romania,
Hungary, Croatia and Latvia.</hs_para>

be a priority for our Government during their chairmanship of the
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, but I hope that it will
not be the only one. Of all the crimes against humanity, genocide
occupies a unique place because of the way in which it seeks to
exterminate entire peoples, their cultures, their society and
everything that sustains them as a people. If remembrance of the
Holocaust is to fulfil its purpose, we cannot be complacent about what
has happened since the Holocaust took place. To the shame of the world,
in the past 20 years we have been witness once again to what can only
be described 
<?notus-xml column=389?>only as genocide. We have seen it in Rwanda, Yugoslavia and Darfur and,
for all the efforts now to secure accountability for those crimes, the
civilised world failed to prevent these terrible crimes against
humanity—crimes that have amounted, again, to
genocide.</hs_para>

brutal repression in Tibet and systematic attempts to eradicate Tibetan
culture, and a savage onslaught on the Mayan people and their culture
in Guatemala. No continent can take pride in its record in recent years
in preventing these terrible atrocities that remind us that the
Holocaust, for all its horrifyingly unique characteristics, was not the
last of the ways in which civilisation can be overwhelmed by
savagery—savagery that is rendered all the more terrible by the
way in which the power of modern technology has been applied to its
perpetration. History is harsh on those who, whatever they might say,
in the end do little than more than wring their hands.</hs_para>

uncle and his family lived in a small town in what is now the Czech
Republic. The family graves in the Jewish cemetery suggest that the
family had lived there since before the 18th century. Ten thousand Jews
lived in that town and the remaining population was about 70,000, most
of whom were Sudeten Germans who had lived there since the
17th century. My uncle was a second father to my father. The
town was a place of refuge for him from a difficult childhood in
Vienna, and his first job was in the family firm

my grandmother, grandfather and father managed to escape to London. My
grandmother’s brother refused to go with them; Jews had lived
through hard times before, he thought, and this, too, would pass. He,

state of Czechoslovakia expelled all the Sudeten Germans. In less than
10 years, that pretty little spa town had been entirely depopulated.

A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:21:34"></hs_TimeCode> lot of work

planned over the next five years in relation to World War I demonstrate
how, as a country, as communities and as human beings, we will ensure
that the memories of the horrors of that war will never fade. Of
course, so many UK families have memories passed down between
generations. We have personal possessions, war memorials, public
buildings paid for by subscription, monuments, films, plays, museums
and wealth of personal testimony in books, many written shortly after
the war. Of course, study of World War I is in the national curriculum.
It is vital, now, that we clarify how we will maintain personal
testimony of the Holocaust as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

developing resources in teaching and learning by the Holocaust
Educational Trust since its creation in 1988. It has brought
understanding to new generations, particularly since 1991, when
Holocaust studies became part of the national curriculum at key stage
3. The trust tells us that when students listen to a survivor tell
their personal story, they will often say that it is the most memorable
lesson of the year. We should acknowledge that, within its capacity,
the trust does an excellent job in teacher development, resourcing
schools, colleges and universities, and in enabling visits to them by
survivors and visits by students to Auschwitz. Its beacon school and
regional ambassador programmes should be

generation—which is, in practice, only a school’s
generation—moves on, and another takes its place. That is why
the work of the trust is a continuous process. This raises the question
of how we can maintain personal witness and testimony in the years
ahead. I have on several occasions led discussion at events to mark
Holocaust Memorial Day. I have done so following a performance of
“The Tin Ring”, a dramatisation of the autobiography of
Zdenka Fantlova, a Holocaust survivor. The importance of this
dramatisation is that it takes witness testimony and transfers it into
a theatrical landscape where that testimony can live on the through the
performer.</hs_para>

communicated is not actually testimony. Sometimes drama can be the most
effective way of communicating it. Sometimes that can be in writing,
film, poetry, sculpture, art or painting, and sometimes it can be
through another person, in particular through the testimony of the
children of survivors. But my concern in relation to the debate is that
we should use our leadership role this year to encourage the spread of
good practice internationally on how to preserve personal testimony in
the years
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:25:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

There were two facts in the Library briefing that I think should be of
concern to us. The first is that research shows that over 40% of
teachers say that teaching the Holocaust is difficult in terms of
managing cross-curricular co-operation, dealing with the emotional
content, and responding to student misunderstandings or prejudice. I
find that a very high percentage and it needs to be reduced. Secondly,
the briefing refers to the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance’s UK country report of October 2012, which states that
in 2010-11, 13,276 people came before the UK courts charged with hate
crimes, either for assault or verbal abuse, most of them racially
motivated. More than 80% were convicted. Those 
<?notus-xml column=391?>figures tell us that we have to maintain our vigilance, and therefore
memories, and that the testimony must not be allowed to

Finkelstein (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, in 1985, Ronald
Reagan’s visit to Bitburg became the subject of controversy. He
had been visiting the graves of members of the SS and he decided that
he would therefore also visit Bergen-Belsen. I remember hearing this on
the radio in my bedroom and thinking that my mother would be interested
because she was a survivor of Belsen. I went down to the kitchen where
Mum was doing the washing up. “Mum”, I said,
“Ronald Reagan is going to Belsen”. “So
what?” she replied. “I’ve

contribution to the debate that the wonderful as well as noble
Baroness, Lady Deech, has secured, I want to make just three points.
First, Holocaust remembrance is about to face its biggest challenge. We
are going to need to think about how to keep the memory of the
Holocaust alive when the distinct and irreplaceable voice of the
survivors can be heard no more. I recall my mother preparing to speak
at our synagogue and telling me for the first time that she and her
sister had seen their family friends, Margot and Anne Frank, arrive in
Belsen, and that her sister had recorded the event in a little pocket
diary, the keeping of which was in itself a crime under the camp terms.
She asked me if I thought the children would be interested. Yes, I
thought they would be interested. My mum is still alive and continues
to give talks about her experiences, but how do we replace that
electrifying testimony? That is the job of the Prime Minister’s
Holocaust Commission to consider and should also be a priority during
our chairmanship of the International Holocaust Remembrance
Alliance<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

speaking is to lend support to the campaign of the noble Baroness, Lady
Deech, for compensation for Polish victims of the Holocaust. On the
mantelpiece of my parents’ home is a clock embedded in a statue
of Marshal Pilsudski, the leader of the Second Polish Republic. On the
hour it plays Polish anthems, although generally we switch it off. My
father was born in Lviv, which is now in Ukraine, but he was deeply
proud of having been born a Pole. On his deathbed he told me that I
should always honour the Polish people and never blame them for the
crimes committed against them. So I do, and I am happy to do so. The
revival of a free Polish nation and its emergence as a great European
power is one of the happiest political events of my lifetime. It is why
I can say with confidence and belief that I know that Poland will
respond to the case the noble Baroness has made

Union stole my father’s house and the family business when it
imprisoned and exiled my father’s family. In 2005, Poland made
compensation available for this theft and we are pursuing the claim,
although I have to confess that progress is slow. I am sure that as
that claim has been recognised, so Poland will understand and respond
to the noble Baroness. Poland is our friend, a friend of liberty and
justice, and a great modern nation—and that is what great 
<?notus-xml column=392?>modern nations do. Helping our friends do the right thing should number

to make. The alliance has 31 members and four observers.
There are more than 190 countries in the world. Not to belong to this
alliance and not to adhere to the Stockholm declaration is not just to
show disrespect to those who died, it is the canary in the coal mine.
It demonstrates that a country does not want to teach its children
about hatred and genocide. We should make it our business to leave the
alliance bigger than we found
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000111">In the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, in
seeking the Government’s priorities, which were so admirably set
out by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, I also want to draw attention to
some of the victims of the Nazi regime who are less remembered. I refer
to the Romani population of Europe, called by themselves Roma. I say
this without wanting in any way to diminish the enormity of the Shoah,
and the memory of those of my Polish grandfather’s family who
died in Auschwitz. I should declare that I am chair of the Department
for Education stakeholder group on the education of Gypsy, Traveller
and Roma children, and I am president of other relevant organisations
which are shown in the

hope the Minister will tell us how the Government’s new
Holocaust Commission will deal with the Roma genocide. Can he tell us
whether the Government have invited any UK Roma organisation to be
affiliated with the International Alliance? One of the aims of its
committee on the genocide of the Roma is to find ways of drawing Roma
representatives into its working
processes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000114">I
do not think that the public as a whole are aware that a quarter of the
Roma population of mainland Europe were killed by the Nazis, or cares
much that the descendants of those who remained are still harried,
persecuted and sometimes killed because of their race throughout the
European mainland. There is a history of ignorance. Little regard was
paid even by the Nazis to what they were doing. In contrast to the
meticulous documentation and photographing of Jewish victims, few
records were kept of the Roma. Some think that this is because,
ironically enough, the Roma were more Aryan than most Germans, being
descended from 15th-century migrants from the Punjab, which presented a
problem to Nazi racial
theorists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000115">While
the fate of the Jewish victims of the concentration camps and the gas
chambers was acknowledged soon after peace was signed, it took until
1982 for the German Government to recognise the Porrajmos or Roma
annihilation. Even now, the word is probably unfamiliar to many noble
Lords. It was not until 2012, 
<?notus-xml column=393?>after 20 years of campaigning by Roma groups, that a memorial to the
Sinti and Roma people murdered under the Nazi regime was opened in
Berlin. A campaign to place a memorial on the site of the Lety Roma
concentration camp in the Czech Republic, where there is now an
industrial pig farm, is so far
unheeded.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000116">However,
as my noble friend said, it is not enough to commemorate. One Roma man
I talked to said, “There is a Kristallnacht every weekend in the
Czech Republic. Today it is nothing extraordinary to see patrols of
extremists in T-shirts with slogans such as ‘Burn the
Gypsies’”. Segregated education of Roma children en masse
exists. Forced sterilisation exists. Inhuman and degrading treatment by
police exists. All these are included in recent evidence from judgments
in the European Court of Human
Rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000117">Another
aim of the IHRA’s Roma genocide committee is to include Roma
history and the contemporary situation of Roma in the school
curriculum. Can the Minister tell us how far the Institute of Education
and other bodies funded by Her Majesty’s Government to improve
holocaust education have got with
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000118">The
European Commission is well aware of the situation. Following the
wretched deportation of hundreds of Roma people from France in 2010, it
proposed in 2011 a Roma integration strategy which all member states of
the EU signed up to. Yet the UK did not devise a specific strategy,
saying in 2012 that they had got as far as setting up a national Roma
contact point and a ministerial working group for the Gypsy and
Traveller community with a list of commitments, although this had been
set up for other purposes in 2010. Eventually, they were persuaded to
include issues specific to the Roma people from the European mainland.
We nevertheless hear insults and bigotry stereotyping all those of
Romani and Traveller descent throughout the tabloid press and in casual
conversation in a way that would not be tolerated for any other ethnic
group. It is not unknown for parliamentarians and even Ministers to
talk, for instance, about the proximity of Travellers having a
“negative impact on business”. However, the negative
impact is in the other direction: Travellers and those of Romani
descent have by far the worst outcomes in mortality, general health and
education of any ethnic group in the UK—although again, this is
not often remarked
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000119">At a time

capable of great tolerance and humanity, could do better—save

Foreign Secretary’s stated aims reflect the Stockholm
declaration, which is, in effect, the founding document of the
organisation as an international body. It emphasises the importance of
upholding the terrible truth of the Holocaust against those who deny it
and of preserving the memory of the Holocaust. That is an extremely
important aim and a touchstone in our understanding of the human
capacity for good and evil—there was of course good in those
times as well, that of people who sought to combat that dreadful evil.
The declaration also recognises the responsibility of the international
community to combat genocide, ethnic cleansing, racism, anti-Semitism
and xenophobia. I will come back to the genocide point, which the noble
Lord, Lord Wills, also
mentioned.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000123">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:39:40"></hs_TimeCode>

some school pupils from Pembrokeshire—an area that I used to
represent in the National Assembly for Wales—are going to Poland
to visit Auschwitz. I appreciate the point about the danger of a sort
of Holocaust tourism industry but it is important that the memory of
these dreadful events is kept alive. On the basis that hearing is not
like seeing, these visits are important and vital. Indeed, there is a
very real danger if we do not do these things that Holocaust memory
will die. There is evidence, as 
<?notus-xml column=395?>has been stated, of many schoolchildren and others not really
understanding this. This will certainly be perpetuated as people die

agree very much with what the noble Baroness said about property
restitution. This is a vital part of our chairmanship of the
international institution. Through the EU and other organisations, we
need to put pressure on Poland and other states. Poland is perhaps the
most obvious state that is not fulfilling its obligations, but there
are others and they need to be pressurised during our chairmanship to
live up to their international obligations. That is an important
priority. As has been said, there is an urgent need for action because
the longer this goes on, the more difficult it becomes and the fewer
direct survivors there
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000125">Finally,
I applaud the work of the alliance and its important aim of extending
its influence beyond Europe and North America. The link between
holocaust and genocide has been noted and is important. In the past
year I visited the Holocaust Memorial in Berlin, which is a deeply
moving experience: you see people of all ages and racial and religious
backgrounds in tears and hugging each other, which is a measure of its
impact. I also visited the site of the killing fields just outside
Phnom Penh, and there was a similar thing going on there. I remember as
a younger man, probably in my teens, visiting the Anne Frank House, and
these things are important. Restitution is also important. I associate

working processes and outreach. On the first, he is seized of the need
to address the problems of the restricted financial resources of
Governments and NGOs, as well as the need to make deliberations more
accessible to less well resourced countries. Perhaps the Minister might
say something about the resourcing of the alliance. Sir Andrew’s
focus on plenaries being more content-driven and less administrative
will doubtless ring true with
many.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000132">The
White Paper notes that 13 of the Governments who were represented at
the Stockholm forum in 2000 and endorsed the declaration are still not
affiliated to the alliance. These need to be encouraged into the fold
together with others. Further plans approved in 2010 to seek engagement
with countries in north Africa had been put on hold but a tentative
revival of this is suggested.</hs_para>

development outside the alliance, but sitting full square with its
agenda, is the launch of the Prime Minister’s Holocaust
Commission. This has been referred to by a number of noble Lords and I
think the noble Lord, Lord Finkelstein, sits on the commission as an
adviser. We have been pleased to participate in this on a cross-party
basis. The Commission’s remit is to investigate what further
measures should be taken to ensure Britain has a permanent and fitting
memorial to the Holocaust along with sufficient educational and
research resources for future generations. The Labour Party fully
supports this. The point is made that we will not always have with us
the survivors who have shared their stories. In Luton, at this
year’s Holocaust memorial event, there was only one local

with passion and justice about the need for restitution. When in
government, we fully supported Holocaust asset restitution and we
continue to see the issue of restitution as morally important as well
as legally and culturally vital to honour. We endorse the Terezin
principles and strongly encourage the Government to use diplomatic
efforts to encourage other states to sign up to and honour what the
declaration called for. There is particular concern about Poland, as we
have heard today. Poland is yet to become a signatory to Terezin and we
believe that it has a moral duty to sign 
<?notus-xml column=397?>up to the declaration and to honour it. As we have heard, survivors of
the genocide need and deserve
restitution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000135">A

the first time in history, industrial methods were used for the mass
extermination of a whole people—the systematic and planned
attempt to murder European Jewry. We have to do everything in our power

International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance will help to that

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I join other noble
Lords in thanking and paying tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Deech,
for her contributions, not just to this debate but to the issue. This
is an important debate for everyone, and we have seen and heard many
personal and moving interventions from noble Lords today. The Holocaust
will always have a universal meaning given its magnitude, the
unprecedented and unparalleled suffering involved—as the noble
Lord, Lord McKenzie, said—and the scarring of humanity that took
place. We are collectively committed to ensuring that all our children
and future generations understand the events of the Holocaust and can
reflect on its consequences. We also remember the many lives which were
so cruelly cut short, and we support and sustain the survivors, who are
all too few. We are truly honoured by the presence of some of them here
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000137">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:48:00"></hs_TimeCode>
determination to remember the Holocaust and to learn the lessons of
history domestically is reflected at the highest levels of the
Government, as seen by the Prime Minister’s recent creation of
the new cross-party, multifaith Holocaust Commission. Internationally,
as noble Lords have acknowledged, the Foreign Secretary’s envoy
for post-Holocaust issues, Sir Andrew Burns—who I am delighted
has joined us in the Public Gallery today—draws together
activity across government. Along with the executive secretary of the
International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance, Dr Kathrin Meyer, and
with academic and non-government experts, Sir Andrew provides a clear
British profile, presence and influence in this
field.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000138">I<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>

delegation to the IHRA, which is drawn from academic and civil society
organisations. Their activities in the field of post-Holocaust issues,
and the best practice they are able to share with the IHRA’s
other members, are the real heartbeat of the organisation. I
particularly thank the brave survivors who every day actively visit
schools and community groups to share their first-hand testimonies and
help us in the ongoing struggle against Holocaust denial and
anti-Semitism. We are truly honoured by the presence of two such
incredible people, brother and sister Ben Helfgott and Marla Tribich,
who have joined us to listen to the debate
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000139">It<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:49:26"></hs_TimeCode>

It is an honour for us to be at the helm of the foremost international
body committed to promoting multinational co-operation in Holocaust
education, remembrance and research. As several noble Lords pointed
out, the alliance
is<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:49:45"></hs_TimeCode> now at a
crossroads. From three initial country members, it has now grown 
<?notus-xml column=398?>to a sizeable regional alliance, encompassing 31 member states. I assure
my noble friends Lord Bourne and Lord Finkelstein that outreach to new
countries is central to the IHRA and is a priority in our chairmanship.
Yesterday, our special envoy for post-Holocaust issues briefed
ambassadors from a number of interested countries, and we will continue
those conversations with countries such as Australia, Albania, Morocco,
El Salvador, Uruguay and Moldova. Other countries not yet part of the
organisation but registering interest in it include Macedonia, Portugal
and Turkey. These countries, of course, have their own Holocaust
history and their own experiences to bring to the
organisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000140">A<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:50:38"></hs_TimeCode>
key part of the Holocaust issue is education, remembrance and research.
The alliance has recently launched a multiyear work plan which will
feature prominently in our chairmanship throughout this year. This
includes addressing the deficit of knowledge of what took place outside
of the death camps. The name of Auschwitz, for example, is horribly
etched in our minds and sends shivers down our collective spines, and I
assure my noble friend Lord Shipley that we recognise the importance of
ensuring the impact of the Holocaust is not forgotten when the
survivors are no longer with us. We pay tribute to the book <I>The Tin
Ring</I> and to organisations such as the Holocaust Educational Trust,
the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust and the Association of Jewish
Refugees, with which we work actively and imaginatively to ensure that
survivors’ stories are kept alive and are shared through various
innovative ways. We are actively looking to share our best practices
with other members of the
IHRA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000141">However<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:51:32"></hs_TimeCode>,
there are other sites across Europe where mass shootings took place
which remain relatively unknown, and other people suffered, such as the
Roma people mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, and the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie. We are taking forward the Roma integration
strategy within our broader social inclusion and integration policies
because we believe that is the best approach in a diverse and
decentralised country such as the UK. Our approach is fully in line
with that of countries we are working with at all
levels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000142">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:52:02"></hs_TimeCode>
recent IHRA conference in Krakow on killing sites demonstrated that
work still needs to be done to anchor Holocaust remembrance in our
societies, and we are ensuring that Holocaust deniers do not get their
way in any sense. We want to ensure that we curb these perverse and
dangerous views. I assure my noble friend Lord Gold that I understand
the sentiments he expressed. Tackling Holocaust denial or
trivialisation is another priority of the organisation. This struggle
is so important because it confronts a form of anti-Semitism which
risks raising its head again, as we have already seen in parts of
Europe. I assure my noble friend Lord Gold that we work actively
through IHRA’s committee on anti-Semitism and Holocaust denial
to ensure that the international community takes action to combat
anti-Semitism wherever it is seen. That means that the IHRA is not just
a legacy-based body looking backwards, but, more importantly, is
tackling anti-Semitism
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000143">The<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T14:45:00"></hs_TimeCode>

victims of the wrongdoing by actively lobbying other Governments to

implementation of international declarations on restitution. Moreover,
we will go on highlighting UK initiatives on restitution, including the

institutions in the UK on claims for the return of works of art lost
during the Nazi era, and will continue to push this through bodies such

countries in addressing the issue of restitution of property, whether
communal or private, is not all negative. For instance, there was the
extraordinarily successful Austrian operation to compensate Holocaust

this area of restitution are ultimately non-binding. We

start from the proposition that democracy and humane values can best be
defended by humane and lawful methods. The so-called war on terror has
been a mistake from the start, although the use of force against
particular terrorists is acceptable. I remind your Lordships that
successive British Governments used the criminal law against terrorists
associated with 
<?notus-xml column=401?>Northern Ireland. Internment and shoot to kill were briefly tried, but
soon rejected. If anyone says that the IRA or others were just
operating in a remote part of Ireland, I would reply that we should
remember that the whole British Cabinet were twice nearly killed, in
Brighton and in Downing
Street.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="14022777000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000150">For
the reason I have given, I opposed the use of indefinite detention
without charge or trial. My name was included, with many others, as an
amicus curiae in cases about Guantanamo detainees and I have met with
Reprieve and others defending such detainees. I deeply regret that
President Obama has not yet fulfilled his pledge to end detention
without trial. Secret detentions—in eastern Europe, Djibouti,
Afghanistan or elsewhere—are equally objectionable. Rendition to
enable others to carry out torture that Western states are too
law-abiding or too squeamish to do themselves is wholly despicable. It
cannot be doubted that British airspace and airfields were used to
assist renditions, whatever equivocations have been used to deny this.
Waterboarding and other techniques of enhanced interrogation, although
approved in some cases by US authorities, are tantamount to torture and
therefore rejected by most fair-minded people. Why have I gone through
this list of unacceptable practices? It is because they are wrong in
themselves as well as short-sighted. They sacrifice long-term interests
and reputation for the sake of short-term gains, which may well prove
illusory.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000151">Attacks
by drones, or UAVs, began in 2002. In Yemen, there were 93 strikes,
killing some 900 people, including 66 civilians, for example a wedding
party last December. In Pakistan, at least 400 civilians have been
killed, including some children. Survivors have given evidence to
Congress, and only this week I met some such survivors here in
Westminster. The toll may be much higher, as also in Afghanistan and
Somalia. The All-Party Parliamentary Group on Drones last May put the
total number of deaths at 2,700. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, who I am
glad to see in his place, when replying to the earlier debate, said the

relatively lucky, because it is claimed they have only killed four
civilians.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000152">Since
2001, detention and drone killings have been principally used against
Afghans, Arabs and other assorted Muslims who have come under the sway
of jihadi ideologies. What seems to have been overlooked is that
Afghans and Arabs have a highly developed sense of personal honour. The
special term for this is “izzat” in Pashtun and
“karama” in Arabic. For every person arbitrarily
detained, tortured or maltreated, and for every related woman or child
killed, a whole extended family or tribe may seek revenge in order to
restore their wounded honour. It is true that traditional Sunni ethics
forbid suicide, even to promote a just cause; they also ban the killing
of women and children even in a just war. The extreme jihadi/takfiri
ideology has, however, consistently rejected such teaching. We should
therefore beware of policies that simply raise up future generations of
jihadi holy warriors, including suicide bombers. We should understand
that death from the skies is a good way to alienate whole populations,
who are largely defenceless.</hs_para>

the United States has followed Israel in its policy of targeted
killings of supposed enemies. Between 1995 and 2012 Israel assassinated
at least 61 men in the Middle East outside its own borders, and no
doubt others before and after those years. Israel thus lowered itself
to the level of the notorious medieval Old Man of the Mountain, the
patron of the Assassins. I hope that the US will see that
assassinations have not stopped terror attacks, or even defeated
national resistance. Neither has administrative detention, as the
Israelis describe
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000154">Will our

Judd (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am glad to follow the noble Lord,
Lord Hylton. Nobody has been more consistent, in his modest but
effective way, in pursuing the issues before us in this short debate.
In supporting him, I will make a few general
observations<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:08:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000157">First,
we must not allow ourselves to be tempted into thinking that it is
somehow weak to say that we are in a battle for hearts and minds. We
are faced with an appalling threat which every father and grandfather
in this country must take seriously: the threat to the innocent is
real. We must therefore talk about what is muscular in policy. What is
muscular in policy is not to react—not to settle for simply
containing and managing the problem—but to seek to win minds.
One observation that I would make about extremism and terrorism is that
they operate best in the context of ambivalence.</hs_para>

of people, as we saw in our own history in Ireland, who would
individually be appalled and horrified by some of the things that
happened. Yet they would always have an element of doubt. However
dreadful and however deserving of unqualified condemnation the acts,
there was the idea that the perpetrators were perhaps on their side.
They were perhaps fighting for rights and a concept of society which
had not yet been achieved. There is a grey area of ambivalence. This
means that people do not leap up from—or struggle out
of—bed every morning and say, “What can I do today to
expose the terrorists?”. There is an undermining element of
doubt and ambiguity. That is why I will never take second place to
anyone in saying, “Let’s be rid of the nonsense which we
allow ourselves to hear from time to time about what is strong and what
is weak in the
response”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000159">The
real issue is to win minds. If we are to do this there must be
something to which people can relate. There must be hope, and a context
of decency and 
<?notus-xml column=403?>fairness in society. There must be a convincing context of justice that
people can see and relate to. In the aftermath of Syria we have been
presented with a renewed campaign. I applaud those with responsibility
in this area who remind us without qualification that the dangers of
terrorism in our own society are accentuated because of what is
happening in Syria. We have to be on our guard and we have to be
effective.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000160">However,
that makes it all the more important that we establish in the United
Kingdom in all we do a transparent commitment to the values that we say
are basic to our society and which we wish at all costs to defend. That
is why I am very glad indeed that the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of
Holbeach, is replying to this debate. If I am allowed to say so, over a
number of issues over the years I have come to like and admire him as a
decent parliamentarian who cares about society, although across a
political
divide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000161">I now
want to make some points about the interconnections, or connected
government as we sometimes call it, and our effectiveness in winning
hearts and minds. Forgive me if I have to oversimplify slightly. If a
well qualified, intelligent, thinking and decent man or woman, who is
struggling to find a future for their family in the real desperation of
the world as it is, has a bad experience in the immigration process,
are we not sowing the seeds of the ambivalence of which I speak? I am
not one of those who object to the concept of the need for a convincing
immigration policy; we cannot just have an open door. However, this is
why it matters desperately that everything within the procedures
happens with decency, civilised values and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000162">When
something goes wrong, let us please remember that there is an element
of real potential—I hesitate to use the word because it is very
strong—treasonable activity. It plays into the hands of the
extremists, who play on the doubts and the anxieties that exist. It
strengthens the climate of ambivalence: is this society really about
the things it talks about, or has it got double-speak and double
values? That is why what we do in immigration policy is so important.
It is why, when we are talking of the armed services, the police or the
security services, we should uphold people within those organisations
who are determined to operate by the highest
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000163">When
things go wrong, they are not just wrong and to be condemned as acts
that are insupportable in terms of the rules and regulations and
conventions, they are counterproductive in terms of giving ground to
extremist recruiters. We have to be infinitely more rigorous in seeing
the connections in so many elements of our society and public life
between what is happening and the way it is happening, and our
determination to preserve security in this

this in the House before and I do not apologise for saying it again: I
was greatly influenced at the age of 13, in 1948, when I was taken to
Geneva by my father to an international conference that he was
organising. At that conference, I had the privilege of meeting
personally Eleanor Roosevelt. Eleanor Roosevelt was not just
championing a nicer way of organising society in which human rights
would be an 
<?notus-xml column=404?>element. She was a tough woman. Like many others in the aftermath of the
Second World War, she had seen that human rights and all that attaches
to them were a fundamental and indispensable element of security and
stability. If you do not have human rights, there is always the danger
of extremism gaining ground. The commitment to human rights throughout
everything we do is therefore desperately important.</hs_para>

context I want to express my great appreciation of all the work that he
does. Let me also say, like the noble Lord, Lord Judd, for whom I have
the greatest respect, that it is very nice to have the noble Lord, Lord
Taylor of Holbeach, here to respond to the debate. As far as I can tell
he works infinitely hard to respond to the questions and pleas of his
fellow Members. I would like to express my thanks to him and to the
noble Earl, Lord Attlee, for their willingness to be present and to
take seriously the issues we are

entirely to address the domestic scene because the noble Lords, Lord
Hylton and Lord Judd, have talked quite rightly about the international
and broader position. I want to talk a bit about the issue of the
indefinite detention of those who are either suspected of terrorism or,
in some cases, are simply illegal immigrants, because I believe that it
is a very serious issue. We all heard this morning an inspiring speech
by the Chancellor of Germany, and one of the most impressive things
about it was the way in which she frequently reiterated the goals of
the European Union. She said that they are peace, freedom and
prosperity. I want to address the issue of
freedom<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:18:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the European Union, there are only two that have no limit on the length
of detention of people who are sent to detention centres either because
they are illegal immigrants or because they are suspected—in
most cases it is found to be rare—of being involved in some kind
of terrorist activity. I found that amazing when I first heard about
it. I did not really believe it, so I pursued it using every line of
research I possibly could. Let me say in a completely non-partisan
spirit that the understanding and agreement to allow non-limited
detention to go on started with the Labour Government and has been
continued, to my great regret, by this Government. I want to challenge
this bipartisan
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:19:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which has not opted out of the so-called return directive which was
passed in 2008 and made active in 2010—it is a prime EU
directive—that directive says that the maximum period for which
people can be detained without any form of trial is six months. One can
then appeal for an extension of an 
<?notus-xml column=405?>additional 12 months, making a total maximum figure of 18 months.
However, we should not forget that that figure is subject to there
having been an agreement to the extension of 12 months: the normal
limit is six months and 18 months is the absolute limit. That is not so
in the United Kingdom or the Republic of Ireland, partly for reasons
that are a hangover from the terrorist issues of the past, as the noble
Lord, Lord Judd,
indicated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:20:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000170">That
means that, at the present time, on the figures for 2012-13, we spend
£34 million in keeping just under 3,000 people—the latest
figure is 2,685—in unlimited detention. That is bad enough.
However, in addition to that, these detention centres—and there
are enough to deal with the 3,000 figure, which is the current
maximum—are outsourced to private administrators or private
executors of the rules. They are not run by the Home Office or the
police; they are run by private
bodies<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

these private bodies are not subject to any form of regular inspection.
They are inspected if there is a death in their premises by the
Independent Police Complaints Commission, but that is the only form of
accountability there is. Therefore one of the first questions I want to
ask my noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach is whether the Home Office
might consider bringing in a regular inspection of these detention
centres. In some centres, such as Harmondsworth, the numbers are quite
troubling. Eight people have lost their lives through self-harm,
suicide or accident in Harmondsworth over the past few years. The
figures are lower for other detention
centres.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000172">I
declare an interest: I am a patron of the Gatwick detention centre,
which is remarkable and has never had a single unacknowledged death.
What characterises Gatwick but does not characterise Harmondsworth is
the existence of a regular pool of volunteers drawn from the locality,
from the countryside—from the community, if you like—who
regularly visit those in detention, giving them moral support and help
and useful advice. That has had a wonderful outcome because it has not
only given the local community an understanding of the detention centre
and made it willing to engage with it, but it has also given the
detainees, some of whom had been tortured or imprisoned for years
before they got here, the kind of moral support and friendship that
they desperately need. It is a wonderful social experiment, recognised
by the Queen but not very much by
Parliament<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:22:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000173">Having
asked the noble Lord, Lord Taylor, whether we could consider some kind
of accountability for these detention centres, I come to the serious
point that many of those in detention find it difficult to apply for
bail. Under the new Immigration Bill, they will largely be expected to
apply for any reconsideration of their case from another country. For
most of them, that is not possible and not practicable. They cannot
afford it, they do not have the communication, they do not have the
language and they do not have the
advice<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:23:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000174">The
other aspect of this issue which troubles me, apart from the high
expense, is the fact that it makes the UK look like a poor member of
the attempt to get civil liberties and freedom strengthened within the
European Union. I repeat that we are the only country— 
<?notus-xml column=406?>along with the Republic of Ireland, which has been persuaded by us to
support an opt-out—which has opted-out completely from the
return directive of 2010. Sadly, that opt-out was made in 2006 and so,
once again, none of us can say, “Sorry, it was not us”.
It was us. It was all of

I have said, the current expenditure is £34 million, which is
quite a lot for 3,000 people, but there is now a proposal to convert
the old prison at Verne in Dorset to a detention centre at a cost of
£30 million. That is a big jump in the amount of money made
available for detention. It is due to open later this year or, at the
latest, early next
year.</hs_para><hs_parafo UID="14022777000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000244">So, on
the basis of legality, freedom and expense—and, not least, on
the basis of losing the good will and respect of other countries,
because we are one of only two in the whole of the EU about which this
is true—we really ought to consider whether there are some
alternatives.</hs_parafo>

people—for example, from Somalia—against whom there is no
criminal charge but who cannot be returned under United Nations HRC
rules because their country is too dangerous to be sent back to. They
are in suspension: they are not out of detention but cannot be
returned, they have not been tried, they have not committed crimes and
there are several hundred of them in this condition. I ask the noble
Lord, Lord Taylor, whom I regard, as does the noble Lord, Lord Judd, as
a sensible and thoughtful person, whether he and the Home Office might
not find it possible to let such people —I am talking now about
Somalians, or others who cannot be returned for the reasons
given—be released on licence, or, if you like, under probation,
where they might have to report to police every week and their position
would be regularly reviewed? It would cost the country a great deal
less, it would obviate a great deal of real psychological and mental
suffering, which, as I said, has led in some cases to self-mutilation
and suicide, and it would save the Government a great deal of money and
gain them a great deal of
respect.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/1306FF7277F451E6FBD514409D5335A06FEECCD2" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2014">Thursday,

isolation of large sections of the Muslim community is not good.
Demonisation and sensational headlines in the tabloid newspapers are
also bad. Despite what the media portray, Muslims are not the major
source of terrorist atrocities. The Government seem preoccupied with
Islamist terrorism despite the fact that, according to Europol, fewer
than 6% of terrorist acts across the continent, year on year for the
past 10 years, have been carried out by Muslims. Counterterrorist
anti-extremism measures need to be more holistic in their approach and

abroad, a point raised by the noble Lords, Lord Hylton and Lord Judd.
At the meeting of the APPG on Drones on Tuesday, we heard evidence from
two victims of drone attacks and from Mr Clive Stafford Smith from
Reprieve, who described the 600,000 citizens of North Waziristan as
living through a blitz. His mother had lived through the Blitz and he
said that she described how people lived day after day in the same
conditions. One third of the population in the region is on
antidepressants due to drone attacks and the fear of them. He said that
the American policy on drones has made the Americans the most hated
people on earth for the Pakistanis in Pakistan. True, the Pakistan
Government are taking action against the terrorists and the Taliban. It
because they are doing it themselves that the public support that
action. However, they resent any outsider making attacks on their land,
on their culture and, as they perceive it, on their religion. That

Hylton, for giving us this opportunity to debate a matter of real
concern and import to the citizens of this country. The subject matter
of the debate is the Government’s assessment of the
effectiveness of counterterrorism practices. I want to refer in that
context to the recent developments in
Syria<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000186">Terrorism
is not just a major issue for the United Kingdom; it is a global
threat. As I understand it, in 2011 more than 10,000 terrorist attacks
occurred in around 70 countries, resulting in almost 45,000 casualties
and more than 12,500 fatalities. About three-quarters of those attacks
occurred in the Near East and south Asia, but in 2011 attacks in Africa
and the western hemisphere were at a five-year high. The figures
indicate that in the 12 months to 30 September 2012—I am not
sure if there are any more recent figures—there were 245
terrorism-related arrests in Great Britain; 45 people were charged with
terrorism-related offences and 18 convicted, with a further
25 people awaiting trial. At the end of 2012, 122 people were in prison
in Great Britain for terrorist, extremist or terrorism-related
offences, including those on remand. As the noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, has
already mentioned, the sentencing in a case yesterday reminded us of
the brutality and savagery that can be involved in such offences in our
own backyard in broad daylight. The value and importance of the work
that our police and security services do to protect us cannot be
overestimated<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:37:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000187">In
their last annual report on the UK’s strategy for countering
terrorism, the Government stated that there were now hundreds of
foreign fighters from Europe in Syria and that, as and when UK
residents return here, 
<?notus-xml column=409?>there is a risk that they may carry out attacks using what were
described in the report as the skills that they have developed
overseas. The most recent annual report of the Intelligence and
Security Committee of this Parliament also referred to the increasing
potential for those who travel overseas to train and fight alongside
one of the al-Qaeda affiliate groups to subsequently return to the UK
and pose a direct threat to the UK’s national security. The
report went on to say that what was most significant in this regard was
the growing trend for UK resident extremists to join elements of the
opposition in Syria, and that this was likely to form part of the
terrorist threat picture for years to come. The report said that the
shape of the terrorist threat was potentially changing from what it
described as tightly organised cells to looser networks of small groups
and individuals who operate more independently, and that it was
essential that the agencies continued to make a clear assessment of
this evolving picture in order to keep ahead of the
threat<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000188">We
have had a much more recent update on the position, with the head of
the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism being reported in the
media as saying that the biggest challenge now facing the police and
intelligence agencies was the size of extremist groups in Syria and the
number of Britons joining them. He was reported as having gone on to
say that the number of foreign fighters in Syria was higher than
anywhere since Afghanistan in 1989, and that Syria was different from
any other counterterrorism challenge that this country had faced since
9/11 because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the
fighting; their size and scale; the number of people from this country
who are joining them; the ease of travel; the availability of weapons;
and the intensity of the conflict. Statements along very similar lines
have also been made recently by the head of Scotland Yard’s
counterterrorism
unit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000189">There
have been suggestions—I stress that that is all they
are—that there may now be new laws being considered by the
Government. That would of course be an interesting development; the
Government have hardly strengthened our ability to keep a check on the
potentially most dangerous people, since the Government’s own
terrorism prevention and investigation measures, which placed the most
menacing terror suspects under special, albeit watered down,
restrictions were, I assume—subject to the Minister telling me
otherwise—brought to an end, as intended, a month or so
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T15:40:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000190">The
independent reviewer of terrorism legislation has confirmed that those
who were the subject of terrorism prevention and investigation measures
and their special restrictions were considered the most dangerous
threats even by the standards of international terrorism. In relation
to one who absconded, the Secretary of State simply tried to assert
that the only reason why that individual had been made subject to a
TPIM was to prevent them travelling to support terrorism overseas. In
the light of the recent warnings about Syria, that suggests that if
that really is the Government’s criterion, rather more people
should be being placed on TPIMs instead of allowing the measures to
lapse after two years with the consequences that we now see. It would
certainly be helpful if the Minister could indicate what the additional
cost has been, in terms of extra surveillance, 
<?notus-xml column=410?>of watering down the previous control orders and replacing them with
TPIMs, and what is now the additional cost of surveillance of those
who, I assume, were until a month or so ago subject to a TPIM and its
associated restrictions, but are no longer so even though there has
presumably no change in the assessment of the serious threat that they
represent to national
security.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022777000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022777000191">Perhaps
the Minister could also say if the Government are indeed considering
new laws. Are the Government considering activating the Enhanced
Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures Bill, which, in
essence, reinstates control orders? Is Clause 60 of the Immigration
Bill, on deprivation of citizenship, the Government’s response?
A number of steps were initiated following the work of the task force
set up by the Prime Minister on tackling radicalisation and extremism.
What is the position now in regard to the implementation of those
steps, and what consideration is being given to any further steps that
may be needed in the light of very recent concerns that have been

actions that we take need to give at least as much attention to

We face a real and serious threat from terrorism, and this threat

dear. The police and the intelligence 
<?notus-xml column=411?>agencies do an outstanding job in identifying and disrupting terrorist

Marathon and the Nairobi shopping mall, which resulted in 60 deaths,
six of them British nationals. All this goes to show that terrorism is
an international problem. The numerous casualties of terrorism are
found in many countries. Our partnerships with international allies are
vital to the protection of the UK and our interests overseas, and
innocent people everywhere. The noble Lord, Lord Ahmed, should be

I hope that as I recount these I will reassure noble Lords about this
strategy. Our strategy is to prevent people becoming terrorists. Our

distorted ideologies that can lead to violence and to support those who

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:28:22"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
first thank everyone who bothered to put their name down for this
debate. I would like to say why I felt that a discussion on this matter
would be worth while. When we start talking about concussion and
injuries and the areas around them it is important to try to get the
whole situation in context. When it comes to head injuries there is
always 
<?notus-xml column=414?>a great deal of fear within any organisation, and quite rightly so,
because we are not entirely sure what happens. If your head goes,
everything goes. Every time you talk about this, in particular when
there is the idea that children will be involved, there is a fear
reaction. Also, in sport—and this is probably very true of my
own sport, rugby union—there is the machismo. “Well, it
didn’t do me any harm”, a player will say as he twitches
and staggers. However, that reaction always comes
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000006">I want to
look at a debate which started at the elite level of the game. Here I
pay tribute to Chris Bryant MP, who I first met on the Commons and
Lords rugby trip about 10 years ago. Not a bad centre, likes to run
straight and does not miss many tackles: that is my assessment of
Chris. He has done a great deal of work at the professional end of the
game. In the period of time since I had my flirtation with the top end
of the game—and when push comes to shove it was a
flirtation—professional rugby union players have got bigger,
stronger and harder. They have gained weight and got fitter. They are
now basically monsters. One of the biggest changes in the game is that
they now take the defence more seriously and look for heavier
collisions more
frequently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000007">The
other side is that those players are professionals. They have a
structure which looks after them, which is aware of them and has
invested in them on dozens of different levels to observe what is going
on. At all levels there is a great incentive to make sure that people
are functioning properly. Most of sport does not have that. It is also
the case that most sport is played at an amateur or community-level
basis, where people are not playing or training primarily because they
are paid but because they want to be there. They enjoy the process.
There are some, possibly not in this debate but quite frequently in
other situations, who cannot understand this process and the fact that
people enjoy what they are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000008">Virtually
all sports have a danger of concussion and head injury. They involve
people moving around and bumping into each other, and occasionally
bumping into very hard balls travelling very fast. All sport has an
element of risk. All sport will have to try to adjust and ensure it
knows what it is doing. All of sport will have to interact with the
National Health Service to make sure that these problems do not become
chronic. As we become more aware of these problems we tend to discover
more of
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000009">At the
amateur, more participatory, casual end of sports, people frequently
play more than one sport. The specialist at the top end will
concentrate on one sport alone. That is why I frame this debate in
these terms. Rugby union, rugby league and possibly gridiron football,
although not that much of it is played in this country, look for a
collision, as do the martial arts. In other sports it will occur as an
inevitable part of the game at even the most casual level. In
basketball, players are not supposed to hit each other, but people jump
up for the ball and two of them can hit each other. If they do not
clash heads and elbows, there is a nice hard surface to bang their
heads on. It will occur. For example, in football, if the defender,
goalkeeper and the forwards all go up for the same ball, all trying 
<?notus-xml column=415?>to head it—or the goalkeeper punch it—there is the
possibility of impact. It has occurred at the top level of the
game<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000010">I
have tried to look at how all sports manage to get the information
running through themselves about what they should do and how they
manage to get this down to the more vulnerable groups. In this case,
children and the young are more at risk—more of them apparently
have head injuries and more come into casualty. Much of this may be
simply because the young climb trees, for instance, or cross roads less
carefully than others, but it still occurs. They are more at risk not
only from the one incident but the secondary incident. How do we take
this on board and encourage the sports themselves to identify when
somebody is at risk? How do we make sure that the people who are in
charge of the organisations and of coaching know to tell the rest of
them when to step down? How do we tell the medical services when they
should take action and when they should tell you to go home? Very
importantly, how do we tell them when not to
overreact?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000011">There<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:05:52"></hs_TimeCode>
is a general consensus that exercise is the wonder drug. It helps
prevent types of cancer and even dementia. Most people take exercise,
at least initially, through a sport. If we could all be trained to jog
the 2.3 miles 2.4 times a week that are required to keep our bodies
healthy, we all would and we would not have to worry about
this—but we do not, as people find it basically fairly boring.
How do we interact and make sure that this is going
on?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000012">When<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:06:27"></hs_TimeCode>
it comes to examples of good practice, the best culture I have seen for
dealing with injuries is probably in anything to do with riding or the
equestrian world. I live in Lambourne, the valley of the racehorse, and
in National Hunt jumping, people come off the horses fairly frequently.
I have seen quite an intimidating tea-towel about some old National
Hunt jockey—I cannot remember which one, but he had X number of
wins, rides and broken bones—which showed which bones he had
broken flying off a horse. In that sport, a hard hat is the thing you
absolutely always wear. The sport knows that people get hurt and it
shares doctors now with rugby union. In rugby union, you probably have
twice the amount of person to practise on but similar types of
injury<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:07:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000013">How
do you get that culture down into the grass roots? Rugby union has a
very good scheme, which seems to be a brand leader, called “Use
your head”. It comes down to a culture of making sure that
introductory-level coaches are taught how to deal with people who have
head injuries. Will the Minister encourage all sports to get similar
types of schemes going? We need to encourage people to take
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000014">Also<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>,
how do the medical services react? They should not just say,
“Don’t do it” for X number of weeks. That would
mean people will ignore you, because most of the time—statistics
prove this—although you have a slight headache and feel slightly
giddy, you are
fine<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>. We do not
want to go back to assuming that you are not in danger, but most of the
time you are fine. It is when this gets compounded and, on the odd
occasion, the freak event and the panic occur. How do we square 
<?notus-xml column=416?>this circle of reaction? Can we please have some guidance about what are
the best schemes? How can we address this and get
through?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000015">We<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:08:33"></hs_TimeCode>
are told not to go to accident and emergency all the time as we are
clogging up the doors. Will the other elements of the National Health
Service know when to refer you on, when to tell you not to panic, when
to tell you to rest and when to come back? That is what I am trying to
get at. If we overreact here and act inappropriately we get rid of the
benefits of sport. If we do not react at all, we will have occasional
cases of tragedy and then more commonly occurring cases of impairment
and damage in later life. We have got to work these together. What are
the best practices for what we are doing and how are we going to bring
them together? That is what I am trying to get at
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000016">I hope
that this is the start of a process in which the NHS and all the
sporting bodies talk to each other. They need to ensure that there is
communication at the grass roots, at the schoolboy—or
schoolgirl—level, and that people know what is going on and what
is best practice. If they do not, we are in danger of creating another
case where overreaction, bluff and basic ignorance mean that we end up
with slightly less competition—not just in sport but in any
competitive environment—and a few tragedies are the result. We
do not want that. We want to go forward with activity and safety. That
is something that we can achieve and we should try
to.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/4F363FA15190D7F12BF6BCE50CDA33346C081FBC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2014">Thursday,

and important. It is timely because it comes on the eve of the
screening next week at the Curzon cinema here in London of the world
premiere of “Head Games: The Global Concussion Crisis”,
which will spark nationwide comment and debate. From the acclaimed
director Steve James, it is a revealing documentary featuring
neurological findings related to rugby and soccer players that will
serve as a wake-up call for those who think that the devastating and
chronic effects of repetitive head trauma are found only in American
football and boxing. The film is inspired by the book <I>Head
Games</I><I>: Football’s Concussion Crisis</I>, written by the
former Ivy League football player and WWE wrestler Christopher
Nowinski. I believe it will capture the attention of the sports world,
and it is already causing a stir in the United

is increasingly recognised as a serious medical condition that is
interesting legislators around the world. Indeed, it is the only
medical condition whose treatment is currently mandated by legislation
in the United States. This is the result of the Zackery Lystedt law,
started in Washington state, home of the Seattle Seahawks, by the
Seahawks’ doctor, Dr Stan Herring, after a terrible accident
involving a teenager, Zackery Lystedt. There are now Zackery Lystedt
laws in 49 of the 50 states of the union; Mississippi is the only one

Zackery Lystedt law states, first, that concussion education must be
delivered to parents, coaches and players in all sports, not just
contact sports. Secondly, after a concussion the player must be removed
from play and not allowed back on to the pitch. Thirdly, 
<?notus-xml column=417?>after a concussion the player cannot be allowed to return to sport until

have no legislation in the United Kingdom and, as my noble friend Lord
Addington has highlighted, individual sports vary greatly in their
attitude towards concussion management. That is the urgent issue that
needs to be addressed. My noble friend mentioned horseracing, which is
way ahead of the rest and started a management programme in 2004. The
work that Dr Michael Turner, until recently chief medical
officer of the Jockey Club, has done for jockeys has been world-leading

trialling new and appropriate codes; for example, the five-minute
concussion timeout to allow doctors to assess and diagnose concussion.
Speaking from a non-medical perspective, that seems a totally
inadequate length of time and yet rugby has put many of the issues
under consideration on the world stage. The highly controversial
decision to allow Australia’s George Smith to return to action
during his side’s third-test defeat to the British and Irish
Lions last year, despite clearly having been concussed, has prompted
one of a series of changes to the global trial of the pitch-side
suspected concussion assessment, the PSCA protocol.</hs_para>

all is education at the grass roots. At the moment there is nothing in
this country that is structured for coaches, parents and clubs. That is
a very serious state of affairs, which should concern all sports
administrators and politicians. The South Africans have a great
programme in this context called BokSmart, which should seriously be
considered by all our governing bodies. The Canadians have Parachute

information is the latest concussion consensus statement from Zurich
2012. It recently emphasised, once again, the need for education and in
the United Kingdom all sports, not only contact sports, have faced the
consequences of this. In soccer, there were changes to pitch-side
assistance and medical requirements soon after the Reading-Chelsea
match when Petr Cech sustained a depressed skull fracture and then the
substitution goalie sustained a concussion, leaving John Terry in

Australians are probably the leaders internationally given the work
being done in Aussie rules football in particular. Many sports are now
caught up in the debate—NFL, ice hockey, FIFA, boxing,

needs to be done? In this country we could create a national concussion
and head injury research centre. This could address all of these
issues, bring them together and ensure that what we are debating today
is not a series of different practices across sports, clubs and schools
but a centre capable of bringing together all research in this area and
then disseminating it to all sports in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Above
all, we need consistency in the approach of the national governing

I may set this in context. The current definition of concussion was
first agreed in 2001 at the Vienna concussion consensus conference and
has remained largely unchanged over the subsequent three
meetings—the Prague concussion conference and then in 2008 at
Zurich 1 and in 2012 at Zurich 2. It has been recognised that
concussion is a complex neural process that does not involve any
structural brain damage and does not produce any changes on
conventional imaging—for example, an MRI scan. Normally it
resolves spontaneously in seven to 10 days without medical
intervention. However, it may linger on, and post-concussion syndrome
may lead to long-term

the subject of long-term concerns, recent research published in the USA
suggests that multiple concussions or sub-concussive impacts might lead
to a serious brain condition called chronic traumatic encephalopathy.

America against the governing bodies of professional sports, the NFL

noble friend focused his remarks on the sports with the highest
incidence of concussion. We need to look at all sports. Dr Turner, to
whom I have referred, recognised that if concussion does not involve
any structural damage it is reasonable to suggest that a little more
impact would lead to a few nerve fibres becoming damaged or dying. He
refers to this as concussion plus. You cannot tell the difference
between concussion and concussion plus. They are indistinguishable at

Grey-Thompson (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Addington, for tabling this timely debate. The issue of concussion has
been gaining momentum over recent months. The journalist Anne Peters
has written extensively about it and it comes on the back of the
announcement last August of the case 
<?notus-xml column=419?>of the NFL in the USA, where 4,500 athletes took a class action suit and
sued the league. The league agreed to pay out a total of $765 million
to fund concussion-related compensation, medical exams and
research<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:20:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, raised the issue of “Head
Games”. Unfortunately, I cannot make the premiere next week, but
I have read the book instead. It makes stark reading in terms of the
information it lays in front of us. Who can forget the tragic case of
Ben Robinson who died in 2011? He was a young man who died after being
concussed on the pitch three times. I spoke to Ben’s father
Peter this morning. It was very emotional. It is hard enough reading
about Ben’s case, but it is incredibly powerful listening to a
man talking about his son who died playing the sport he came to love.
It is probably fair to say that Ben was not a natural rugby player, but
he was really good at the sport and was one of the best players on the
team. The hardest part was listening to Peter say that Ben’s mum
Karen had been at the game and she realised that something was not
right, but did not feel that she had any power to stop the game going
ahead. When she did try to intervene, she was told to “calm
down<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:20:59"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

argument in making us realise that we have to involve many people and
governing bodies in the discussion. I absolutely do not want to stop
children playing sport, because the benefits are greater than being
inactive. Peter told me that Ben received advice on nutrition, training
and absolutely everything except concussion. Peter also said that he
has a younger son who does not play rugby, but he would let him if he
felt that he could do so
safely<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:21:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

information out there, but would I have gone out and looked for it had
I not been taking part in this debate? The answer is no, because I
would have assumed that concussion would not be an issue in most sports
that my daughter and I are involved in. Some of this comes back to how
we educate people. Sport Scotland has issued a really good leaflet
highlighting the issue of concussion and what you have to do if you see
it in a young player. At the launch of the leaflet, Dr
Willie Stewart presented a huge amount of information. He had
interviewed 300 schools from the south-west of Scotland. The good stuff
was that 90% recognised that concussion could be fatal. However, 30% of
the schools said that they would still leave a child with suspected
concussion on the field of play. Curiously, virtually all the 30% who
would have left the child on the pitch would have then informed the
parents that they thought the child had concussion, so there is a bit
of a mismatch in terms of how young people were being treated. The
survey also made it very clear that there was a need for a physical
test in the first 24 hours after injury, but there was not the
understanding that it was important for the brain to rest as
well—that is a really important part of
rehab<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:22:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0001.htm#14022788000035">It
is also interesting that well known rugby players like Will Greenwood
have spoken out on this matter and the need to take it seriously.
However, it is really difficult for current players to speak out,
because it is their career. How much time they spend on the
pitch  
<?notus-xml column=420?>affects their sponsorship, media coverage and future contracts. So I
think it is important that we engage retired players and, I hope,
encourage more competing players to think about
this<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000036">Over
the weekend, I was told the story of a professional club player who was
very clearly concussed but refused to leave the pitch. The good news is
that the referee refused to carry on. That might be easier to do at
club level and it should be hugely applauded. But at a lower level,
where there is a lot of pressure from parents and the children
themselves who want to play, we should not be asking the children,
“Are you okay to play
on<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:23:42"></hs_TimeCode>?”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000037">I
have had a lot of help with preparing for this debate. The RFU has
showed me a lot of information. Rupert Moon, a great Welsh rugby player
and also a friend of mine, put me in touch with a lot of professional
people within the sport who are trying to filter the information down.
But we have to do so much more than we currently do. We have to
recognise that, while there are many stories about rugby, the problem
is about so much more than rugby. Yesterday, in the <I>New York
Times</I>, there was a story about a young man, a 29
year-old former soccer player who died from chronic traumatic
encephalopathy. He is the first named player to have died from this
condition. On a four-point scale of severity he was considered to be at
stage 2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000038">Part
of all this is education and getting people to think about the issue,
no matter whether it is lacrosse, hockey or any other sport we can
think of. We also have to recognise that sport is dangerous. There were
a number of concussion injuries during the recent Winter Olympics,
while Maria Komissarova was injured during ski cross training. She has
undergone a number of operations on her spine. My own husband broke his
back cycling, and indeed many of my friends are in wheelchairs due to
playing sport. I have twice been by hit by cars while out training. By
the end of my career I also knew that, despite all the benefits of
doing sport, I would probably end up with some severe damage to my
back, neck and shoulders, which has happened. But I still believe that
the benefits far outweigh the
risks<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:25:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

some kind of context for this. Stories about sports injuries will
obviously hit the headlines in lots of media outlets, but it is a
question of trying to figure out what the comparable data are.
Statistics from Headway using data extracted from the NHS show some
massive figures for head injuries. During 2011-12, 213,752 people were
admitted to hospital. There has been a 33% increase in UK head injuries
over the past decade. The number of severe traumatic brain injuries is
running at between 10,000 and 20,000 per year in the UK. Interestingly,
men are twice as likely to sustain a brain injury as women, and if we
look at the target groups, it is 15 to 24 year-old males and people
aged over 80. Those figures are important in terms of putting the issue
in context and showing how many people are injured. However, it is hard
to find data for the UK, so measuring data is an area in which we need
to do more
work<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:26:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

blunt trauma in the USA among athletes aged under 21 in organised
high-school and collegiate sport show that there were 261
trauma-related deaths, 1,139 cardiovascular deaths and 427
deaths 
<?notus-xml column=421?>from other causes. If those numbers are broken down by sport, American
football is responsible for 56.7%, track and field 10%, baseball 6.9%
and then gymnastics at 1%, hockey at 1% and weightlifting at 0.4%. The
average number of deaths per year is nine. Again, comparing these
figures against deaths in the general population, some 12,000 are
killed in road traffic collisions, there are 6,000 homicides, 2,500
young people die of cancer and, bizarrely, 50 are killed in
lightning-related incidents, which is interesting. That is why we need
some context in the

very conscious as a mum whose daughter plays a lot of sport that the
temptation is to stand on the sidelines and say, “Come on, you
are all right”. My daughter has never hit her head playing
sport, but when they skid across the hockey pitch one says,
“Come on, darling. Give it a bit of a rub and you’ll be
okay. Get back out there”. That is because there is pressure on
people to carry on playing, and that is much more the case for boys. We
have a culture where it is cool to be a sporty boy but not so cool to
be a sporty girl. I think that that kind of pressure on boys is

received some interesting information from a colleague of mine, David
Sutton, who is the strength and conditioning coach at Northants
Cricket. He has worked in numerous sports. He sent me some information
on fencing, which I had never considered to be a sport where there was
a risk of traumatic head injuries. What is looked for is the natural
position of the arms following concussion. Immediately after moderate
forces have been applied to the brainstem, the forearms are held flexed
or extended, typically in the air, for a period lasting up to a few
seconds. It is interesting that there is a lot of work in this area
through fencing. David Sutton said that this ultimately comes down to
three simple things. We need to educate our PE teachers and coaches. We
need to be unafraid of running a SCAT score in order to check whether a
young person has been injured. It is not enough just to say,
“Are you okay?”. We also need much more training through
accident and emergency departments and GP surgeries so that health
workers understand the realities of

are noble Lords here who have far more experience and understanding of
the subject than me. I wanted to speak in the debate for a number of
reasons, which will become apparent in the next few minutes. I am a
former teacher, and the importance of sport in general, and team sports
in particular, is there for all to see. I do not need to catalogue the
details of that importance. We are becoming an increasingly sports-mad
nation, with more and more people participating in sport in so many
different disciplines.</hs_para>

of the delightful—or less delightful—things about

you have to do some research. The noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson,
mentioned Ben Robinson, who I did not know about until I did some
research. I was saddened by the case of this lad who suffered a double
concussion and died while playing a sport that he loved but, as in so
many other cases like this, the parents immediately took up the issue,
and a campaign was started. There was a meeting with the Scottish
Government, there are leaflets available on what can be done and the
message was developed, “If in doubt, sit them out,” which
has been taken up by American football authorities. Out of this
personal tragedy, a really
important<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>
campaign has started. In my own city, a young boy called Oliver King
died while swimming due to sudden arrhythmic death syndrome. He was 12
years old. As a result of that terrible tragedy, his father set up the
Oliver King Foundation, which campaigns for defibrillators to be placed
in every school. I am pleased to say that the

is not just a matter for sporting authorities. What should we do?
First, we should not assign contact sports some sort of pariah status,
but nor should we pretend that there is not a problem. We should not
believe that there are quick and easy answers, such as a mandatory
three-week rest that will solve the problems. Nor should we believe
that we can spend 15 minutes looking at a cut as a result of a contact
sport, but only a few minutes if there is

doing the research, the person who best summed up for me what our
attitude should be is the rugby player Dean Ryan, and I will leave his
thoughts with you. My noble friend Lord Addington will know that Dean
Ryan had six caps for England and is currently director of rugby at
Worcester Warriors. Bizarrely, he was concussed not while playing rugby
but in the victory celebrations after winning a match when somebody, in
moment of hilarity, actually hit him. Examination showed that he had a

rid ourselves of the effects of a poisoned history and the macho
culture which still pervades the issue of concussion, players have to
believe in the guidance they are getting and this is where my
frustrations lie. The game, the professional game, isn’t getting
it. I’ve been to recent conferences on the subject hoping to
learn the way forward, but instead came away with yet more conflicting
views and argument. What the professional game needs is to be told what
it must do. It must be authoritative and convincing. And until it gets
that guidance there is little chance of persuading players that there
is a way forward; that they can stop running away from the doctor, that
they can stop hiding behind a wall of lies which prevents appropriate

purpose of this debate is to show that we are living in changing times.
Only days ago, we were being thrilled by the Olympics and seeing people
whizzing down slippery slopes on trays and so forth—all
potentially lethal. At the weekend we saw the England and Wales rugby
match; if ever there was a clash of titans, that was it. In past times
we would have accepted the odd bang or fall and expected play to resume
fairly quickly. However, these are new times. The recent medical
evidence has brought with it a far more cautious approach. The
long-term effects cannot be ignored. In fact, the medical evidence has
already affected the views of parents and participants in a whole range
of sports. Rugby union, as has been said, is under more scrutiny than
ever. It is now apparent that parents are 
<?notus-xml column=424?>refusing to allow their children to play that sport, which is something
we all ought to be concerned
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000054">All
sports played at either a competitive or non-competitive level share
the possibility of injury. However, life is strange, and it is not only
contact sports which have become the focus of public attention and
apprehension. Three weeks ago, I went to the ballet at the Royal Opera
House. Before it began, the house manager came forward and said that
two of the dancers had collided at the matinee that day and had mild
concussion. Previously, there would not have been an issue, but the
manager said that he was very sorry but they were unable to dance
tonight and the ballet was cancelled. In the old days, it would have
been on with the
show.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000055">We have
to be very careful now. This is a game-changing period. We cannot
ignore advice, and we have to be sensible. The Government must take
their responsibilities keenly. We do not want to spoil or lose the
beauty and wonder of our sport, but we must ensure that people taking
part are fully protected. I look forward to the Minister’s

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, for tabling the debate
today. As a couple of other noble Lords have admitted, I also have to
admit that this is not an issue that I knew a great deal about prior to
this debate but, now that I have looked into it, I agree with him that
this is a serious problem. I very much look forward to hearing from the
Minister about how the Government are acting to address the
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000057">As the
noble Lord has pointed out, growing awareness has occurred because of
very sad deaths, particularly among several young people. It is
particularly sad when that happens on a school playing field, where
pupils ought to be properly supervised and protected by the highest
standards of safety protocols. Parents should be able to feel assured
that their children are being looked after in that
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000058">However,
there is also growing awareness of the more insidious and widespread
threat of longer-term damage for those who play sports, particularly
professional sports on a regular basis. It is becoming increasingly
clear that a number of sports players who have suffered concussion on a
repeated basis are suffering from dementia and other longer-term brain
issues. That is obviously a particular cause for concern. While it
might not be possible to eradicate the danger completely, we owe it to
amateur and professional sports men and women to invest in research to
understand the dangers better; to provide rules for safe play; to
ensure that staff are educated in diagnosis and response; and to ensure
that there are strict regulations regarding return to play.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022788000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000059">What does this mean in
practice? First, we should welcome the latest Zurich consensus
statement on concussion, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan,
which provides a well informed and practical set of recommendations for
those involved in the healthcare of sports men and women. Their advice
provides diagnostic tools about what should happen 
<?notus-xml column=425?>should concussion be suspected, and emphasises the importance of
standard emergency management procedures to ascertain the extent of the
injury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000060">Importantly,
the advice recommends that it should never be permitted for a player to
return to play on a day where concussion is suspected, not least
because, even if they get up and say, “I feel all right”,
or if their mum and dad say, “Come along, pull yourself together
and get back on the field”, there may be post-injury damage that
is not immediately apparent. This is a particular challenge in
high-level high-contact games such as rugby and football, where both
the player and the medical team may be keen to downplay the injury and
allow the player back on the field. However, as evidence grows of the
longer-term health risks, it becomes more apparent that we need strict
enforcement of the rules on the principle about returning to
play.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022788000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000061">The
guidance that I have just referred to also makes it clear that any
return to play should be on a graduated basis—over a period of a
week is recommended—while tests continue. Again we need to
ensure that this approach becomes standard practice. I would be
grateful if the Minister would confirm whether his
department is taking on board the Zurich conference recommendations and
what discussions are being held with the Department of Health to ensure
that health professionals are more aware of the dangers of this type of
sporting injury and understand the signs that they should look
for.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022788000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000062">Secondly, we need a
clear set of rules specific to children and adolescents, recognising
the particular health dangers for this group whose brains can swell
uncontrollably after a single bang on the head. All schools need to be
aware of the dangers and the steps that need to be followed immediately
an injury is suspected. Every PE teacher should be trained in the
assessment procedures, and should be expected to carry a card that
lists the nine red-flag symptoms that warrant urgent action. Parents
and governors should be expected to check that the necessary staff
training and awareness has taken place and should have a system for
monitoring the responses to sporting accidents, as well as rules for
rest, rehabilitation, and return to play. I agree with many of the
points about the improvements in school procedures made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson. Will the Minister give details of any
discussions held between his department and the Department for
Education about the need to raise standards of care in sporting
accidents, specifically on school
premises?</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000063">Thirdly,
at the professional end of sports, all players and coaches should be
trained to understand the dangers of concussion and its diagnosis. This
should follow the initiative already taken by the rugby union, to which
the noble Lord, Lord Addington, referred, and should extend to other
sports. This is increasingly necessary in the light of the rising
number of concussions that have been recorded per 1,000 hours of play
since 2011. Andy Hazell, who was forced to retire from England rugby
after failing to recover from a concussion injury, rightly made this
point, which was echoed by the noble Lord:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="14022788000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000174">“Players are
getting bigger and faster, and the collisions are getting a lot
bigger”,</hs_quote> 
<?notus-xml column=426?><hs_parafo UID="14022788000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000167">so the challenges in
this particular sport remain high. It is not just rugby union, though;
concussion remains the most common injury in premiership football.
Training and awareness for both players and coaches across all sports
have to be key to improving safety, so will the Minister give details
of discussions held with the governing bodies to roll out a programme
of training for players and coaches across the spectrum for all
sports?</hs_parafo>
<hs_para UID="14022788000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000064">Lastly,
there needs to be a review of what further preventive measures can be
undertaken. It is not good enough to say that these games are
inherently dangerous and that this is the nature of the sport. Where
changes can be made to the rules to protect players from dangerous
practices, they should be introduced. Most sporting rules are not set
in stone; they are constantly being reviewed and updated by their
governing bodies. For example, rugby union rules have been regularly
updated to provide greater protection for individual players without
taking away any excitement of the game, and that can be done across the
board in other sports. We should be asking all sports bodies to review
their rules to see what further steps can be taken to limit impact on
the head, and what penalties should be introduced against those who
flout the rules.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022788000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000065">We should
also be encouraging more research into helmets and other head
protection to ensure that the best possible guards are available and
permitted in the games. Will the Minister reassure us that dialogue is
continuing with sports bodies to encourage research into safety
equipment and to develop safer rules of play? Will he give serious
consideration to the proposal of the noble Lord, Lord Moynihan, for a
meeting to discuss the establishment of a national research centre? I
thought that he made the case very well in his
contribution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000066">The
solution to many of the problems that we debate in this House is better
liaison between departments and more joint working, and that is
certainly true in this debate. The solutions lie in better education,
better awareness among heath professionals and more responsible sports
governing bodies. I hope that the Minister is able to persuade us that
he is taking all these issues on board, and I look forward to hearing
what the department is doing to liaise effectively and improve
performance on this important
issue.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/6CF6918C99104350552EBBAA0AE070F286B42AAD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2014">Thursday,

Gardiner of Kimble (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate
my noble friend on securing this debate on such an important subject. I
thank noble Lords for this illuminating debate. As the noble
Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, and my noble friend Lord Storey
acknowledged at the outset of their speeches, participating in sports
greatly benefits individuals and society, but we must ensure that risks
are minimised and that appropriate medical treatment is available to
all.</hs_para>

injury sustained on the sports field must be treated seriously.
Instances of serious injury are, thankfully, low, with many patients
recovering fully without special intervention. However, a minority
experience complications that must be minimised  
<?notus-xml column=427?>or avoided with early detection and appropriate action. The
noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson, spoke movingly about the tragic

are undoubtedly of concern to governing bodies. From what I have seen,
I believe that they take this matter increasingly seriously, and
responsibly. The Football Association and other sports with experience
of head injuries, such as rugby, American football and ice hockey, are
working together to establish appropriate internal guidance. This point
was raised by my noble friend Lord Addington. The equestrian community,
to which my noble friends Lord Addington and Lord Moynihan referred, is
very much at the forefront of this. We need to ensure that the
experiences of the equestrian world are incorporated into what other
sports are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000070">The FA
rules on head injuries are extensive but, in essence, a player
suffering a head injury must leave the field of play and may then
return only if he is given medical clearance to do so. My noble friend
Lord Addington referred to the amateur and community level of
sport—what I would call the grass-roots end of the
game—where a medic may not be present. There, the default
guidance to all affiliated clubs in the FA is that the player cannot
resume play, and the reintroduction of the player to football in the
following weeks should be tightly controlled. The FA emergency aid
certificate provides club representatives and volunteers with crucial
skills and gives prominence to head injuries and
concussion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000071">As
the leading body on concussion management in sport, the Rugby Football
Union works proactively with the International Rugby Board and

of global exchanges of experience. I have the leaflet produced in

noble friend Lord Storey referred to the “Don’t be a

coaches—it is very important to mention coaches as
well—below professional level to recognise and remove players
with concussion. Some 200,000 concussion awareness cards have been
distributed, and posters have been sent to every member club and
newsletters to every member school. The “HEADCASE”
website has also been adopted by the Medical Officers of Schools

noble Baroness, Lady Jones, rightly raised the important issue of
safety within schools. Many young people engage in sport at school.
Indeed, the Department

noble Baroness, Lady Jones, rightly referred to the need for dialogue.
DCMS Ministers meet DfE Ministers monthly as part of the ministerial

in PE lessons. The departments continue to work together to ensure that
schools have the necessary resources to deliver high-quality PE and
sport, including through professional external partners such as the
Association for PE, and provide guidance and advice on ensuring the
safety and well-being of their pupils when playing sport. The
Association for PE guidance on safe practice in physical education and
sport is available online through the Department for Education. This

sports governing bodies working with schools should ensure that
participation takes place in a safe environment. All national governing
body coaches working in schools should obtain the level 2 coaching
standard, which includes basic first-aid skills as a minimum
requirement. Indeed, as part of the school games initiative,
in which around 17,000 schools take part, national governing bodies

provide safe, meaningful and appropriate competition to all pupils
regardless of age, ability or
disability<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:55:48"></hs_TimeCode>. As

the welcome for this statement, which of course forms part of the
learning that is increasingly being developed in the area of head

healthcare provider using standard emergency management principles or
be safely removed from practise or play for urgent referral to a
physician<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T16:56:48"></hs_TimeCode>. The

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:02:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, each
year in the United Kingdom, between 600 and 800 young people aged 15 to
24 take their own lives. Under the age of 35, the number rises to more
than 1,700. In England and Wales, around 24,000 attempted suicides are
made by 10 to 19 year-olds. To put this in another way, as appeared
recently in the national press, that represents one every 20
minutes<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:02:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000084">In
Northern Ireland, since the signing of the Belfast agreement, the
number of suicides almost equals the number of killings during the
years of our Troubles. Professor Tomlinson of Queen’s University
has concluded that the steep increase in the Province’s suicide
figures are accounted for in part by those who lived through the
Troubles as children in the 1970s—some of the worst years of our
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:03:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000085">These
are truly shocking figures. The statistics from across the United
Kingdom are the reason for my Question to the Government this evening.
Last week’s release of the latest UK suicide statistics shows a
welcome decrease in the number of young people under the age of 35 who
took their own lives during 2012 compared with the previous year: 1,625
compared with 1,746 in 2011. This fact is welcomed by the many
charities that do such valuable work among young people. I will quote
the words of the chief executive of one of those charities, PAPYRUS
Prevention of Young Suicide. He
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="14022788000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000175">“While
we welcome this downward trend, suicide remains the highest cause of
death for men and women in the 15 to 34 age group in England and
Wales.”</hs_quote><hs_para UID="14022788000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000086">Taken
against the figures for suicide in the United Kingdom as a whole across
all age groups, it might seem as if I am asking noble Lords to consider
a small proportion of this tragic problem. However, any of us here or
further afield who in our professional lives have seen first-hand the
emotions of parents and families where a young person has succeeded in
taking their own life, or indeed attempted to do so, have little doubt
of the impact on family life and community reaction.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022788000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000087">So what are we talking
about in this debate? A future of possibilities, a lifetime of promise
and usefulness cut short; shattered hopes unfulfilled; hopes never
realised. There are the inevitable questions, none of which have easy
answers: why, how, and could it have been prevented? Then there is the
agony of parents—“Where did we go wrong?”. Much
research over the years has been devoted to seeking answers to those
questions. That research has produced a complex and at times
contradictory picture. It has spoken of broken homes and family
relationships, drug and alcohol abuse, mental and emotional conditions,
bullying, the  
<?notus-xml column=431?>influence of the social network on vulnerable lives, and the impact of
certain aspects of television and some films that seem to cheapen the
gift of life and paint a picture of the glorification of self-inflicted
sacrifice of life.</hs_para>

emerges: each case represents individual circumstances and needs.
Therein, I suggest, lies the problem, not just for government but for
society. Prevention calls for a multifaceted and multidimensional
approach. It calls for many disciplines to work in
collaboration—social services, the medical profession, charities
and the churches, to name but a few—and for a sharing of
information. However, research is expensive, and in today’s
economic climate many charities ask about government priorities in this
field.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022788000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000089">The
recently published <I>Preventing Suicide in England: One Year On</I>
was the first annual report on the cross-government outcomes strategy
to save lives. Of the regions of the UK, Scotland, with its
“Choose Life” campaign, was well resourced and had a
clear implementation strategy, with a 20% target to reduce the rate of
suicide. In Northern Ireland, some £7 million is
allocated annually to suicide prevention, but here in England there is
concern on the part of charities when comparisons are made with
Scotland and Northern Ireland. PAPYRUS claims that had there been as
clear a strategy and sense of purpose as in Scotland, probably 814
lives could have been saved. There is a genuine feeling that the
Government have not granted new resources to deliver their strategy and
have failed to present a clear implementation strategy. That may be the
view of one charity, but I found that it is shared by others. Equally,
there is a growing concern that in various parts of the country
children and adolescent mental health services are seriously
underresourced to meet the growing demands on their
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000090">I
could point to many more aspects of this tragic scene but time permits
me to mention only two. First, how accurate is the picture we have of
the enormity of this problem? In a coroner’s court, a suicide
verdict cannot be given for those under 10 years of age. That means
that many of the figures published tell only part of the tragedy.
Equally, how can we gain an accurate figure of those children
attempting suicide or inflicting self-harm?</hs_para>

that I suggest could be followed and would be welcomed. There is an
urgent need to change the burden of proof used by coroners to reach a
suicide conclusion. The continued use of the criminal standard of proof
is surely unacceptable in this day and age. It contributes immensely to
what so many of us refer to as the stigma surrounding suicide—a
stigma that a lot of us feel inhibits many from seeking help.</hs_para>

positive note. There has been a general welcome for the support of the
Department of Health and the Royal Colleges for the sharing of
information in a suicidal crisis. However sensitive though the issue
may be—and I fully accept the sensitivities of patient
confidentiality—many support the words of the chief executive of
PAPYRUS:</hs_para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T12:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I
warmly congratulate the noble and right reverend Lord on securing this
debate on a critical and all too often overlooked subject. It is a
source of huge pain for all those concerned, not just the loss of life
but for the family, friends and community in which the individual
lives. A traumatic, violent death is bad, but when it is self-inflicted
it is hugely confusing.</hs_para>

historically fraught with stigma—not least, I do not need to
tell the noble and right reverend Lord, in the church. Some 20 years
ago, when I had to formulate the “Health of the Nation”
strategy, there were five areas where we wanted to see improvement,
which the health service or government departments could not deliver
but which required the co-operation of the community and the charities.
Under mental health, my targets in 1992 were indeed reducing the
overall suicide rate by at least 15% by 2000 and reducing the suicide
rate of severely mentally ill people by at least 33% by then. However
much prejudice there was against mentally ill patients at that time,
the greatest danger that they posed was to themselves, and the rate of
those officially receiving mental health care was appalling.</hs_para>

encroach on the area of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, but in
today’s environment the terrible loss of life in young offender
institutions is of great concern, as is the extraordinary influence of
the internet, which in one way can be a source of befriending those at
risk of suicide but, it seems, has somehow been distorted, misused and
abused to actually precipitate suicide events. It is my view that,
rather like when the Member of Parliament for Worthing was very
preoccupied with reducing road accidents, there was a time when more
young people lost their lives in road traffic accidents. Now, of
course, the figure for suicide is higher, and has been for some
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="14022788000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000096">A
campaign to tackle that could not be done just by allocating money. I
fall out with the noble and right reverend Lord for simply thinking
that charities need more money so that they can abuse the Government
further for not giving them more money. The answer here is more subtle
and requires broad
ownership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000097">In
the voluntary sector I want to commend Cruse Bereavement Care, of which
I am a patron. It provides support for those whose relations and
friends have taken their own lives. As the noble and right reverend
Lord touched on, the result is intense anger—how could the
individual have done it?—shame and isolation. You can tell
somebody that your relation died of cancer, but it is still very
difficult to say it of suicide. There is guilt—what more could
we have done? There is confusion—why?—and endless
reproach. It is very hard to achieve a sense of peace when a close
relation has taken their own life. As we know, there are all too many
in our parliamentary family whose children have done
that<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:15:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Waller set up a wonderful charity when their son took his life in 1998.
It works with health, education and the private sector on tackling
depression and giving practical advice to people whose children and
friends might be thinking of suicide. These people might think,
“If I mention suicide, will the individual go over the top and
take their own life?”. Many people are uncertain what the
toolbox is. Traditionally GPs were particularly poorly equipped in
mental health skills, but they are

Government very warmly. I have looked closely at the suicide prevention
strategy. I think it is a tremendous step forward. It is in the context
of the “No health without mental health” keystone of
government policy in relation to health. I am not sure it is just a
question of more money. I am sure that it is constantly reminding that
this is a critical issue, a serious threat to life that people should
not be afraid to discuss and draw to other people’s attention.
For that, again, I praise the noble and right reverend

Linklater of Butterstone:</Member></B> I will go on. I will focus on
suicide among young people in the criminal justice system. They are the
most disadvantaged and damaged in our society, with enormous mental
health needs while being in the care of the state—our care. We
lack adequate skills to recognise and understand the degree of the
vulnerability of many of these young people, with the result that,
since 2000, 282 children and young people have committed suicide while
in custody. Untold numbers of others have tried but did not
succeed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:18:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000103">One
example is that of a 19-year-old girl with no previous convictions and
a long history of self-harm who set fire to her mattress as an act of
self-harm and was remanded in custody for arson with intent to endanger
life—her own. She was recognised as having a personality
disorder but could not be sectioned because she was deemed to be
untreatable, so she continued to self-harm until she strangled herself
to death. Meanwhile, her twin sister, also a self-harmer, found
appropriate support in a therapeutic

staff greatly need training and skills to understand better the needs
of this very vulnerable group, but so do the Government, as their plans
demonstrate. Hence, although restraint is now understood to be hugely
distressing for these children, future plans, under the new Criminal
Justice and Courts Bill, will allow restraint to be used by prison
officers if their orders are not followed. Places at secure
children’s homes—the one source of real
security—are now 
<?notus-xml column=434?>going to be reduced by 17%, and fortified schools will cater for
children who offend. A huge secure training college taking 320 young
offenders—the antithesis of what these children need—is
being planned. Young people over the age of 18, who are indeed just as
needy and immature, will be left only the option of prison.
Vulnerability is an explicit element in remand decisions in the court
but not, amazingly, when it comes to sentencing, apart from mitigation
if imprisonment is being considered. Crucially, sentencers too must be
made more aware of what provision is locally available to them and what
is appropriate for children in such desperate

will children not be included? The factors include, first, inadequacy
of management in the custodial centres, inadequacy of staff training,
multi-agency failure in communicating individual vulnerabilities and
needs, and failure to listen to children. There is also failure to
circulate and implement recommendations which have been laid down in
countless reports by the ombudsman and others, and recommendations made
by coroners in inquests under Rule 43 of the Coroners’
Rules.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000111">The
Ministry of Justice’s reasons for rejecting the report were
that, instead, it would have internal reviews by Ministry of Justice
agencies; it would have discreet specialist reports into such things as
the use of force; it would have better publication of information; and
it would try to expand the scope of the law governing inquests. That
has absolutely nothing to do with the subject of this debate, which is
the prevention of children committing suicide, particularly in custody.
I therefore ask the Minister to do all that he can to persuade his
colleagues to include children in the review by the noble Lord, Lord
Harris of Haringey, so that, among other things, it can include the
Youth Justice Board report which contains many of the factors that it
will need to carry for a slightly younger part of the same age

Association for Young People’s Health recently published its key
data on adolescence. At present, the statistics show that the levels of
self-harm are relatively stable, although for such a sensitive topic
there is likely to be low reporting. It is clear that girls are at
least three times more likely to self-harm than boys; on the other
hand, suicide is much more prevalent among young males, particularly
those aged between 20 and 24. This coincides with the evidence from
ChildLine. Numbers have fallen fractionally in more recent years but
the report questions whether this will
continue<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:26:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000114">How
this correlates with child well-being needs careful consideration. We
all remember the United Nations report about the unhappiness of
children in this country. ChildLine reports that the number of children
contacting it about suicidal feelings has risen for the third year
running, including a rise of 33% in the last year. Overall, child
well-being in the UK, according to the United Nations, has improved
from 21st out of 21 to 16th out of 29 countries. Economic reasons have
been stated and there is much correlation with the commentary from the
Association for Young People’s Health.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="14022788000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000115">Clearly<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:27:21"></hs_TimeCode>
the motives towards suicide are varied but the underlining factor seems
to be lack of self-worth. This is underlined by the evidence of high
rates among 
<?notus-xml column=436?>minority groups. I shall say a word about that later. Whether or not
bullying is a component, although often it is, the social isolation and
lack of affirmation which these young people feel are key components.
It is both encouraging and concerning that more young people are
contacting ChildLine about this. Obviously it is good that they are
communicating, but bad because they say that when they have rung up
other places or have been online, they have not really felt the
understanding or acceptance that they were hoping for. All this shows
that we, as a society, may not be providing sufficient support in the
early days when these young people’s foundations in relational
networks are initially
developed<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:28:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

two particular topics in relation to this. First, bullying is often
directed at those who are different and it is well known that
disability frequently gives rise to despicable behaviour in others.
This is starting to appear insidiously in the area of assisted suicide.
Recently a young man in Northern Ireland telephoned a radio phone-in to
complain that since the increasing cover of assisted suicide cases, he
had noticed a change in people’s attitudes towards his own motor
neurone disease, that he was being asked with increasing regularly if
he had considered suicide. This shows, if nothing else, that the
messages we give young people about their self-worth and their dignity
as human beings is
crucial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000117">Secondly,
on asylum seekers and refugees, many children from these groups suffer
high levels of mental health issues, which is unsurprising given that
many of them have experienced hugely traumatic events. Add to this
their poverty, homelessness, practical and emotional insecurity, let
alone the hostility from the natives, it is not surprising that levels
of well-being and self-worth are significantly
diminished<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:30:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

this is that a society will be judged on how it treats its most
vulnerable members, a matter over which all of us have deep concerns.
Let us at least seek and do all we can to make sure that those who are
struggling, or who are different, do not go on falling through these
gaps.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2014-02-27?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2014_02_27_PT_1/07D8FA62405A2B06D459DA3D5886BCDD90126479" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 27 February 2014">Thursday,

want to talk about how both government and the private sector are
working to try to reduce levels of suicide. I will focus upon the

has been considerable debate in recent weeks about the influence of the
internet and social networking sites on young people vulnerable to
suicide. The truth is, it is much more difficult to reduce access to
potentially harmful information when it is online. The Samaritans has
been focusing on this for a number of years, and its experience shows
that the most effective approach is to both expand the sources of
support to vulnerable people online and also to encourage organisations
which run highly popular sites to develop responsible practices and to
promote sources of
support<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:31:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

approach, the Samaritans has worked in partnership with major companies
to develop practical initiatives to support people at risk of suicide
online. In November 2010, an initiative was launched in partnership
with Google which adds a new feature to search results. The Samaritans
helpline number and a highly visible telephone icon is now displayed
above normal Google search results when people in the UK use a number
of search terms related to suicide. We have also launched a pioneering
new scheme in partnership with Facebook which allows the 30 million
Facebook users in the UK to get help for a friend they believe is
struggling to cope or feeling suicidal. People who are concerned about
a friend on Facebook can report suicidal content such as status updates
or wall posts through the help centre page on the website. The
distressed person then receives an email from the Samaritans offering
to open a line of communication with a volunteer so that they can
access our
services<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

organisations that run these websites, such as social networking sites
and online news media outlets to take action to reduce the availability
of harmful content hosted on their sites. As part of the Samaritans
media monitoring work, we contact newspaper staff directly to suggest
amendments to the online version of articles with potentially harmful
content<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:33:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

difficulties in reducing the risk of suicide online is that the current
research on the internet and suicide is extremely limited. The
Samaritans are therefore working on new research in partnership with
the University of Bristol, funded, I am pleased to say, by the
Department of Health’s policy research programme on how people
with suicidal feelings use the internet and the impact that this has on
suicidal behaviour. We are hopeful that this research will provide new
evidence to help to inform policy and best practice.</hs_para>

an important element of suicide prevention is that support is
immediately available to people in distress, and that people know how
to access it. The Samaritans national helpline number currently uses an
0845 prefix, which means that, while calls from landline phones are
relatively inexpensive, calls from a mobile phone can cost considerably
more. Several years ago, the European Commission decided that certain
services of social value should have the same memorable telephone
numbers in all member states, and should be free. In 2009, therefore,
Ofcom awarded such a number to the Samaritans, which has since launched
a successful pilot of this new free number in limited areas.</hs_para>

At the moment, thankfully, the Big Lottery Fund is funding the rollout
of the free-call service in just 10 areas, targeting those most in need
of a free-to-caller service. This will allow Samaritans to understand
how a free-to-caller number targeting people in socioeconomically
deprived areas will change the nature, volume and pattern of calls. But
the issue that Samaritans urgently needs to resolve is how to make the
service financially sustainable in the long term.</hs_para>

to suicide is bullying. It is shocking that 69% of children in the UK
report being bullied. The National Centre for Social Research report on
bullying showed that each year 16,000 children are out of school
long-term with depression because of bullying, and that there are at

Goth couple who jumped together in front of a train. Red Balloon works
with suicidal bullied children, offering intensive recovery and
education support so that children can return to mainstream school and
to their friends and society. However, only a handful of places are
available nationally, and CAMHS beds are also limited, not to mention
the constant problems around funding. My worry is this: does that
reflect the value we place on these tragically short lives? Much more
is needed to get early support to youngsters before depressive thoughts
of death turn into the horror of young suicide, which affects family

particular group of young people for whom suicide and attempted suicide

am indebted to Stonewall, as is so often the case in these debates, for
providing me with some deeply disturbing figures. According to a study
conducted for the organisation by Cambridge University two years ago,
almost one in four lesbian, gay and bisexual young people say that they
have tried to take their own lives. That is a truly shocking figure
when compared with the estimate of 7% of young people in the general
population. The same research showed that gay young people who are
bullied are tragically much more likely to take their own lives. More
than seven in 10 of those who suffer homophobic bullying contemplate
suicide 
<?notus-xml column=440?>at some point, and half of them have symptoms consistent with clinical
depression. Let me put these appalling figures into the human context.
The Stonewall study highlights the case of a 15 year-old boy called

found dead in his bed by his father in Colchester almost exactly a year
ago. His case was highlighted by the publication <I>Pink News,
</I>which does an excellent job of campaigning in such crucial policy
areas. As my noble friend said, Ayden, who had come out to his parents
just a few months before his death, left two suicide notes outlining
the homophobic and racist bullying he had experienced. He had been
targeted with consistent violence, abuse and malicious allegations
because of his sexuality and his Japanese origins.</hs_parafo>

huge strides have been made in recent years in the battle for equality
for gay men and women, it is a sad fact that there is still too much
homophobic bullying in some schools, much of it now done through the
internet, which can all too often lead to tragedy. There are too many
Aydens, but there need not be. There is a great deal that schools can
do to turn the tide. Much of it is set out in Stonewall’s
excellent “Education for All” packs, including schools
having clear and promoted policies on tackling homophobic bullying,
whether it is physical bullying or cyberbullying. It makes clear that
school staff should be trained to spot problems and to provide young
people with information and support to keep them safe, signposting them
in the direction of professional help when they need it. It means that
school nurses should make clear that young people can talk to them in
confidence about their sexual orientation, and be aware, too, of the
particular mental health issues they may face, intervening as necessary
to support them. Local health services have a role to play in working
alongside schools to focus on early intervention, a subject mentioned
by my noble friend Lady Brinton, which is absolutely crucial because
early intervention is the sort of thing that might have saved the life
of a young man like Ayden. Local health services can also help train
their staff on the particular issues that young gay boys and girls
might face as they struggle with their identity.</hs_para>

we passed the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act last year, with a huge
majority in this House, many may have believed that the dark shadow of
inequality, prejudice and intolerance was now behind us. It is a deeply
regrettable fact that in too many communities those basest of human
instincts are alive and well and, as we have heard, have deadly
consequences. It will take many years to tackle that, but in the
meantime we can and should do a great deal more to protect those who we
know are most vulnerable—young people who are struggling because
they are different. Will the Minister restate the Government’s
strong commitment to tackling this issue and encouraging all

Royall of Blaisdon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an
excellent, albeit painful, short debate, for which I, too, thank the
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Eames. We have heard the
devastating facts and figures. Each and every young life lost through
suicide is a tragedy, of course, to the young person, but also, as has
been said, to the family and friends who love
them<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:46:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

am ashamed that in the 21st century in a wealthy developed country with
so many advantages and where we know the effects of bullying behaviour,
too many young people contemplate or attempt suicide, too often
successfully. I recognise the strains and stresses in our society,
where there is great pressure to succeed and where much is expected of
individuals, but who are not always able to live up to their own
expectations, let alone those of their peers or society. Feelings of
inadequacy, of being different, can be made acute by the media,
including social media. The report, <I>Alone with My Thoughts</I>,
produced last year, showed that nearly one-third of young people have
contemplated or attempted suicide. This is a shocking statistic that I
discussed with a friend in the forest who works in mental health. She
suggested that there needed to be better training for staff in schools
to identify the difference between perceived lack of motivation and
depression and between anxiety and apathy, and that more support was
needed around low confidence and self-esteem, especially in the world
of social networking, where cyberbullying is
rife<hs_TimeCode time="2014-02-27T17:47:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022788000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-gc0002.htm#14022788000141">I
also know from talking to students that there is a similar problem in
some colleges and universities. The Government have a suicide
prevention strategy which includes the development of an e-portal for
children, young people and those working with them. This is welcome,
but will the Minister say how he will ensure that young people and
their teachers will know about it? I also wonder what training, if any,
teachers have to enable them to identify those children with mental
health needs or those who are being bullied. Should not all staff
working with children and young people receive training in mental
health, including suicide prevention training? Some excellent charities
are working in this area, including YoungMinds, but they rightly say
that, despite the Government’s rhetoric or good intentions, we
are a long way from seeing parity between physical and mental
health.</hs_para>

people’s mental health is a vital issue that must be
prioritised. It is not acceptable that in 51 of England’s 58 NHS
mental health trusts there were 350 under-18s admitted to adult wards
in the first nine months of 2013-14. This marks a 36% increase on the
previous 12 months. Will the Minister say what action the Government
are taking to ensure that under-18s are not admitted inappropriately to
adult psychiatric wards and that, when they are sent to young
people’s units, they are not hundreds of miles from home? Young
people aged 16 to 25 are going through a 
<?notus-xml column=442?>number of transitions. If they are in contact with mental health
services, there is the additional transition from child and adolescent
services to adult services. I would be grateful for an assurance that
steps are being taken to ensure that adequate care and support is given
at this difficult time. A difficult transition can make young people
disengage with services, with the risk that their mental health
problems will become entrenched and harder to

Trust has produced an excellent report, <I>Youth Index 2014</I>, the
message of which is clear: long-term unemployed young people are in
desperate need of support. Some 40% of jobless young people say that
they have faced symptoms of mental illness, including suicidal
thoughts, feelings of self-loathing and panic attacks as a direct
result of unemployment. I pay tribute to the extraordinary work of the
Prince’s Trust, which is helping these young people, many of
whom grow up in poverty and face an increased risk of mental health
problems as a result. The same is said in a recent report by the
Samaritans, which reports that there are systematic socioeconomic
inequalities in suicide risk defined by job, class, education, income
or housing. Whatever indicator is used, people in the lower positions

suggest that the changes the Government are making to social security,
including the bedroom tax, are exacerbating or creating problems for
people who are already struggling, so clearly it is important that the
Government rapidly monitor the effect of the changes and take the
requisite action. My friends in mental healthcare tell me that, as a
consequence of the changes, the pressure on their services grows by the

suicide rate among teenagers is below that in the general population
and has remained steady over the past few years. However, we know that
this group is vulnerable to suicidal feelings, as has been made
abundantly clear in this debate. The risk is greater when they have

alcohol or have experienced family breakdown, mental health problems or
suicide in the family. However, any suicide is one too many.</hs_para>

have also been clear that social media sites need to take
responsibility for inappropriate content that is made available on
their sites, which includes images of self-harm and suicide. We expect
social media companies to respond quickly to incidents of abusive
behaviour and inappropriate content on their networks. This includes
having easy-to-use reporting tools, robust processes in place to
respond promptly when abuse is reported and, where appropriate,
suspending or terminating the accounts of those who do not comply with
the acceptable-use policies. The Minister for Culture, Communications

is good to report that the industry has already worked on positive

suicide prevention in England. More than 50 national organisations have
signed this call for action, committing to work together so that fewer
lives are lost to suicide and to support those who are bereaved or
affected by suicide. My noble friend prompted 
<?notus-xml column=444?>me on the issue of the promised round table. I reiterate to her that
free-to-caller access to the excellent Samaritans service would be an

Samaritans have also been instrumental in developing media guidelines
for the reporting of suicide. Those guidelines are aimed not only at
journalists reporting suicide but also at authors and producers of

draft Strategy builds on the good progress we have made so far in
tackling child poverty. Despite the tough economic climate, employment
has increased by 1.3 million since 2010 and the number of children in
workless households has fallen by 274,000. Poor children are doing
better than ever at school; the proportion of children on free school
meals getting good GCSEs including English and maths has increased from
31% in 2010 to 38% in 2013.</hs_para>

we are publishing an in-depth evidence review which identifies what
leads families to be stuck in poverty and what leads poor children to
become poor adults. By identifying and understanding the root causes of

on the evidence in the review, our Strategy sets out the action
Government is taking to tackle child poverty. It sets out how we will

adults through raising their educational
attainment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="14022775000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/140227-wms0001.htm#14022775000014">However,
central government action cannot, by itself, end child poverty. Action
is also needed by employers, the devolved administrations, local areas

The original £28 million estimate has been

operators are required to apply to the Secretary of State for any
increase in tolls regardless of how big or small. This process can be
costly and time consuming for the operator, and will often involve a
public inquiry. These costs are likely to be passed on to the user
