reinvent it all over again and keep picking away at the issue, what

tell his constituents that we will not put a cap on social care costs;
we will not deliver a single tier pension; we will not pass legislation
to have a national insurance contribution cut for employers? I think
that we should stick to the priorities of the British people, which are

I am surprised that the right hon. Lady wishes the Government to
interfere directly in competition investigations. It was her Government
who rightly moved competition authorities on to an independent basis.
We believe it is very important to have independent competition
authorities, because that strengthens their ability to act.

commodities trading. An issue to be considered—we have seen it
with LIBOR and the gas market manipulation allegations and now we see
it today—is how price reporting agencies operate. They are
unregulated bodies, as they were under the previous Government. She
will know that the International Organisation of Securities Commissions
has been looking into both price reporting agencies in general and oil
markets specifically. It reported to the G20 last November, stating
that it had potential concerns about the operation of the global
market. It did not refer to any particular allegations of manipulation,
but there is an ongoing debate, globally as well as in this country,
about how we deal with price reporting agencies given that there have
been instances of market manipulation. We are taking action; the

right hon. Lady’s final question was what was the state of play
with respect to the Ofgem review of gas market manipulation. She
described it as an investigation, but I clarify that it is a review of
the allegations. She will also know that Ofgem is independent. We do
not expect an independent investigator or regulator to give the
Government day-by-day reports as that would go against its independent
nature and reduce its power. I would be surprised if the Labour party

to the right hon. Gentleman for his point of order. I believe that
there is a need to interpret the Standing Orders in a way that
facilitates the business of the House in a developing parliamentary
context. Conditions and expectations today are very different from
those in October 1979, when that Standing Order was made. I must tell
the House that I have studied the wording of Standing Order No. 33 very
carefully. My interpretation is that the words “a further
amendment” in the fifth line of the Standing Order may be read
as applying to more than one amendment successively. In other words,
only one amendment selected by me is being moved at any time. Once that
amendment is disposed of, a further amendment may then be called. I am
extremely grateful to the right hon. Gentleman—almost as
grateful, I suspect, as he is to
me.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13051531000241" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0001.htm#13051531000241">1.30

The figures for France are disappointing. France has gone into
recession. It is in the eurozone, trapped in austerity, and its economy
is not growing. I looked at the figures today to see what French growth
had been since the Chancellor’s spending review compared with
the UK. Since the spending review in 2010, growth in France has been
1.1% and growth in the UK has been 1.1% as well, compared with Germany,
which has had three times more growth, and America, which has had four
times more growth. The eurozone is locked into austerity by virtue of
those countries’ membership of the single currency. Our
Chancellor imposed on our economy austerity that went too far, too
fast, and what has happened? He has delivered the same growth
performance over the last two years as that of the French economy, well
behind that of Germany and America, where, as we now know, the deficit

have consistently said that they had to stick to the plan, even though
growth was low, even  
<?notus-xml column=659?>though the deficit was not coming down and even though living standards
were under pressure, because otherwise they would lose the triple A
credit rating. Now, they have lost the triple A rating, but they still
maintain that they have to stick to the plan. That is completely
illogical. The credit rating agency said in terms that it had
downgraded us because there was no growth in the economy, and that that
was choking off deficit reduction. Sticking with a failing plan that is
not working and that has resulted in the deficit reduction being
stalled is not the way to keep our credit rating—if that is the
Government’s objective. The way to keep it is to get the economy
moving, get people investing and get people back into long-term
sustainable jobs. Until we do that, the Chancellor is going to continue

The whole point about confidence in the British economy is that people
need confidence in Britain’s ability to get out of the economic
mess that his Government left us in. This is not about the absolute
level; it is about market confidence. He must surely understand that

explain to the hon. Lady the term structure of interest rates. The
10-year bond yields are the accumulation of market expectations of
three-month interest rates added up every three months over 10 years.
Why are our long-term interest rates so low? It is because people think
that short-term rates are going to stay low because the economy is flat
on its back. People would have to be economically illiterate to think
that our long-term interest rates were driven by market confidence at a
time when we are being downgraded by the agencies. Our long-term

way in which credit ratings work. Let us not forget that in 2007 these
same credit rating agencies were saying, “Stick with Lehman
Brothers” and giving America a triple A rating despite all the
sub-prime lending. That 
<?notus-xml column=660?>is the reality. The fact is that the credit rating agencies are
downgrading Britain because our economy is not growing. That is the

will give the hon. Gentleman a bit of ground, however. It is true that
the Labour Government left a longer-term interest rate structure than
other economies. We had far less foreign currency borrowing and more
index-linked borrowing than other countries. That helped, but the
fundamental thing was that we did not join the single currency. In
Spain, Italy and elsewhere, we see a currency risk premium, which
relates to the central bank’s ability and willingness to stand
behind sovereign debt. That is not an issue here. Our interest rates
are low, and they have fallen because our economy is not growing. The
market is therefore reflecting expectations of continuing stagnation. I

rhetoric of the

have checked this, and, sadly, it is true. A rather more serious
Conservative commentator, Mr Paul Goodman of ConservativeHome,
confirmed on his blog back in May of last year that the Chancellor was,
indeed, the brains behind the Prime Minister’s referendum stunt.
That casts further doubt on the judgment of the Prime Minister. Surely
by now he has worked it out. After all, his Back Benchers and the
country have worked it out. This is the Chancellor who claimed bringing
back Andy Coulson would be a strategic triumph. He is the one who said
taking child benefit away from middle-income families would be a
masterstroke. He is the one who said that gambling his credibility on
our triple A rating was sound economics, and that cutting tax credits
and labelling as scroungers 3 million working families—an
average of 6,000 in every Tory constituency—was somehow good
politics, and that cutting taxes for millionaires would wrong-foot
Labour. Surely even the Prime Minister has worked it out by now. This
is the man who last year gave us “Omnishambles 1” and
“The Budget debacle” and who has now given us
“Queen’s Speech 2”, “Omnishambles 2”

certainly an odd speech from the shadow Chancellor. He called me a
tactical genius, but those on his side are going around calling him a
busted flush, and after the extraordinary 40 minutes of comments we
have just heard from him, we can see why. The contrast is with a
Government who are building an economy where those who want to work
hard and get on are rewarded. The contrast is with a tax system that is
being changed to support effort, with the largest ever increase in the
personal allowance. The contrast is with a welfare system that is being
changed so it always pays to work and benefit bills are being capped so
no family gets more from being on benefits and out of work than the
average family gets from being in

the Labour leader could not contain his excitement about the economic

said, “What President Hollande is seeking to do in France, I
want to do in Britain.” We do not hear much these days about

exclusively, but those have been the most dominant. Those concerns have
not disappeared, but they have been complemented by economic concerns,
and those economic concerns have grown. There is concern that the
European prescription of high taxes, expensive social costs and
unaffordable welfare is slowly strangling the European economy. There
are concerns from business that directive after

Members, after the shambles of the past three weeks, of what their
policy is on the currency that Scotland would use, should Scotland vote
to leave the Union. We have not had a clear answer. Some members of the
SNP have said that Scotland should have its own currency, others have
said that Scotland should join the euro, and still others have said
that they would negotiate a monetary union with all of us in order to
keep the pound. There is complete confusion in the SNP ranks and until
they have a clear answer to that, they will not be listened to on much

remark—I do not know whether anyone noticed it—from the

reform. Labour Members have voted against every single welfare proposal
put to the House. The shadow Chancellor thinks the benefits cap is
“too low” and that it is not set at the right level at
£26,000. That is the problem. Any view of Britain, and any view
of western nations, is that they need to do more to constrain the
growth of entitlement spending and more to make sure that welfare pays,
and to spend the money that they save on things such as infrastructure
in Northern Ireland, broadband, high-speed trains and the Crossrail

taxes up on jobs. That is what he fought the general election on, and
that is what he still talks about when people listen to him in his
interviews. That is the point. The Opposition offer more borrowing; we
are reducing the deficit. They want to increase the size of government;
we want it reduced. They penalise enterprise and wealth creation; we
support it. They would put a tax on jobs; we are abolishing it. While
they would repeat all the mistakes of the past, we are engaging in the
great economic challenges of the future. We are building an economy
that will enable Britain to compete and succeed in the world. We are
building an economy that helps people who want to work hard and get on.

Beckett</B> (Derby South) (Lab):</Member> The best that can be said
about this Queen’s Speech is that it is inadequate on the
economy. A pattern is emerging in the way the Government weigh the
national interests on 
<?notus-xml column=678?>the one hand against the interests of the Conservative party on the
other. From the outset, the Chancellor claimed that we had to cut
faster and deeper than Labour had proposed, because only that level of
austerity would reduce the deficit. It was clear then that the speed
and depth of the proposed cuts were dictated by a political
goal—a massive early deficit reduction speedily followed by
economic success well before the next election.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051532000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000082">The
Chancellor was warned then that the scale and pace of that austerity
risked the fragile growth re-established before the election, but for
potential political gain he was ready to take a huge gamble with our
economy. To that gamble he added self-inflicted wounds. He constantly
told the British people, again for political reasons, that we were on
the brink of bankruptcy, and so almost destroyed confidence. He made a
fetish of our triple A credit rating, and then he lost it. He has hit
our economy with a double whammy—greater austerity and, as a
direct result, higher, not lower, borrowing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051532000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000083">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T14:48:37"></hs_TimeCode>
are three ways to cut the deficit: growth, taxation and spending cuts.
The Chancellor made it clear from the beginning that he preferred
spending cuts to tax increases, though his VAT increase hit everyone.
Now he talks only about either tax or spending; he never mentions
growth, because he does not have any. Meanwhile, other developed
countries that have not followed his lead are growing while we are
not<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T14:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000084">The
Chancellor is neglecting the opportunity of green growth. Potential
first-mover advantages in green technologies are, just, still to be
had, and with them new high-skill, high-value-added jobs, but unless
the Treasury allows more ambition, those jobs will be elsewhere, not in
this country. Meanwhile, his cuts increasingly come at the expense of
the most vulnerable, justified by the rhetoric of scroungers and
strivers. He justifies the bedroom tax as encouraging people to
downsize, but the Government must have known that for many people there
is nowhere to downsize to, so it is just a cut. If we cannot afford not
to cut that benefit, as he alleges, we cannot afford to cut taxes for
millionaires in the same
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T14:49:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000085">With
the EU referendum omnishambles, what began as a gamble with our economy
in the interests of the Conservative party has become the disregard of
our economic interests. The Conservative party claims to be the party
of business, but a key hate of business is prolonged economic
uncertainty. Now we are telling inward investors, “We might
leave the EU, but we’ll let you know in four years’
time.” Japanese, American and European inward investors all make
it clear that they are in the UK because the UK is in the EU. Millions
of jobs are at stake. A semi-detached status, such as that of
Switzerland and Norway, means being bound by EU decisions without
having a voice. The voice we have now is continually being weakened by
the continued uncertainty about our membership and whether the
Government even support

is crystal clear to everyone, in this country and outside, that that
disregard of our national interest has nothing to do with cool
calculation of how that interest is to be served and everything to do

of the UK Independence party and scared of their own Back Benchers. As
has been said already today, they are in office but
not in power.</hs_Para>

Baron:</Member></B> I completely agree. I think that the political
system has denied the electorate their say for far too long and that
Parliament needs to understand that. That is why some of us on the
Conservative Benches have been campaigning for some time for a
referendum in the next Parliament. I am pleased to say that the Prime
Minister deserved credit for listening. In January he became the first
major party leader to offer the country a referendum in 2017. But we,
as a group on these Benches, have also long argued that our commitment
must be both credible and believable. It is credible because the
referendum in 2017 has an “out” option, but it is not yet
believable.</hs_Para>

British electorate, quite understandably, are deeply sceptical of any
politicians making promises about matters European, particularly EU

remember Tony Blair’s broken promises about a referendum on the
EU constitution, which never materialised. They are constantly reminded
about Liberal literature promising an in/out referendum, which never
materialised, even when they came to power. That is why we on these
Benches have also campaigned for legislation in this Parliament for a
referendum in the next, not because we do not trust the Prime Minister,
but because the electorate do not trust politicians generally. I would
argue that we as a party are more united on this issue than we have
been for a generation. We have all signed up to the referendum in 2017;

support the publication of the draft Bill yesterday. It just goes to

However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T14:55:10"></hs_TimeCode>, the
problem with a private Member’s

Chancellor is still in his place—to support the amendment. It
provides him with a golden opportunity. If we were to win, that would
provide him with the mandate to try to introduce legislation through
the normal channels, which would stand a far better chance of
succeeding. He should seize the moment. He could claim, quite rightly,
that the situation was not of his making and blame me or us as a group.
It would therefore be outside the confines of the coalition agreement.
I must say to my right hon. Friend the Chancellor that the Liberals

other Benches—honourable and principled Members—support
the concept. Even if we fail, we will have tried. On a matter of this
importance, political transparency is paramount, and the electorate
could then take note.</hs_Para>

important than party politics. I encourage other Members to do likewise
within their own parties. Were the amendment to pass tonight, we as a
Parliament would be opening the door to the possibility of introducing
legislation that would stand a far better chance of succeeding. It
would take a majority to defeat that legislation, rather than the

Bob Russell</B> (Colchester) (LD):</Member> Successive Governments have
spoken of localism and sustainable communities, but the reality has not
matched the rhetoric in many respects. That is particularly true with
regard to the loss of post offices and neighbourhood and village shops,
whereby Government policies over the past 30 years have hastened their
decline, rather than helped sustain them to the overall benefit of
society and the communities that lose
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:05:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000110">Nowhere
is Government failure more obvious than in the closure of thousands of
neighbourhood and village public houses—the traditional English
“local”—and the rise of mega-drinking
establishments with wall-to-wall boozing and round-the-clock easy
availability of alcohol, aligned with below-cost-price special offers
in supermarkets, which has fuelled an explosion in alcohol-related
incidents in town and city centres, making many people wary of going to
them in the evenings and putting serious extra pressure on our
emergency services, including clogging hospital accident and emergency
departments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:05:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000111">There
is also worrying evidence from health professionals of an increase in
drink-related conditions and that this self-inflicted rise in
alcohol-induced illnesses is occurring in increasing numbers of young

individuals concerned and their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:05:55"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

stretches from Athens to Oslo, is the largest single market in the

would like to have the discussion. We went into a referendum on the
alternative vote with a discussion 
<?notus-xml column=689?>led by the Prime Minister, who was not in favour of it, and other
Members held honourable positions on the issue. This is about giving
the discussion to the British public, however they would like to view
it.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:30:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Croydon South that I have the figures from the House of
Commons Library, and our total earnings from abroad constitute 44% of
our GDP. We are a global trading nation and trade a higher proportion
of our GDP than any other major European state. Trade with the EU
comprises 19% of GDP, and 25% with the rest of the world. The rest of
the world is the growing proportion; the EU is the declining
proportion. Manufacturing is the only part that would be excluded, by
virtue of the tariffs that were mentioned earlier by my hon. Friend the
Member for Croydon South, and manufacturing exports to the EU comprise
10% of GDP, and 10% to the rest of the world—a substantial and
important part of our economic activity.</hs_Para>

point is that there is no evidence that we would not continue to trade
that proportion of our manufactures with the European
Union—incidentally, the figures are inflated by what we know as
the Rotterdam-Antwerp effect because a lot of what we export to the EU
is instantly exported to the rest of the world. We are regulating our
entire economy and burdening our taxpayers with the costs of the
contribution—rising to £19 billion gross—with our
membership of the European Union. One hundred per cent. of our economic
activity is burdened with those regulatory costs for the sake of less
than 10% of our overall

a lot of people in UKIP are saying things that are similar to what is
felt by a lot of people who would like to vote Conservative at the next
election. There is a majority in this country, and I think the Prime

entire debate is conducted on the premise that membership of the single
market is indispensable to our national interest, is it not? Those who
say we must remain in the EU come what may believe that the single
market is indispensable to our national interest, but here are the
facts. I have already mentioned how little of our GDP that we export in
goods would be subject to tariffs were we not to have a free trade
arrangement with the EU—probably around 8.7% of GDP. The idea
that 3 million jobs are dependent on exports to the EU and that we
would lose them if we left is a myth. There is no substantial evidence
that we would lose any jobs.

the economy, who governs Britain and whether we can achieve economic
growth, which is what the debate is actually about. We cannot achieve

risen from £47 billion to £70 billion. Furthermore, the
German surplus, which was running at £30 billion, rose to
£70 billion between 2011 and 2012. It is essential that we take
note and hold this referendum—and hold it

Chancellor. The British Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small

was. Once the rate of growth has slowed below the expansion of debt,
the policy is doomed, and that is exactly where we are. Given that, it

the UK during the best years up to 2007. The National Statistics

than the total for equity withdrawal from housing for the same period.
In other words, the inflation of property assets largely accounts for
the apparent growth. So, rebalancing the economy, which is now vital,

make ends meet, working really hard and trying to give their young
people a decent start in life. Arguments will rage about austerity cuts
and the lack of investment—there are as many opinions as there
are economists. I do not want to rehearse those arguments today, but to
talk about something practical that I believe can help to address our
economy’s problems that are causing such misery to thousands of
families across the land.</hs_Para>

concept of responsible capitalism.</hs_Para>

months ago, I worked with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Warwick and Leamington (Chris White) to take the Public Services
(Social Value) Act 2012 through this House, and I was delighted to do
so. The duty to put social value at the heart of public procurement
came in at the end of January. If implemented across government, across
local government and in private sector supply chains, I believe it
could make a huge difference to the number of apprenticeships, the
amount of local labour, the building of small and medium-sized
enterprises and the encouragement of innovation.</hs_Para>

the last year, I brought some big companies together with social
enterprises to see how they could collaborate to renew our economy. I
have been heartened by the commitment from the private sector. Good
companies know that this is not about philanthropy or altruism, because
doing good is good business. Moving from traditional corporate social
responsibility into a place where businesses are using their mainstream
models to make a social impact in procurement, human relations,
marketing and product development is helping to get social value into
companies’ DNA. That is the way to get our economy
moving.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000222">Let
me give a couple of examples. Sodexo, whose headquarters are in
Salford, is working with one of my local social enterprises to take on
ex-offenders to carry out grounds maintenance and facilities
management. That is a fantastic partnership. Deloitte is helping 30
social enterprises to grow to scale under its social investment
pioneers programme. CH2M HILL, which built the Olympics stadium and is
working on High Speed 2, has values that extend to every level of the
company when it comes to apprenticeships, training and social mobility.
Trading for Good is a brand new website where people can ask questions
such as “Which is the company that takes apprentices? I want
that company to redo my roof. Which is the company that is building
local supply chains? I want to spend my money there.” It is a
fantastic resource.</hs_Para>

Blears:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. The
combination of social value and the creation of social investment
through crowdsourcing, peer-to-peer lending and the activities of the
Big Society Capital bank, which was a Labour idea, will take us along
precisely that
track.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000225">My
final example is Interserve, which employs  50,000 people and
has a turnover of £2 billion. Its chief executive, Adrian
Ringrose, recently committed himself to reinvesting 3% of his profits
in the communities where his companies operate. That is the kind of
thing that good, decent companies can do, and it can make a big
difference. Such companies want to rebuild trust and secure a better
reputation for big business, which has suffered from a lack of trust
because of the activities of the banks and others. There is also the
fact that it is good
business.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000226" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000226">The
challenge for the Government is to enable that activity to become
mainstream, rather than a niche activity in which only a few people
engage. I ask them to think seriously about extending the Public
Services (Social Value) Act 2012 to cover goods and major
infrastructure. Over the next five years, we shall spend £200
billion on the really important things that we need: energy,
transport—including High Speed 2—and building broadband.
Why should we not include social value clauses relating to local labour
and local supply chains in all infrastructure contracts? Can we not
imagine the difference that that could make?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051532000227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0002.htm#13051532000227">When money is
tight—and it would be tight for us if we were in
government— we can make a real difference by gaining extra
impact from procurement and by doing business differently. We need
community reinvestment, and we need to provide incentives for companies
such as Interserve to do the right thing. A year ago, when I presented
a ten-minute rule Bill in the House, I suggested that bankers could
voluntarily put some of their income into local social enterprises.
That might even make bankers popular, for goodness’ sake, and it
is a very practical thing that we could do.</hs_Para>

Government must also support the development of measurement and metrics
for social impact. There is a lot of good work going on. The
Connectives Limited in Manchester, which is run by two inspirational
woman accountants, has done fabulous work on social audit and
accounting, but if we are to make such activity mainstream, we need to
ensure that the metrics are rigorous and substantial. I should like the
Treasury to do some more work on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000229">In
the time that I have left, I want to mention the Big Society Capital
bank. It was the bank’s first anniversary last week, and I went
to an event to mark it in the City. There was standing room only
because there was such a huge appetite for the creation of a social
investment market. The leadership of Sir Ronald Cohen and Nick
O’Donohoe is first class. They have some really good ideas about
how to get products to market, and about new types of bond such as
social impact bonds. They are trying to persuade foundations and
pension funds to invest. I welcome the Government’s consultation
on 
<?notus-xml column=699?>a tax relief for social investment; I think that that is a very good
idea. It could release an extra half a billion
pounds into the market.</hs_Para>

may wonder why I am speaking about the European Union on a day that was
allocated to a debate on economic growth. The one thing that is certain
is that there is absolutely no connection between economic growth and
membership of the EU—quite the reverse. However, it is the
Labour Opposition who choose the subject for each day of debate on the
Queen’s Speech. On no day did they choose to debate foreign
affairs, which indicates how little regard they have for international
relations in general and Europe in particular. I suspect they did not

is that it was done without threatening to leave the European Union. If

course the European Union needs reform. It needs to be more flexible
and less rigid and it needs to concentrate more on growth and jobs. The

Swales</B> (Redcar) (LD):</Member> I was pleased to see that the
Gracious Speech mentioned tackling tax evasion, and that the Chancellor
later added tax avoidance in a G8 conference interview. He often says
he is proud of a 
<?notus-xml column=703?>corporation tax rate that is the most competitive in the G20.
Unfortunately, large companies can easily move their profits and
operations outside the G20. I want to speak about the effect that this
is having on the UK economy and
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000262">There
is widespread bafflement about how we can have an extra 1.2 million
private sector jobs and so little growth. Part of the answer is tax
avoidance, because many of those workers are employed by offshore
companies. For example, Amazon is growing in this country at more than
20% a year. It employs thousands of people, but its sales of £4
billion do not appear in our economy. They appear in Luxembourg.
Microsoft, eBay, Google and others have large businesses in the UK but
their figures do not show up either, and the Google chief executive
proudly talked about avoiding $2 billion in tax last
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:23:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000263" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000263">Now
let us turn to the companies that are based here. The tax system
encourages them to move manufacturing and other parts of their supply
chain overseas. The Government’s change in controlled foreign
company legislation makes this even more likely. Companies that do
declare large profits here will find that they get a knock on the door
from a well paid tax partner of a large accountancy firm, who will put
forward schemes whereby corporation tax can be avoided, the simplest of
which is to export the profits to Luxembourg via interest payments.
This is a route followed by well-known companies such as Vodafone and
Pearson, owner of the <I>Financial Times.</I> In fact, it is done by
most of our national newspapers, which might explain why media
reporting of this issue is patchy at
best<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:24:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000264">If
a profit-making company fails to succumb to the charm offensive of the
tax partner, something more sinister is likely to happen. The next
knock on the door could be from the vulture
capitalists—representatives targeting an aggressive takeover of
the company. Let us take a current example. The outstanding business
success and growth of Betfair has led it recently to declare
£247 million in profits. Its prospective suitors are CVC
Capital. What will it bring to Betfair—better management;
outstanding new internet technology? The clue is probably in the
description of CVC as a London and Luxembourg-based venture capitalist.
I am guessing that it will bring a shameless approach to exporting
Betfair’s profits to avoid paying UK corporation tax. Boots and
Thames Water are just two of the many companies that have been taken
over and had their UK profits stripped out of the country and placed in
tax

Government have themselves facilitated tax avoidance, not just through
the tax framework but through their procurement and private finance
initiative activity. The Green Book on PFI assessment still contains an
assumption that 10% of total PFI payments, not profits, will come back
to the Government in tax. This is risible when one examines the facts.
The vast bulk of PFI deals now have an offshore element. HMRC’s
own offices are owned in Bermuda, the Home Office HQ is owned in
Guernsey, PFI schools in my constituency are 50% owned in Jersey, and,
most bizarrely of all, junction 1A to junction 3 of the M40 is 50%
owned in Guernsey. This is the story throughout the country. It is high

money from our tax system and the incentives for companies to operate
in certain ways are bad for the economy, bad for growth and bad for
individual taxpayers. I welcome the moves that the Government have
already made. Let us remember that nearly all the framework was put in
place or left in place by the last Government, and they compounded the
problem by sucking up to their friends in the City, stripping
high-level resource out of HMRC and telling it to go easy on big

where appropriate, prosecute their advisers. They should add advisers

to us being a low-skills, low-pay economy. There is already great
competition around the world from people with high skills who are low

have introduced a Bill to abolish unemployment before the age of 25. It
would cost only between £4.5 billion and £5 billion a
year, but it would have stopped politicians condemning young people to
live in the shadows of society on a bit of unemployment benefit here
and a bit of housing benefit there. We could have ensured that every
young person in this country was in education, training or work

for South Dorset (Richard Drax). The Democratic Unionist party endorses
his views on the amendment, which we support. We believe it is
important that the people of the United Kingdom should have a say about
their relationship with Europe. Some of those who oppose the commitment
to a referendum claim that it will somehow leave us with four years of
uncertainty and that that will damage investment in the UK, but the
genie is out of the bottle as far as renegotiation and a referendum are
concerned. Any investor knows what will happen at some stage in the
future, so there should be no difficulty in giving the people of the
United Kingdom a say on this very important issue. I will concentrate
on other issues that relate to economic growth, but I accept that our
relationship with Europe impacts on economic growth in this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000292">If<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>
we are to achieve the objectives in the Queen’s Speech of giving
people job opportunities, rewarding hard work and reforming welfare,
economic growth is important. If we are to create economic growth, we
need proper stimulus. The Chancellor and the Government argue that we
cannot borrow more in order to borrow less. That is not true. Good,
solid investment in the economy would help us to grow and to pay our
debts. That is not the view of those on the extreme left wing; it is
the view of the IMF, which is hardly a left-wing organisation. In fact,
many of its policies resonate with what is said by the Government. It
is also the view of many industry
organisations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000293">More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:41:10"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, the evidence of what has been happening in the economy
bears out that view. The hon. Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr
Wallace) talked about what is happening in his constituency. Nearly
every example that he gave was the result of stimulus through
Government borrowing and spending to create infrastructure and produce
jobs. I could give stacks of examples from Northern Ireland. There has
been investment in our tourism industry. Not so long ago, we got a
Barnett consequential as a result of the Government deciding to spend
more money on housing. We put it into co-ownership housing, which has
brought money down from the banks and has led to almost half of the
houses being built in the private sector. Just a small amount of money
from the public sector has created construction jobs and allowed people
to pay their taxes, which adds to Government revenue and helps to pay
off the
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:42:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000294">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:44:32"></hs_TimeCode>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T16:44:32"></hs_TimeCode> Chancellor
made a big point today about the money markets. Actually, the money
markets are quite relaxed about this. They are lending money to the
United Kingdom on negative interest rates. There is more demand for
Government bonds than supply. If there are sensible investment 
<?notus-xml column=708?>policies, the money can be made available. The question is whether there

am disappointed that there is not much detail on what the Government

has fallen substantially since 2010. We have not dealt with the banking

unless the Government grasp the nettle and decide what to do with
failing banks that are undercapitalised and unable or unwilling to
lend, we will not stimulate growth. I believe that there is great
potential and that a Government stimulus could release the billions of

with this problem that we all face. It is high time we stood up to
large international businesses and said, “We have to secure our
tax base.” We have to secure a fair deal for each individual who
is living in this country, so that they pay a fair share of income tax
while large international corporations pay a fair share of corporation
tax. We must ensure that there is a level competitive playing field for
home-grown businesses, just as much as there is a level competitive
playing field for international businesses. That would be the right
settlement and tax framework for the UK and all our European
neighbours<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:01:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/6AEF473B3053AD864747BA6F623887C9789A34A9" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 May 2013">Wednesday

Geoffrey Robinson</B> (Coventry North West) (Lab):</Member> I think
that some of us who have sat through this debate find it regrettable
that, to a large extent, it has been hijacked by the obsessively
anti-European faction in the 
<?notus-xml column=713?>coalition parties. It is not that Europe is not important, but the
debate is about the Queen’s Speech and a
reflection on the Government’s record after three years in
office. Rather than intruding on the private grief of Government
Members caught up in their internal and agonising debates, I would much
rather say to those on the Treasury Bench that, in all seriousness,
they have to face up to the fact that after a full three years in
office they are responsible for the economy: they are responsible for
the situation we are in, and they are responsible for getting us out of
it. Unless they accept that responsibility, they will never accept the
measures that are necessary to find a way out of the chronic situation
in which we still find ourselves.</hs_Para>

years ago, after only a few months into office and after they brought
in the cuts that went too far and too fast, the Chancellor was already
crowing that the plan was working and the recovery was on track. We
know what the recovery was meant to achieve: central to all economic
policy is growth. In the three years to date, we were meant to have
achieved 6% growth, but have achieved only 1.1%. I wonder whether the
Government realised that what they were committing themselves to, and
which after three months they thought was working, would achieve only
one-sixth of their central economic objective. Those who have doubts
about whether they should change course should reflect on that. Had
they realised what that would achieve, they would never have embarked
on it. The only way forward is to change course. Of course, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:04:03"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Morley and Outwood (Ed Balls) pointed out, to do
that would mean going back on so much of what they proclaimed to be
absolutely essential, and that is impossible for them to do.</hs_Para>

is limited for all Members, so I want to concentrate on just two
aspects of economic policy where the Government’s incompetence
and failure is hard to explain.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:04:25"></hs_TimeCode>The first is
investment. What the Government call the national infrastructure plan
has been variously described by conservative organisations as
“hot air”, “complete fiction” and, by the
chairman of the CBI, as “lacking all delivery”. Where
does this leave investment? One cannot understand the
Government’s failure, because there is no cross-party debate on
investment or conflict over it. Less still is there any doctrinal
argument such as we have on economic growth or financial
policy—on the components, predictors or causal factors of, say,
bond yields in 30 years and so on. Everybody in the House I have ever
heard speak on this has said, “We must have more
investment,” because traditionally the UK has not invested in R
and D or fixed equipment and plant as much as we should have done or as
much as our
competitors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:05:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
There is no argument about
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051532000336" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000336"><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Barclay" PimsId="5573" UID="13051532000557" xid="1182" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051532000557"><B>Stephen
Barclay</B> (North East Cambridgeshire) (Con):</Member> I am struck by
the hubris of the hon. Gentleman, who is a former Paymaster General.
The report on the extension of the private finance initiative by the
Public Accounts Committee, which is chaired by a Labour Member, found
that the previous Labour Government wasted more than £1 billion.
Half, or more, of the PFI projects in the housing sector came in at
double their original budget. He needs to accept his party’s
record on major infrastructure

major infrastructure project that has not run over budget. As my hon.
Friend the Member for Huddersfield 
<?notus-xml column=714?>(Mr Sheerman) said,
let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:06:24"></hs_TimeCode> us see what
happens to HS2. They all run over budget. Some terrible PFI deals were
done—there is no question about it—but all Government
Members ever do is say what Labour did badly. We have admitted that we
did many things badly. We failed on certain things, but it will not
help to get the Government’s plan going to say, “Oh, look
what you did when you were in office.” Nothing could be more
pathetic. That is what I am trying to get through to the Government.
They are now in charge, and they now have to face up to their own
failures and the things that need to be done to put them
right.</hs_Para>

come now to what those things are. I have mentioned how the Government
budgeted for 6% growth, but in fact have achieved about 1% growth. It
could not get much worse than that. Under their national infrastructure
plan, they have about 567 projects in the pipeline, ready to go, but in
three years they have achieved seven of them, or 1.2%. Everyone agrees
that these projects are good ideas, so why can they not get these
things done? We own one of the banks outright—I shall come to
the banks in a moment—and we have a substantial stake in
another, but the Government have created their own business bank. It
could be investing in some of these projects, but against a background
in which bank lending to businesses has fallen by £4.8 billion
in the last quarter alone, they are offering £300 million
through the British business bank. It is no wonder they are not getting
the projects through. It is no wonder they are
failing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:08:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Barclay:</Member></B> With respect to the hon. Gentleman, who is a
senior Member of the House, he is just not engaging with the facts.
Public investment as a share of GDP will be higher on average over this
Parliament and the next Parliament collectively than under the last
Government. On housing, which was my previous example, his
party’s record was absolutely shocking, whereas our build to
rent fund is addressing some of these issues. Action is being taken. He
is ignoring his own record as a former Treasury Minister and the action
that this Government are taking. It is

Robinson:</Member></B> The Chancellor produces that tired statistic
every time we mention investment. Let us take construction. The last
time the level of house building was this low was in the 1920s.
Overall, the level of construction has fallen 11% in the last year.
This is against a background of a chronic need for the jobs and growth
that investment can supply. We need a major uplift in the level of
investment. It is higher, marginally, than it was 10 years ago, but so
it ought to be. It is pathetic that they continue not to face up to the
reality of the failure of their own programme. As long as they do not,
they will not succeed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:09:24"></hs_TimeCode>Would the hon.
Member for North East Cambridgeshire (Stephen Barclay) really have
embarked on this plan if he had known that, instead of 6% growth, we
would end up three years down the road with 1% growth? Would he? Of
course not: nobody on the Government Benches would have done that, and
if they had, they would have needed their brains tested—perhaps
they need them tested anyway. That is the truth of it.</hs_Para>

failure of Merlin and the question of the banks. Instead of making the
Royal Bank of Scotland a national bank to invest in such projects, all
the Government want to do is flog it off 
<?notus-xml column=715?>ahead of time. That will be another failure to add to the long list.

talk about something other than our coalition partner’s internal
difficulties over Europe. My e-mail inbox—like, I imagine,
everyone else’s—is filled with demands that we spend more
on the health service, education, defence and so on. However, to be
able to do so in the current budgetary situation requires the economy
to grow faster than spending. Otherwise, the resultant increase in debt

but I think we can see that it has already been effective, and the

reduction in unemployment.
What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:12:34"></hs_TimeCode> is more,
part of our work on apprenticeships is about preventing abuse of
apprenticeships. We are setting out a definition of what an

are jobs in the regions. I am lucky to have a very low rate of

here we are after three years of the coalition Government. The early

address our economic crisis at all. I am not saying that there is
nothing in it for us to welcome. Reform of the Independent Police
Complaints Commission is long overdue. We have yet to see what it will

away at red tape they will encourage the private sector to rise up like
the Incredible Hulk and get the economy working? I do not think that
they really believe that. They cannot believe that that is going to

would like, however, to use the few minutes that I have to give the
Government some advice. They might listen—you never know! How
about looking into housing? For example, £30 billion spent on
infrastructure investment in housing—particularly affordable
housing and social housing for rent—would represent 2% of GDP.
The International Monetary Fund has said that the fiscal multiplier
resulting from such investment could be between 0.9% and 1.7%, which
could boost growth by 2.6% of GDP. That would be a short-term boost,
but the TUC recently commissioned the National Institute of Economic
and Social Research to look at the effect of such investment over the
longer term. That research showed that such investment would continue,
three to four years on, to have a positive effect on debt and
GDP.</hs_Para>

is not just about the economy; it is also about fairness. We know that
there is not enough housing. We know that people need jobs and
training, and that our youngsters need something to do. They need hope.
Investment in housing would provide all those things. This Government
are building the smallest amount of housing of any Government; they
have the worst peacetime record of doing that of any Government since
the 1920s. Council house waiting lists continue to grow. If the
Government continue at this rate, it will take until 2129 to build
enough housing to meet the current need.</hs_Para>

know that the Government want to cut back on the benefit bill. They say
it is wise to introduce a blanket cap without thinking about how some
areas that have a desperate housing crisis will have much higher
housing costs. My constituency provides a very good example. If a
family of five is living in a three-bedroom house in the private sector
in my constituency and someone is unlucky enough to become unemployed,
the rent would be £400 a week.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:20:52"></hs_TimeCode> question I
wanted to ask the Chancellor earlier—unfortunately, he did not
allow me to intervene—was this. If the rent is £400 a
week and the cap is £500, what does such a family of five do?
Does it live on £100 a week or not pay the rent instead? If the
rent is not paid, does that mean the family is intentionally homeless,
and if it does, does the council have to re-house the family? If the
council does have to re-house them, but there is not enough social
housing, where does the family go? Where would the Government suggest
these people go? Perhaps they would go to Dover or to some of the
marginal seats in outer London. Unfortunately, the Government have no 
<?notus-xml column=718?>idea of where these people should go. The tragedy of the debate so far
is that there has not been enough emphasis on
fairness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:21:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/FA13BA43BA8C24850C09ED740541DAEBA9008D03" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 May 2013">Wednesday

The Institute of Directors has calculated that the cost of regulation
on business in this country is £110 billion a year. That is
clearly too high. This Bill will make a difference by exempting from
health and safety law the self-employed whose activities pose no
potential risk  to others. It will also give non-economic
regulators a new duty—to have regard to the impact of their
actions on growth. These are positive steps for businesses in

There is more work to be done within the EU and in wider international

businesses exporting more. Britain needs to fall in love again with
enterprise, entrepreneurs and exporting. Equally, businesses need to be

the European context, I have spent two days in Brussels and the

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:33:19"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stone (Mr Cash), and others. I was astonished at the extent to
which not just the EU but the eurozone are straitjackets preventing
growth. We met Olli Rehn, Commissioner for Economic and Monetary
Affairs, who had a blueprint, put forward on 5 December. We also met
Herman Van Rompuy—one more president of Europe—who put
forward a blueprint for a deep and genuine economic and monetary union
in December 2012. On 29 January 2013 José Manuel Barroso, the
other current president, spoke at a European conference in support of
Van Rompuy’s blueprint, saying it was the only way forward.
However, what it was, in fact, was a constraining arrangement in
economics—in countries’ banking systems and
budgets—as the Chair of the ESC said. The arrangement would be
contracted and would have penalty clauses, and it would punish
Governments who are already in dire straits, and the people of their
countries, for not coming up to what are, in fact, the aspirations of
the northern European countries, who are making so much out of the
European arrangement at present.</hs_Para>

statistics showed that we had a growth-free, recession-bound EU, and
alongside it we have a growth-free, austerity-choked UK economy. As we
have heard, even in these times, our deficit against the EU has gone up
to £72 billion, which represents more than £1.25 billion
every week. These countries are in a bad condition, but we are still in
a worse condition. Oddly, the G7—our Prime Minister was
there—reported how happy it is with the arrangements for the EU
to continue to squeeze and choke these people, but that contradicts
what the Chancellor said today. What he said about the ECOFIN meeting
suggests that there would appear to be an argument against how the EU
is performing and constraining people. I do not know who is telling the
truth—was he just making his speech because of the leadership
bid in the background, was he playing to  the dissidents on his
Back Benches, or was he genuinely saying that an attempt is being made
in Europe to unlock that terrible arrangement set up in

crisis is a eurozone one. Everyone we spoke to did not talk about the
countries in the south being a danger to the EU; they said that they
were a danger to the euro. The euro has become the symbol of what they

fundamental than the European project, and that really worries me.
There is a growing meanness of spirit in what is being talked about in
the EU: people are to be punished because the euro is being threatened.

serious questions to answer here, because I do not think the
renegotiation being talked about by the Prime Minister has anything to
do with that—it is on the fringes. His renegotiation is to do
with justice and home affairs and Schengen agreements; it is not about
the fundamentals of the European project, which is now an economic

are now talked about by McDonald’s, which has
them—in-service training for six months constitutes an

apprenticeships, too, but these are not apprenticeships. The reality is
that 60% of the skills shortages are in non-graduate technical

want to focus on the economy. Clearly, austerity is failing, and I was
among those who predicted its failure. Early in the life of this
Government, I quoted Paul Krugman and his view that the Government were
going in precisely the wrong direction. What Britain needs is a
reflationary programme, not austerity, with a boost to public spending
in specific target areas. We have 2.5 million people
unemployed, so it is logical that additional spending should be
directed to areas of high labour intensity: construction and the public
services, which are precisely the areas that have suffered the most
savage Government cuts. Construction output has fallen by 12% since
2010 and by 20% since 2008, and thousands of jobs have been cut in the
public services. Jobs in construction and the public services have the
added advantage of pumping additional economic demand primarily into
the domestic economy, so maximising the reflationary multiplier effects
to boost growth. Reducing unemployment quickly and substantially will
cut the bill for benefits, raise tax revenues and bring down the
Government’s spending deficit into the bargain. Moreover, the
kind of jobs created by such a programme will go to those whose
marginal propensity to consume is high, thus putting their newly
increased income straight back into the economy as they spend their new
wages. If, indeed, additional borrowing is required—it may not
be required if we just collect the taxes we are owed—the
kick-start should not be expensive. I do not think reflation will be a
problem. Interest rates are in any case very low so the costs of
borrowing are also very low.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051540000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000037"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>There
is, however, a serious problem with such a reflationary programme.
Although construction and the public services have minimal import
content, meaning that additional spending goes initially into the
domestic economy, the additional spending will quickly begin to suck in
imports and Britain already has a massive and growing trade deficit,
largely with the rest of the EU. The figures are stunning. We had a
deficit on the current account in 2012 of minus £57 billion, up
from minus £20 billion the year before. The goods deficit was
more than £106 billion in 2012, more than £2 billion a
week. The bulk of this deficit is with the EU 27 and rose from
£4.8 billion in January this year to £5.1 billion in
February, on course for a deficit of more than £60
billion this year and possibly £70 billion, as was said before.
This is a massive
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000038">There
is a goods deficit with the rest of the world too, up to £4.3
billion in February from £3.4 billion in January, so the deficit
is not just with the EU, but the EU is the major problem. Britain
therefore has a desperate trade problem that can be solved only by
rebuilding and expanding the UK manufacturing sector. It is a shocking
fact that manufacturing as a proportion of GDP in the UK is half that
in Germany, and it is no surprise that we have a gigantic trade deficit
specifically with Germany.</hs_Para>

phenomenon is not new, of course. I have with me a copy of a pamphlet
published 24 years ago by the Institute for Public Policy Research
called “The German 
<?notus-xml column=724?>Surplus”. Even then, there was a massive problem that had grown
quickly over that decade. It was just such trade imbalances that Keynes
knew would cause economic damage and, if they were not addressed, would
ultimately cause serious economic and political tension between
economies and between nations. The 1944 Bretton Woods conference
decided to provide for essential devaluations by deficit countries, and
Keynes proposed too that countries with large trade surpluses should be
required to revalue their currencies. The latter proposal was rejected
by the US, but the necessity of appropriate exchange rates was
recognised. This is why the euro is such a disaster and is doomed to
fail<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:42:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000040">Mercifully,
Britain avoided the euro trap and is able to flex its exchange rate.
However, it is glaringly obvious that we need to depreciate our
currency to become competitive again and to maintain an appropriate
exchange rate so that we can rebuild our manufacturing industry. We
have seen manufacturing deteriorate over several decades and we need to
reverse that

negative growth and back into recession and Germany has seen economic
growth of only 0.1%—the latest growth figure of 0.3% is a
remarkable testament to the very difficult and invidious decisions that
this Government have had to make in clearing up the crisis that was

evidence of economic growth is coming through in my constituency.
Today’s unemployment statistics in Crawley showed that in April
unemployment fell to 3.4%, although I appreciate, as someone who has
previously been unemployed, that it is 100% of a problem for each
individual who makes up that statistic. That figure represents a fall
on the previous month, and a fall on this time last year. Earlier this
year, I was honoured to open a new production line at Vent-Axia in my
constituency, which represented jobs coming back to Crawley from
China—a sign of growing confidence in the British economy. I
congratulate Gatwick airport on its significant infrastructure
investment of £1 billion to upgrade its terminals, making that
an attractive international trade destination, which is to the benefit

economic project, which is what it should always have been. The
resulting eurozone crisis
means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:47:34"></hs_TimeCode> that
demand in the eurozone is down and therefore demand for British goods
is down. Despite that, our Government’s performance in
engendering economic growth is remarkably impressive. I was pleased in
the last Session to serve on the Growth and Infrastructure Bill

measures to reduce regulation and burden on business. If we give the
people of this country a choice on our future membership of the EU, we

Such things are pushing up the benefits bill, as is rising unemployment

millionaires, fresh from their tax cut, to buy a second home worth up

the need to get benefits down, ignoring the reality that it is soaring
rents and unemployment that are pushing benefits up. He has engaged in

should—I kid thee not—get a job or sleep on a sofa. What
would he say to the severely disabled couple who came to see me who can
no longer sleep in the same room, but whose son has moved out? Because
they have a “spare room”, they have to pay the bedroom
tax. It is an immoral tax that will cost the taxpayer more because
there will be a higher housing benefit bill as people are pushed out
into the private sector and disabled people will be forced to move from
adapted homes to unadapted homes that will then have to be adapted by
local authorities and housing

Fovargue</B> (Makerfield) (Lab):</Member> There may have been
concentration today on a certain topic in the Queen’s Speech,
but in Makerfield it is the economy, the cost of living and jobs that
concern my constituents  the most. Without confidence in the
economy and job security, they will not spend, and without spending the
economy will not thrive. I stress that there need to be real jobs with
real opportunities. When I last checked the universal jobmatch site, 45
of the 67 sales jobs that were advertised within 10 miles of Wigan were
self-employed catalogue distribution jobs, many of which demand an

welcome the consumer Bill of Rights, which has been proposed to
simplify and consolidate consumer law. If people are to spend, it is
important that they are free from misleading and aggressive practices
and have access to proper redress if they have been ripped off. They
should not have to go through tortuous legal processes because of grey
areas. Last year, Citizens Advice found that three quarters of
consumers had had a problem that was covered by existing consumer
rights, and 94% of them had complained but only 10% were successful.
Improvements are needed, and I hope that the consumer rights Bill will
be amended so that consumers understand their rights, are clear about
what to expect and are given a time scale within which they can expect
redress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000082">One
notable omission from the consumer rights Bill, and from the Financial
Services (Banking Reform) Bill, is action on lead generators and the
marketing texts that people receive. Some companies, particularly in
the high-cost credit sector, for example Cash Lady, do not provide the
service themselves but simply gather details and pass them on to
lenders. The consumer is often not aware who their lender is until they
get the paperwork. They do not know whether the company from which they
are buying is in a trade association or has a code  
<?notus-xml column=731?>of practice that they can use if there is a problem. They think they are
taking out a loan with one company when they are actually taking it out
with another.</hs_Para>

Bill of Rights aims to provide transparency, which I would like to see
extended to all products and services. Particularly in the high-cost
credit sector, consumers do not always know the full implications of
their agreement. How many, for example, would agree to a continuous
payment authority if they knew that it gave the lender unlimited powers
to dip into their bank account at any time and for any amount? Such a
power also militates against the rigorous affordability checks
required.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000084">Another
area contributes hugely to the strength of our economy but is often
overlooked: the humble bus. A excellent report was launched this week
by Pteg entitled “The case for the urban bus”, and it
describes the contribution that buses make to the economy. Bus networks
generate more than £2.5 billion in economic benefits, about
£1.3 billion of which reflects user benefits from access to
jobs, training, shopping and leisure opportunities. The remaining
£1.2 billion of benefits accrues to other transport users and
society at large through decongestion, reduced pollution, lower
accident rates and productivity. The overall economic benefits are
around five times higher than the amount of public funding going to the
bus networks, and the bus industry has a turnover in excess of
£5 billion, much of which is ploughed back into regional
economies through the supply chain and consumption expenditure by
staff.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13051540000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000085">Public
expenditure on bus networks is therefore likely to have a large and
direct impact on regional economic growth. It helps the economy by
contributing to flexible labour markets and by increasing the number
and range of jobs accessible to workers, in particular less-skilled
workers who are likely to have less access to a car. However, the bus
service operators grant has been cut, and there are fears that it might
be under threat in the next spending review. Instead of salami slicing
the BSOG—an easy target—I urge Treasury Ministers to read
the report and recognise the contribution that the bus makes to the
economy. It might be the Cinderella of the transport service, but it is
used by the highest numbers of our constituents—more than any
other mode of transport—and we must look at the benefits that
the service accrues, instead of cutting it
willy-nilly.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/29325511A92A87161FFAF73E270A822E125E8A71" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 May 2013">Wednesday

Mahmood</B> (Birmingham, Ladywood) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful for
the opportunity—albeit time-limited and short—to
contribute to the debate on the Gracious Speech. We as a country face
huge challenges, and those faced by my constituents and the people of
Birmingham are acute. My constituents are getting poorer and my
constituency has the highest rate of unemployment in the country. Youth
unemployment is at 8.4% in Ladywood, and long-term unemployment has
gone up. More and more of my constituents are dependent on food banks
that operate in my constituency, and my advice surgeries are inundated
with people who cannot make ends meet and for whom simply keeping a
roof over their heads and putting food on the table is a serious
struggle. That is the reality of 21st-century Britain after three years
of this Government.</hs_Para>

scale of the challenge faced by the country, and the reality of what
the last three years have meant for my constituents, we needed a change
of direction in the Queen’s Speech and bold action to kick-start
our economy—we desperately needed a jobs Bill. We have an
unemployment emergency in this country and there are simply not enough
jobs to go around. Instead of acting quickly and decisively as required
by such an emergency, the Government are content to trundle along at a
pedestrian pace, doing a bit here and not going quite far enough there,
as if they have all the time in the world—or, more likely, two
years to kill before the next general election.</hs_Para>

constituents, however, do not have the luxury of time to waste. The
Government do not realise that each day one of my constituents remains
unemployed there is a clear and present danger to their chances of ever
being able to find work, and the longer that goes on, the more likely
it is that they will be for ever on the fringes of the labour market.
As individuals, my constituents will pay a heavy price, but so will the
country. A lost generation is not only a tragedy for those unfortunate
enough to be among their number, but frankly it does not come cheap. My
constituents were crying out for a jobs Bill—something that
would have given a chance of work to young people who have been
unemployed for more than a year, and a compulsory jobs guarantee for
the long-term unemployed who have been out of work for more than two
years. The scale of the challenge demanded that, but the Government
failed to deliver.</hs_Para>

disappointed that the Government’s proposals contained no
reference to using public procurement to boost apprenticeship places.
Again, that is a missed opportunity to put a rocket booster under
apprenticeship policy. The Government have real power in the
market—they are the UK’s biggest consumer—and
should use it strategically and for the good of the country. In March,
the Government voted against the Opposition’s plans  to
use public procurement contracts worth more than £1 million to
create apprenticeship places. The Government could make a difference. I
do not understand why they will not accept my point and weave it into
procurement policy. It is no good them praying in aid EU law, because
other European countries have been able to take into account the impact
of procurement decisions on the local economic environment and remain
within its
confines.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000090">In

hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Edgbaston (Ms Stuart) deserves
special mention for the work she has spearheaded on the Birmingham
Labour party policy review of education and skills in our city. The
review culminated in a process to create a Birmingham baccalaureate,
which will embed in the core school curriculum both generic
employability skills and sector-specific skills in areas where
Birmingham hopes to grow. I hope that, with the process we have
embarked on towards a Birmingham baccalaureate, we can address the
skills disconnect in our city, and move to a position in which young
Brummies are first in line for the jobs that are created in our great
city.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000091" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000091">In

<?notus-xml column=733?>However, the Government’s approach to regional growth so far has
created uncertainty, deterred investment, and held back regional and
local economies. I agree that local areas should have the powers and

relentless focus on the economy, clearly demonstrating that growth and
jobs are our No. 1 priority. It is sad to see the cavernous gap between
the perfectly sensible and laudable proposals outlined in the
Opposition’s alternative plans, and the half-hearted and
half-baked measures from the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:24:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051540000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0003.htm#13051540000110">In
reality, the coalition has reached the limits of what the parties can
achieve together, so all we get is this minimalist approach with only
15 Bills proposed. What was left out was almost as revealing as what
was left in. With just two years to go, the Government have no answers
and nothing to say on tackling the crisis in youth unemployment;
nothing to back small businesses struggling to get credit; nothing on
living standards at a time when families’ energy and other
household bills are rising out of reach; nothing on housing at a time
when new home completions are at their lowest level since the 1920s;
nothing to stop the undercutting of wages by tackling the exploitation
of immigrant labour; and nothing on
growth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:24:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

welfare,” if there is no work to go into. A jobs Bill would get
the 17,000 Scots, for instance, who have been unemployed for more than
two years back to work. I want to see cheaper energy too. People are
paying too much for their gas and electricity, and living standards are
being squeezed. An energy Bill could have tackled rip-off energy

still in the midst of the longest slump for 140 years. We
need to generate 2.6% of GDP and  more than 900,000 jobs to
match the output and employment rates we achieved before the financial
crisis struck. Four years into what should have been a recovery, we
have unemployment locked at an unacceptable 2.5 million,
under-employment among young people  at nearly one in five,
construction output falling, the  IMF describing
Britain’s economy as severely demand-constrained, and the OECD
saying that our society is increasingly unequal. Yet what has the
country seen in this debate today? It has seen an out-of-touch
Chancellor, an isolated and absent Prime Minister, a decaying coalition
and a weak Queen’s Speech that cannot meet the aspirations of
our people. A governing coalition riven with divisions over Europe,
welfare and child care cannot unite the country on jobs and

Gracious Address should have contained measures to inject demand into
the economy and offer hope to our struggling construction and
manufacturing sectors, but instead it simply compounds the
Chancellor’s obstinate refusal to use fiscal policy to ease the
pressures on ordinary households. Only this morning, the Office for
National Statistics revealed that in the first quarter of this year,
pay excluding bonuses rose at its lowest level since 2001, at a mere
0.8%. The OBR’s March fiscal outlook reveals that the decline in
real-wage forecasts since December would cost ordinary households a
further £200 this year, which is more than four times what the
Government are handing back through their
increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:29:23"></hs_TimeCode> in the
personal tax allowance.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:29:13"></hs_TimeCode> squeeze on

than 11% of the working-age population in my constituency is
unemployed, which is utterly unacceptable. We know from our friends and

people’s health and,  if they can find another job after
that period of unemployment, their earnings and job satisfaction. In
the UK, 18 to 24-year-olds are now 10% less likely to be in work than
they were in 2008. We should be following the successful example of
countries such as Sweden with a jobs
guarantee—initially for people out of work for two years or
longer, but eventually extended to those jobless for a year or
more—that would be paid for by a tax on bank bonuses and by
limiting the pension tax relief that top rate taxpayers receive to 20p

Even if the coalition parties do not care about the tragedy of

encouraged to see the economic folly of their policies. This Government

the Member for Corby (Andy Sawford) and my many other hon. Friends for

that Britain faces. As such, it is entirely typical of this pitiful
excuse for a Government. It is as though they could not be bothered to
think through the legislation that is needed to get our economy moving,
perhaps because their minds were elsewhere. We know where their minds
were. Downing street has been caught in the headlights. It is fixated
with internal party management and is frantically trying to hold it all
together, when what we really need is a Prime Minister and a Chancellor

action needed to kick-start growth. They are so distracted, however,

growth by now, but we have seen barely more than 1%. As my hon. Friends

Croydon South (Richard Ottaway). They were a pleasure to listen to on
my 41st birthday—and I am grateful to the shadow Financial

the Queen’s Speech, notably the hon. Members for Glasgow North

Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey), who presented their arguments
passionately.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051560000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0004.htm#13051560000031">The

Queen’s Speech contained a number of measures that will help
people who want to get on, because the best way of increasing

system that helps those who want to offer work and those who want to
find work. Our new national insurance allowance will reduce the costs
of employment for employers, and especially for small businesses
looking to hire their first member of staff or expand their work force.
We estimate that the £2,000 allowance in the Bill in question

taken significant strides in this country, but we are working together

<?notus-xml column=745?>environment that is much tougher on tax avoidance, and the
Queen’s Speech recognises that. We are making real progress. The
Chancellor, through his work in ECOFIN and in the G7, the G8 and the

greater transparency and accountability. Our efforts in that area

charities and local authorities are reporting an increase in the number

longer afford to look after them, others because their owners can no
longer control them. Battersea Dogs and Cats Home told me that 41% of
the dogs that came to its shelter last year were what it calls
“bull breeds”, and 32% of those were Staffordshire bull
terriers. The home has also seen an increase in the number of
Akitas—Japanese fighting dogs—and Rottweilers. Like other
charities, Battersea finds it difficult to re-home such dogs. Indeed,
it was unable to re-home 28% of the dogs of all breeds that came to it.
It was keen to stress that it does not destroy any dogs that can be

that the number should be reduced to two a year; others, including the

important point, which I hope my colleagues in the Home Office will

Heath:</Member></B> I do not entirely agree that it is necessary to
have consolidated legislation in order to effect the suite of measures
that the hon. Lady is looking for. There are many cases in criminal law
where various provisions dealing with similar issues are contained in
different legislation. Sometimes that has benefits. I agree that it
makes it slightly more difficult for the lawyer or the police officer
to find the necessary measure, but provided they know that there is a
measure on the statute book, they can use it. This is fairly common in
criminal law. There has been a great profusion of criminal justice
legislation over the years, much of which deals with overlapping
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T20:22:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051561001595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/debtext/130515-0004.htm#13051561001595">I
do not entirely accept the hon. Lady’s criticism. In a perfect
world we would have neat self-contained Bills on every subject, dealing
with the entire statutory background to it. In reality, the House does
not work like that. Also, there are provisions with respect to dogs and
antisocial behaviour in common law as well as statute law, so even if
we had a single statute, it would still not cover all the law that
pertains. Nevertheless, I hear what the hon. Lady

continue what I was saying, it is very important that we now work with

number of commentators have asked who will enforce the controls on

local authorities at this time. The split that we see is that police
will concentrate their time on more serious criminal matters, which
will involve investigating dog attacks under the Dangerous Dogs Act,
and not spend time dealing with stray dogs. That makes sense. Local
authorities should be taking decisions on local priorities for action
and allocate their 
<?notus-xml column=770?>resources accordingly. Some local authorities have been very proactive
and imaginative in providing local solutions and approaches to dealing
with dogs. For example, it is a requirement of Wandsworth’s
housing tenancy agreements that any dogs on its properties are
microchipped. That means that there is a direct link between the dog
and its owner, which encourages more responsible behaviour and reduces
dog-related

However, none of the key stakeholders, such as the police or local
authorities, consider it would be very effective to add more types of
dog to the prohibited list. In fact some stakeholders want the list
taken away completely and for us to concentrate on what the dog does,
not on the breed of dog. Like the police, the Government are not in

during the Polish presidency. There was general support from
participating delegations for the overarching recommendation of the
group that more was needed to optimise the functioning of the European
innovation system through improved management and coherence of the
range of policy initiatives. The UK welcomed the report and in
particular the reference to making sure policy makers and regulators
understand how to use science correctly in the development of
regulation. We did not, however, advocate a single, centralised

lunch was followed by a plenary in which three keynote speakers
addressed the topic of “How to optimise the benefits of research
investment for European jobs, growth and society”. Breakout
groups then discussed aspects of this broad theme. The UK took part in
the workshop looking at “Ensuring the global competitiveness of
European industry, including through the development and deployment of
KETS (key enabling technologies)”. The discussion was wide
ranging. The UK relayed the results of research undertaken in the UK
which showed that a key driver for industry to take part in EU
programmes was the development of pan-European networks. A major
disincentive included the bureaucracy associated with the programmes.
Other topics discussed included the importance of providing industry
with a work force with the right
skills.</hs_Para><hs_6bDepartment UID="13051529000003" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/wmstext/130515m0001.htm#13051529000003"><DepartmentName xid="14">Treasury</DepartmentName></hs_6bDepartment><hs_8Statement UID="13051529000006" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/wmstext/130515m0001.htm#13051529000006">UK

UK gas production (including potentially from unconventional sources)
and restrain gas demand (e.g. through promoting renewable heat 
<?notus-xml column=236?>and encouraging energy efficiency). Nevertheless UK gas import
dependency is expected to continue rising given declines in North sea
production. We therefore also have a range of mechanisms in place to
promote the security and affordability of gas imports, including
extensive import infrastructure, liberalisation of EU and international
gas markets, and strong bilateral relations with key gas

Heath:</Member></B> No. The Harbour Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847
aims to ensure that ports are available to all without discrimination.
It would not be an appropriate legal instrument for use by port
authorities to introduce an effective barrier to trade. In any case,
banning the export of live animals would be illegal and undermine the
principle of free movement of goods enshrined in the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European
Union.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1305163000011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/text/130515w0002.htm#1305163000011">Livestock:

school meals are not compulsory and there are many reasons why a family

The fear of being stigmatised can prevent many children from taking a
free school meal, but we have made progress in addressing this. For
example, many schools now have cashless systems and other methods to
ensure that it is not obvious which pupils are receiving a free school
lunch. The Department for Education's eligibility checking service,
used by local authorities, has also made it much easier and quicker to
check anonymously which families are entitled to free school meals.

dependent children, there may be a combination of (a) children who are
the biological children of both adults, (b) children who are the

sort. However, changes to the Building Regulations that came into force
in April 2010 introduced a new requirement for thermostatic mixing
valves to be fitted on baths in new dwellings. This was in response to
evidence which demonstrated that there were a significant number of
scalding accidents each year in the home, particularly to young
children and the old. We are not aware of evidence that would justify
extending this requirement further, for example, to
hotels.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1305168000012" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/text/130515w0003.htm#1305168000012">Housing

their high streets and encourage residents to shop locally. The main
aim of this scheme has been to harness the energy and enthusiasm of

long-term projects, and teams are taking a strategic approach that is
consciously trying not to splurge all the funding awarded at once. Each
plan to rejuvenate a high street will be different. Therefore the way,
speed and manner that local teams spend money will be different.
Moreover, town teams have leveraged additional funding from other
sources including the local authority, in-kind support (such as
premises) and free publicity. The Portas Pilots' local authorities are
the accountable body responsible for spending, and we have not imposed
performance management frameworks to monitor their spend patterns nor
are we requiring them to provide assessments of the impact on local
economic growth from this specific initiative, reflecting the fact that
this Government is committed to reducing top-down reporting burdens on
local
government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1305168000269" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130515/text/130515w0003.htm#1305168000269">Pilots

matters but considering this in isolation fails to properly reflect the
reality of child poverty in the UK today. The most recent figures
showed that 300,000 children moved out of relative income poverty. In
fact, this was caused by a fall in the median income. For such
children, life remained the same: disadvantage continued to limit
aspiration and they were no better off. We have recently consulted on
developing better measurements of child poverty, which include income
but provide a more accurate picture of the reality of child poverty. We
are now analysing the responses to that consultation, and will publish
our conclusions in the

have been published and providers must make them clear to all
