Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl

March did not go as smoothly as planned and that a number of providers
have delivered an unacceptable service, especially at weekends. NHS
England is working closely with clinical commissioning groups to
stabilise providers who have failed to deliver an effective service and

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble
Earl for that response, but on what grounds was the decision made to go
ahead with the national rollout in the light of the results from the
pilots, which showed problems with the scheme, and the fact that many
people in the NHS advised Ministers and NHS England not to roll it out

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the University of Sheffield did work for
the department reporting on the first four NHS 111 pilots. That showed
that 92% of patients were satisfied with the service and that 93% felt
that the advice given was helpful. It also found that, overall, the
service was meeting its objective of getting people to the right place
first time. On that basis, it was 
<?notus-xml column=128?>considered safe to go ahead with a rollout. Unfortunately, in particular
areas of the country, the resources deployed to meet the demand have
not been accurately assessed, but I stress that that is in a minority

on these matters. I think it would be quite difficult to turn the clock
back completely, but I take his point. There is enormous scope for GPs
to contribute to the drive to keep elderly, frail people in particular
out of hospital. Too many people are landing up in hospital with
chronic diseases who should never have been allowed to get

Wall of New Barnet:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister has just stolen
my thunder in his response to the noble Lord. Does the Minister have
any idea when the failings in the system will be sorted? At the Barnet
and Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust, of which I declare an interest as
chair, we see extra people coming into A&amp;E who, as he has just
said, are very poorly and should not really be in hospital because they
need antibiotics or something like that and would get better much

Howe:</Member></B> On the issue of A&amp;E, there is no doubt that the
NHS has been under very heavy pressure over the past few weeks. I am
pleased to say that over the past two weeks the NHS as a whole has met
the 95% standard, but obviously that statistic masks difficulties that
are still being experienced in particular locations. The challenge now
is to ensure that we are ready for next winter, and all the work that
is now being done in NHS England, by clinical commissioning groups and
within providers is designed to ensure that we are much readier for the
pressures to
come<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T14:41:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Laming" PimsId="1399" UID="1305137000169" xid="1305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000169">Lord
Laming:</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister accept that, although
we refer to “primary care services”, they are not primary
in that they are available for the shortest number of hours per week of
any part of the health service? Unless things change dramatically, it
is inevitable that accident and emergency will be seen as the first
point of call for more and more people, especially in out of office
hours<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T14:41:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="1305137000170" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000170">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> I take the noble Lord’s point. That is why
the 111 service has been created; there is no doubt that there was a
very confusing landscape in which people did not know who to call out
of hours, and they did not necessarily have the telephone number of the
out of hours provider in their area. The 111 service is designed to
simplify all that, and across the vast bulk of England people are
getting a good, if not  
<?notus-xml column=129?>fantastic, service. Unfortunately, in two areas of the country, the
south-east and the south-west, we are still seeing problems arising,
and those are being

services, A&amp;E and these 111 services need to work in a harmonious

McIntosh of Hudnall:</Member></B> Does the Minister not agree that
although corporate social responsibility is clearly important in this
matter, what is really at stake is a business model for many of these
retailers which depends upon being able to sell clothes at prices that
are, frankly, ridiculously low? I am just as guilty as most other
people of taking advantage of that opportunity when I see it, but I
would really rather not have it before me. Will the Minister say in
what way the Government can help to educate the market in this country
to understand the price of low prices?</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I understand that even if wages were
doubled in Bangladesh—I know that we are talking about a health
and safety issue—it would put only 2p on the price of a T-shirt,
so there are some real issues to tackle. As I mentioned earlier, this
is a cross-departmental issue. For example, DfID is supporting the
ethical trading initiative which is a leading alliance of companies,
trade unions and NGOs, and the Government very much support it.
Secondly, DfID, with government support, is supporting the Responsible
and Accountable Garment Sector challenge fund, known as RAGS, so a
number of initiatives are being pushed by the Government, and we
continue to put the necessary pressure on the retail
organisations.</hs_para>

Is my noble friend aware that there is nothing wrong with the building
regulations? It is entirely a matter of whether the buildings are
inspected. Clearly, the loading on the floors of this particular
factory was far in excess of what it should have been. Can the
Government not think of something practical to do? We have high
commissioners in Commonwealth countries and ambassadors in
non-Commonwealth countries. We usually have a trade section. Why can we

pointing out some of the difficulties and challenges of independence
does not mean that we are scaremongering or being negative. For

on looking at the full detail of the inconsistency of what the SNP says
about providing a new MoD, command and control, intelligence and the
Five Eyes community? These are a whole raft of issues that are
crucially important for the defence of these islands in the future

things need to be looked at, and I am not sure that they are being

one of the primary responsibilities of government is the defence and
security of the realm. The report, which was published two weeks ago by
the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commons and the Economic
Affairs Committee of this House, touched on a whole stream of important
issues related to defence. Defence is one of the issues on which a
paper will be published in the Scotland analysis series. It is
important to recognise the benefits Scotland gets, not only from our
defence of the UK but from the number of jobs that are dependent on the
defence industries in

Maclennan of Rogart:</Member></B> My Lords, have the Government given
collective consideration to how to get across to the general voting
public in Scotland the facts that are being made available, in a
department-by-department process? It is extremely important to bear in
mind that the media are not giving detailed consideration to these
issues. The Government might think it right to communicate with the
electors directly on these matters. If we follow the pattern of the
previous referendum, on alternative voting, we had two weeks of media
coverage of that issue, although admittedly it was nothing like as
important as the break-up of Britain. However, if we do not get
detailed knowledge to an intelligent electorate, we could find that the
public react against the general condition of the country at the

friend’s point about the importance of communicating the
arguments. The paper on currency to which I have just referred in my
response to the noble Lord, Lord McAvoy, had so many points in it that
some did not necessarily get the full airing that they might have. The
next paper in the series will be on the financial services industry,
and numerous issues could arise from that. It is not anticipated that
there will be any separate government publication in the run-up to the
election in the way that there was in the run-up to the EU referendum
of 1975. However, it is important that the Government communicate these
important messages and arguments for the union in a way that is readily
accessible. It is important that they are underpinned by some weighty
analysis, but there is also a case to be made for making sure that the
arguments are readily available to the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000052"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T14:59:28"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Butler of Brockwell" PimsId="2394" UID="1305137000207" xid="1120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000207">Lord

Council, must go through due process. It has been published on the

considered against the criteria published by the Privy Council Office.

place? Surely the point is that in a democracy it is the will of

of the chronology of what has occurred. It seems very strange that,
although the all-party supported royal charter was agreed before the
one put together subsequently by the press group, the only one being
put forward to the Privy Council is the press version, which was agreed
after the one that was originally put forward on an all-party basis. I
really do not understand why that has been allowed to happen. Why is
not the Privy Council also considering the one put forward on an

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I can understand the point
that the noble Baroness has made. I asked the question myself. I
understand that you cannot have two royal charters relating to the same
sort of subject dealt with in parallel. It will have to be, because of
the due process, that there is one royal charter from Pressbof, which
is a professional, body-based version, and then the state-sponsored
royal charter, which this and the other House agreed on 18 March.
Therefore, the first process is that there will have to be a
consideration of the Pressbof royal charter. Once that has been
achieved and the Privy Council has dealt with it, my understanding is
that you cannot have two applications at the same
time.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Bill"><hs_DebateHeading UID="1305137000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000234">Medicinal

Lords, it is a privilege to open this debate. We will be considering
the Government’s priorities

ahead. I am particularly looking forward to the maiden speech of the
noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox of Soho. She brings valuable business

to make the most of technology to revolutionise business and our daily
lives. She is a most welcome addition to this

measures in Her Majesty’s gracious Speech advance the
Government’s strategy to position this country for success in
the global economy. This strategy and its component parts are clear and
have been consistently articulated and pursued. Our priority now must
be the effective implementation of the policies which have been
introduced, delivering meaningful improvements to our economic
performance. The foundation of this strategy remains the steady
restoration of our public finances from their precarious state in 2010.
Although slower than anticipated growth, caused principally by problems
in the eurozone, has necessarily extended the period of fiscal
consolidation, the deficit has already been cut by a third. This has
established credibility in the financial markets and keeps our
borrowing costs at record low levels. This commitment to fiscal
responsibility, reinforced by an activist monetary policy and the
reform of the banking system, is the base on which we are building the
supply side measures, such as establishing the lowest corporation tax
rate in the G20, aimed at making the UK a great place to do
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T15:12:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000071">Last
Thursday, we hosted a conference in London which attracted senior
business people and investors from around the world. The positive
attitude to the UK’s business environment was overwhelming and
represents a significant advantage to us in the global race, which we
can exploit but cannot take for granted. Our economy faces many
challenges, but progress is promising in a number of areas: more than a
million and a quarter private sector jobs have been created since 2010,
with the OBR projecting employment to rise in every year of its
forecast. We have also seen our exports to some of the large emerging
markets increasing strongly, a trend that we must accelerate to reduce
our relative exposure to a slower growing
Europe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000072">I turn
to some of the specific initiatives driving this agenda forward.
Following the Financial Services Act, the Banking Reform Bill, which
was introduced in the previous Session, will enter this House for
consideration before the Summer Recess. This Bill is fundamental to the
Government’s commitment to pass the necessary legislation before
the end of this Parliament to restore the financial system to
stability. Only then can it effectively support growth in the economy.
The Bill implements the recommendations of the Independent Commission
on Banking, ring-fencing retail banking services on which households
depend from more volatile wholesale
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000073">In
addition to strengthening our financial infrastructure, first-class
economic infrastructure is a necessary condition for UK business to
achieve global competitiveness. Our intention is to improve our
approach to planning for, financing and delivering this critical
infrastructure as we go through a significant period of renewal. This
is very well illustrated by our ambitious programme to 
<?notus-xml column=140?>deliver transport infrastructure. We all know that good transport is
essential to drive sustainable economic growth and prosperity.
Efficient transport systems help UK businesses to be more productive by
making journeys quicker and more reliable, supporting UK exports,
enabling a flexible workforce, attracting inward investment and
rebalancing our economy by generating development opportunities
throughout the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000074">In
many cases, crucial transport investments are needed now to unlock
growth and support the supply chain. That is why we are pioneering new
ways to deliver infrastructure projects faster in all parts of the
country, from essential highway maintenance that keeps traffic moving,
to targeted improvements to our networks, to transformational
investments for future generations. We will reduce the time it takes to
plan and deliver new roads by up to a half and we are piloting a new
delivery model for upgrades to the M1, M3 and M6. We have also focused
our short-term investment plans on projects that will deliver benefits
quickly, such as addressing pinch points and extending managed
motorways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000075">Her
Majesty’s gracious Speech announced the paving Bill and High
Speed 2 hybrid Bill. High-speed rail is an engine for growth that will
help drive regional regeneration, secure economic prosperity across
Britain and support tens of thousands of jobs. We should not
underestimate the scale of transformation that rail infrastructure is
providing. Crossrail is the largest infrastructure project of its kind
in Europe—it is going on at the moment—and is one of the
largest single infrastructure investments undertaken in the UK. The
high-speed rail link will be the first new line that we have built
north of London for over 120 years —that is why we need
it—and will boost our rail capacity, benefiting many throughout
the country. Network Rail’s current investment in our railway
infrastructure is the biggest since Victorian times. Introducing a
paving Bill will allow Parliament to make a clear commitment to high
speed rail. Crucially, the Bill will also give us the spending powers
to progress the detailed design work for the scheme. We want to get
this project moving and delivered at the earliest opportunity and this
Bill will help us do just that.</hs_para>

lines that are being transformed but a concerted regeneration of major
stations is currently under way. Two examples of this are, the
£550 million part-privately funded redevelopment of Birmingham
New Street that will stimulate the physical regeneration of the
surrounding area, and the £850 million reconstruction
of Reading station, due for completion in 2015, which will add five new
platforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000077">As
to local government, we believe there is a significant opportunity to
deliver our growth agenda more effectively by supporting the
initiatives, capabilities and energy that exist in our regions and
cities. Local government has a key role to play in local economic
development. By implementing many of the recommendations in the review
by my noble friend Lord Heseltine, the Government are handing power to
the regions. We are committed to creating a single local growth fund
for 
<?notus-xml column=141?>the key areas of skills, housing and transport. The final size of the
fund will be set out at the spending round next
month.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000078">We have
brought in local enterprise partnerships, with public and private
participation, to co-ordinate regional development and enabled cities
to take control of their own local economies through City Deals. Thus
far, City Deals have been implemented in eight major cities, with 20
more to be agreed this year. Now we are going further by continuing the
process of devolving resources away from Whitehall towards local
leaders who know what is best for their areas. We are introducing a
localism Bill and the general power of competence. The Bill will
increase local accountability by empowering local people to hold
councils and local bodies to account for local spending decisions and
ensure that they deliver effective value for money. This is the final
step in a programme of reforms to local audit arrangements that will
close the audit commission and deliver an estimated £1.2 billion
of savings over 10
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000079">We are
also committed to reforming the planning system to help achieve
sustainable development. We have simplified planning and provided
incentives for communities to support development through neighbourhood
plans and the community infrastructure levy. The primary legislation
required to enact this programme is in place, and we are now
streamlining the planning application process, including by broadening
permitted development rights by exploring opportunities to create new
housing from shops and agricultural buildings.</hs_para>

our plans for economic growth but, more importantly, it is essential to
the hopes and dreams of people across the country. Our aim is to help
people achieve their aspiration to live in a home that gives them
security. The Government are committed to addressing housing shortages
through a major increase in the supply of new homes where they are
needed and wanted. This is why the Government have committed to invest
over £11 billion in housing programmes during this spending
review period. It is why, to date, the Government have sold enough
surplus public sector land to deliver 45,000 new homes. With our new
guarantees programme, we now aim to deliver 200,000 new affordable
homes by 2016-17 with over £20 billion investment. It is also
why we are providing a package of support for councils and developers
to help accelerate and unblock locally led large housing sites. In
addition, we are of course making it easier to obtain a mortgage
through our Help to Buy scheme.</hs_para>

business is a key part of our plan to improve the UK’s
competitive performance: this takes the form of tax incentives,
progressive legislation, access to finance and other forms of
intervention with a particular focus on nurturing smaller businesses.
The National Insurance Contributions Bill will entitle businesses and
charities to a £2,000 employment allowance each year. By
reducing the costs of employment, this will support small businesses
aspiring to grow. More than 90% of this benefit will go to small
businesses with fewer than 50 employees. This Bill also builds on the
robust stance that this Government are taking in tackling all forms of
tax and NICs avoidance. Our 
<?notus-xml column=142?>approach is very simple: in return for offering a highly competitive tax
system, we expect everyone to pay their taxes. The general anti-abuse
rule reinforces this principle and will deter those who market and
participate in artificial schemes. In addition, we continue to lead
international efforts to develop a more effective cross-border tax
framework.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000082">The
Government are also working hard to help UK businesses to increase
their exports. We have supported 32,000 UK exporters in 2012-13, up
from 25,000 the previous year. This has helped UK exporters to win
billions of pounds of high-value export contracts, such as £150
million for an oil industry project in Brazil and over £78
million of new business for UK rail companies in Singapore. However, we
want to do more, which is why we have committed to increase total
annual UK exports from £488 billion in 2011 to a £1
trillion target by 2020. We plan to deliver this partly through
increasing the number of UK SMEs that export from one in five to one in
four.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305137000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000083">If those
SMEs are to grow, they need better access to finance. That is why we
have set up the business bank with £1 billion of funding. Of the
£1 billion, the Government will invest £300 million
alongside private investors over the next two years in new channels,
such as non-bank lenders.</hs_para>

Green Investment Bank to stimulate the additional investment required
to finance the UK’s transition to a greener economy. In its
first six months of operation, the bank has committed more than
£635 million, including investments in each of its four priority
sectors: waste, offshore wind, non-domestic energy efficiency and the
Green Deal.</hs_para>

have implemented a package of credit-easing measures to improve the
supply of affordable credit to SMEs across the country. For example,
the Funding for Lending scheme was recently extended with incentives
heavily skewed towards SME lending support. The £1.2 billion
Business Finance Partnership was established to stimulate the
development of alternatives to bank
finance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000086">The
Government are also supporting SMEs which lack a sufficient track
record or collateral to access bank finance by providing government
loan guarantees. Since May 2010, more than 10,500 SMEs have been

billion.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305137000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305137000087">Her
Majesty’s gracious Speech announced legislation that will
further support SMEs in the design sector to drive growth through
innovation by facilitating the protection of their intellectual
property. The Intellectual Property Bill will implement the
recommendations of the Hargreaves review. One of its key elements is
the unified patent court agreement, which will make it possible for
British businesses to protect their inventions across 25 countries in a
single application. That could bring direct savings to UK businesses of
up to £40 million per annum in translation costs

consumer rights Bill during this Session. In particular, this Bill will
include important new protections for consumers buying digital content

that our future prosperity depends on our ability to be competitive in
a fast-changing world. That means competitive in terms of hosting
businesses that can take on the world and win, and competitive in terms
of attracting highly mobile capital and investment. This Government are
determined to create the best possible financial and economic
conditions for the UK to succeed in this race. First, we have to
demonstrate that we can deal with the deficit—it is impossible
to produce sustained growth if the public finances are not under
control. Secondly, we need to complete our work in fixing the financial
system so that it is able to sustain growth in the economy. Thirdly, we
must implement the reforms necessary to improve our competitiveness.
These range from the support we are providing for SMEs to investments
in infrastructure and housing and to the devolution of important local
spending responsibilities. I believe that this is the right recipe to
convert from our current phase of economic healing to one of sustained
recovery and the right recipe to unlock the aspirations of our nation

considering just how sound these pillars really are. First, on monetary
activism, there certainly has been plenty of activity—from
quantitative easing and Merlin to the Funding for Lending scheme and
now Funding for Lending mark 2. The difficulty with all that activism
is that when there is a lack of demand, it is very difficult for
monetary policy to achieve any traction, so QE2 follows QE1 and there
is no noticeable effect on lending. Funding for lending offers banks
cheap funds to lend at highly profitable rates, but there is no
noticeable increase in lending. Now we have Funding for Lending 2, and
without any prospect of sustained growth of demand the result will be
the same—no noticeable increase in lending. It is no wonder that

all that activism has achieved is a serious distortion of the monetary

no relation to Britain’s real economic condition. The conclusion

Government’s credibility in the financial markets, and that the
subsequent increase in long-term interest rates would outweigh any
benefits from cutting taxes or increasing spending. Since this is the

traders who pore over their computer screens trying to guess how the
markets will move in the next month, week or even the next few seconds,
and trying to make a secure return. In other words, they are trying to
guess what everyone else in the market will do in response, for
example, to announcements by firms or Governments, to the release of
economic data or to research reports. This is not easy, but it is made
much easier if an authoritative source makes statements that every
trader believes all the other traders will accept. We have had a
striking example of this in the eurozone, where Mario Draghi’s
statement that the ECB would do everything necessary to defend the euro
convinced each trader that all the other traders would take Draghi at
his word. Accordingly, the markets all moved together in exactly the
way in which Mr Draghi wanted. Authoritative statements can move
markets, so if all the traders are convinced that any relaxation of
austerity will result in higher interest rates in the UK, it
will.</hs_para>

They do everything they can to reinforce those traders’ beliefs.
They turn potential into reality and they cry from the rooftops that

justification they have left of a failed policy, and the danger for
Britain is that anyone will believe them. At the same time, they
falsify the arguments for abandoning austerity. No one is expecting
George Osborne to take himself off to the Tower of London, crying out

Empey:</Member></B> My Lords, every time the economy and public
spending are mentioned, the word “growth” usually
accompanies them. Today is no exception. People say that what we need
are policies for growth, as this is the only way to close the deficit
and reduce our borrowing. It is easy to see why this is a popular idea.
When one looks at the graph of spending to borrowing, a rise in tax
revenues brought about by an increase in economic activity would, over
time, solve our problems—or would it? When we were enjoying
economic growth, we increased our spending. We did not use the
increased tax revenues to pay down our debt, so when the crisis of
2007-08 occurred, we were caught in a trap from which we have not
escaped. Who said we are entitled to expect ongoing growth in our
economy? Growth will occur only if we remain competitive. We no longer
provide sufficient goods and services at prices that the world wants to
pay. This is not surprising, for a number of
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000002">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T15:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>

is on the holding-together of these two laudable elements and the
outworking of their detail that we must focus in the local economy day
by day, person by person, job by job. There are, as we have heard,
murmurs of good news. Foreign direct investment in greater Birmingham
in 2012 rose by 52%, bringing in 2,200 new jobs and more than
£174 million of new investment, four-fifths of which was within
the sectors targeted by Business Birmingham—they are in some of
the exciting areas about which we may hear later: IT, food and drink,
life sciences, digital media, professional and financial services and
advanced engineering. It was also good to hear about infrastructure
developments. I recommend that any of your Lordships who visit
Birmingham should do so via New Street station, which is already much
improved. The airport runway is also being extended so that we can
travel further. In real economics, we need to persuade air carriers to
use our regional airports. Connecting up the macro and the micro is
significant. High Speed 2 is welcome, particularly when the right
compensation deals are agreed. Of course—to bring culture into
the argument—Birmingham has one of the finest new libraries in

a little into practical matters. Those of us on this Bench are supposed
to stick to principles, but I find that principles are best illustrated
by hard decisions, particularly where money is concerned. In the
wide-ranging Birmingham social inclusion White Paper, published in
March this year and accepted by local businesses and politicians alike,
economic policies are seen as being at the heart of changing society,

from school through their not being able to engage in the economy. I

apprenticeship schemes and enabling businesses to take on more than

produce huge profits but can be profitable and can enable the 9 million
people in this country who do not have access to bank accounts to
manage their affairs in a way which will enable them to be contributors
rather than dependants. But the Government must deal face-to-face with
the appalling business of the poverty premium, which means that the
poorest people in the country pay the most for the ordinary goods that

your Lordships will forgive me for mentioning this in an economic

it through a Near Neighbours programme. Although modest in money terms,
it has already reached out in our area to 120 projects, spending just
under £400,000. The basic requirement is that people of
different cultures and faiths meet together to engage in community

principles of freedom, fellowship and service, faith, family, church,
trade and professional associations, businesses and voluntary movements
working together can achieve what any nation wants: peace and
prosperity. I urge the Government to attend to those details of
ordinary lives so that people can immediately participate in a country

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to
follow the right reverend Prelate, who is absolutely right to warn us
of the considerable dangers of unmanageable debt both in
households—private debt—and in government. We are heading
for a doubling of our national debt by the end of this Parliament to
about £1.5 trillion to £1.6 trillion. For the life of me,
I do not know how it is possible to pay back that kind of money. We are
passing on to the next generation a terrific burden, one that is tough
enough already with interest rates that are well below historical
norms. They will certainly go up, and with them will go the cost and
burden of servicing the debt. I have considerable respect for the noble
Lord, Lord Eatwell, but when I asked him by how much the Opposition
wish to increase that debt still further, he did not really give me an
answer. He told me that the Opposition did not understand this. I think
that he meant the Government, but he may have been listening to the
interview that his  leader gave on the “Today”
programme, which certainly gave the impression that the Opposition did
not understand
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Eatwell" PimsId="3069" UID="1305138000081" xid="1203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000081">Lord
Eatwell:</Member></B> I am grateful to the noble Lord for correcting
any verbal infelicities that may have occurred. I wonder if he has
noticed that the significant government cuts in expenditure have not
resulted in a falling deficit for the past two years. In the same way,
an expenditure programme targeted on worthwhile activities that
stimulated a flow of tax returns would result in a reduction in the
deficit. One other small point: when he says that there is a burden on
our children from this debt, I wonder if he ever thinks about who we
owe the debt to. The answer is that one group of our children owes it
to another group of our children. Collectively, there is no
burden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:01:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="1305138000082" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000082">Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> That is all right, then; we will just
write it off, there will be no problem and the world will continue to
treat the pound in the same way. One of the extraordinary things is
that although 
<?notus-xml column=153?>the pound has sunk significantly on the markets relative to other
currencies, we are still not able to increase our exports and improve
our productivity. As the noble Lord, Lord Empey, said, the key to this
is being able to sell goods and services to a global marketplace
competitively. Unless we can increase our revenue, we will not pay back
the debt or, more importantly, provide the public services that the
right reverend Prelate rightly emphasised as being of importance. The
issue for us is how we do that.</hs_para>

list of Bills. One of the things that I have learnt in almost 30 years
of being associated with Parliament is that legislation is seldom the
answer to any problem, and usually creates considerably more. The idea
that we should address every problem by thinking of a Bill or a new
regulation comes out of this gracious Speech. To be fair, many people
have said that they thought that the Speech was a bit thin, and in some
regards it was. Perhaps it was modesty on the part of my noble friend,
but I do not know why Her Majesty did not refer in the gracious Speech
to the fantastic success that we had last summer with the Olympics,
when Britain was advertised across the world as a competitive,
successful and enterprising nation that was proud of its young people.
My noble friend Lord Deighton played his part in ensuring that the

that we are reducing the burden of corporation tax because you pay

gracious Speech also refers to our commitment to encourage people to
save for their pensions, but why do my noble friend and his colleagues
in the Treasury continue to interfere and change the rules that apply
to pension schemes? Raids started with Mr Gordon Brown’s on
dividend tax relief. Then we had A-day; rules were going to be set in
stone and people could rely on them, but in every Budget and finance
Bill we have another nibble at the rules on pension saving. Why does
that matter? People might say that it affects only the very wealthy who
have built up very large pension pots. It matters because it undermines
confidence in a long-term saving vehicle in a country that needs more
long-term saving. Then you have the Government, who say that they are
holding down interest rates because of their control on public
expenditure—which, incidentally, is going up in cash
terms—and who are funding their own borrowing by quantitative
easing and creating, through quantitative easing, an artificially low
interest rate. You then have the contributions that employers and
companies must make to company pension schemes determined by the gilt
yield. The result is that billions of pounds that would otherwise be
going into growth and investment to create jobs for the future are
going into pension funds, from whence they will never come out because
the assessed liabilities of those pension funds have been exaggerated
by the Government’s quantitative easing policy. Far from
quantitative easing helping, it is causing enormous damage and sucking
productive funds out of the economy, from the private sector, which
would otherwise be invested in job creation.</hs_para>

Forsyth of Drumlean:</Member></B> My noble friend is absolutely right.
I remember, when I was an Employment Minister, spending hours trying to
prevent the working time directive coming into being, which ended with
our challenging it in the courts and being advised that we would lose
because the court has a duty to promote the acquis, which is about
integration. We are involved in a club that has a particular direction.
That direction is to create a country called Europe with one Finance
Minister, one currency and one set of interest rates, which will take
no account of the relative competitiveness of the member states. We can
see what is happening. The result will be years of economic decline. It
is our marketplace. It is a big marketplace, of course, but the rest of
Europe actually sells more to us than we sell to it. We have a
Commonwealth. We have relationships around the globe. We need to get
out there and sell to those parts of the world that are growing. That
is where our future lies. It does not lie in being tied up in sclerotic
bureaucracy created by this organisation called
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:13:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

all the political parties are split to one degree or another on our

we should have a referendum to end the uncertainty about our continuing

friends that the most disgraceful thing has been the behaviour of the
Deputy Prime Minister and the Liberals on this matter. I took part in
the general election campaign. I saw the leaflets that were produced
asking us to sign a petition to send to Liberal headquarters, with a
picture of the Deputy Prime Minister saying that the people of Britain
must be given an in/out vote. That is what the Liberals fought the
general election on. Indeed, the former Prime Minister, Gordon Brown,
was attacked by Nick Clegg at Prime Minister’s Questions for not
giving the people an in/out vote. Nick Clegg says that he wants to
restore trust in British politics. Holding the Prime Minister hostage
and preventing him giving the people a say on this crucial matter is a
very funny way of doing that. Let us have a referendum, get it out of
the way and then concentrate on building our prosperity by selling our
goods and services to the rest of the globe, and using those
relationships—our soft power—to make Britain produce the

noble Lords have remained in this Chamber for my speech, but rather for
the speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, who will follow
me—and quite right, too. I very much hope that she will address
the issues of entrepreneurship in such a cutting-edge industry. That
will be fascinating, not just on a personal level, but because it lends
itself so much to the issues of economic growth that we are talking
about
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:15:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:15:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000041">The
opening phrases of the gracious Speech indicated that the
Government’s purpose is to focus on building a stronger economy
and promoting a fairer society. Let me wholeheartedly endorse those two
principles, which must go hand in hand. This country has, at times in
its history, pursued one but not the other, and that has damaged us as
an economy and a

of the work of rebuilding the economy is already under way. I will pick
up on the latest measure that was in the Queen’s Speech, which
is extremely positive, namely the commitment to introduce a new
employment allowance of £2,000, not least because its simplicity
should make it very attractive to small businesses. We have heard again
today, from the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Birmingham, and
others, that small businesses are key to the future of this
country’s economy. This should be a spur to new

commend the Government on resisting the temptation to constantly think
up more legislation in the finance area, where we already have crucial
banking reform legislation to deal with. I am on the Parliamentary
Commission on Banking Standards, and our report will come out in the
next few weeks. The Government slightly surprised me today by saying
that that Bill will 
<?notus-xml column=157?>come to this House before the Summer Recess. It is very important that
the issues raised in our final report have the opportunity to be
properly considered, and, on many fronts, incorporated into that
legislation. I therefore ask the Government to take a serious look at
the
timing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:17:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000044">I
agree with one part of the speech made today by the noble Lord, Lord
Forsyth: it is sometimes a relief that we have a Government who do not
constantly try to address every problem by producing yet another piece
of legislation. When we heard the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, essentially
complaining that there were not enough new laws in the Treasury field
for this section, I thought, “Labour’s continuing with
its old habits of legislation”. I am glad that he finally agrees
that implementation and governance are the right answers, but those are
not the words that his colleagues have
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:17:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000045">In
these uncertain times in which we live, it is unwise to overestimate
green shoots in the economy. However, I have been struck by the very
positive tone that I now hear from a wide range of those working in
small businesses, in business accountancy, and even in the commercial
sector of the banking industry. Help to buy is having a very big impact
on the housing market; Barratts has reported the highest demand for
five years, and now warns of a possible skills shortage in
construction, which it is combating by planning for 600 new apprentices
and graduates over the next three years. The CBI report also reinforces
the sense that there is momentum.</hs_para>

have seen these signs before. In 2011 confidence began to grow, but was
knocked back with the problems in Greece, and in 2012 we began again to
see gathering confidence, which was then shaken by concerns over Italy
and Spain. This time, however, there is a broader base, with a pickup
in the service sector, non-EU exports, manufacturing output and retail
sales. I would love to hear from the Government about retail sales, but
I understand that much of the pickup comes from the over-45 age group,
which, frankly, was much less impacted by unemployment and by wage
compression. That group has the capacity to spend, and if it is
starting to again, that is a very important message for the
economy.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305138000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000047">Of
course, any return to recovery has its own risks. A few months ago it
was fashionable to suggest that many companies in the UK were
essentially zombie companies—the walking dead that would
collapse in an economic revival. Thank goodness that theory has largely
been discarded because it does not fit the facts. However, it is true
that as the economy improves many companies will quickly chew through
their cash reserves, and it will be absolutely critical that we have a
banking sector able to meet the demands especially of small and
medium-sized businesses. I confess that this  worries
me<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:19:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000048">The
Government’s decision in the Budget to continue and expand
Funding for Lending, with much more emphasis on small business lending,
was significant and welcome. The big banks have been clearing their
balance sheets and trying to retrain their staff to look at the sector,
and they should have enhanced lending 
<?notus-xml column=158?>capacity—although I remain sceptical about the low levels of
demand that they insist exist in the economy. However, as the economy
recovers we will definitely see a very significant pickup in demand for
credit. It will come not in steady increments but in waves of
expansion. We cannot afford for the banks to fail us again. If they are
correct that only lack of demand has been holding back the flow of
credit, we should see that change. In case they do not, I hope very
much that the Government are looking at additional contingencies. It
would be terrible to lose the opportunity of a rising economy because
our banking sector, which has never focused very much on the real
economy in the UK, failed to live up to
expectations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:21:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000049">In
the long run, new banking players and non-banking players will enter
the credit market. We must never again depend on just four
institutions, as essentially we do today. I am very pleased that we are
close to achieving a proper regulatory framework for peer-to-peer
lenders, and that they are getting support from the business bank. I
congratulate the regulators, the FCA and the PRA, on a complete
about-face in historical strategy. They are now setting out to remove
barriers to the entry of new banks. Measures such as seven-day account
switching will finally let ordinary people change their banks to get a
better service, and will open the opportunity for new players to
thrive. The Chancellor has proposed that the regulator should take on
the payment system—the plumbing of financial services and
banking—which has been in a sclerotic state and made it almost
impossible for any new players to enter the market. We are moving
towards an environment where competition is
encouraged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:22:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000050">I
am still concerned that waiting for banking and credit markets to grow
organically and provide us with new players of any size will take
longer than we can wait, and longer than one economic cycle. For that
reason, I urge the Government to look closely at RBS, and possibly
Lloyds, and consider splitting them up. People talked about splitting
RBS into a good bank and a bad bank. That would have made sense five
years ago but we are past that point now. Much more interesting would
be a split into a number of regional banks that could identify and
focus on the needs of each regional business base. For decades we have
let the market shape our banking industry. It has been a disaster; we
have seen nothing but consolidation and homogenisation. We now need the
Government to tackle the failings in the structure of the industry, not
just the failings of individual banks, which they are tackling with
capital requirements, ring-fencing and other measures, so that it is
fit for purpose, and the purpose is serving the real
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:23:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000051">I
know that Lloyds and RBS have had trouble selling off the pieces of
their own banks that they have been forced to sell by European law. Two
points are relevant here. One is the appalling legacy technology that
the institutions are burdened with, which has not been brought up to
date. The other is a general expectation that they will simply
consolidate into another new big bank rather than remain sustainable as
regional organisations. Economies of scale have dropped sharply and
dramatically with modern technology. Highly competitive regional banks
have proved viable across  
<?notus-xml column=159?>the globe. If national banks cannot serve our businesses and regional
banks can, we should seize the once-in-a-generation opportunity of
returning two major banks to the private sector to build the banking
structure that best supports our
economy.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/F9F15581372F86C96F16CAC3EE917B60FECEE81F" __version__="1.9"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 May 2013">Monday,

I first met her when she was running lastminute.com, the business she
started with Brent Hoberman. Unlike so many digital businesses,
lastminute.com is still going strong. However, the noble Baroness, Lady
Lane-Fox, has moved on and now sits on several boards, including

February, “Woman’s Hour”, that most influential of
programmes, anointed her as one of the 100 most powerful women in the
UK. From what we have heard today, I am certain that she will make a
very powerful contribution to your Lordships’ House. Britain
needs more people to build businesses and create wealth. The gracious
Speech spelt out that the Government’s first priority is to
strengthen Britain’s economic competitiveness, but we have a
long way to go. I am delighted that by 2015, this Government will have
cut the rate of corporation tax to a level which makes the UK the joint
lowest in the G20, but a low rate of corporation tax will not ensure
our competitiveness. The UK suffers from a dire level of productivity.
Figures released in February by the Office for National Statistics
showed that output per British worker trailed the G7 average by 21% in
2011. Output per hour was some 16% worse than across the other major
industrialised economies, the worst figure for 18 years. Economists
expect that the picture will be even bleaker in the current year.
According to Spencer Dale, the Bank of England’s chief
economist, the level of private sector productivity is around 15% below
the level that would be implied by a continuation of the trend before
the economic crisis

that low productivity disadvantages the country and we need to find a
way to improve it. The gracious Speech heralded some welcome measures
for business—in particular, the promise of further deregulation.
Red tape remains a major hindrance to business efficiency and
undoubtedly puts UK firms at a disadvantage when competing particularly
with those from outside Europe. Europe, of course, is where much of the
red tape begins.</hs_parafo>

cited by my noble friend Lady Kramer to exempt companies from the first
£2,000 of their national insurance bills. That should encourage
businesses to recruit, but the Mayor is right when he cites low skills
and a lack of investment as the key to Britain’s productivity
problems. The Government are doing their best to enhance the skills of
those currently in the education system and are committed to trying to
ensure that school leavers not going on to university move into
training or apprenticeships. However, we have far too many unskilled
workers. According to the Chartered Institute of Personnel and
Development, there are on average 45 people applying for every
low-skilled job. Improving the skills of the older unemployed is
essential—and so is investment.</hs_para>

companies are sitting on an unprecedented cash pile. Non-financial
businesses had a total of £672 billion in the bank
last year. The Government have tried to encourage them to invest.
Generous capital allowances are available but that policy has not been
noticeably successful. There seems to be a risk aversion in business
and the key may be to address the chronic short-termism that the Mayor
cites. The owners of big businesses, the shareholders in public
companies, do not encourage investment for the long term, because they
are too interested in short-term gains. We need to find a way of
encouraging investors to think long term and to foster an attitude that
does not view stocks as mere gambling chips.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>There have been

aspect of the economy on which I should like to focus is the dominance
of London. Even allowing for the importance of financial services to
the capital and the hammering that the sector has taken in recent
years, London’s economy has outperformed that of other regions
since 2007. Between 2007 and 2011, it grew by a nominal 12.4%, compared
to just 2.3% in some parts of the country and no more than 6.8%
anywhere else. This led to London’s share of output increasing
from 20.7% to 21.9% over that period. The right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Birmingham spoke eloquently of the needs of the
regions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305138000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#1305138000069">Whether
the statistics say that we have escaped a double-dip recession or not,
there are many parts of the country where the views of economists count
for little. If it looks like a recession, if it feels like a recession
and if it hurts like a recession, it is a recession. The Government are
pledged to push a greater proportion of growth-related spending to
local areas from 2015, and we have heard how that will be of benefit.
However, more can be done. The numbers employed in the public sector
are decreasing but will remain substantial. Wherever possible, those
jobs should be pushed out of London—not just the clerical jobs
but the jobs at the top. In the digital age, with Skype available to
all, there is no need for everyone to be in the capital. The savings in
property costs would be beneficial, as would the boost that would be
delivered to the regions. I am sure that plenty of civil servants would
hesitate even to contemplate this and might talk about the huge
transport bills that they would incur when coming to London for
meetings. Forget it; they can just go online. I am sure that the noble
Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, can advise on how that could be done. There is
much talk of rebalancing the economy away from financial services to
manufacturing, but a bit of rebalancing away from London would also be
a good
idea.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/F6C866C2D78532D754FEC4062D7BE8F481571F0E" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 May 2013">Monday,

Eatwell pointed out in his magisterial analysis of the short term,
austerity will not improve our tax revenues, nor will it reduce our tax
expenditures. There are perhaps three timescales over which one can
analyse economic prospects: short, medium and long, by which I mean for
the short term possibly three to four years, for the medium term 10 to
15 years, and for the longer term perhaps 20 to 30
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:43:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The

European Union in all its manifestations now goes back for the best
part of 50 years. It is partly in view of the
extraordinarily peremptory and dismissive speeches made by the noble

recipe for leaving the European Union and indeed for the future of the
nation as a whole is, in my view, catastrophic. It is going down an
ideological road and is far from an objective analysis of our economy
and our place in the world. It is also as far removed from pragmatism
and empiricism as something that went on in the Labour Party in the
1980s, and that is where the Conservative Party will wind up if they
follow that line. In the short term, it will be, as I said,
catastrophic. Figures published today by the TUC, which has done some
analysis of the statistics of the International Monetary Fund, suggest
that by 2017 our per capita income in Britain will have increased by
precisely 0.0%. I know it sounds extraordinary that a figure should be
as precise as that but it works out that our living standards, our per
capita income, in Britain will have risen by precisely 0.0% since
2008<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:45:22"></hs_TimeCode>. Given the
vast increase in the quantum of the top 1% and, indeed, 10%, that
explains the deep cut in living standards for the median and the vast
majority of the British people who, not surprisingly, are angry and
disorientated as a result, and are prepared more readily to listen to
sophists such as Mr Farage and others nearer to

acknowledge that the EU as a whole has not had a very much better
record, although perhaps I may draw attention to the fact that per
capita incomes in the same series in Germany and Sweden—two
examples of northern Europe—will both be projected to have risen
by 10% in this period, a point to which I will return. In passing, I
will also mention that on a couple of occasions I have asked my noble
friend Lord Eatwell a rhetorical question about how we will pay for
this, that and the other without increasing the deficit. The noble
Lord, Lord Forsyth, says that we have to get on urgently with filling
up the potholes. Perhaps he will pay for it himself but I assume that
it will come out of public

is the bigger economic picture that we face in this country? Just to
put the numbers another way, the loss of output in these 10 years below
our earlier potential of roughly 2% growth per annum comes out at some
extraordinary numbers. If you look at the cumulative loss against that
trend, by the year 2017 it will work out at some £3
trillion—£3,000 billion. It will not be £30
billion or £300 billion but £3,000 billion. People can
work it out for themselves. The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, is looking
puzzled but if he does a bit of mental arithmetic he will find that
that is in the right ball park. I know he does not have time to work
all that out in the time of my speech but perhaps later he will realise

to  draw attention to one or two features of the trade deficit.
It is not that we cannot grow our economy in the European Union. If the
EU per se is the reason for 
<?notus-xml column=165?>some incompatibility because of so-called red tape, how is it

of course, which relies much more than we do on something as old
fashioned as manufacturing, is rarely mentioned by the new ideologues.
They seem to think that there is something magic about the City of
London. For every £2-worth of goods or services—in the
statistics they come to the same thing—we now export, we import
£5-worth. This is, in part, to do with our exchange rate. Of
course we cannot go on devaluing the pound without our living standards
falling. However, if we want to regain our competitiveness, I could
argue at the same level of abstraction as the noble Lords, Lord Forsyth
and Lord Lawson, who think they are brilliant economists—I do
not think that I am a brilliant economist but at least I can see the
fallacies in what they are saying—but what is wrong with saying
that although we are now stable at 85p to a euro we would be more
competitive at parity with the euro? That is a devaluation of 15%. With
the growth of our educational system and our whole industrial policy,

Razzall:</Member></B> My Lords, first, from these Benches I
congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox of Soho, on her
brilliant maiden speech. Like other noble Lords, I look forward very
much to her contributions to the deliberations of this House and her
contribution to driving growth in the economy, which she touched on so

criticism of the gracious Speech, particularly from those on the
Benches opposite, who suggest that it is slight and insubstantial. I do
not share that view. The criticism suggests that the role of government
is to legislate. I do not believe that that is right; the role of
government is to govern. Do we really believe that the 30 or so crime
Bills in 13 years of Labour Government caused the recent drop in crime
rates? I certainly do not. I come from the school which believes that
we have too much legislation, and I have often thought that
occasionally a one-line Queen’s Speech saying, “My
Government propose no legislation this year”, would be
appropriate. Whether your Lordships agree that the primary role of
government is to govern, all must agree that the Government now face
two major challenges, both of which have been touched on by other noble
Lords: what to do about the economy and what to do about
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:58:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is common ground that economic growth will not be forthcoming without a
correction in aggregate demand. Unlike in the 1930s 
<?notus-xml column=167?>when Keynes was a lone voice against the austerity measures of the Bank
of England, there is also now common ground that an economic slump is
not self-correcting, that there are limits to monetary policy alone in
dealing with a deficiency in aggregate demand, and that fiscal policy
plays a significant role in stimulating demand. But then policy
advocates part company. On the one hand, Keynes is prayed in aid,
particularly on the Benches opposite, to dignify any proposal to spend
more money and oppose cuts, while on the other hand, the right
wing—not represented quite so strongly here—sees its
authority in Hayek rather than Keynes to justify supply-side
arguments—namely, that we need more deregulation, to scrap
employment legislation, and that growth will come from the private
sector always filling the space left by a retreating state. I have
always leant towards the Keynesian side of the argument, but I have to
accept that the UK crisis since 2008 is different from that in the
1930s.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051310000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#13051310000023">In the
1930s, we did not see the difficulties in the banking sector that we
have had since 2008. Indeed, in his classic work, Keynes hardly
mentioned the problems of the banking sector. If we take banking assets
relative to GDP, the UK has the biggest banking sector of any major
industrial country. The banking crisis and the measures taken to avoid
future crises have, as my noble friend Lady Kramer said, seriously
impeded credit flows, particularly to SMEs and to individuals. As the
Minister indicated, the Green Investment Bank and the business bank
represent an attempt to start to deal with this problem. However,
progressing from millions to billions being available for investment
through those two institutions will not be
easy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:00:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051310000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#13051310000024">To
understand the other difference with the 1930s, I need to be a bit
technical. In the 1930s, Keynes assumed that private sector multipliers
of two to three times for every £1 of public sector spending
would apply. However, the Office for Budget Responsibility now
estimates that there is an income multiplier of only 0.4 for tax cuts
and revenue spending and a multiplier of one for capital projects. Tax
cuts, or an increase in current spending as advocated by certain
members of the Opposition, would have significantly less effect on the
creation of demand and carry a much greater risk of damage to our
credibility in world markets and our ability to finance the
deficit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:01:04"></hs_TimeCode>.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:01:16"></hs_TimeCode> the
coalition Government were formed in 2010, it was clear that the UK
would lose the confidence of our creditors without a credible plan for
deficit reduction. However, the issue for the Government now is whether
the balance of risks has changed. In May 2012, the IMF said that the
risk of losing confidence as a result of a more relaxed fiscal policy,
particularly the financing of more capital investment by borrowing, may
have diminished relative to the risk of deterioration of public
finances through lack of growth. I believe that there is now a case for
a significant increase in public investment where there are impediments
to growth, particularly capital spending on housing and infrastructure
spending on the so-called “shovel-ready”
projects<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:01:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051310000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#13051310000025">On
Europe, the noble Lords, Lord Lawson and Lord Lamont, as well as
television star Michael Portillo, have now weighed in on the side of
the “come out”  
<?notus-xml column=168?>camp. I am slightly reluctant to intrude on Tory grief over this issue
but will make three points against them. First, the
noble Lord, Lord Lawson, disagrees with the common assumption that
leaving Europe would cost 3 million jobs. Indeed, he said that the
Deputy Prime Minister was talking “poppycock” in using
that argument and knew nothing about economics. As Alistair Darling
said in the <I>Times</I> last week, although any assessment is
theoretical, even if only 1.5 million jobs would be lost, that is a lot
of jobs.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:03:05"></hs_TimeCode>, the
main thesis of the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, was that our presence in
Europe distracts our industry from competing in the growth markets of
Asia, India and South America. However, it does not seem to stop the
Germans in those markets—and they do not want to come out of
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:03:05"></hs_TimeCode>. The
third argument against those advocating coming out seems to be the
potential loss of international investment. The motor car industry is a
classic example of an industry that has seen major overseas investment,
primarily because of our presence in the European Union. The motor
vehicle industry is a huge success story—last year, for the
first time ever since the creation of the motor car, we exported more
motor cars from the UK than we imported. Why should Tata, the Japanese
and the Americans locate a new plant in the United Kingdom if we are
outside the European Union? It is a highly risky strategy to assume
that the European Union would allow us free trade in motor vehicles if
we were outside
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:04:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051310000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0001.htm#13051310000026">I
have a suspicion that the arguments to come out, certainly from members

about £700 billion in cash on their balance sheets—money
that is looking for places to invest but companies are lacking the
confidence to do so. In addressing the growth strategy—which
currently seems to be absent—the biggest task facing the
Government is to instil confidence in people and companies. We have to
recognise that there is a demand problem facing the country. That is

ensure that confidence is based on reality. As a member of the
Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, I am very much aware of
the reality that in banking and finance the architecture has crumbled.
We need not just to reform but to rebuild that from the floor up. We
cannot afford to apply a sticking plaster to a system. Just how much
the system has disintegrated was admitted by Adair Turner, the former

we—as the authorities, central banks, regulators, those involved
today—are the inheritors of a 50-year-long, large intellectual
and policy mistake. We allowed the banking system to run with much too
high levels of leverage, inadequate levels of capital, and we ignored
the development of leverage in the financial system and in the real
economy. And not only did we ignore it but we had a pretty overt
intellectual philosophy that we could ignore it, because we knew the
financial system was just a market like any other and whatever it did
was bound to be for the good because that’s what markets are
… I was surprised at the supervisory approach. I’d been
on the board of a bank, I’d been involved in banks, I’d
dealt with banks back in the 1980s and 1990s, and I, throughout that,
had accepted the existing capital regime as a given, right? I had never
gone back to basics and said, ‘Why do we allow banks to run with

my point of view, there is not a chance of that happening, and it is
simply not true. Alistair Darling made it clear in an article in the

billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:11:51"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
vital that we do not turn a paper loss into a real one with a hasty

Standards is doing excellent work, it is not the forum to produce a

way forward, but the blueprint is for the Government. That is not our
main focus. Our focus when we were established was clearly to look at

we do not at present know what is on the banks’ balance sheets.
Less than two weeks ago, the Financial Policy Committee said that
British banks have a £25 billion shortfall in capital overall.
The other day, the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, representing 55
public pension funds, stated that the Royal Bank of Scotland has
£10 billion of undisclosed loan losses on its balance sheet
because it is using accounting standards that allow loss to be booked
only after it is incurred, however likely a default may be, thereby
underplaying the likely losses. We have been here before with
accounting standards, when the banks, in their heyday, booked options
and their own bonuses and expenses based on expected profits. A year of
two later, however, the profits did not materialise. It is a sensitive

the other week, I had discussions with HMRC after the noble Lord, Lord

Following my discussions with HMRC, the head of the business unit wrote
to me to say that HMRC has 92 issues with the big banks at the moment

avoidance schemes. Those matters have still to be determined. They will
not be determined tomorrow or next month; it could take between seven
and 10 years. The sum of £3.2 billion could have considerable
impact on the prudential stability and health of banks. The banks have
set aside £16 billion already for PPI mis-selling—perhaps
that is a euphemism for fraud—and that figure is not final. The
situation is fragile and illustrates the folly of making definitive
judgment calls before a general election. We are presently clawing our

employees giving up their rights for shares? This was against the will
of business. It was twice sent back by the House of Lords to the House

I have learnt from this is that I could see very clearly that the

illegal immigration, the bad immigration that harms our country, and
yes, we need to deal with that. Unfortunately, though, the signals that

gracious Speech, are about discouraging and deterring the immigration
that we benefit from. The number of Indian students has gone down by
more than 40,000. In fact, recently we had a former head of immigration
from Australia in the UK, and he said that every day in Australia they
pray and thank God for the existence of the UK Border Agency. It has
been proven unfit for purpose; that is why it is being dismantled. We
are harming our competitiveness. If students do not come here, they go
to Australia, Canada and the United States. It is one of our biggest
strengths. We need to send out a very clear signal that we want
immigration to benefit this country and that we appreciate the good
immigration that has benefited it.</hs_para>

many people, particularly from China, who come to Europe, come as far
as the channel, but do not come to the UK because a Schengen via for 25
countries is cheaper than a UK and Ireland visa. We should join
Schengen. Anyone who has a Schengen visa should be able to come into
this country. The reason we do not join Schengen is that we are worried
about our border security. I have just spoken about the UK Border
Agency. Why are the Government continually postponing imposing exit

we should be proud. That is in spite of the fact that we spend less as
a proportion of GDP on R&amp;D and innovation than the OECD or the
European Union. We spend half the proportion of GDP on R&amp;D that
South Korea spends. When it comes to higher education funding, overall
we spend less as a proportion of GDP than the EU average or the OECD
average and way below countries such as the United States. Why is it
that the United States always bounces back quickly? Why is it so

the past two or three years a number of reforms to the police have
taken place: the introduction of police and crime commissioners along
with pay and pension reforms. Somebody joining the police gets
£19,000 a year, yet a new PCSO gets £25,000 a year. What
message does this send out? Then there is the potential for the
introduction of direct entry at the rank of superintendent, with no
experience of policing anticipated. How many people would go to their
surgery to be seen by a doctor whose only experience is as a helicopter
pilot? These changes, and others that have taken place over the past
decade or so, are completely counter to those who label the police as
“the last unreformed public service”. In addition, police
have to deal with the impact of reforms on other services, particularly
in the area of mental health. There are too few areas where places of
safety are available on a 24-hour basis to assess individuals who are
suffering from mental illness and in need of immediate support. This
means that far too many people have to be taken to police cells
following their detention under Section 136 of the Mental Health Act
due to the lack of an available place of
safety.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000037">The

closely together but there are still the same number of chief
constables, deputy chief constables and police and crime commissioners

Crime and Policing Bill will enable the creation of the police
remuneration review body. Police officers are officeholders,
independent of state and answerable for their actions to the law. This
onerous responsibility brings many restrictions on an officer, not
least of which is the fact that they are forbidden in law to take
industrial action. The transition from the current national Police
Negotiating Board must take into account an officer’s inability
to directly influence policy concerning police pay and conditions of
service. Mechanisms must be put in place to ensure that officers feel
that they will be treated fairly by the Government of the day. A system
of appeal that can be influenced by the Police Federation is essential
so that the relationship between state and officeholder continues with
a common understanding. I would also urge caution with the current
proposals to introduce compulsory severance, which could change the
independence of the constable. There should be a pause to ascertain the
necessity for something drastic, particularly as many no longer see it
as necessary. It is the first duty of government to

Tugendhat:</Member></B> My Lords, I will focus on one of the biggest
disappointments of our economic reforms over the past few years. I
refer to our failure to expand our exports as rapidly as had been
hoped, and in particular to expand them outside the eurozone, despite
the 20% devaluation of sterling on a trade-weighted basis since 2007.
Ministers invariably place the blame for this on the sluggish
performance of the eurozone. Certainly the eurozone’s sluggish
performance has played a significant part, but as an article on UK
export performance in the February issue of the Bank of
England’s <I>I</I><I>nflation </I><I>R</I><I>eport</I> points
out, UK exports have increased by much less than those of several
eurozone members, including Spain, Italy and Portugal, for whom the
eurozone is also their major export market.</hs_para>

Bank of England suggests that part of the reason for this is the
weakness in demand, since 2007, for financial services provided by
banks and other financial institutions. Devaluation cannot do much
about that—which, given the composition of UK exports, shows the
limitations of devaluation as a means of boosting British exports.
However, devaluation should have given a boost to British manufactured
exports beyond the eurozone, and our failure to make progress on that
front is particularly
disappointing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:41:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000041">The
contrast with Germany is particularly striking. Against the background
of rising trade with both eurozone and non-eurozone countries, the
balance of Germany’s trade has shifted in favour of the latter.
In 1999, when the euro began, some 45% of Germany’s trade was
with other eurozone countries—now it is 37%. The fastest-growing
partners for German foreign trade include China, India, Korea,

we so stuck in the eurozone, as Ministers keep pointing out, while they
are so much more successful at breaking out into markets in other parts
of the world? The single market is meant to be a launch pad for selling
to the rest of the world, not a contemporary equivalent of imperial
preference. Germany and other countries have achieved that break-out,

great supporter of inward foreign direct investment. Many foreign

it cannot be gainsaid that much of foreign direct investment into
Britain has been made to supply European markets rather than markets
outside Europe. The companies that have made those investments see
their UK plants as part of a worldwide network in which plants in
different geographical locations are aimed primarily at different

do not mean to be absolutely black and white about this. Corporate

said already, this is a complex matter in which many factors come into

review to determine to what extent the subsidiaries of foreign-owned

one part of the world, it will follow that the supply chains that
service them will equally be concentrated on that part of the world.

As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:49:23"></hs_TimeCode> the Business

there are no easy answers. However, there are some wrong answers, and
these include a slavish belief in deregulation and in scapegoating the
European Union for our difficulties. I ask, as my noble friend Lord
Glasman did recently in an article in the<I> New Statesman</I>, why
Germany is doing comparatively well. It has the highest level of
workforce participation in its governance; it has the greatest degree
of regulation of labour market entry through insistence on high-class
vocational qualifications; and it has the most severe constraints on
capital in its banking system. How can that be? The orthodoxy practised
on the other side of the House is that you grow by deregulating,
reducing workers’ rights and cutting some standards. The
Queen’s Speech mentioned extra proposals in that direction. The
German example is not being followed. We should go for the high road

to the TUPE arrangements whereby staff from one franchise can
automatically expect to move forward to the next. It does not seem that
the Department for Transport is in any way equipped to work out a

Mitchell:</Member></B> My Lords, in my reply to the gracious Speech, I
will address two issues. The first is the special concern of small
business growth, and the second the consequences and opportunities of
the digital
revolution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000063">Despite<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:00:12"></hs_TimeCode>
the fact that my job definition as Shadow Business Minister includes
responsibility for SMEs, I have vowed to myself to refrain as best I
can from using the expression SME. It is so engrained in our
vocabulary, but it is such a misnomer. The fact is that small
businesses and medium-sized businesses are not the same and should not
be grouped together; their requirements are so different that combining
them is an error. Those who do so, in my opinion, demonstrate that they
have no understanding of the particular needs of each
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:00:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

<?notus-xml column=183?><hs_para UID="13051320000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000064">As I have mentioned on
many occasions in your Lordships’ House, nearly 40 years of my
business career were spent in the small business environment. Well,
that is not quite true, because the three small businesses I founded
each grew to become medium-sized international companies. But in the
beginning each business started with a few of us sitting around a small
table, or at the bar in a pub, where we said, “Wouldn’t
it be a good idea if?”. It is very hard to convey what it is
that motivates one to become an entrepreneur. When I think back, I
sometimes think that I must have been crazy; the incidence of failure
in start-up businesses is heavily stacked against the entrepreneur.
What few people outside the entrepreneurial circle understand is just
how stressful it all is. There is the perennial stress that the money
might run out, that an important customer might go somewhere else, or
that a key employee might be recruited elsewhere. You need the
constitution of an ox. Put simply, it is not for everyone, but if you
succeed it is truly
wonderful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:01:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000065">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:02:06"></hs_TimeCode>
I created my companies I never thought about the rates of income tax,
corporation tax or capital gains tax, and I certainly did not have the
vaguest notion what inheritance tax was, nor did I care. Indeed, when I
started my first business in 1972, I seem to recall that the top rate
of income tax was 83%, plus unearned income tax of 15%—not what
one might call an entrepreneurial incentive. To me it was all
irrelevant. I wanted to be my own boss. I had worked for big companies,
and I simply knew that I could do it better; it was the arrogance of
youth. I loved the freedom, I loved building teams of well motivated
and excited people, and I revelled in the joys of customer
satisfaction. So when I hear politicians somehow thinking that a tweak
here and an incentive there will suddenly turn us into an
entrepreneurial society, I know that they have got it wrong. It is not
how it works. Nothing illustrates this better than the
shares-for-rights issue that we debated at length in the previous
Session. No businessman would have dreamt up such lunacy as
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000066">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>
does matter is creating a climate where the entrepreneur feels
comfortable—and for them, as for all business people, the one
ingredient that gives comfort is confidence. Success in any field comes
from confidence. Just see what happens to a football team when a great
new manager arrives; the same players are revitalised. As the Minister
will know better than anyone, we saw it in the Olympics. When people
believe in themselves, they can move mountains. As it is with sport, so
it is with business. Confidence comes from leadership, and leadership,
of course, comes from the very top. When I look at the grim face of
George Osborne, all I see is dour despondency. What he needs to do is
to lighten up and provide strong, positive leadership. He needs to
change the atmosphere, be upbeat and introduce a strategy for growth.
He could have done it in the gracious Speech, but he chose not
to.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000067">Goldman<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:04:16"></hs_TimeCode>
Sachs, for which I know the Minister has a special attachment, has run
an interesting study in business growth, and I would like to bring it
to your Lordships’ attention. Several years ago, Goldman Sachs
introduced a project called 10,000 Small Businesses, which is a target
that it set for itself. In conjunction with five UK universities and
based on its American 
<?notus-xml column=184?>experience, it set its goal to supercharge ambitious small businesses,
seeking to generate small business growth that otherwise would not have
happened. The results have been
extraordinary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000068">Small<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:04:58"></hs_TimeCode>
businesses are the major source of job creation and also drive economic
growth through innovation and market expansion. It is true that the
overwhelming majority of small businesses do not grow and are static;
they are important, but they do not produce economic growth. But there
is a small percentage of small companies that are ambitious, growth
hungry and well run. What the Goldman Sachs programme seeks to do is to
locate such high-growth companies and propel them to achieve
significantly greater returns. So what does Goldman Sachs do? It
selects high-growth potential companies that have more than 10
employees and a turnover of just over £1 million and screens
them carefully to determine their ambition and their management
competence. Each CEO commits to undertake 100 hours of involvement over
a four-month period. As Goldman Sachs puts it, they are companies that
have dreams and talent which they wish to translate into advanced
action. They learn about money and metrics, leadership, marketing,
strategy, financing, and putting it all together. At the end, they
produce a business growth plan—not so much a business plan, more
a commitment to growth. The most exciting aspect of the programme is
the dependence on peer-to-peer learning and engagement, which comes
from the entrepreneurs themselves, from different backgrounds and
different industries, sitting down together, challenging, querying and
providing support from each other to each
other<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:06:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000069">The
results are staggering. Employment growth is up 23% compared with 1%
for small businesses as a whole, and there is revenue growth of 16%
compared with minus 9% for the small business area as a whole. Equally
impressive are the following qualitative statistics: 92% became more
confident of their ability to grow their businesses; 83% introduced new
internal processes; 81% used financial data to derive business
decisions; and 84% had an understanding of external finance options
that they did not have before. The programme has so far created around
2,000 new jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:07:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
This type of programme is not exclusive to Goldman Sachs and variants
are practised by others, but there is no denying that these are
impressive results and an indicator that selecting high-growth small
companies with big ambitions and helping them to accelerate their
growth is an important way to stimulate the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000070">I
cannot let the opportunity go by without welcoming the noble Baroness,
Lady Lane-Fox of Soho. Her maiden speech was outstanding; for me, as an
IT entrepreneur, it touched many key points. The noble Baroness is not
in her place, but perhaps I can relate to fellow Members of the House
of Lords how I first met her. I had to see her to do with a charity
that I was involved in, and I was given an address in Soho. I went
along this street and that street and, eventually, was standing outside
what I would probably describe as a massage parlour. It was a tanning
salon—noble Lords get my drift. I was pretty concerned about
this, but I went in through the aforementioned massage parlour 
<?notus-xml column=185?>and into the noble Baroness’s office, where lots of exciting
people were doing amazing things in the IT sector.</hs_para>

part in my own life. As a misbegotten youth, I used to spend much time
there going to jazz clubs and generally hanging around. But perhaps I
should move swiftly on. When I met my wife, she was a film director
working in Soho, and we had our wedding reception there. In a moment of
complete madness I opened a mega-restaurant just off Dean Street, which
failed dismally and cost me a fortune. I put it down to a learning
experience. So one way or another, Soho is part of my life. My only
regret is that, unlike the noble Baroness, I did not have the foresight
to include Soho as part of my

those of us in the IT sector, Martha Lane-Fox, as she then was, is a
legend. Lastminute.com was one of the triumphs of the dotcom boom and
one of the survivors, as was I, when all around us collapsed. Indeed,
the noble Baroness is a born survivor. No matter what slings and arrows
have been flung her way, she just brushes herself off and gets on with
it. She has been a champion for our industry and has helped government
understand the challenges of the digital revolution. Through her
chairmanship of Go On UK, she has sought to make Britain the most
digitally skilled nation in the world. That is a tough challenge in
that, as she said, 7 million people have never used the internet. I am
delighted to have a fellow IT entrepreneur in your Lordships’
House and I look forward to working with
her.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000073">There is
a digital train crash about to happen. In the past few months, we have
seen some dramatic failures on our high streets. Jessops, HMV and
Blockbuster video have all gone bust but not as a result of the
financial crisis, the Government’s policies or the boom in
out-of-town shopping centres. They have failed because they were unable
to anticipate the tsunami of the digital revolution. Cameras are on
their way out, music is streamed, DVDs are downloaded over the
internet. This is just the beginning and we had better get used to it.
The internet is changing everything. It is Schumpeter’s creative

increasing from the younger generation. I discovered last weekend that

aspects of the gracious Speech, particularly the action that is

raised previously in your Lordships’ House but without success.
I am glad that proposals are now in place to deal with it. Other than
that, I think that the gracious Speech is regarded as being somewhat
thin, and there is a tendency to concentrate on what has been left out
rather than what has been put in, particularly at the other end of the

far as economic management is concerned, is embodied in the paragraph

strongly support the line that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has
taken on this. However, I am somewhat concerned by the assertion, which
was repeated by my noble friend on the Front Bench this afternoon, that
we have reduced the deficit by a third. I do not think that that is the
right way to put it. One should say that we are still increasing
borrowing at two-thirds the appalling rate set by the previous
Government. I do not believe that this can go on. It is crucial that we
find a means of reducing that deficit, as stated in the gracious
Speech. I said right at the beginning of the formation of the coalition
how difficult that would be. We are still not the least bit clear where
the Opposition stand. Mr Balls still seems to be saying that the
deficit has been cut too soon and too much. I do not believe that
either of those assertions is
valid<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:19:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000078">However,
the policy is now being reappraised. An IMF team is making its usual
annual visit to the UK. The press seems to be indicating that the
IMF’s support for the Chancellor’s policy is weakening. I
believe that that is wrong. I very much hope that the IMF will continue
to sustain his efforts to reduce the deficit and ensure that our
position is sustained
internationally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:14:48"></hs_TimeCode>.
Various people have argued against the stance adopted by the
Chancellor, as we have heard from the opposition Front Bench today.
However, one thing is absolutely clear: the rating agencies are not
reducing our rating because we are cutting the deficit too much but
because we are not cutting it enough. That is an important point to
take into account.</hs_para>

the same time, we have to relate this overall problem to economic
management. Demand management seems to have disappeared totally from
discussion. It is very important, however, because if we find ourselves
in a situation—as we are—where fiscal stimulus is not
possible, we must rely on monetary measures. To that extent, I very
much welcome the action that has been taken on quantitative easing. It
is, of course, true that this is having a serious effect on pension
funds, as was pointed out by the opposition Front Bench. The time has
probably come to reappraise whether achieving quantitative easing by
working through the gilts market is the right way to do it—that
is, the rather ludicrous situation whereby the Bank of England
purchases the gilts and then pays interest to the Chancellor. That is
rather silly. We should consider other ways of doing this as we will
never want to reissue the debt which has been purchased. If we need to
do that to control inflationary pressures later on, that can be done by
issuing new gilts, which are likely to be of a better 
<?notus-xml column=187?>form and duration than those which have been purchased. I suggest to my
noble friend on the Front Bench that we need to do some serious work on
that

article by my noble friend Lord Lawson was very helpful in as much as
it made one think afresh about Europe. I have to confess that for many
years I have said to people that there is no question whatever of our
withdrawing from Europe. I believe that the time has come when we need
to reassess that. Indeed, the Prime Minister has indicated that that is
the case. The timetable that he has set out is right. In television
interviews he is asked whether he would vote to stay in or to go out of
Europe if there were a referendum tomorrow. However, that is a totally
false question. People come down on one side or the other but usually
state their reservations, which are then totally disregarded in
subsequent headlines. That is the situation we happen to be in but, as
I say, the Prime Minister’s proposed timetable is right and we

noble friend Lord Lawson and others are too pessimistic about
negotiations. At all events, we should take the opportunity to
negotiate. It would be absurd simply to say that we will pull out
without any negotiation whatever. That would not be the right way to
approach the problem. However, irrespective of whether the negotiations
are likely to be successful, the touchstone is the financial
transaction tax. If we fail to resist that being applied to the City of
London, the possibility of successfully negotiating other issues may be
less than one would hope. None the less, overall, it is worth entering
into negotiations and it is worth while to have a referendum in due
course, as is
proposed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051320000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051320000082"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:20:00"></hs_TimeCode>Meanwhile,
those who are in my party need to be very careful. There is not to be a
referendum, as I understand it, unless the Conservative Party wins the
next general election. If there is one thing that I learnt from some 18
years on the executive of the 1922 Committee in another place it is
that the electorate are far more concerned about whether a party
standing for election is united than they are about any individual
policy. I lived through that in 1997. My only consolation was that the
people on the 1922 executive who were being such a pain were the ones
who lost their seats. We really must deal with this issue with a little
more sensitivity. The press is bound to blow up enormously the matter
of a referendum as a great event, which it may be, but we have to keep
a sense of perspective on this

Anything which can be done to make markets work better for consumers is

role played by the Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham, in
accepting our amendment on requiring letting and managing agents to
belong to an ombudsman

landlords, and help clean up the sector, which can only be good for the
provision of much-needed homes. She should be proud of the results of
her arm-twisting. Thirdly, I welcome the opportunity that will be
provided through pre-legislative scrutiny of a draft Bill. This will
ensure that we end up with a Bill that will make a real difference to
consumers. That is probably enough of the good

turn to what is not in the Bill and where the Government have failed to

the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill whereby service providers
should have to exercise a fiduciary duty towards their retail savers or
beneficiaries. The Government resisted. We asked for the Competition

funding of trading standards has been slashed, thereby making the

The Government also failed to introduce a register of lobbyists. Yet
who has the money to pay for fancy public affairs companies? It is not
consumers. Whether it is the tobacco industry, drinks manufacturers,
the insurance industry, food producers or newspaper proprietors, their
bought access is never in the interests of their customers but of those
industries’ bottom line. We need to know who is paying for such
access. Sadly, the Government omitted from the gracious Speech
proposals in this area. When tested, the Government have shown
themselves to be lacking in resolve to help consumers negotiate

consumers’ ability to claim for losses from misleading
advertisements or aggressive sales practice. We welcome the remedy for

been local integrated services, Total Place, small area budgets,
participatory budgeting, Total Neighbourhoods and the Neighbourhood

in common: they were short-term initiatives promoted by one Minister.

how do we move integrated working forward and deepen practical

the importance of long-term leadership. In my experience, real change
happens in a community where there is clear, committed leadership that
remains involved for the long term. Secondly, we need to resolve the
confusion between democracy and delivery. The reason local services are
not joined up is not that local people are not consulted. While it is
good to understand the priorities and concerns of local people, joining
up delivery is hard work and, if at every turn the partners feel they
need to check via some amorphous consultation process, it is likely to
run into the sand. Instead, we need to enable and encourage
local organisations to deliver services together, and to use the
Government’s procurement muscle to deepen partnership working
between the sectors. Business is now up for this but it needs
encouragement and not signals that point to a retreat.</hs_para>

distance themselves from broken political promises, I suggest our

this one are sticking with it. I am talking about the western terminus

where planning permission would have been turned down by the Highway

I turn briefly to direct farming issues. Farms and the farming
industries provide a variety of different businesses within the whole.
They produce food, look after the countryside, care for biodiversity
and are involved and engaged in energy projects. One thing makes the
farming community different from all other businesses: it is subject to
the vagaries of the weather. Over the past year, snow, sunshine and
drought followed by floods have obviously had a big impact. Farm
incomes for 2012 show a bottom-line decrease of some 14%. UK
agriculture is but part of the food industry, but it is an enormously
important one that wants to play its part. It needs people with
vocational training and appropriate skills. Science and technology are
hugely important, while innovation is key to making our businesses
grow. Farmers are responding to these issues and they are willing to
take calculated risks. They look to diversity and growing new ideas
outside their businesses.</hs_para>

a danger in this description. It seems to play to popular notions of

to this country as refugees who have made enormous contributions, not
least in academic fields. However, in framing the introduction of the

sure that the Prime Minister and many of those close to him understand
and share my view that international students are an enormous asset to
the UK and make both an immediate and a long-term contribution to this
country. Where I think we differ is in believing that the UK is doing
the best it can to attract such people. Although the Prime Minister has
gone some way to explaining that the UK welcomes international
students, that has not been enough to counter the effect of recent
policy restrictions and, perhaps more significantly, hostile rhetoric.
If the Prime Minister wants to see growth in this important area of
university activity, he is going to have to do more. Removing
international students from the net migration target would send an
important signal that the Government do not intend to meet that target
by means of steadily tightening the rules for students. In that
context, can the Minister explain how the measures in this Bill will
affect students? Will they be affected by new restrictions on access to
the NHS? Which appeal rights will be lost? What calculations have the
Government made on the impact of requirements to check immigration
status in regard to the supply of private rental
accommodation?</hs_para>

the Government’s aim is to achieve a balance in policy which
ensures that the UK attracts migrants who contribute to the country,
what plans are in place to increase our attractiveness, given the
evidence that we are losing ground? The Minister may say that
applications for visas to study in universities are up, and that UCAS
figures are also up. There are a good many people in this House who
understand these figures and know that the really important measure is
the number of new enrolments. These figures, as the Minister will no
doubt be aware, have shown a decrease recently, particularly for
post-graduate taught students. In the context of a rapidly growing
market, this should be a cause for concern. While the Government are
clearly doing what they feel they can to put off those who, in their
view, are unlikely to contribute, where are the measures to attract
those who clearly do make an unequivocal contribution?</hs_para>

speak briefly about something which was absent from the gracious
Speech. Last year, we were led to expect a higher education Bill. We
now know that we will not see one this side of an election. However,
even without a Bill, the Government will be taking decisions that will
have a major impact on the 
<?notus-xml column=200?>future of our universities. The spending decisions that the Chancellor
will make in the next couple of months for the years 2015-16 will be
very challenging indeed, and I certainly do not envy him the task. But
the biggest priority facing this Government is the return to growth. It
would be economically short-sighted in the extreme to cut funding for
teaching and research at this time. NESTA has shown that 54% of jobs
growth between 2000 and 2005 was produced by innovative companies. It
also showed that innovative companies employ more than double the share
of graduates than non-innovative businesses. The UK now ranks second in
the world for university-business collaboration.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:07:18"></hs_TimeCode> amazes me
that we still spend substantially below the OECD average on tertiary
education in the UK, and we spend substantially less on research than
many of our competitors. This would be precisely the wrong time to make
that disparity even worse. The industries which are going to help us
re-establish growth need graduates and they need a strong research
base. I hope that the Government will not prioritise one at the expense
of the other. Yes, we need to maintain expenditure on research, but not
at the expense of student numbers or efforts to widen
participation.</hs_para>

that context, we know that part-time undergraduate numbers in England
have decreased considerably, with a 40% drop in part-time enrolments
compared with 2010. We really cannot afford to ignore this. I am
pleased that the Government have asked Universities UK to lead a review
into the reasons for this decrease. The fact is that although many in
higher education have been aware of the issue, little public or
political attention has been devoted to it. A recent meeting of the
All-Party Parliamentary University Group heard some of the possible
reasons for the fall, but we were all struck by the fact that if
something like this happened to the full-time population, there would
be an enormous reaction and great concern; there should be concern
about part-time provision too. The changing demands of employers mean
that we have to provide routes back into education for people long past
their early twenties. I would like to ask the Minister what assessment
has been made of the impact of the drop in part-time enrolments on the
economy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000060">I

education. Today, I will talk about the creative industries, so there
is quite a nice overlap. However, perhaps I may start by offering my
congratulations to the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, who I know a
little. She made the most fantastic maiden speech. Her father, the
distinguished historian,  
<?notus-xml column=201?>was sitting next to me and said that he was far more nervous than she

the creative industries and the contribution they make to our economy,
our shared identity as communities and as a nation, and our reputation
in the world. Matthew Parris has referred to the culture of a country
as its heartbeat. It is a fitting image, as considerable economic
benefits flow into the body politic from cultural activities. The
UK’s creative industries are a significant contributor to our
economy and can, if properly nurtured, play a key role in the
nation’s financial recovery and be part of the solution to the
problem of our young people facing
unemployment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:10:46"></hs_TimeCode>, to
which the right reverend Prelate  the Bishop of Birmingham
referred. They are a result of innovation, ideas, imagination and
spontaneity, inspired by the rich tapestry of British arts and culture.
As a country, we have always been blessed with a wealth of creative
talents which have shaped and illuminated our history and national
identity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000063">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:11:32"></hs_TimeCode>
have a global reputation for creativity and innovation, even more so
since last year’s Cultural Olympiad. Who can forget that opening
ceremony? It was a beautiful and brilliant spectacular; complex and
humorous. In celebrating the entity that is the United Kingdom, it was
a showcase for our great creative industries. We saw our pre-eminent
conductor, Sir Simon Rattle, performing with Mr Bean. There was James
Bond, first the product of a writer, Ian Fleming, and then of
film-makers, actors, special-effects creators, costume and set
designers, and those who make the costumes and sets. It celebrated our
children’s literature, music, television and art, and how art
and design can come together in such a wonderful creation as Thomas
Heatherwick’s “The Cauldron”. And centre stage of
course—literally—was Tim Berners-Lee, British creator of
the world wide web. The ceremony was shot through with our creative
accomplishments, and was a huge one in its very

as I am that this is a debate partly about the economy, I have some
statistics. The UK’s creative industries are worth more than
£36 billion a year, generating about £70,000 every minute
for the UK economy. Employment in the sector has grown at double the
rate of the economy as a whole. At least £856 million per annum
of spending by tourists who visit here can be attributed directly to
arts and culture. The economic contribution of the arts and cultural
sector has grown since 2008, despite the UK economy as a whole
remaining below its output level before the global financial crisis.
The UK has the largest cultural economy in the world as a proportion of
GDP. That is all according to a report brought out by the Arts Council
last week. That last point is crucial, because in today’s global
economy, where capital and labour are so mobile and goods and services
can be produced almost anywhere, it is the power of ideas and
innovation, and of creativity and design adding value, that will bring
growth, economic success and prosperity. The world’s creative
industries make up around 7% of global GDP and are rightly being
recognised as crucial  
<?notus-xml column=202?>to economic success. While ours are a driver for economic growth in the
UK, they are also helping our country compete
effectively on the world stage.</hs_para>

the Prime Minister’s trade envoy to Mexico. On a recent trip, I
was impressed by the opportunities that this one country potentially
offers the UK in terms of trade and by the reputation that goes before
us there in the area of the creative industries. Guadalajara, the
second largest city in Mexico, was designated last year by the new
Government as a digital creative city. Developing that is a priority
for the Government and for the governor of that area. It will focus on
attracting technology companies that produce video games, movies,
multimedia and mobile applications—all areas in which we
excel—and offers a clear opportunity to achieve our
Government’s target of doubling bilateral trade with Mexico by
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000066">Then
there is the contribution that creative industries make to the vitality

area of great concern is the cuts being inflicted at local government
level on arts and culture, despite LGA and Arts Council research that
shows the benefits council investment in these areas
brings—revitalising local economies and regenerating
neighbourhoods that have seen traditional industries decline. Sheffield
is an old example of this: an economy that was based on the
manufacturing of steel, cutlery, engineering and tool-making. Its city
council was the first to recognise that investing in cultural
industries was an alternative as a source of employment creation and
urban regeneration. It discovered that putting money into culture
became investment rather than simply
subsidy.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13051331000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000068">As
I mentioned at the start of this speech, I sit on the board of the
Lowry in Salford. The idea behind it was to build a major arts complex
as a trigger for the regeneration of the area. In 1996, £64
million of National Lottery money was allocated. Central to the
Lowry’s ethos is interaction with the local population through a
community and education programme.  An example is the
“Walkabout” project, in which a  member of the
Lowry team and a range of artists spend 14 months within a
specified community—recently the Yemeni and Orthodox Jewish
communities. The primary aim is to help them turn their own ideas into
creative projects that articulate local issues. A recent report showed
that 71% of, I think, the 2,340 people involved in it said that it
helped them develop skills which would be useful in future jobs while
81% said participation made them feel more part of their local
community. The establishment of the Lowry has been a resounding success
in encouraging social cohesion but also as a catalyst for the
regeneration of the local economy. The BBC’s decision to
relocate some of its key departments to Salford Quays and the
subsequent development of MediaCity are clear evidence of this. They
brought with them employment, traineeships and new floor space for
business and residential
property.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000069">In
conclusion, the creative industries punch above their weight, providing
a significant return on what government invests. The UK is fortunate to
have a 
<?notus-xml column=203?>powerful creative industries sector, but we must maintain it. This
creative economy needs creative innovators and employees—we must
continue to create the creators. Interestingly, this is an area where
we do not have a jobs problem but a skills problem, so it is excellent
that the coalition Government have listened to the industry and
included computer science in the science strand of the EBacc; and
excellent that, last October, the Secretary of State for Education
announced bursaries of £20,000 for 50 top graduates to train as
computer science
teachers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000070">However,
the creative economy needs people who are not just skilled in computer
science but also art and other creative subjects. My noble friend Lady
Hanham will not have heard this but many other noble Lords have heard
me ask about Darren Henley’s review into cultural education,
which was published 18 months ago and greeted with great enthusiasm by
the Secretary of State for Education. We were told that a national plan
for cultural education would follow immediately. When I asked last
autumn, I was told we would be getting it this year; when I asked at
the beginning of this year, I was told it would be in the spring. We
may or may not have had a spring but we certainly have not had a
national plan for cultural education, so I am asking again when this
might happen. We should listen to such successful and highly respected
individuals as Sir James Dyson and Sir John Sorrell, who argue that we
should invest more in creative education and
design.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000071">The
other area in which the creative industries struggle is in getting
access to finance. It is a two-way problem. The banks and the regional
development funds do not understand the creative industries and the
creative industries are not aware of the various support schemes that
exist. I commend the coalition Government on setting up the Creative
Industries Council, the remit of which includes addressing this
problem. But I draw to the attention of my noble friend the Minister

we find they have been inadequately discussed or whole chunks of them

have only recently thought of things or because of points made by
Back-Benchers in the other place or this House. Sometimes, as in recent
Sessions, we get Bills such as the Public Bodies Bill or the Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform Bill, which range over an unrelated mix of topics
so it is quite difficult for us to understand what the specific aims of
the legislation are. Sometimes the aim of the Bill may be clear but the
solution that the Government propose to us is not at all clear.

previous Session, the purpose of the Groceries Code Adjudicator Bill
was perfectly clear and the Government had a perfectly good answer to
the question: what is the purpose of the Bill? The Competition
Commission had recommended that because of the overweening powers of
supermarkets, suppliers such as farmers and others deserved some sort
of protection and dispute machinery. Why on earth did the Government
not simply give this role to the Office of Fair Trading, which was
about to be amalgamated—under another Bill of the
Government’s—to form a powerful competition body called
the Competition and Markets Authority? Instead, a new institution was
set up, a charming lady has been appointed; nobody knows how many cases
it will receive, but a whole new institution has been set up with a
back office and all the rest of it. I do not know how much work it is
going to do. It must be very difficult to estimate because
“groceries” is very narrowly defined. Nobody knows quite
how many different anti-competitive practices may emerge that deserve
to be looked at by this adjudicator. It may take some time to know what
the result is. It does not even cover all supermarkets; only the
biggest ones are

and again, the Government tell us that there is a great need to protect
small and medium-sized enterprises. I apologise to those who think that
there is a real difference between small and medium-sized. Of course
there is, but they are classed together for many purposes and that
seems quite reasonable. One of the troubles that SMEs—as I will
continue to call them—suffer from is late payment of debts.
Larger companies deprive SMEs of their cash flow because the cash flow
does not proceed in accordance with the dates that the contract has set
out. Payments are delayed and small companies have to put up with that.
This is a very real problem. I have not seen the full report yet but I
am glad to note that the special adviser to the Government on matters
of enterprise, the noble Lord, Lord Young of Graffham, has pointed
specifically to this problem as something the Government ought to deal
with. Of course, I entirely agree.</hs_para>

creating some new body, one should look at the Financial Conduct
Authority, which was set up recently by the Government; it is a
perfectly good, existing body that could be given the task of assisting
the creditors among the small enterprises which really need assistance.
It is unreasonable to leave it to consumers or small businesses to

consumer rights” sounds like some kind of holy grail, and people
have been using that phrase for quite a long time. I have been involved
with the reform of consumer law one way or another for about 50 years.
In the 1960s and 1970s Governments of different political colours set
about making a number of changes; for example, making illegal any
contract terms that sought to exempt a seller from his normal liability
to supply goods that are fit for their purpose and of satisfactory
quality. Incidentally, it used to be “merchantable
quality” but it was reasonable for the Houses of Parliament to
accept that “merchantable quality” was not a phrase that
would appeal particularly to the ordinary consumer and something else
was needed, and so one has “satisfactory quality”,
bearing in mind the price and description of the goods. That was an
excellent change, but I wonder whether the setting out of consumer
rights more simply can be achieved, because it may be very difficult.
It may be asking the impossible to set out rights in such a way that
they are self-explanatory and the consumer needs no help, but I am

is no particular section that deals with it, so I am taking
today.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13051331000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000086">Two
questions arise. The first is whether Gordon Gekko was right about the
driving force of capitalism—if he was, it is a very serious
matter, and it is claimed by some that that is the case—or
whether David Hume was right and has given us fair
warning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000087">The
second question is: what is the relationship between a stronger economy
and fairness? That relationship is posed in the gracious Speech. I am
with Hume in the voting lobby on both these questions. Hume’s
case is pretty straightforward. He argued that one of the two major
responsibilities of the state was to enshrine in law the rules
concerning property—who owns what, what are the grounds of
legitimacy of ownership and what are the rules governing the transfer
of property and wealth, because societies, until well into west
European history, used other means of transferring property and other
means of claiming legitimacy of ownership. This covers much of what is
important to all the members of our society. It covers ownership of
property, payment of wages and salaries, payment of taxes in life and
death, inheritance and financial gain or
loss.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000088">Hume
argues that in a society where everyone understands these rules and
sees them enshrined in law, we find them broadly acceptable. In such a
society, there will be stability, continuity and sustainability, which
are essential in many ways—not least in “building a
stronger economy”, because without these civic virtues enshrined
in our society the strength of the economy will begin to fray. It would
also help in “strengthening Britain’s economic
competitiveness”—another phrase from the gracious
Speech.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000089">However,
connoisseur as David Hume was of the ways of men and women and the
contortions of civil society, he saw that the needs of society went
beyond the simple definition, simple acquiescence and enforcement of
law. A just society goes beyond simple acquiescence in words of the
law; it goes beyond the capacity of the  
<?notus-xml column=207?>state simply to enforce the requirements of the law. A just society
requires the acceptance of a shared concept of fairness within that
society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000090">Acquiescence
in the law is fine, and indeed necessary up to a point, but it is not a
sufficient condition of health in a society, whether economic health or
civic health. If one’s sole criterion of acceptable behaviour,
commercial and financial, is whether that behaviour is in accord with
the law, Gordon Gekko becomes the relevant guru—“Greed is
good”, if you can get away with it. If the definitions of law
are inadequate or, even more, the enforcement of law is weak, then
“grab all you can” is the order of the day. Forget
flaccid words such as “fairness” and
“justice” even if they feature in the gracious Speech.
Tax evasion is, after  all, not the same as tax avoidance,
especially if you  are an international company with
international tax arrangements. Tax avoidance is okay, provided your
overseas bank account is sufficiently shielded from the gaze of
HMRC.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000091">Greed in
those circumstances, Gekko would claim, is actually good—it is
good policy; it is the right technique to use. After all, as both
Amazon and Starbucks argue in these circumstances, it provides jobs and
satisfies customers. There is some good in it. “Well, what is
wrong,” some would ask, “with the going rate of £4
million as an average perhaps annual bonus in certain areas of the
financial services? Four million pounds is not big by comparison with
some of the bonuses paid, but it is the equivalent of 40 years’
earnings for a university professor, a junior consultant and all sorts
of people who are considered reasonably comfortable. There is something
odd; there is a distortion that we have drifted into when £40
million—and that is at the lower end of the scale—is seen
as
acceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000092">“All

all else on the economy. It was a reminder to us all that although we
have made some progress, there is still much to be done and our
Government are committed to staying the course and maintaining our

a businessman myself, I was particularly heartened to see that central
theme running through the very heart of our plans for the next 12
months. I am sure that everyone will agree that the way to strengthen
our economic competitiveness is by growing our economy back to the

believe that the twin engines behind achieving that will be those of
increasing our level of international trade and attracting higher
inward investment from overseas. Last week, the Prime Minister spoke
passionately to financial leaders at the global investment conference,
when he rightly said that we face a sink or swim moment in the global
economic race. Indeed, two of several key points that the Prime
Minister outlined were focusing on trade deals and ensuring that the UK
remains as internationally connected as

figures were also released last week which showed that our successful
management of  the 2012 Olympic Games brought the UK an extra
£2.5 billion of direct foreign investment, increasing our
productivity and, ultimately, our competitiveness. It created 58,000
new jobs, and 105,000 jobs were safeguarded as a result, firmly
retaining our position as the leading destination for foreign
investment in Europe. UK Trade and Investment was involved in helping
to deliver the majority of those projects and should be applauded for

focus must now turn to maintaining the momentum. We need to prove to
the rest of the world why the UK remains an ideal place to do business.
Specifically in terms of trade, I believe that we must begin to look
much more seriously at developing our trade relationships in Africa. We
have historic ties with some African countries and we can build on
those connections further. Strong growth over the past decade has
already helped to reduce poverty, and the International Monetary Fund
recently forecast that sub-Saharan Africa will grow by 6% over the next
four years. In fact, Ghana, Mozambique, the Congo, Liberia and six
other African economies are expected to grow by 7% or more this year.
To put that into perspective, the only other emerging economies in that
7% growth club are China, India and Vietnam.</hs_para>

specifically mentioned in the Queen’s Speech, we must also

the Thatcher Administration. There is concern that manufacturing is not

Session of Parliament we considered two pieces of legislation that one
might have thought would have addressed some of these problems: the
Growth and Infrastructure Bill and the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform
Bill. Both have now been accepted by both Houses, but both contained
provisions weakening employment rights, making it more complicated and
costly to sue for unfair dismissal, changing legal requirements
relative to accidents and illnesses through work and making it more
difficult for workers to obtain compensation. Then there was the
peculiar provision whereby workers surrender employment rights, fought
for by previous generations, in return for shares. I and a number of
noble Lords opposed those provisions—unfortunately, without
success. The Government appear to believe that a system in which
workers are regarded as disposable—hired when needed and sacked
without rights when no longer required—will improve the economic
situation. I think that they are wrong. The support of the workforce is
necessary if companies are to succeed. Will Hutton, the director of the

course, trade unions insist on good pay and conditions. One of the
problems about the private sector, where union organisation is low, is
that the pay is too low as well. The benefits system is actually
subsidising employers who pay low wages. That has an effect on the

that families are not rendered homeless. We have discussed these issues

rents are too high and pay is too low. The TUC is calling for the
introduction of the living wage, in the hope that this will lift
families out of poverty.</hs_para>

shall refer to three strategic issues relevant to the gracious Speech
that could help the Treasury: first, reducing public spending where it
is higher than it need be by investing more in prevention; secondly,
reducing overhead costs caused by duplication in public service
provision; and thirdly investing further in social rented
housing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000125">In
terms of prevention, I am very disappointed that no Bill is yet
proposed on the minimum pricing of alcohol. Recent research from Canada
has shown that a 10% increase in average minimum price would result in
a 9% reduction in hospital admissions and a 32% reduction in wholly
alcohol-caused deaths. The costs to the NHS, the police and local
councils in dealing with the consequences of alcohol abuse and excess
are substantial. It is in the interests of the public purse that
minimum pricing is introduced. The same is true of smoking, where good
work has been done to reduce it. Reducing it further through plain
packaging would save the NHS yet
more.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000136">As a
third example of how investing in prevention can help to cut costs, I
shall mention concessionary fares for pensioners. I declare that I am a
holder of a concessionary bus pass. I raise this in the context of the
forthcoming Care Bill and proposals for the support of children. There
has been some discussion recently about the justification for such
passes, but too often it is considered only in terms of its immediate
cost. Concessionary bus fares should be seen as part of the support
system for carers. They enable older people to travel to give help to
families and friends. Demands on the public purse for care could rise
without the availability of those bus passes. In addition, without the
income from bus passes to bus companies, many bus routes could close
down or else would require higher public subsidies to keep them
running, which would be of no help to those trying to get to and from
work. There are no plans, of course, to change the policy on
concessionary passes, but could we look again at levels of
reimbursement to local authorities and make them reflect actual usage
of buses rather than simply a population split? As a national scheme
with national funding, the distribution of the budget needs to reflect
the higher costs in those areas with lower car ownership, more bus
routes and hence more
passengers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000137">Next
I shall speak about the potential for reducing public spending through
reducing the overhead costs of public sector organisations that we now
know can be achieved through whole community budgeting. There have been
whole place pilots in Greater Manchester, west Cheshire, Essex and the
London boroughs of Hammersmith and Fulham, Westminster, and Kensington
and Chelsea. This latter tri-borough community budget 
<?notus-xml column=214?>pilot concluded that it could within five years deliver savings of
approximately £80 million per annum across all public services
through initiatives to drive growth, build homes, create jobs, reduce
dependency and rehabilitate offenders. That report was published in
October last year. Essex has estimated £127 million cashable
savings. West Cheshire and Greater Manchester also forecast substantial
savings. The evidence from the Local Government Association is that
savings of between £2 billion and £5 billion a year
across England can be generated, depending on implementation. In the
context of a forecast £16.5 billion funding gap for local
government by 2019, it has become clear that some of it could be made
up for by community budgeting. It has become vital that this process is
progressed
speedily.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000138">I
agree substantially with the noble Lord, Lord Eatwell, on housing and
social rented housing in particular. It is not enough to try to
stimulate new housing simply by subsidising mortgages, which is likely
in any event to lead to higher prices. The priority has to be
increasing the housing supply at levels of affordability, which is why
relaxing the housing borrowing cap for the local government rented
sector matters. More properties for social rent could reduce
significantly the Government’s housing benefit bill in the more
expensive private sector. Local authorities have further headroom to
borrow without it being counted as public sector borrowing since their
local housing accounts are now trading accounts.</hs_para>

which I shall take a close interest. The first is the local audit Bill.
A key role of the Audit Commission was to assess good practice and
value for money, and I do not want to see it lost as new audit
arrangements are introduced. The second is the water Bill which will
reform the water industry in England and Wales. I welcome, in
particular, the proposal to ensure that flood insurance remains
affordable in areas of high flood risk. When we debated the Growth and
Infrastructure Bill, I raised concerns that the duties on Ofwat might
be insufficiently strong to drive economic growth strongly enough by
guaranteeing an adequate water and sewerage system deliverable to all
premises. The Minister indicated then that my amendment was probably
unnecessary, and that may indeed be so. However, there might be an
opportunity during the passage of the water Bill to make Ofwat’s
obligations even more explicit, and I hope we can look at this
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051331000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051331000140">Finally,
making the economy stronger is central to this gracious Speech. The
role of our universities will be central to that process. Universities
working with their regions and with regional banks will help to
underpin the work of LEPs and local authorities. But in repairing our
economy, can we put youth unemployment at the top of list of
priorities? The Government have done good work with apprenticeships,
but the current scale of youth unemployment is deeply worrying. All
proposals for investing in growth, of which there are many, should be
tested for the number of long-term jobs that they can generate for
young people because we cannot permit a lost generation, as seems to be
happening in some other parts of
Europe.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/050F1B733EA83E5407F6929A3E9CC018FC711D1A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 May 2013">Monday,

large one is the Thames tunnel, the £4.3 billion tunnel to
remove the inflow of sewage-flavoured rainwater into the Thames when it
floods. I believe that it is the wrong project, that the wrong company
is doing it and, equally bad, that the regulator does not appear to be
regulating. That is to the detriment of customers and the environment.
There is no point in the Government investing in infrastructure if the
private sector can or should do it or if there is a cheaper or better
alternative, especially if that will create more and local jobs, as I
believe this one will.</hs_para>

discussed for many years and Thames Water is now starting the process
of obtaining planning permissions. However, in the past five years,
there has been increasing evidence from around the world that the
scheme is out of date. The best example is probably in Pittsburgh in
the US, where it has been demonstrated that preventing the volume of
storm water entering the sewage system in the first place is a much
more effective solution. It is easier to achieve, there is much less
risk than building a big tunnel, it will use lower-skilled and
therefore local labour and  it will start the clean-up of the
river much sooner, which could mitigate the effects of the potential
fine from the European Commission of up to about £1
billion because the Government have failed to clean up the Thames. The
problem is that neither the Government nor Thames Water have examined
this new option properly. I wrote to Ministers about a month ago,
asking them to set up an independent inquiry to look at the
alternatives; I have not had an answer yet.</hs_para>

an inquiry is Thames Water itself and whether it is a fit and proper
company to undertake such a project, especially when it has reduced its
asset base over the years to the extent that it says that it cannot
fund the tunnel—it needs government help, which the Government
have kindly given it through legislation last year—but still
suggests that this project will add £80 to the bills of every
Thames Water drainage customer for the next 125 years. Thames Water
customers go well past Reading to Oxford and places such as
that—that is a lot of customers.</hs_para>

in his opening remarks that the Government intend to tackle all forms
of tax avoidance, and the Treasury indicated a few weeks ago that the
Government intend to stop companies bidding for major contracts if they
have used aggressive tax structures in recent years, perhaps this
particular company and project should be looked at. Other examples
include Wales &amp; West Utilities, which was recently sold
to Cheung Kong Infrastructure Holdings, where the
shareholder equity was largely represented by a shareholder loan at 15%
to 21%—not bad for a boring utility—and Arqiva, where the
equity is represented by shareholder 
<?notus-xml column=216?>loans at 13% and no corporation tax has been paid from 2007 to 2011. It
is difficult to find much information about Thames Water. One thinks
that Macquarie Bank is involved, but it is almost certain that it has
followed the same route, which is the kind of route that many of these
utilities have followed.</hs_para>

If the island community of 2,000 is to survive, its economy, now based

the decline in visitor numbers is more rapid than that in mainland

for good. There remains a fixed-wing air service of eight-seater or

Land’s End. These planes—as anybody who is an expert in
them, which I am not, will tell you—are much more vulnerable to
bad weather than helicopters. The “Scillonian” operates
March to October and has just had a good refit for a five-year life
extension. As noble Lords will know, the original build of the ferry

loss of the helicopter has brought into focus the dire service that
remains. Between November and March, Land’s End was closed due
to waterlogging for more than half the days. Immediately before
Christmas, 177 people were queueing, unable to travel between the
islands and the mainland for over three days; they finally got there on
Christmas Eve. Some islanders have in desperation travelled in a RIB, a
high-speed motor boat, from the Scillies across 20 or 30 miles of very
rough sea, costing 12 people £1,200. That shows the desperation;
it is not as if there are a lot of rich people there.</hs_para>

year ago, the Council of the Isles of Scilly produced a report
comparing the transport available there to that for the Scottish
islands: charges, frequencies and the lifeline service concept, which
ensures an affordable service to all islands—some provided
privately, some subsidised, but guaranteeing a service so that people
can go for work, business, pleasure or hospital appointments at a cost
that approximates to that of using an equivalent road distance. In the
case of the Scillies, it would be £20 to £30 return,
compared with the current fare of £84 on the ship and
£160 by air. The islanders get a concession on the ship but not

subsidy it would need, because it fears that the service will be
tendered out. I have written to the Minister responsible, Norman Baker

reflect that there are very few other places, however remote and

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts:</Member></B> My Lords, it is perhaps
inevitable that all defeated Governments engage in a period of
introspection during which there is a tendency to rewrite history. It
appears that the previous Labour Government are no exception to this
rule. The narrative that we have heard this afternoon focuses on two
things: first, that the economic crash of 2008 was the result of
factors entirely outside their control; and secondly, that by May 2010
their actions were bringing economic recovery. I am afraid that neither
of these assertions withstand close examination. It is true, and
absolutely fair, that the trigger for the economic cataclysm of 2008
was the collapse of the sub-prime mortgage market in the United States.
However, the economic policies of the Labour Government left this
country uniquely ill prepared to withstand the consequent shocks.
Profligate government spending without any associated requirements for
economic performance, linked to low interest rates, which inflated
asset prices—particularly house prices—were policies that
could have only one ending, and it was not the promised ending of
“boom and
bust<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:21:17"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0002.htm#13051336000019">Tullett
Prebon, the money broker, has produced an interesting study of debt
levels. Between 1997 and 2010, in constant prices, public debt
increased by 250%, and private debt by 275%. Such levels of
indebtedness, with their associated asset price inflation, will
inevitably take a long time to unwind, and it will be a painful
process. It does not seem wise for the Opposition now to propose, as I
understand they do, that the Government should go out and borrow more
money. I was therefore reassured by the commitment in the gracious
Speech that the Government will stick to their broad strategic economic
approach. In my commercial life outside the House I see some good signs

one area that continues to concern me is the persistence of, and
perhaps increase in, regional disparities, a matter which the right

hard to find many signs of recession in London and, to a greater or
lesser extent, in the south-east. However, in the review of the
Charities Act which I carried out

the rest of my remarks I wish to go off on a riff of my own. It is not
an issue which was raised in the Queen’s Speech, but it is an
important issue, and one which particularly concerns the Treasury and
local government—namely the implications of population growth in
the world and in this country. This is a sensitive issue that is easily
capable of being hijacked, so I make it clear that my remarks are not
about immigration under another name; they are not about relative
population sizes and whether there are more white people or black
people; they are not about the relative sizes of faiths and whether
there are more Christians, Jews or Muslims; they are not about the
relative sizes of social classes and whether there are more rich or
poor people; and, finally and most importantly, they are not about
preaching or personal example, because I need to put on record that I
have four children. My remarks are about the staggering absolute

creating a city the size of Wolverhampton every day, 365 days a year:

on providing family planning and advice. We all know that economic

our overseas aid budget. Of course we must be careful to ensure that
our 
<?notus-xml column=220?>overseas aid is properly spent, but I urge my noble friend, wearing his

I turn to the no less challenging position of the United Kingdom. Our

7 million people look like? The city of Manchester has
500,000 people: think 14 Manchesters. The larger Manchester
conurbation, including Bolton, Bury, Oldham, Rochdale, Salford,
Stockport, Tameside, Trafford and Wigan has a population of just over 2

is a further complication. Not only is England the sixth most densely
populated country in the world, after Bangladesh, Taiwan, South Korea,
Lebanon and Rwanda, but the population is not spread evenly across the
country. The bulk of the population increase will surely take place in
the south-east, where we will probably have to build two of the three
Greater
Manchesters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:27:53"></hs_TimeCode>. It
will certainly be a challenge for future government planning Ministers

can be done? “Stop immigration” is a popular cry. That
would make some difference, but perhaps not as much as people think.
The Migration Observatory at Oxford University has pointed out that
with 100,000 migrants per annum—the Government’s
target—the population would reach 70 million by 2035. With zero
migration the figure would be 66 million, a difference of 4 million. On
the other hand, there are those who say that unless we have more young
people, we cannot afford to look after our existing old people. They
appear to have forgotten the implications of compound interest. We
would be engaging in what Sir David Attenborough calls a gigantic
population Ponzi scheme.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:58:12"></hs_TimeCode> have to
recognise that at some point we will have to achieve a stable, balanced
population in this country. There will be considerable strains during
the transition phase, but at some point, someone, somewhere has to be
brave enough to state this fact and withstand the misinterpretation,
misconstruction, misreporting and misquotation that will surely

it is worthwhile reflecting on how much more serious this problem is
for the UK, and especially for England, than it is for our continental
European neighbours. At present, with a population of 63 million,
England has a population density of 383 people per square kilometre. We
have just overtaken the Netherlands and we are now more densely
populated than that country. By contrast, France has 102
people—about 25% of our density—and Germany 226, which is
about two-thirds. No less importantly, both those countries and Italy
have falling populations. Germany’s population today is 83
million compared to our 63 million but, on present trends,
it will fall to between 70 million and 74 million by mid-century.
Sometime in the 2030s, the UK’s population will overtake
Germany, and we will become the most populous country in

of this is to say that we cannot fit the people in. I have referred to

conclude by addressing why I am raising this topic particularly today,
as some noble Lords may be wondering. The answer is that the issue

No doubt, my noble friend on the Front Bench is thinking that this is
at least one speech to which she does not have to reply when she comes
to stand up—that she can pass gracefully on. That lacuna is part
of the problem. No one anywhere in government has responsibility for
looking at this problem, looking at the big picture and the long-term
trends, and explaining the implications for us all. A Minister with

expense of the principle of social cohesion, Mrs Thatcher subverted the
growing egalitarianism of British society. At the same time, she
protected and reinforced the traditional privileges of the wealthy

gratitude by adopting her own social and economic philosophies. The
economic philosophy in question was a resurrected version of the moral
philosophy of the commercial classes of the 18th century

of the major Acts of privatisation, of which we will be facing the
consequences in this Session of Parliament, concerned the electricity
supply industry. This was enacted in 1990, at the end of
Thatcher’s period as Prime Minister. She must have regarded it
as her crowning achievement. The national electricity grid was one of
the great technical achievements of the interwar period. Its origins
date back to the Electricity (Supply) Act 1926, which created the
Central Electricity Generating Board—CEGB—that set up the

national electricity industry was serviced by some world-famous British
engineering companies, which it also sustained. Foremost of these was
BTH (British Thomson-Houston), later incarnated as AEI (Associated
Electrical Industries) and as GEC (General Electric Company). This
company provided generators, transformers, switchgear and turbines.
Over the years, it absorbed several companies of foreign origin,
including Siemens Brothers and Company, which was an offshoot of the
German company. Another famous company which was sustained by orders
from the CEGB was C A Parsons and Company, famous for the invention of
the steam

ultimate effect of the denationalisation of the electricity industry

owner, the German utility company E.ON. National Power split into a UK
business, which is now owned by the German utility company RWE, and an
international business, which is now fully owned by the French company
GDF Suez. Britain’s nuclear power stations are now in the hands
of EDF Energy, which has 5.7 million customer accounts in the UK. EDF

effect of the denationalisation, which began immediately, was the
crippling of the companies that had served the industry. This was the
consequence of the so-called dash for gas, whereby the newly privatised
electricity-generating companies, many of which were on a small scale,
opted for combined cycle gas turbine generators. The British
engineering companies, which had been crippled by the loss of their
primary market, were unable to compete. The outcome has been that
virtually all the modern equipment in our power stations is of foreign
origin. The major suppliers of this equipment are the Japanese
companies Toshiba and Mitsubishi, the American company Raytheon, the
French company 
<?notus-xml column=223?>Alstom, which absorbed a large part of GEC on the eve of the
privatisation, and the German company Siemens. The strength of these
various companies derives from the fact that they are sustained by the
electricity-generating utilities of their native countries, which, for
the most part, are nationally owned industries. The failure of our
national Governments to support our strategic industries in the way
that has been common in the countries that are our competitors is both
remarkable and hard to explain. However, part of the explanation lies
in the insouciant free-market and laissez faire ideology that was
espoused by the Conservatives during Thatcher’s Administrations

respect in which the policies of Margaret Thatcher have done great
damage to the British economy has been in the promotion of the
interests of the City of London via the programme of deregulation which
began in 1986 during the time of Thatcher’s second
Administration. Here, there is a sharp division of opinion between the
Conservatives and us on these Benches. A week ago, a senior
Conservative politician proposed that we should leave the European
Union for the reason that the Parliament in Brussels seems to be intent
on placing restraints on the activities of the City. He pointed to the
success of the City and its importance to all of us through the fact
that it accounts for a large proportion of the British national
economic product. Far from being an asset that benefits the nation as a
whole, the City serves the interests of a very restricted class of
people at the expense of the rest. The very size of the City is a
symptom of the morbid hypertrophy of an organ of the economy that
threatens the health of the body as a whole. Until recently, the City
has been responsible for sustaining an overvalued rate of exchange that
has made it difficult and sometimes impossible for our industries to
export their products. The City has been largely responsible for the
way in which our industries  have fallen into the hands of
foreign owners. It also bears responsibility for one of the longest
periods of economic recession on record, which we are currently
undergoing. The detrimental effects of the City have been
monstrous.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/C3405B00F5D42F9D428009C0EE0A83E3BF961599" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 May 2013">Monday,

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, nearly six hours into this debate I
thought I would give us a change of subject. I was reliably informed by
the Chief Whip’s Office that if I wanted to talk about the Care
Bill and its implications for local government, I should speak today.
In doing so, I declare my interests both as a member of the Commission
on Funding of Care and Support, whose recommendations the Bill largely
implements, and as a member of the Joint Select Committee that
considered the draft Bill. However, before turning to that Bill I want

of the Youth Justice Board, set up after the 1997 election, I dealt
with some of the consequences of unemployed, untrained and uneducated
young men ending up in the criminal justice system. I am not going to
lay all the blame on the current Government, because youth unemployment
is a global problem. OECD figures suggest that 26 million 15 to 24
year-olds in developed countries are not in employment, education or
training. Our performance in the UK is better than some but it is
certainly not as good as it  
<?notus-xml column=226?>ought to be, with 1 million young people unemployed. Unless we improve
the way that we tackle this problem, we will be storing up trouble not
just for those young people but for ourselves.</hs_para>

policy is preoccupied with the demography of an ageing society. This is
understandable and my noble friend Lord Filkin chaired a committee of
your Lordships’ House which produced an excellent report on our

well trained and educated workforce that is generating
wealth—not a growing number of sullen, unemployed

we grapple with the needs of an ageing society through worthwhile
measures such as the Care Bill, we also must ensure that we set aside
sufficient resources to educate, train and employ our young people, and
not waste their talents. That means striking a better balance than we

the elderly. That may be an unfashionable thing to say but, as one of

sorry but on this I disagree with the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, who is
not in his
place<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:50:54"></hs_TimeCode>. If tough
decision-making is the political mantra of today, why not start by at
least taxing those entitlements or partially withdrawing them, and
removing exemption from national insurance contributions for those who
work after retirement age? Will the Minister comment on those issues in

me turn now to the Care Bill. The coalition Government are to be
congratulated on grasping the nettle of both reforming social care law,
as recommended by the Law Commission, and on accepting the thrust of
the proposals in the Dilnot commission’s report. Here, I pay
tribute to Paul Burstow and Norman Lamb for tenaciously pursuing reform
despite Treasury obstacles. I do not intend today to comment on the

comment on social care funding and the problems that it presents in
implementing the Bill’s good intentions, particularly on some of
the implications of that parlous state of funding for the NHS. Adult
social care is now consuming more and more of local government’s
budgets and is set on a course to consume virtually all of it in a
couple of decades. Yet, strangely, the latest survey from the
Association of Directors of Adult Social Services shows that by next
April local councils will have stripped out £2.7
billion—I repeat, billion, not million—from adult social
care services since 2010. That is equivalent to 20% of their budget for
care at a time when demand for their services is rising considerably.
Domiciliary care is being paid for at below the minimum wage by some
councils and some care homes are relying on subsidies from self-funders
because councils simply are not paying the true cost of providing
decent
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:53:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

£850 million to councils from the NHS this year does no more
than cover the budget reductions that councils are making. One-third of
the directors of ADASS consider that many people who in the past would
have qualified for help will no longer get it as a result of the
existing tightening of eligibility criteria. On present plans, that
rises to half of directors in two years’ time when the Care Bill
will be
implemented<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:53:39"></hs_TimeCode>. The
idea that this Care Bill can be implemented without a significant
increase in the service and administrative budgets for adult social
care is pure fantasy. However, let me emphasise that I am not
suggesting an increase in public expenditure, as I shall
explain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:53:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000060">The
Dilnot commission made clear that its proposals would do nothing to
bring up to speed the existing shortfall in funding of adult social
care. On the most conservative estimate I suggest that the shortfall is
somewhere in excess of £1.2 billion a year. Demography is
worsening these matters by about 3% a year—another half a
billion pounds a year. The consequences of this social care funding
crisis for the NHS are already clear to see in the overcrowded medical
wards of acute hospitals. Experts acknowledge that those wards have
around a quarter to a third of patients who simply should not be there.
The great majority of those people are aged 80 and older. This is both
bad for the patients and extremely costly for the taxpayer. The present
way in which we are caring for elderly patients in some of our
hospitals and care homes is simply another Mid Staffordshire waiting to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:55:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000061">What
we need now is a much clearer policy across the political parties of
resource transfer from the £110 billion a year NHS
budget to fund adult social care properly, where the taxpayers’
money would be better spent. Can the Minister tell the House what
further plans the Government have to transfer resources from the NHS to
social care this year and next to make good the budget shortfall before
implementation of the Care Bill

Lord Lawson, with whom I agree on most things, I am not really

necessary or desirable. I do not think that if ring-fencing had been in

failed. Besides, banks now enjoy greatly improved capital and liquidity
ratios, which I believe is more important. However, ring-fencing is
going to happen. The Government want it, the banks have accepted it,

As my noble friend Lord Forsyth so eloquently argued, our future lies
in developing our global trading relationships with the Commonwealth

Mandarin Chinese as one of the languages that may be offered in primary

economic competitiveness. Although I keenly support the
Government’s economic policy, I would ask my noble friend to
explain what the Treasury means by its statement following the gracious
Speech that there would be a crackdown on tax avoidance and evasion,
with a £4.6 billion package, including a new information

the Government still distinguish between tax avoidance and tax evasion?
Can she explain whether the UK is also a party to the information

the Local Audit and Accountability Bill, which abolishes the Audit

government departments should have the same focus on “Made in

every policy they work with by asking: will this support businesses to
grow and prosper? The UK cannot and indeed should not hide from
international competition. What manufacturing businesses want is a
levelling of the playing field, an understanding of the challenges that
UK manufacturers face, policies to ensure that, wherever possible,
manufacturing is supported in government policy, and for policymakers
to heed the Hippocratic oath—which exists in my other interest,

skilling and re-skilling their valued employees. They realise that
doing this ensures that they have the talent and skilled workforce to

congratulate the Government on continuing and re-emphasising the focus
on skills, in particular apprenticeships. This was started by the
Labour Government, who put several millions of pounds into getting this
off the ground. I was employed for many years in a major chemical
company in the north-west where having apprentices was a way of life
and the whole business was surrounded by young men, very often carrying
the can for tradespeople. Nevertheless, apprenticeships were a way of
life. We are now getting back to what I think is the best of all worlds
by having apprenticeships revived.

According to the UK Commission for Employment and Skills, by 2017 the
percentage of manufacturing jobs that will be in the employers’
“high end”—mostly degree-level
employment —will rise from 27% today to 37%, meaning
that there will be about as many people in high-end occupations in
manufacturing as in low-end occupations. That is aspirational; it is
wonderful; and we should all aim  to support those who want to

recent focus on higher apprenticeships is making a huge difference to
large businesses. As well as recruiting graduates to their management
training programmes to carry forward talent and leadership skills, as
they have in the past, they are focusing on expanding this talent
pipeline by offering existing skilled employees the opportunity to gain
additional leadership and management skills, thereby bringing them
along that same route to senior management and senior supervision
positions. Many businesses doing this say that those employees who have
already served skilled apprenticeships will have the added bonus of
knowing the business from the shop floor to the
boardroom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000086">It
was feared that SMEs would not see that higher apprenticeships were for
them. However, many of them—when supported, for example, by
Semta, the sector skills council for science, engineering,
manufacturing and technology with which I work—are realising
that they add huge value to their business opportunities, particularly
in the supply chains within which they operate. Having people with
skills, vision and leadership gained through the higher apprenticeships
ensures that they stay competitive and, very often, punch above their
weight.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000087">Government
must not let this visionary and sustainable policy be just another
flavour of the month. They should continue to support employers to
recruit more so as to retain the true value of the whole apprenticeship
programme and not allow it to be diluted, leading to the devaluation of
these important levers. Although the increase in the number of
apprenticeships and the money that is brought with it are welcome, I
ask the Minister to reassure us that the quality of apprenticeships is
hugely valued.</hs_para>

to develop a range of higher-level apprenticeships and

I have identified the pressing need for advanced skills in our economy,
the Government need to consider doubling or trebling this level of
support so that the quality of our apprenticeships increases as numbers
rise. Employers need to support that by providing matched funding in
many
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000089">There

Earl of Glasgow:</Member></B> My Lords, it seems that all parties
regard transport as a minor, even expendable, department of government.
In the past three years of this Parliament, we have already had three
Ministers of Transport. The job has become a staging post for Ministers
moving on to what are generally regarded as more important ministerial
roles. As someone who cares a lot about our public transport, I find
this department’s continual relegation to the class of a lesser
ministry quite
depressing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000091">On
the other hand, I have to accept that there is one aspect of the
transport brief that must make it less attractive to ambitious career
politicians: nearly all important transport policies and decisions have
already been made before you take up the job, often—in fact,
usually—by an earlier Government. Any major decision that you
may make in office is likely to come to fruition only long after you
have moved on, and there is little satisfaction when someone else takes
the credit for the hard work that you did 15 years earlier. All the big
planning decisions are made at least 10 years before they are
implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000092">That,
of course, is the situation in the case of HS2. It has been on the
cards for at least five years and now at last we learn that the first
phase of the controversial high-speed rail line from London to
Birmingham is expected to be completed in about 15 years’ time,
with the further extension to Manchester and Leeds seven years beyond
that. Work, however, is not expected to start before 2017, so HS2 and
other long-term projects, such as extra airport runways around London,
can be safely planned only with the aid of a crystal ball. What sort of
world will we be living in 20 years’ time? Will we really need
more airport capacity? Will we be driving electric cars? Will the
threat of global warming finally be taken seriously and carbon
emissions substantially and forcibly reduced? Will we still be in
Europe? When will we be seeing those flying cars that feature in so
many science fiction films
nowadays?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000093">I am
convinced of one thing. Our middle to long-distance journeys within the
United Kingdom will increasingly be taken by train. Apart from anything
else, it is the only civilised and potentially pleasant method of
travelling long distances. Flying is always a hassle and uncomfortable
if you are squashed up to a particularly large man—and
unhealthy, too, if he has 
<?notus-xml column=234?>a streaming cold, as happened to me recently. Driving long distances in
a car is always stressful. Cars should be used primarily for shopping
at your local market town, visiting neighbours and driving to the
station to catch a train. Incidentally, we need more safe parking at
our suburban and country
stations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000094">I
believe that the train is the only long-term answer to our national
transport problems and will continue to be so for at least the next 30
years. I am therefore very supportive of the HS2 plans announced in the
Queen’s Speech. I would like the Minister’s assurance
that the Government will not be diverted by a number of powerful
anti-HS2 bodies who believe that they can persuade them to change their
mind. Its opponents are against it on the grounds of cost, that the
money would be better spent elsewhere, that the Government have got
their projections and figures wrong, that it is not a good use of
taxpayers’ money and that it will pollute the English
countryside, particularly the Chilterns. I believe, however, that HS2
is a crucial element in Britain’s overall policy for improving
our railway network and should, if anything, go ahead with more urgency
and, if necessary, at even greater expense to ensure that it achieves
the objectives to which it
aspires.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000095">One
of the objectors’ arguments is that the money could be spent on
improving the existing rail network, but I am under the impression that
the existing network is to be upgraded at the same time. I would like
the Minister’s assurance that that is indeed the case and that
it is not an either/or option. After all, one of the justifications for
high-speed rail is that it will free up capacity for the existing
network and enable other lines to operate more
efficiently.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000096">Beside
the country’s overall need for a faster and more efficient train
service, another of HS2’s purposes is to bring London and the
south-east closer to the north and the Midlands. It has been calculated
that if London and the Home Counties formed a separate country, it
would be by far the most prosperous in Europe, but when included within
the rest of the United Kingdom we stand only about half way in the
pecking order. Surely anything that helps to widen Britain’s
areas of prosperity can only be a good thing, although it will be up to
the Government to ensure that the new rail line is used more to
encourage southerners and southern companies to go north, rather than
seducing more northerners to come down south to London. The
BBC’s move to Salford shows that major relocations can and do
work.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051336000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000097">The
argument that high-speed rail will ruin beautiful countryside seems
completely fatuous. If you live nearer than a quarter of a mile from a
proposed route, you may well have reason to object, but I understand
that those adversely affected will be amply compensated—and so
they should be. Who nowadays objects to any of our existing railways
passing through areas of outstanding natural beauty? In some cases, the
railway actually enhances the countryside. No one has ever made a
convincing case that wildlife has been more than temporarily disturbed
by new railway lines. A railway is not like a motorway, particularly a
motorway interchange or, worse still, an extended runway to  an
existing airport, which really can have an adverse effect on the
surroundings and everyone living near it.</hs_para>

then goes on to list what it considers to be the project’s
flaws. My fear is that compromise and elements of cold feet may
infiltrate the Government’s future thinking. In the present
plans, the project is to be completed in two main phases, followed
rather vaguely by a contemplated further phase. However, these
contemplated further phases are essential to the success of the whole
project. For instance, there surely must be a direct connection to
Heathrow Airport, and from there to Gatwick Airport. However, this is
not intended in either of the first two phases. There must surely be a
direct connection with High Speed 1 so that passengers from Manchester
or Leeds can go straight through to Paris without having to change in
London, yet this, too, is not included in the first two phases. HS2
needs to go north at least as far as Preston in order to make the time
saving significant enough for passengers travelling to and from
Scotland, ultimately making internal flights in the United Kingdom
unnecessary. In the present two-phase plan, only three-quarters of an
hour will be knocked off the journey time from Glasgow to London, which
is not enough to deter many of us from taking the
plane.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13051336000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000099">Phase
1 takes us only as far as Birmingham. If for any reason the line were
to stop there, I would agree with the objectors that the whole thing
had been a disgraceful waste of government money. When in phase 2 it
reaches Manchester and Leeds, the project begins to make sense, but the
real benefits come only when the distance travelled is considerably
longer and when these other essential connections are made. The
Government must therefore commit to phase 3 before even starting on
phase 1. Delay the start if the financial situation demands it but,
once started, all three phases must go ahead as quickly as possible,
one after the other. The project cannot afford long gaps between
phases, when the fares will be high and the benefits strictly
limited.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051336000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000100">The
Government, supported by all three parties, are taking an expensive
gamble on High Speed 2, a gamble that in my view will pay off
handsomely in the end. However, the Government must be bold and buy
wholeheartedly into the whole package, not progress slowly in small,
hesitant steps. I would like the Minister’s assurance that this
is indeed the Government’s intention and that they recognise the
danger of progressing too
slowly.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/2003DD007664ED72FC82745BE847B331F9368F72" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 May 2013">Monday,

Patten:</Member></B> My Lords, I warmly congratulate my noble friend
Lord Glasgow on what he has just said about high-speed rail, and not
only on what he said but on the way that he said it, which was lucid
and clear, so unlike many speeches that the political classes tend to
unleash on the innocent electorate. They say all that stuff about how
we are about to be nudged by the nudge unit, the need for a national
conversation—what is a national conversation?—about this,
that or the other and the need for us all to go out into the street 
<?notus-xml column=236?>and celebrate something as stakeholders, probably slipping into a
paradigm shift as we do so. I greatly regret the way in which the
political classes tend to address themselves and not the electorate,
thus widening the gap between the two. The next thing that we will be
told is that we need a political narrative about HS2. What is a
political narrative? I cannot tell the difference between a political
narrative and the back end of a number 11

respectfully, but in the gracious Speech we have another prime example

realities of the economic situation that we are in. I am a strong

pleased to hear that. There may not be all that many of us left, but
those of us who are mostly think that the naysayers to our policy can
“IMF off”.</hs_para>

will accept what is being done to achieve this deficit reduction if it
is explained in an open and transparent way, so we should explain to
our electorate that the UK’s debt, just as in the aftermath of
World War 2, has ballooned to a level that will never be paid off by
economic growth alone, probably in our lifetimes. Therefore, not
wanting, at one extreme, to default our way out of the debt problems
that face us or, at the other end, to impose impossible levels of
austerity, what we are doing is very sensible. It is reducing the real
value of debt by keeping interest rates below inflation. After 1945,
this policy of negative real interest rates, sustained for many
years—indeed into the 1970s—was a bipartisan and very
effective approach to reducing the debt pile, with savers then as
savers now being asked slowly to absorb the pain. They were a captive
audience buying government debt at below market interest rates. That is
certainly happening today with inflation fast approaching 3%.</hs_para>

of a more or less flatlining economy likely to obtain for some
while—a long period of low growth—there is nowhere else
for us to go. The banks already know, with greater regulation, which I
again support, concerning demands on them to hold more capital, that
the Government know that there is a set of captive buyers for their
debt out there. I am not quite so sure that the rank and file of retail
savers have woken up to the fact that government policy is indeed to
erode the real value of their capital in order to reduce the
country’s debt. This is a highly inconvenient truth, but truth
it is, and both parties have conspired to cover up that truth in
earlier years. It is better explained than not, better understood than
glossed over. We should be honest.</hs_para>

those who want to persecute entirely innocent baby boomers for having
had it too good over the years and force them to make recompense by
passing some of their wealth down to generations X and Y. We should
recognise that this blameless group is already doing quite a lot of
that by taking part in the process that I have just outlined. Also,
from January 2014, we will see more such transfers between the
generations as the help to buy scheme, following the new buy scheme and
then the fresh buy scheme, begins to be rolled out, paid for in part by
savers and taxpayers, many of them in the baby boomer
generation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000108">My
second point is that, needless to say, I hope, I support anything that
will enable more people to buy their own homes in a proper and orderly
way. I also support anything that helps the building industry because
it employs people and gets more jobs created more quickly. I also
support anything that enhances the environment. However, there are
three risks involved. First, there is the risk that under the new
scheme, from some date in January 2014 onwards, people who should not
be borrowing money may be brought into borrowing it and, as in the
run-up to 2007, we may have a higher risk of people taking on debts
that they should not be taking on. At no point in the excellent speech
by my noble friend Lord Deighton that introduced this debate did I hear
any assessment of the risk of this or, indeed, of the parallel risk
that the scheme may incite house price inflation again in a way that we
have not seen in recent years.</hs_para>

friend was an investment banker in the old days. Doubtless he was
pretty used to assessing risk and to mitigating it. I do not know
whether he took a few risks as a young banker, but I do not wish to
take risks with taxpayers’ funds that may leave more people in
debt who should not be in debt and lead to house price inflation coming
back again. If my noble friend Lady Hanham, who always speaks very
clearly and never uses jargon, any more than my noble friend Lord
Glasgow does, is tempted to say in her wind-up speech—if she
chooses to address the point that I am making—that there is no
risk at all in those schemes, I promise her I shall not barrack from my
spot high up on the Back Benches by shouting “Bunkum!”,
but I shall certainly be thinking it very fiercely. It is terribly
important that we stress that risks are being introduced in this new
housing policy.</hs_para>

course, is that it will lead to more rapid development on greenfield

on brownfield sites, but I support it because it is necessary and the

disturbing stories about the landscape effect and the quality of new
buildings on greenfield sites being rolled out by housebuilding
companies. I therefore took an interest this weekend and went to look
at a housing scheme being run by Bovis Homes, a publicly listed
company, on the edge of Wincanton,  a small market town in the
boondocks of Somerset. I found what I saw there disturbing. Much of the
pre-existing landscaping that had been demanded by the local Liberal
Democrat-controlled council had been eaten into, tree shelterbelts
interfered with and taken 
<?notus-xml column=238?>into part of the development sites, and hedges planted by Messrs Bovis
now ripped up and replaced by metal- grilled fencing, giving a
terrible look to the development itself. It is just the kind of thing
that discourages those who might be tempted to support, as I do, the
building of high-quality houses on greenfield sites and gives it a bad

were not so sad it would be funny also to be told that in one or two of
the new houses, which have been on sale only for about six months,
there are the sort of issues that none of us who wish to promote the
welfare of the housebuilding industry wish to see. One poor lady
putting her three-pin plug into a socket in the wall found that it
would not power up her appliances, so she asked an electrician to come;
I have checked these facts, and they are facts. When the electrician
came, he—for it was a male electrician—found that there
was indeed no electrical supply of any sort running up the walls to the
sockets. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:37:23"></hs_TimeCode>
noble friend Lady Hanham needs to do all she can to encourage local

turn to infrastructure. Just as bad housing developments can be a blot
on the landscape, as my noble friend Lord Glasgow said, we undoubtedly
face blots on the landscape from the development of HS2. There is no
point in messing about and saying that they are not there. We should be
absolutely honest and say that HS2 will be damaging to some parts of
the environment, at least for a while, through noise and the
destruction of landscape and views. It is therefore absolutely right
that we must persuade people to accept HS2 in its various
manifestations as something that we will be prepared to pay large sums
of compensation for in order to make it bearable for people who live
nearby. I hope that we will say transparently that we recognise the
environmental risk and intend to do something about it, including,
maybe, the introduction of environmental offsets of one sort or
another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:38:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

transparency is also vital for those who wish to come alongside the

from abroad, which I entirely support. Only last week, we had one of
the big Canadian pension funds, the Ontario teachers’ pension
fund, saying that it felt that too many schemes were seeking public
funding from entities like it, and that it was important that we
reduced the number of schemes and concentrated on those that were
deliverable—and, as my noble friend Lord Glasgow said, get going
on it very
quickly.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/3FE577944F93F13F8ABA73820113C9EFDECFF900" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 13 May 2013">Monday,

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, some have said that this Queen’s
Speech is too thin. I do not have a problem with that. Frankly, it is
an issue of quality rather than width. If the legislation proposed was
going to do something about the economy and improve our economic and
societal prospects, I would welcome it, however thin it was and however
many Bills were involved. As it is, I welcome some of what is there,
and welcome the 
<?notus-xml column=239?>opportunity to debate the rest. I am very glad that we are about to
debate the Energy Bill and the water Bill; both will probably be
discussed more tomorrow, but both are vital for issues of living
standards and cost of living, and for our investment programme. The
Energy Bill seems deeply flawed, and I am sure that we will have some
serious debates on that. I agree with what is in the water Bill,
broadly speaking, but there are great gaps in it—in particular
any reform of the abstraction sector, which will be vital for the
economic and environmental future of that
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:45:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:40:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000116">I
am glad, although it was not mentioned in the gracious Speech, that we
will also get banking reform back before the House. However, I am
pretty dubious about the present proposal’s ability to reform a
sector which both caused the financial crisis by its recklessness and
which is failing and holding back the recovery by its caution. It is a
sector in this country which, despite the dramatic changes since 2007,
has somehow retained, broadly speaking, the same structure. Some
institutions are under different ownership, including state ownership
but, basically, we have not tackled the problem of the structure of the
banking sector in particular.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:41:23"></hs_TimeCode> was hoping
that we would see a more decentralised and more segregated banking
system, both horizontally and vertically, and an absence of

legislation of the last Government, but unfortunately it was lost
during the wash-up when it was objected to by the then Opposition.
Collective redress would have avoided a lot of the hassle which
consumers face, for example with PPI, where they are exploited first by
financial institutions and then by claims companies. To have a proper
system of collective redress for consumers would be a major step
forward, and I hope that the Government have that in their

after cutting back even on the rather inadequate programme they
inherited from the previous Government, have finally realised this, and
they are providing some significant support for the purchase of
housing. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said, that is not
enough. In default of increasing the supply of housing—in other
words, acting on the provision and capital side as well as supporting
potential buyers and landlords—the net effect of underwriting
and providing mortgages under Help to Buy and other schemes will be to
raise house prices and increase housing costs, aggravating rather than
resolving the problems of dysfunctional housing markets. Help on the
capital side for building houses, by raising the limit on borrowing for
local authorities and housing associations, by joint ventures and by
supporting the private sector in housebuilding, is one way

in housing ought to be accompanied by investment in infrastructure. The

Government who are in danger of believing their own propaganda. The
financial crisis was started by private debt in America and in Europe.
It was compounded by the failure of the banks, and compounded further
by the fact that Governments throughout Europe and North America

UK was more impacted than others because we are more dependent than
other countries on the financial sector. The long-run record of the
Labour Government was that before 2007-08 we had a debt-to-GDP ratio
that was roughly the average of the OECD countries. It got worse
because of our dependence on the financial sector. That is something
that this Government have to pick up. However, they should not try to
do so by imposing a form of austerity on the whole of the country in a
way that minimises our chances of getting out of the recession. In
particular, they should not focus on the social security budget and
misrepresent the way in which it has increased over recent years. The
vast majority of that, of course, has been because of the increase in
the part of the population of pensionable age. The other two elements
include the increase in housing benefit, which has got seriously out of
control. But that is due to a failure of the housing market, not of
social security policies, and housing benefit should not be included
within the universal credit system until we have resolved the problems
of the housing market in a way that does not lead to huge increases in
housing benefit for those dependent on ever-decreasing opportunities

position in the international markets—he talked about our
credibility—whether the most vivid example of where we stand in
the eyes of would-be speculators against sterling is not the fact that
the rate at which we have to pay on our admittedly massive
international debt is little if any more than the Germans pay. Had we
not adopted a programme of some austerity, the cost of our borrowing
would have been enormously

Whitty:</Member></B> No, my Lords, I do not accept that. I accept the
first part of what the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, says, but not the
second. The ability to borrow in international markets, as with
borrowing in almost any context, depends on a number of things. It
depends 
<?notus-xml column=242?>on your ability to have a low rate of interest and low cost of
borrowing; a reasonable term of borrowing; and an ability to service
that borrowing and to repay the borrowing. On all those counts,
throughout the desperate period of 2007 to 2011, the UK retained
credibility and could borrow at relatively low rates over relatively
long periods. The final qualification is that the markets have to be
confident that the Government can raise enough money to repay those
debts over the medium to long term. What has lost credibility in this
Government is the slow growth and flat-lining of the economy, as well
as the downturn of financial income for the Government as a direct
result of that economic failure, which has reduced the markets’
confidence in the ability of the UK to repay loans. That is why the
credit rating has gone. It was not Gordon Brown who lost the credit
rating—it is actually George Osborne and his failure to get
economic growth within this country. Unless the Government recognise
that and start changing course by investing in infrastructure and
housing and getting us out of this economic recession, they will be
going down the wrong road. I think that they have already gone too far
down that road, but there is still time even for this

Flight:</Member></B> My Lords, as the noble Lord, Lord Deighton,
pointed out, there are some useful, detailed provisions in the gracious
Speech for the economy, but it seems to me that there is really nothing
of great substance. The national insurance allowance is welcome for
small businesses. The help to buy scheme is extremely unwise in that it
applies to existing property and not just to new builds and is in
danger of feeding yet another housing bubble. It is perhaps inevitable,
with two years before an election and with a coalition Government, that
this is not a time for radical change. However, both the Labour Party
and the IMF are by mistake or wantonly misreading the situation. The
reality is that this Government are still running a deficit of
£120 billion and they have financed most of the spending of
£380 billion by printing money. They could not be much more
Keynesian than that, in truth, whatever may be being said. In my book,
we are erring on the rather incautious side in that territory and
telling a slightly different story from the underlying
reality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:54:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:54:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:53:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000130">I
repeat that it is a question of what is politically practical at this
stage of the cycle but, in principle at least, I would like to see
radical supply side measures. Taxes are still too high, the state is
too large, the incentives to work, invest and save are too low,
regulations are too burdensome and increasing and the lack of planning
reform is still the key delay to new housebuilding. The energy reforms
will do nothing to reduce prices. Energy policy needs radical change to
encourage fracking, given what is happening to the US economy as a
result of that. There is plenty of potential here in that regard. We
have a crackpot policy of massively subsidising unreliable and
expensive wind power, which will result in ridiculously high tariffs
for manufacturing industry and impoverish consumers. I am greatly
disappointed that the Government have not yet got round to reviewing
what is clearly a mistaken policy. The childcare scheme 
<?notus-xml column=243?>discriminates unjustly against single-earner families. Although I am
absolutely convinced that the noble Lord, Lord Deighton, is doing his
best, infrastructure investment needs to be released to a far greater
extent than is the case. It is still hugely delayed by planning and
environmental red tape. It is pathetic to continue to put off a
decision on the airports serving London, which is clearly a very
pressing decision relevant to overseas investment in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000131">However,
my particular concerns are what I call “kicking the can down the
road” measures, things being done today which do not attract
much opposition from the Opposition or the media but will be the source
of major cost in the future. It seems to me that care for the elderly
will saddle the taxpayer with huge future liabilities, is a regressive
extension of the welfare state and does not really solve the
fundamental problems. Shifting the burden of identifying illegal
immigrants onto landlords just adds to their costs and is unlikely to
be successful. We have spent time in this House debating the Public
Service Pensions Bill. Nobody seems to be concerned that by 2017 there
will be an annual cash flow deficit of somewhere between
£20 billion and £25 billion per annum. I
question whether the government of the day will be able to afford

House of Lords Library recently presented a most interesting report
which forecasts that the proportion of students who do not repay their
student loans will rise from 28% to 40%. Forty per cent of a total of
£80 billion is £32 billion to write off on the student
loan book. There are two problems here. One is that a lot of students
simply do not earn enough because their degrees have no commercial
value. A second category of students either go overseas or return to
Europe and do not repay their loans. The whole machinery needs to be
tightened up. I have been told by students in Europe that they would be
happy to repay their loans but do not how to do so because it involves
getting a standing order from a bank account in Europe, which is in
euros, translated into a sterling order over here and finding a
representative bank to pay it. However, behind that there is a much
more serious problem of the establishment still not attaching
sufficient value to vocational training. The figures show that people
doing proper vocational training get jobs more easily and earn more
than those doing a lot of liberal arts degrees. Their debts are much
lower because it takes much less time to complete vocational training.
The truth is that the policy of trying to send 50% of the population to
university, and then saddling them with massive debt, is wholly
mistaken. What we need in this country is much more vocational training
and for it to have the status it deserves given its economic
value.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:59:18"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13051336000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#13051336000133">I
now want to switch to a much more positive angle because it seems to me
that few people realise that the UK economy is recovering extremely
well. That is not just according to the latest figures, which I will
come on to. What is happening is that the impact of the depreciation of
sterling is finally working its way through. The second quarter showed
0.8% growth, strong factory output and particularly strong advertising
spend, which is always a pretty reliable precursor to wider economic
recovery. The true picture in relation to what has been happening for
the past four years has 
<?notus-xml column=244?>also emerged. There has been a major reduction in North Sea oil
production, and if you take that out of the equation the private sector
has been growing by an average of 1.3% annually—more than 5%,
which I said was the case when we debated the budget. That is where all
the new jobs have come from. In comparison to much of continental
Europe, the UK economy, as a matter of fact, has been doing
surprisingly well. That is extremely good news and is not adequately
recognised. In that context, it would be mistaken for government policy
to overegg what is already happening of its own

picking up on the odd comment on the eurozone. In the 1930s it was the
gold standard and reparations which caused chronic unemployment,
particularly in Germany, and which, bluntly, let directly to the rise
of Hitler. It is horrific that people are standing by and seeing some
50% youth unemployment in Spain and some 30% youth unemployment in
Italy. This risks causing dangerous political reactions. It is a
crackpot policy, all in the name of keeping the euro together. It is
absolutely clear that the characteristics of southern and northern
Europe mean that they cannot comfortably share a currency. The reality
of that needs to be addressed. The German policy of getting
away with doing as little as possible and temporarily financing it
through the ECB ignores completely the political risks that are staring
us in the face. The fact that Germany of all countries, having lived

conscious that the Minister who will reply to this debate was, like me,

The world would really have changed if that had been accompanied by a

prolonged period of silence on matters that should properly be the sole
concern of local authorities and their electors in a true spirit of
localism. But that is fantasy world and it will not happen. The
Government will continue to legislate and regulate because that is what
they do, and some Ministers inevitably will continue to make

of even greater significance to local government will be the spending

The challenge has been implementing 33% budget cuts in only two years.
The fact that they were front-loaded in the four-year review was a very
unwelcome and unexpected surprise. Some Ministers, although never the
noble Baroness who will reply shortly, have sometimes given the
impression that that was easy—that all that was needed was to
get rid of a few chief executives, cut the pay of the rest, share a few
services and the job would be done. At the other extreme, local
government representatives gave the impression that the world was going

be achieved just by reducing back-office costs and a few more salami

services and the expectations of local residents of what they should
receive from their local authorities—a real behavioural change.
Behavioural change and transforming services and the way in which they
are delivered takes time and needs a climate that encourages creativity

community budgets. Whether those estimates are accurate we will know
only if and when we do it. However, even if they are only half-accurate

done not by reducing services but by targeting those services more

Lord Deighton, for introducing the debate on the humble Address and for
making a fair fist of it, despite the relatively sparse material he had
to work with. I am sure that he will not mind my saying that he had to
rely on more than a few previously announced policies—housing,
infrastructure, training and planning come to mind. Of course, there is
always a case for limiting the amount of legislation, provided, as my
noble friend Lord Whitty said, it is of high enough quality. However,
the problem he had and that the Government have in general is in
matching their rhetoric to the reality of their programme. You cannot
trumpet your wish to focus on building a stronger economy if all you do
is bring forward a programme that fails to deliver the growth and jobs
required while attacking people’s rights and economic security

we had better get used to it. It is invidious to single out
contributions, but I hope that when the Minister responds she will pick
up some or all of the interesting points made by the noble Lord, Lord
Forsyth, on the Scottish dimensions to many of our debates and the
Barnett consequences of that, which are very important. UK productivity
problems were raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Wheatcroft, who also

Bill. That was picked up initially by my noble friend Lady Hayter, and
then by my noble friends Lord Whitty and Lady Crawley. Mention was made
of the needs of small and medium-sized companies, particularly small
companies that want to grow. My noble friend Lord Mitchell, late of
Soho, picked up points that are worth taking forward. We had a
reference to higher education by my noble friend Lady Warwick. I
endorse that; it has been far too long since a major statement on
higher education has been made and we have not had a chance in this

that a number of issues have been raised all around the Chamber about

would have thought that an aspiration on that scale would have presaged
Bills that created the conditions for businesses to grow and for wealth
to be created, to enhance productivity and to propose a restructuring
of our economy, ensuring diversification towards those sectors that
would contribute to GDP in the future. Instead, what do we have? In
finance, we have the carryover banking Bill and the welcome but very
modest national insurance Bill. In business, we have a modest set of
amendments to the intellectual property regime; a promise of more
regulatory reform, but led from the Cabinet Office; and a welcome but
very limited consumer Bill that plays around with structures and
responsibilities but does not introduce the sort of regime that will
protect hard-pressed consumers and empower them as drivers in making
markets work effectively for them and for producers, thus helping to
provide the foundation for UK businesses to succeed here and in other
markets abroad. Surely what we needed to make this speech’s
laudable aspiration a reality was a set of Bills that would establish a
modern industrial strategy—an agenda where the role of
Government is not to step back but to work with business to create
better outcomes at home and to ensure that we can pay our way in the
world, to ensure that growth is more broadly based across sectors and
the regions, and to reduce imports and to grow exports. So, to add to
the list of gaps identified by other noble Lords, I want to mention
four areas where there are still points to be picked up, and to which
we will return as we move forward through the programme.</hs_parafo>

Eatwell said, we must reform our banking sector, not only so that banks

to February according to the latest Bank of England figures. We know
that the rash of government schemes, from Project Merlin to the
national loan guarantee scheme, and now the Funding for Lending scheme
too, have simply failed to get credit to the businesses that need them.
The problems are exacerbated in the regions and nations of this
country. Every other country in the G8 has a state-backed investment
institution to tackle this problem and to ensure that their small
businesses can access the finance they need. That is why we have been
arguing for the establishment of a proper British investment bank and
for the creation of a network of regional banks, perhaps, following on
from my noble friend Lord McFall, using

dropped by 12%. We urgently need to improve a situation in which
two-thirds of large companies in this country do not offer

only direct mention of infrastructure in the gracious Speech is the two
HS2 Bills. I declare an interest, as the current route for HS2 goes

Lord Glasgow, close enough to qualify for compensation, although I have
my hopes. I have made clear before that I support my party’s
approach to the scheme although, like the noble Viscount, Lord
Trenchard, and, I think, the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow, we do not yet
understand the rationale for the introduction of a paving Bill before
decisions have been made on our airports, for example. We have made
clear that we will look to ensure that HS2 is fully integrated into the
existing rail network, with services running directly to a wide range
of towns and cities in addition to those already placed on the new
line, which amount to a very small number; affordable to use, rather
than a premium-priced service aimed at business passengers; not at the
expense of investment in the existing network, including the rolling
programme of electrification, upgrades and new rolling stock; and
required to generate at least 1,000 apprenticeship opportunities for
every £1 billion of public

surely we need to look beyond HS2 and its 30-year payback. As the noble
Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, we need jobs now. With our economy
flatlining, the country is crying out for investment in infrastructure
to create jobs, boost confidence and strengthen our productivity and
competitiveness, particularly in the regions. Both the CBI and the EEF
criticised the Government for their failure to get on and deliver on
infrastructure. The last infrastructure pipeline update given by the
Government shows that of their 576 projects, less than 5% were
completed or operational. Why was there not more in the Queen’s
Speech to take that forward? Where are the practical measures on
housebuilding, which would kick start the economy with jobs in the
construction industry while providing much needed
homes?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305141000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-0003.htm#1305141000036">Finally, what on earth is

of our lives today—from business to leisure and accessing public
services. Everyone should be  able to access a decent level of
communication, including phone and
internet. Our content and broadcast 
<?notus-xml column=252?>industries need copyright protection and certainty. The communications
sector was worth £50 billion, employing 530,000 people, in 2011,
and of course it supports the wider economy. The internet contributed
8.3%, or £121 billion, of the British economy in 2010—a
bigger share than in any other G20 major country, and is predicted to
grow at 11% a year over the next five years. In her excellent maiden
speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Lane-Fox, argued that the Government
should develop a strategy and a programme that would  get as
many people online as possible. We agree. A communications Bill is
desperately needed, focused on helping people to get broadband in rural
areas, a point picked up by the noble Baroness, Lady Byford; helping
people improve their digital skills through training and education for
both business and personal reasons, as more public services will be
delivered online; ensuring that those who do not have a computer or
broadband at home can access those facilities from a public library;

However, we must ensure that taxpayers get value for money and we

some lack of confidence that I say I will be able to respond to all the
points that were made. I will do my best. It may require me gabbling a
bit but I will provide as many responses as I can. This has been an
important and good debate. I always enjoy the Queen’s Speech

previous Baroness Lane-Fox very well and respected her very much as a
great supporter of the disabled. She was one of the first people to
really put the needs of disabled people on the map, of course being

on the other side that this deficit was not of our making. We inherited
it after 13 years and now to suggest that we should borrow our way out

currently engaged with departments to identify more savings from their

have unwelcome legislative consequences for the UK, particularly as

previously agreed EU Council conclusions on legislation on penalties
and because of the obvious threat to the exercise of judicial

becoming available to more and more people—removing estimated

from the end of this year, when a customer switches from a supplier who
has provided them with a compliant smart meter, the new supplier cannot
replace that smart meter with a dumb meter and must either rent the
previous supplier’s meter or install their own new smart meter.
This will give greater confidence to early movers over their
investments. We are also proposing for consultation that, when a
customer with a compliant smart meter switches supplier, the new
supplier must continue to provide remote meter readings. This would
make sure that customers continue to receive one of the important
benefits of smart metering: more accurate bills. These and related
proposals are set out in today’s Government response to the
consultation on the foundation smart market. Industry has told us that
they expect to roll out in excess of 2 million compliant smart meters
to customers over the next two years of the foundation stage of the
smart metering rollout and today’s proposals will give them even

of the procurement process, DECC has therefore tested with bidders for
DCC communication and data service provider contracts, and with the
energy industry, the time needed for the design, build and test phases
of their programmes. The consistent message was that more time was
needed if the mass 
<?notus-xml column=20?>rollout was to get off to the best possible start and ensure a quality
experience for consumers. We therefore now expect suppliers to be ready
to start their full scale rollout by autumn 2015, supported by the DCC

rollout will be an enormous logistical and technical challenge for the
industry, involving visits to around 30 million homes and small
businesses and installing over 50 million meters. To this end, and
reflecting the extended period to build and test the systems required
by industry, the Government have decided to move the completion date
for the mass rollout from end 2019 to end 2020—although I expect
the vast majority of smart meters to be in place against the original
2019 deadline. Getting this right for consumers is the
Government’s priority and this package of proposals will give

£160 million to bring empty homes back into use. £100
million of this funding is being paid directly to

Sixty million pounds is being allocated to 20 partnerships which suffer
from significant clusters of empty homes which have good market 
<?notus-xml column=22?>prospects but require an intensive approach to return them to a liveable
standard. This will produce a further 3,600 homes, resulting in a

second bidding round to bring up to a further 5,000 empty homes back

funding will take our overall target to over 15,000 empty properties
being brought back into use as housing by March
2015;</hs_WAIndent><hs_WAIndent>we are further
supporting local authorities to take a lead. Under the new homes bonus,
local authorities now earn a financial reward for bringing a long-term

large-scale voluntary transfers, the Government have made gap funding
grants to private registered providers to enable stock to be brought up

expected that gap funding outside London will contribute to making
43,500 homes decent between 2011 and 2015 (we do not have comparable

Government introduced the Mesothelioma Bill. The Bill provides for the
introduction of a diffuse mesothelioma payment scheme to make payments
to people with diffuse mesothelioma who were exposed to asbestos either
negligently or in breach of statutory duty by their employer in the
United Kingdom and who are unable to bring a claim for damages against
a relevant employer or that employer’s employers’
liability (“EL”) insurer. In addition to the proposed
payment scheme the Bill provides for a technical committee to be
established, which will make binding decisions in disputes between an
EL insurer and a person with diffuse mesothelioma about whether the
insurer was providing EL cover to a particular employer at the time the
person with diffuse mesothelioma was negligently exposed to
asbestos.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051311000320" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130513-wms0001.htm#13051311000320">This
Bill meets the commitment made in our response to the previous

addition to the proposed payment scheme and technical committee the
consultation response detailed proposals to compel membership of the
Employer Liability Tracing Office (ELTO). We have looked at this
proposal closely and have concluded that, while
this is not possible, we can still achieve the desired outcome of
helping more people to successfully trace an insurer against whom to
bring a claim.</hs_para>

Authority is considering requirements around the tracing of EL
insurance policies that will mirror those that are operated by
ELTO which should result in more evidence of cover being
passed to people with mesothelioma. The Government consider that these

is vital that the pension savings of individuals who are automatically

consultancy charges in automatic enrolment schemes. This will apply to
both occupational and personal pension schemes and I intend to lay
regulations before Parliament as soon as possible. Furthermore, in

plan to publish a consultation this autumn. This will set out proposals
