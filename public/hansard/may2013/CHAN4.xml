joined-up care. The truth is that Labour’s disastrous IT

also a care scandal. Last year, 42 people died because they received
the wrong medicines. There were more than 20,000 medication errors that
caused harm to patients, and 127,000 near misses. On top of that,
structures such as payment by results were left unreformed for more
than 13 years, making hospitals focus on the volume of treatment over
and above the needs of individual patients. The Care Bill will help to
address those issues by promoting integrated care. It creates a duty on
local authorities and their partners to co-operate on the planning and
delivery of care; it emphasises the importance of prevention and the
reduction of people’s care needs; and, by making personal

help, to £118,000—much higher than it is

face value, the social care measures that the coalition is proposing

Commission’s review of adult social care legislation, which was

published before the last election. National standards for eligibility
could help to bring consistency to the care system, and stronger legal
rights for carers are long overdue, as is improved access to

social care is the predominant driver of what we are now seeing in our

withdrawn, or if they cannot afford to pay for them, they are more
likely to struggle and fall ill at home and to end up in hospital. That
is bad for them, and it costs the NHS more. Also, NHS staff are finding
that people who are ready to leave hospital cannot be discharged
because the necessary support cannot be put in place. Beds are not
being freed up on the wards, and A and E therefore cannot admit people
to the wards because there is no space. A and E then becomes full,

They think they can stand there and say whatever they like, and they
think they can get away with it, but they cannot, because people have
seen through them. They have cut the NHS; they have broken the central
promise on which this Government came to office. Now they are saying
that the pressure on A and E has nothing to do with social care funding

All over the country, we hear that A and E is under intense pressure.

downgraded a successful A and E in Lewisham to deal with problems in
another trust—that simply will not do. A and E units in west
London, for example, are being closed one after another. That is not
good enough, and neither is it good enough in Greater Manchester, where
huge changes are planned. These changes must be clinically driven, not

waste money on consultants and all the other things that come from

pushed through. This reorganisation and the budget cuts I mentioned a

running, the NHS in England has missed the Government’s own
lowered A and E target for major units. It really is time that the

exclusively about the current destruction of NHS Direct, a successful,
safe and popular service, and its replacement by 111—I hesitate
to call it a service— that has proved to be a shambles in many
parts of the country. I must declare an interest—a sort of
proprietorial one—because I was Health Secretary when we decided
to set up NHS Direct in 1998. We set it up in a sensible way, and it
worked from the start. We established three pilot schemes. The service
was gradually rolled out across the country, learning all the time from
the experiences of the earlier services that were already working. It
worked well from the start, and there is no excuse for Ministers in
this Government who have introduced the 111 service as a mess. They
have been calling summits and announcing reviews ever since it started
going wrong. That is pathetic, because they are not in the Department
of summits and reviews; they are in the Department of Health.</hs_Para>

Ministers were not even doing anything new. They had the opportunity to
build on NHS Direct, which was a successful example. In 2002, it was
described as a remarkably successful service by the Public Accounts
Committee, then chaired by the hon. Member for Gainsborough (Mr Leigh),
and of which the current Chancellor of the Exchequer was a very active
member. Reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the PAC
commended the service, saying it had met all its deadlines and properly
addressed all the risks, and that it had a practical approach and had
learned lessons as it went along. It was also commended for the fact
that its computer procurement had been well managed and had been
delivered to cost, and that there had been satisfactory consultation
and it was clinically safe.</hs_Para>

praised, too, for reducing demand on other parts of the NHS. The main
reason it was reducing demand was because it was predominantly staffed
by nurses, who had the professional confidence and judgment simply to
offer reassurance to some who got in touch. In the current service,
however, there are many call handlers, who do not have that
professional knowledge and confidence, and are therefore referring
people to GP services or A and E and are arranging
ambulances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051315000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0001.htm#13051315000169">I

NHS Direct was operating at. The only way it could reduce costs was by
getting rid of nurses, because they are more expensive than call
handlers. Indeed, GP representatives have told me the current service
has reversed the situation: whereas there used to be more nurses than
call handlers, there are now more call handlers than nurses, and in one
area there are 15 call handlers and one
nurse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051315000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0001.htm#13051315000175">The

can do so? They are left with three alternatives: they can struggle on
providing this very poor, unreliable service, they can go bust and
there is no service, or the money is found from somewhere else in the
NHS. However, under the crackpot system that the Government introduced
when they changed the law, there is no machinery for putting extra

system that have developed over the past 60 years through a series of
piecemeal measures enacted by successive Governments. It is essential
that in considering this over the next few months we make sure that we
get it right, because legislation in the social care sphere comes to
the House very infrequently. Our care and support system is of key
importance because the rapid age shift that is taking place in our
population is profoundly changing the nature of the demands on the

way that local authorities plan their services. There are new duties on
information and advice. I welcome the fact that the Government have

£118,000—and the cap itself. Of course, we do not want
people to reach the cap. We want steps to be taken to enable them to
avoid having to pay catastrophic lifetime costs in the first place. The
biggest gain of implementing the Dilnot proposals is a public health
gain. It is about having conversations about care needs earlier, so

want to touch on three issues in the time remaining. First, some
serious questions remain about how the Bill, which we will scrutinise
over the coming months, will deal with the issue of young carers, which
has already been raised. It is possible that young carers will fall
into a gap between the Children and Families Bill, 
<?notus-xml column=370?>which is currently before the House, and the Care Bill, which will soon
be before us. The Care Bill needs to address situations in which an
adult does not qualify for local authority support and their children
end up taking on caring responsibilities that become overly burdensome
and inappropriate. In such circumstances the adult should be entitled
to some sort of service so that their child does not lose their
childhood to caring responsibilities. That requires action in the
adult-related Care Bill; it should not be pushed away to be dealt with
in the Children and Families
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T15:52:16"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T15:52:25"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T15:52:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051315000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0001.htm#13051315000185">The
second issue is poor commissioning practice, which was highlighted by
an Equality and Human Rights Commission report on home care more
than 18 months ago. It identified that contracting by the
minute, or time-and-task contracting of home care, denigrated people
and that they were being dealt with in an undignified way as a
consequence of how services were being commissioned. Just a few weeks
ago the Low Pay Commission’s most recent report highlighted, yet
again, too many circumstances in which home care is being delivered by
people who are paid below the national minimum wage. That is
unacceptable and the Government need to deal with

were constantly not paid for travel time. How do we break this vicious

Burstow:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Lady for here intervention and
will come to the issue of funding in a moment. The Joint
Committee on the draft Care and Support Bill, which I chaired, was
unanimous in its report’s recommendation that Government
legislation must address the need for actual costs to be a relevant
factor in determining fees for care. That is not covered adequately in
the Care Bill at present and I am sure that hon. Members will take that
into consideration. The Association of Directors of Adult Social
Services said in its most recent survey that it was already concerned
that some providers were suffering financially and that the situation
would get considerably worse over the next two years. Will the Minister
consider allowing the Care Quality Commission to inspect councils again
when its inspections of local providers reveal that poor commissioning
practices are at the heart of its concerns about those providers? The
CQC has created a space for local authorities to self-improve and
collaborate with one another. However, when its inspections reveal
provider stress because of that, it should be able to inspect the

most of us have chosen a vocation in politics. Our culture is often
caricatured as being about the royal family and maypoles. Those are
important—well, the royal family are; I am not so sure about
maypoles—but what is our culture? Our culture, which we should
promote ruthlessly, is freedom of speech, freedom of association,
freedom of thought and expression, and the rights, protection and
promotion of women and minorities. That is what being British is all

I came to Parliament in 2005, I raised the issue for the first time
that GPs and other health professionals needed to identify carers
within their practice population. GPs are best placed to help carers at
the start of caring, which is when they need that help and advice. It
is the GP who deals with the patient with dementia, the patient
recovering after a stroke, or the patient with cancer. The GP and
primary health care team are, after those life-changing events, well
placed to see if there is an unpaid family carer. It is then a simple
step for them and their teams to take time to check the health of the
carer and to refer them to sources of advice and support. Caring can
have a serious impact on the health of carers. In a recent survey of
3,000 carers, Carers UK found that 84% said that caring was having a
negative impact on their own health—up from 74% in
2011-12.</hs_Para>

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:17:13"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods) and 11 MPs from

However, the Government did not support the Bill. In the debate, the
Minister of State, Department of Health,
who<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T16:17:38"></hs_TimeCode> is
responsible for care services, stressed that it was best to get
everything codified in one place so that one piece of legislation
addressed all issues of care and support. However, the Care Bill does
not help with the identification of carers; it puts the duty of
assessment on to local authorities. It is questionable whether
cash-strapped local authorities will be able to assess the needs of
large numbers of carers in any way that makes it a worthwhile exercise
for those carers. If the Minister wants to look at the Joint
Committee’s web forum on the draft Care and Support Bill, he
will see that many of those who commented said that local authority
assessments are of little practical help in their caring

important group of carers in great need of being identified is young
carers. As we have heard, young carers are in a unique position, being
directly impacted on by the health and independence of adults. The care
provided to that adult should help to sustain the whole family and
reduce the impact of any caring requirements on the child. We know that
if care services ensured that all adults needing care received it, that
would help the children in the family, but frequently, we must admit,
they do not get it, and the person needing care then starts to rely on
the child providing it, which impacts on the child’s
well-being.</hs_Para>

valuable, because it can prevent negative and harmful outcomes for

spent much time on this in the Joint Committee, and the Care Bill now
provides a unique opportunity to ensure that young carers have equal
rights. We shared the concern of our witnesses that it appeared that
clauses in the draft Bill applied only to adult carers, leaving young
carers with lesser rights. Some amendments have been made, but it has
not progressed as much as it should have done, and I found it
disappointing that in a recent Committee debate on the Children and
Families Bill,

hon. Friend the Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)
made the case for the amendments very powerfully. Interestingly, the
children’s Minister argued in response that the draft Care and
Support Bill already allowed for the assessment of adults with care and
that that could be linked to other assessments, which he thought would
allow for consideration of the effects of adult support needs on the
rest of the household, but that is not happening on the ground. Only 4%
to 10% of referrals to young carers

Frances Patterson QC told us that the Bill should make provision for
services for young carers as well as their assessments, and that the
assessments were of limited use for young

continuing increases in home care charges. The number of people

economic policies and tackling the deficit—the reason that the

£10 million was spent on the Francis report, but its
recommendations on the health service they have been practically
discarded by this Government. Instead, the Secretary of State for
Health is suggesting what can be described only as a vanity
policy—he wants a chief inspector of hospitals. He was unable to
tell me how much the chief inspector would earn, where the budget was
coming from, whether this counted as committed spending, whether the
Treasury knew about it, or whether it was to be taken out of the Care
Quality Commission budget. This was not a recommendation that either
Robert Francis or the Health Select Committee made. The <I>Health

remember Helen Mann, a head teacher who was so terrified of an Ofsted
inspection downgrading her school from outstanding that she hanged
herself. Is this what we want our public servants to do? In any case,
it was not Ofsted, but the hard work of teachers and pupils that drove
up standards. Here is the chaotic part: for a top-performing hospital,
there will be lower regulation. How can that be fair? The Secretary of
State was unable to tell the Select Committee how long these
top-performing hospitals would be able to keep their top rating? That
is a recipe for chaos. And what will be monitored? Again, the Secretary

Members know, I was a nurse in a former life, and it was a profession
that I absolutely loved. I was, I think, a committed nurse. I lived in
a nursing home, and often worked for more hours than I was supposed to.
I would go into the hospital on my days off to visit patients who had
no relatives. I was not alone in that; most of the nurses in my nursing
home behaved in the same manner. I pay tribute to a nurse who started
work on the same day as me, on 5 November 1975: Helen Windsor, who
contacted me recently. For all these years, she has been delivering the
same committed care that she delivered in
1975.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051315000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0001.htm#13051315000272">I
suppose many people will say that that was a long time ago, and it was,

timeless. It does not matter when they were being delivered; they
should be delivered in the same way today. Unfortunately, however,
I—like many other Members—regularly receive complaints
from constituents about the standard of nursing care. I mentioned Helen
Windsor because I want to pay tribute to the nurses who do deliver good
care.</hs_Para>

because his nails were serrated and were catching on the cardigan that
he was wearing as he sat in his chair. When I asked the nurse whether
she could cut his nails—he said that he had been asking for it
to be done himself—she replied “No, I can’t. We
are not allowed to do that.” So I took an emery board out of my
handbag and filed his nails myself. I know that sometimes, as Members

nurses holding conversations over her head about intimate

which, while she was in pain, my daughter had no interest in hearing.
Not only was she subjected to those intimate details of their private
lives; she was also subjected to a lack of care. She was completely
ignored on that trolley. Yes, she was about to go into an operating
theatre and be dealt with, but it is when patients are in that

that bottom sheet for the nurses to see, with the dates written in a

been changed. We used to change the sheets every day, and that was

there can be no surprises about me and tobacco, because I have been on
an 
<?notus-xml column=387?>anti-tobacco crusade in the House for nearly two decades. In my

48,000 smokers, and although the number is declining, it is likely that
more than 950 young people between the ages of 11 and 15 will take up
smoking this year, and half of them will die a premature death. This
year, more than 100,000 of our fellow citizens will die a premature
death from using tobacco as instructed to by the tobacco companies. If
half that many people were dying of anything else in this country, this

Gerald Howarth:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right.
Immigration is imposing burdens on our services, such as the health
service and social services. I am seeing that in my own constituency.
We now have some 10,000 Nepalese, mostly elderly, who have come to the
United Kingdom as a result of the politicians’ caving in to the
campaign run by an actress called Joanna Lumley. That has resulted in a
fundamental change to the nature of Aldershot that has deeply upset my

projection that the United Kingdom’s population is likely to
reach 70 million in the next 15 years means, as I said, that we will
need to build eight large cities outside the capital during that
time—in other words, one home every seven minutes, day and
night, just to house new immigrants unless the Government are able to
continue their progress in tackling immigration. The 2011 census
revealed a mass exodus of white British from the city of
London—a fall of 600,000 between 2001 and 2011. Almost half the
population of Ealing and Hammersmith were born outside the United
Kingdom. These are fundamental changes to the nature of our country.
The people of Britain are entitled to express a view on the composition
of their country. Last week there was a story in the <I>Evening

where 59% of the 463 children are on free school meals, 79% have
English as a second language, and Somali and Turkish are the most

main focus of this debate—health and social care—is a
vital issue for many people; even if they do not think so at present,
it certainly will be in the future. As we are all aware, the changing
demography and advances in modern medicine and technology have thrown
up challenges to our society in how to develop the capacity for social
care and, indeed, how to pay for it. The issue is not unique to the
United Kingdom; it is a challenge in many countries across the world.

right hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), the shadow
Health Secretary, when he was in government. I hope that the Bill will 
<?notus-xml column=392?>simplify the existing regulations, provide some
confidence that lifetime assets will not be swept away by care costs,
and—I stress that I hope that this will happen—eradicate
the postcode lottery of care, introducing an element of consistency to
the system. The Bill should also give stronger legal rights to
carers—I echo the words of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:11:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

said that, there are still some major areas of concern and I want to
concentrate on them. Frankly, they throw up challenges for everyone in
this House, regardless of which political party we belong to. I am not
convinced that the Government have thought through where young carers
fit into the big picture painted by the new Bill. It is, of course, a
welcome development that, for the first time, councils will have to
meet the eligible needs of carers for support. I also welcome the aim
for a family assessment, which in some areas should pick up the
pressures on young
carers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:12:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051321000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051321000011"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:14:33"></hs_TimeCode>Many

concerns have not been covered adequately. The well-being of young

people who should, to be frank, be doing other
things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:13:16"></hs_TimeCode>. Council
budgets are being stretched and care and support is being restricted in
many instances to those who have critical or severe needs, so an
unacceptable burden is still being placed on young carers who support
family needs but who will not meet the new exacting

do not want to reiterate some of the points that other hon. Members

a few moments on the issue of working-age people who need support from
our social
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:14:02"></hs_TimeCode>. Too
often the debate on social care concentrates on older people, but it
should not focus on them alone, because the reality is that about a
third of people who rely on support are of working age and they are
often forgotten. I am sure we will all agree that a younger
person’s need for support from the care system is not
necessarily the same as that of an older person. To that end, the
all-party parliamentary groups on local government and on disability
launched a joint inquiry to investigate how social care policy, funding
and practice can better meet the needs of disabled adults.

recently started working with the British Heart Foundation on sudden
adult death syndrome after I was contacted by two constituents whose
son, Sam, died suddenly as a result of cardiac arrest. He was
19 years old. SADS claims the lives of at least 12 young
people such as Sam every week, but many of those fatalities are
completely preventable. I knew a young man in his 20s who died in the
middle of his round in a dressage competition. Like Sam, he was a very
fit young man. All such young deaths are devastating for everyone

seconds and minutes after someone has a cardiac arrest are vital to
ensuring their survival. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation should be used
immediately until a defibrillator can be located. If those activities
are used together, the potential for survival is immediately increased.
In fact, here in the UK, we currently have only a 20% survival
rate—that figure is for all cardiac arrests, not just cardiac
arrests among young people—but in Seattle, where there is
mandatory CPR education in secondary schools, the survival rate has
increased to 54%. I am sorry that

the Under-Secretary of State for Skills in the Department for Education
is no longer in the Chamber—he was here a few minutes ago. My
suggestion is that, if we roll out a schools programme, we could
increase survival rates, as more children are trained to undertake CPR
and to follow-up with
defibrillators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051321000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051321000033">I
am deeply concerned about those figures. I should like to highlight the
pressing need for the availability of life-saving equipment and skills
in our schools. In the first instance, will the Department of Health
work with local authorities through health and wellbeing boards to urge
them to consider providing funding to install automated external
defibrillators in all schools and other local authority facilities?
AEDs are very simple to use, even for the untrained layperson. Detailed
instructions on how they are to be deployed are delivered through a set
of simple audio and visual commands. The machines are programmed to
administer an electrical shock only if the patient’s condition
requires it. In order to prevent mortality as a result of SADS, it is
essential that those easy-to-use and relatively inexpensive devices are
made available in
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051321000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051321000034">Further
to the availability of AEDs, it is also extremely important that,
through citizenship lessons, children of school age are aware of, and
able to administer, life-saving treatment such as CPR. Such a scheme
would cost local authorities very little, and ultimately has the
potential to save many lives every year. Organisations such as 

<?notus-xml column=396?>St John Ambulance would be able to go to schools to train
students and teachers so that they are able to undertake such
treatment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051321000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051321000035">In
addition, I should like to point out to hon. Members that the British
Heart Foundation provides grants to schools for defibrillators. Many
schools are not aware of that. Perhaps MPs on both sides of the House
could make schools in our constituencies aware of the grant. I look
forward to working with the Department of Health on the issues that

congratulate the Government on their fine display of unity on the

recall seeing anything quite like it. In the early days of the
Government, the ambition was simple: wipe out the deficit in a single
Parliament, set debt on a downward path and restore health to the
economy. Hon. Members were to judge success by how the credit ratings
agencies maintained the triple A rating. Simple! The Government now
claim that their ambition is to cut the deficit by a third, but almost
everyone else believes it is more likely to be cut by only a quarter.
That is our lot for the rest of the Parliament. Debt is rising, not
falling, and triple A credit ratings are but a distant
memory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051321000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051321000038">After
the costs in administrative chaos caused by the top-down reorganisation
of the health service, which the Prime Minister promised would not
happen, the Government are turning their hand to social care. They are
right to do so, at least in the sense that social care is a time bomb
that desperately needs tackling. My most recent survey of constituents
in Selly Oak shows that 73% of them consider care to be an issue of
extreme importance, and only 42% think that the quality of care

rang again and spoke to a Jackie, who could find no record of her
application or complaint but said that someone would ring her back. No
one rang, so Mrs Hanslow phoned again. This time, people at the office

of the complexities seems to be that Ms McGarry has exercised her

McGarry has now been advised that all direct payments are being
stopped. That is the reality of social care in this country today, and
it is against such nonsense that we are asked to have faith that the
Government are going to give people more rights. We are asked to accept
that £150 million and promises from the Secretary of State will
fix the problem. It may have escaped the Government’s notice,
but the most recent round of cuts took a further £800 million
out of services for the elderly and disabled, on top of last

setting a cap at £75,000—£72,000 in the first
instance—raising the savings limit to £123,000 and giving
a guarantee that no one will have to sell their home. Of course,
£75,000 only covers the costs of care, not what is called hotel
costs, such as food and accommodation. The cap is not, as

the Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) pointed out,
the amount the individual spends, but the amount a local authority can
buy for £75,000. When we add the real costs of residential care,
rather than the

much more likely that an individual will spend at least double that
amount before the cap kicks in.</hs_Para>

£123,000 savings threshold means that anyone who has capital,
including an empty home, will have to pay all their care costs until
the cap is reached. That only leaves the guarantee that no one will be
forced to sell their home—except that since October 2001 no one
has been forced to sell their home. The previous Government introduced
the deferred payments scheme and, in 2009, advised local authorities
that if they failed to recognise the scheme, the courts would almost
certainly rule their actions illegal. No interest is charged on
deferred payment arrangements while a person is in receipt of care, or
for 56 days after their death. The Government intend to make the
existing arrangements compulsory, but also apply interest charges from
the moment the scheme is activated. While questions remain about who
will qualify, it is estimated that most of the additional subsidy will
go to the richest 40% of people in the care system. That is what is
wrong with the Government. The Government are built on falsehoods:
falsehoods about the unity and purpose of the coalition; denial about
the real state of the economy; and policies that are more about UKIP

2005, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Britain’s
automatic blanket ban on the right of prisoners to exercise their vote
was incompatible with the convention on human rights, of which we are a
signatory. Almost eight years on, the United Kingdom has still not
acted on that ruling and time is running short. The Government must
submit their response to the Council of Europe’s

would like to state from the outset that I disagree with the ECHR
ruling. I believe that the current ban on prisoner voting, which was
ruled on and reinforced by successive Parliaments, is a proper and
proportionate response following conviction and imprisonment, and I
spoke and voted accordingly when the House last debated this matter. I
repeat that to my mind the right to vote is not an intrinsic
right, but a civic duty reserved for responsible citizens. However, we
cannot talk of individual duty and responsibility in the eyes of the
law while shirking our national obligations to uphold the international
rule of law, one of the basic tenets of British foreign policy. And
here is the troubling paradox: if, as the old maxim goes, no man is
above the law, surely no country is either. I welcome the fact that
this Government, unlike their predecessors, have recognised this
responsibility, and I am pleased that the draft Bill on prisoner voting
has been presented and that a Joint Committee will consider its
options<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:39:46"></hs_TimeCode>, but I
am concerned that matters are progressing slowly against a swiftly
approaching deadline and that we are not making a strong enough case
for a pragmatic solution.</hs_Para>

the Government choose to maintain the status quo, we will stand in
breach of the convention. If we ignore the judgment, we send the
message that dissent is an acceptable state of play, and we would
damage our reputation and lose the moral authority to demand compliance
from those countries that persistently violate international law. Do we
want our record on observing the rule of law compared with that of
Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Armenia? It would be neither
right nor desirable, but a solution might be closer to home than we
think.</hs_Para>

the blanket ban came into force under the Representation of the People
Act 1969, limited forms of prisoner voting were permissible and even
practised. The Forfeiture Act 1870 disqualified convicted felons from
voting, but only those serving a sentence exceeding 12 months. Felons
serving less than 12 months could legally vote, and where it was
practically and logistically possible, some indeed did. In the 1950
general election, for example, postal ballots were returned from
prisoners in jails across the country.</hs_Para>

is more. When the Criminal Law Act 1967 abolished the distinction
between felonies and misdemeanours, the concomitant disqualification on
prisoner voting came temporarily to an end. In fact, all prisoners
could vote. In effect, these prisoners had the right to vote, and it
might surprise people that this was not an unintended
consequence of the legislation, but a conscious decision based on a
recommendation by a law review committee that the practice of prisoner
disfranchisement should not continue.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:42:18"></hs_TimeCode> point is
that the issue was not historically set in stone—not under the
Forfeiture Act and not when the United Kingdom signed the convention in
1950—so past precedents should lead the way. To this end, the
Government’s proposals on minimum thresholds are worthy of
consideration, as they reflect an approach that was deemed compatible
with UK law, public opinion and the convention, but we need to
step up the dialogue.</hs_Para>

then, do we move forward? I believe that the distinction between
felonies and misdemeanours is obsolete, but the classification of
crimes into indictable and summary offences, which distinguishes
between grades of crime, mode of trial and punishment available,
continues to apply. Like the old felonies, the most serious indictable
crimes are tried before a Crown court, and I believe that this
distinction could be used as a building block for a
sentence-based solution that recognises the gravity of an offence
committed. This is a route that we should consider, and the United
Kingdom now has an advantage: the European Court recently reaffirmed
its commitment to allowing the UK greater flexibility in how we apply
the ruling, providing an opportunity to develop a policy that
reconciles both principle with pragmatism and which allows

those of my colleagues who are often banging on about Europe. Let me
remind them that divided parties do not give the electorate confidence

referendum, they should rally behind the Prime Minister, who has a
clear commitment to address the European Union’s institutional
deficiencies and to get a better deal in Europe and then put that to
the people of this country in a referendum.

on about Europe and are not interested in the Prime Minister’s
endeavours to find a solution, but they will have plenty to bang on
about if we have another Labour Government. If they sincerely believe
that what we want is a referendum on Europe, let me tell them that the
only way we will achieve that is to return a Conservative Government.

is the background to the Queen’s Speech. There is wide anxiety
across the country because of our economic difficulties—rising
unemployment and falling living standards. Their root is in the global
financial crisis that has engulfed us and others, but they have been
compounded by the failure of the Government’s economic policy to
deliver what we were promised it would. We were told—I remember
the Prime Minister telling us this three years ago—that the
policy would deliver steady growth and falling unemployment. Instead,
we have had no significant growth since, and unemployment has stayed
high. It is rising at the moment and is forecast to become higher still
later this year. We will get an update on Wednesday, but the key
backdrop to the rather thin Queen’s Speech that we are debating
over these few days is rising unemployment, falling living standards
and the inability of the Government’s economic policy to deliver
what we were told it would.</hs_Para>

is also a lot of anxiety about what is happening in the health service.
That was clear from a survey of 1,700 nurses, the findings from which
were published in the <I>Sunday Mirror</I> yesterday. Fifty-five per
cent of them said things had got worse in the NHS since the election,
compared with 6.5% who said they had got better. 
<?notus-xml column=401?>More than half the nurses surveyed said that morale in the national
health service was either poor or at rock bottom. Rather startlingly,
more than 40% said that there had not been enough staff to provide safe
cover on their most recent shift. It is quite difficult to reconcile
that description of what is happening in the health
service—which tallies with some of the things we have heard in
this debate about what is happening in hospitals—with the rather
rosy picture that the Secretary of State presented to us at the
beginning of the debate.</hs_Para>

this Government were elected, they criticised the health service
targets that had been set under Labour, but there is no doubt that some
of the targets delivered massive and very welcome improvements. In
particular, the target for 98% of accident and emergency patients to be
seen within four hours was very valuable. I was pleased to hear the
Secretary of State affirm its value this afternoon. Before it was
introduced, I regularly saw constituents who had experienced terribly
long delays in accident and emergency. It was not unusual to hear from
people who had been kept waiting all night, for example, but when the
target was introduced the problem was resolved completely, and
remarkably quickly.</hs_Para>

the election, this Government weakened the target from 98% to 95%. I am
glad that there is still a target in place, but, as I said to the
Secretary of State in an intervention earlier, there are growing signs
that it is not being hit. The NHS in England has now missed the new,
reduced target for major accident and emergency units for 32 weeks
running. I hope, as he has reaffirmed the importance of the target
today, the right hon. Gentleman will take steps to ensure that it can
be delivered rather than be missed.</hs_Para>

want to mention two other parts of the Queen’s Speech. My first
point is not a matter for the Ministers on the Front Bench today,
although it is likely to be of some interest to them. The Mesothelioma
Bill, announced last week, is the culmination of a process begun by the
last Government, in which my noble Friend Lord Mackenzie played an
important role. The plan was for the insurance industry collectively to
compensate the victims of diseases caused by exposure to asbestos
during their employment, often many years previously. Problems have

As the Bill goes through the other place and then through this

order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I am sorry to interrupt the debate, but I
need to raise a matter of extreme urgency. At the weekend, a
constituent of mine, Augustine Umukoro, came to my surgery to consult
me about his immigration situation. He handed me a letter and told me
that he had had a meeting with representatives of the UK Border Agency,
who said that in two weeks they might have to start removal
proceedings, for which they would visit him and his family—his
wife and their two children—in their home. I therefore dictated
a letter to the Home Secretary today, asking her to look into the
matter. Within the past hour, I have had a telephone call from Mr
Umukoro to say that when he reported to the UK Border Agency office at
Dallas Court in Salford, as he does every week, he and his children
were taken into custody. His wife was not, as her whereabouts appeared
to be unknown. He was taken down to Heathrow, and he is due to be
removed from this country at 10 o’clock tonight
without any warning and without the Border Agency having fulfilled any
of its conditions.</hs_Para>

Newton</B> (Truro and Falmouth) (Con):</Member> The inclusion in the
Queen’s Speech last week of a Care Bill in this new Session of
Parliament is nothing short of a landmark occasion. Those of us who
have been concerned with the reform of our social care system for
decades know that those desperately needed reforms, which are well
summarised in the Bill, have repeatedly been kicked into the long grass

we are making
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:58:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

forward they will represent for the quality of life of many thousands
of people in this country.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T17:58:44"></hs_TimeCode>It was a
courageous decision by the Government to introduce the Bill at this
time, given that public finances are under enormous pressure as we try
to clear up the mess of the financial legacy bequeathed to us by the
Labour Government, because the reforms will require additional public
finances.</hs_Para>

the last Session of Parliament, excellent work was done by the group of
Members of both Houses in undertaking pre-legislative scrutiny of the
draft Bill. That was a good example of how people can bring the
experience they have gained outside Parliament into their work as
legislators. I am grateful for their consideration of my contribution
and the subsequent inclusion in their report of my recommendations. The
recommendations resulted from work undertaken with a number of Members
across the political parties who worked with the charity Macmillan,
looking at what could be done to improve the quality of care of people
who want to stay at home at the end of their lives. Ensuring people
have a genuine choice over where they die is an issue that is of
particular importance to me.</hs_Para>

year, I chaired a round table event in Parliament, organised by
Macmillan Cancer Support, which brought together carers, health and
social care professionals and policy makers to discuss how to enable
more people to be cared for at home until they die, if that is what
they choose. The expert attendees were clear that access to basic
social care support can make the difference between somebody dying at
home surrounded by their families or dying in an expensive hospital
ward. All too often, however, patients and families cannot access the
support because of a lack of integration of health and social care
systems or because they cannot afford to pay for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051322000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051322000021">I
believe that removing the social care means test for people on
the end-of-life care register would lift a significant barrier to the
integration of care, allowing many more people to access the support
they need and to exercise choice, which could also save the
considerable costs of people being in hospital. The Government’s
commitment, made in the care and support White Paper, to assess free
social care at the end of life through the palliative care funding
review pilots represents very good progress. However, with the Care
Bill likely to become an Act before the pilots finish in 2014-15, it is
also crucial that the Bill allows for the delivery of free social care
at the end of life. This would enable the Government to implement the
policy without delay, once the pilots report.</hs_Para>

care for those at the end of life. Such a step forward would be
welcomed by professionals and families alike. It would make
such a difference to families at such a difficult time of
their

specific aspect of the Bill I would like the Minister to
consider—together with the Under-Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, the hon. Member for Wirral West (Esther McVey), who has
responsibility for disabilities—is social care for working-aged
adults with disabilities. The debate about the future of our adult care
system has very much focused on the elderly and their family and
carers. I am as guilty as anyone else of focusing on the
injustices in the current system for elderly people and the need for a
fairer and better system, but the care system has another group of
people who need support: adults who acquire a disability through an
accident or an illness. They might not have been working long enough to
have savings that they can spend on their care needs and they might
have a degenerative condition that has prevented them from working full
time. For them, reform of the current system is less to do with how
they can protect their assets or how they can pay for care without
selling their homes than with how they can get the help they so
desperately
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:03:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051322000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051322000024">The
definition of eligibility for care within the Bill is of greater
importance than the means-tested threshold and the caps on personal

the Minister will be aware, some local authorities have, sadly, chosen
not to spend the money provided by central Government on the adult
social care budgets and have been increasing the eligibility criteria.
The Dilnot commission highlighted this concerning trend, and I know
that Ministers listened. I understand that the Department of Health is
working on amendments to the fair access to care criteria currently
used by local authorities. The amendments are reflected in the Bill,
which includes new interim eligibility criteria. Concerns have been
raised, however, that the interim criteria will not address the
continuing shift of social care provision away from those with moderate
needs. Research undertaken by the London School of Economics indicates
that 105,000 people could lose eligibility if the Government move ahead

very real care needs of those who fall into the moderate care category

we received on Friday on the Government’s consideration of what
improvements might be put into the Bill that they have agreed to look
at the eligibility 
<?notus-xml column=405?>criteria and to fund the proposals under the June
comprehensive spending review. All that is very welcome. I hope that,
once the criteria and the funding to support it have been agreed, the
money passed over to local authorities will be ring-fenced for a
period, perhaps up to three years. The Government have done
that for public health, and doing it in this instance would enable the
estimated 105,000 people who have moderate care needs to receive the
funding and to continue with their working and volunteering lives,
playing their full part in
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051322000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051322000029">I

on minimum pricing of alcohol and on plain packaging for cigarettes and

parties and, indeed, the wider community, but the Government have lost
a golden opportunity to put these measures in this year’s
Queen’s

the past 10 or 12 years, we have had a fantastic record on heart
disease, with deaths going down by 46%. We have taken some big and bold
decisions: for example, the Labour Government passed a measure to ban
smoking in public places; we also introduced statins, which are largely
responsible for the 46% drop in heart-related deaths. We must keep up
the momentum, however, and minimum pricing of alcohol and plain
packaging of cigarettes could have helped us to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000003"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T18:08:18"></hs_TimeCode>Each

Those young people have been deliberately targeted.

now want to say something about how mindfulness can help with problems
related to health and social care. Members may ask “What is
mindfulness?” Mindfulness is an integrative mind-body-based
approach which helps people to change the way they think and feel about
their experiences, especially stressful experiences. It involves paying
attention to our thoughts and feelings so that we become more aware of
them, less enmeshed in them, and better able to manage them. It uses
breath as an anchor to slow down the mind and body and to help us to
live in the present moment, rather than being chased by our past or
worried by our future. It is the perfect way to combat
stress—and the impact of stress on heart problems,
cancer and mental health conditions is
massive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000008">Members
may think that that sounds a bit airy-fairy, but the National Institute
for Health and Clinical Excellence has backed mindfulness as a better
way of treating repeat-episode depression than drug therapy. It puts
the individual in control. It is as cheap as drug therapy in the short
term, and cheaper in the long term. It has no known side-effects, and,
if taught early enough, it is preventive. Let me give the House some
statistics. A total of 32.3% of people aged between 15 and 25 suffer
from one or more psychological conditions. Every Member in the
Chamber will know someone with such a condition, perhaps even a family

compassion is lacking, mindfulness can enhance it. It can be used

can help in a personal capacity, but it can also assist the development
of policy in prisons—85% of prisoners have mental health
conditions—in education, in the armed forces, in the police and

role throughout society and in all departments. I urge the Department
of Health to recognise that, to act on NICE’s 2004
recommendations, and to ensure that the use of mindfulness for the
treatment of repeat-episode depression is fully implemented. I also

Tredinnick</B> (Bosworth) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure to follow
the hon. Member for Vale of Clwyd (Chris Ruane). I entirely agree with
what he said about mindfulness and the need for NICE to ensure that it
is available for the treatment of stress in particular. That is all the
more important now that we have a Government who have put patient
choice at the heart of the health service, a fact that will become more
and more evident as health and wellbeing boards and Healthwatch start
to make an impression through the Health and Social Care Act
2012.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000014">Like
the hon. Gentleman, I intend to focus exclusively on health issues. I
shall concentrate not on what is in the Queen’s Speech but on
what is missing from it, particularly the expected statutory regulation
of herbal therapies. If we are to ensure that the range of
treatments that people demand, including mindfulness, are safely
regulated in the health service, we must tackle the issue of herbal
medicine, which is a crucial tool in our
cupboard.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000015">At
this point, I must declare an interest. I was involved in the
legislation applying to the last two groups that were made subject to
statutory regulation, the Osteopaths Act 1993 and the Chiropractors Act
1994, as a member of the Standing Committees that considered those
Bills. Let me emphasise to Ministers how important it is to take that
route. It makes practitioners focus on a disciplined 
<?notus-xml column=408?>structure and operate a robust complaints procedure, it makes it easier
for doctors to refer, and it makes treatments more widely
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000016">When
it comes to herbs, we need an interface with European legislation. We
must deal with regulation 3(6) of the Human Medicines Regulations 2012,
which grants “a person”, not a therapist, the right to
practise. What worries me is that Ministers may regulate not therapists
but specific herbs. There are thousands of them out there, and that
cannot be satisfactory. We must give therapists the right to prescribe.
In the case of traditional Chinese medicine, for example, most
practitioners will prescribe three herbs to work in conjunction. As I
have said in the House before, it works like the Whips Office: there is
a chief, a deputy and a messenger. The messenger takes the chief and
the deputy to cure the problem. My hon. Friend the Member for Rochford
and Southend East (James Duddridge) laughs; of course, that does not
always apply to
Whips.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000017">My
greatest worry is this: I believe that the statutory regulation has
been blocked by vested interests in the orthodox medical community who
have said to the Secretary of State “We do not want this,
because it will enhance the status of herbal therapists.” If
that is true, it is selfish and
stupid.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000018">A
sub-set of the problems lies in the fact that there are two types of
herbal therapies. There is the “fighter therapy” provided
by Hydes Herbal Clinic in Leicester, which I believe is in the
constituency of the hon. Member for Leicester West (Liz Kendall), and
there is traditional Chinese medicine, which involves the use of
different types of herb. We need separate registers to make sure that
these therapies are prescribed
safely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000019">It
is interesting to see the headlines that are appearing now. The hon.
Member for Vale of Clwyd talked about doctors using mindfulness. One
headline states, “GPs prefer herbal remedies to Prozac, says
survey”, and one such cited remedy is St John’s wort,
which in fact has side-effects if used with other, conventional,
medicines. One reason why I want statutory legislation is to make sure
that people who are taking herbal medicines can go to their
doctors and say, “Yes, I am taking it, and doing so under the
prescription of a statutory regulated
practitioner.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000020">I
should say in passing that the Under-Secretary of State for Health, my
hon. Friend the Member for Central Suffolk and North Ipswich (Dr
Poulter), who has been dealing with this issue, has graciously offered
me a meeting to discuss it further, and I look forward to taking him up
on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000021">Provision
was made in the Health and Social Care Act 2012 for the Professional
Standards Authority, which should regulate all complementary therapies
other than those provided by individual practitioners, who are
regulated under individual legislation. The Society of Homeopaths,
which I have supported for years, should be regulated too. Here, we are
completely out of line not just with Europe but with Asia and America.
We have not used enough of such resources. It is patently absurd to say
it is all placebo, given that in Europe 40,000 physicians practise
homeopathy, in Asia, 250,000 physicians practise it, and it is
practised in Brazil, Nigeria and America. It is not a placebo, because
people are using it. One can fool some of the people all of the time
and vice versa, but not all the people all of the time.</hs_Para>

reason why those who oppose such therapies make some headway is they
refer only to randomised control trials. However, we should also
consider meta-analyses and patient-reported outcomes. Where
double-blind placebo-controlled trials are conducted, they are ignored.

negative.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000023">Just
a few centuries ago, scientists were saying that the sun went round the
earth; now, we know that the earth goes round the sun. Science changes.
Here, we should bear in mind what is known as the Semmelweis reflex.
When a doctor in Germany discovered that child mortality rates could be
reduced if doctors washed their hands, conventional practitioners
pooh-poohed the idea, but eventually it became the norm. We
have to be progressive, and so it is with some homeopathic remedies,
which are so dilute that they cannot be seen through conventional
analysis. However, the fact is that those very dilute substances work
effectively. The future lies in a wider range of health provision
across the health
service.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051323000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051323000024">I

In Plymouth—a mesothelioma hot spot because of the nature of its

has been made on speeding up the process through which insurance
companies accept liability and pay compensation. However, for too many
of my constituents progress has been tragically slow: they have not
survived this awful disease long enough to benefit from the
legislation. We have a moral duty to do everything we can to support
the victims, and we need to ensure that the Bill, which has had a very
slow gestation—it was discussed under the last Labour
Government—does what it says on the tin and guarantees faster
pay-outs. The failure to address other asbestos-related diseases is
also giving rise to concern.</hs_Para>

more fortunate are now, with support, living into grand old age, and we
have to resolve the issue, which has dogged successive Governments, of
providing care for our older citizens, as well as younger people with
illness or disability. The care and support Bill should be welcomed as
a step in the right direction, but I fear it will not be enough and,
rather than having a full-blown national care service, we will
end up with a piecemeal one. The level of the cap has been set
too high—higher than Andrew Dilnot recommended—and
without investment in local services the Bill will have serious
consequences, as clearly set out in the opening speech of my right hon.

exemplar—because of the deep cuts being made to their budgets.

Ministry of Defence was underpowered in the skills required to deliver
increasingly complex programmes. There are too many questions that need

we will need to come back to those questions. The themes,

there is a huge case to be made for Ministers to focus on implementing

Derriford hospital in Plymouth for briefings. I have been going
slightly longer than she has—21 years—and I can tell the
House that in good times and in bad times Derriford hospital is under
pressure. It has a running capacity of about 95%, which means that when
there are spikes, as there have been this winter, it can be running at
103% capacity, which puts the hard-working staff under enormous
pressure. Even when the Labour Government were spending money as though
it were going out of fashion, I have never gone to Derriford hospital

pressure points. Everything is working in our health service.

point I wanted to raise with Ministers is that the funding formula for
emergency work needs to be reviewed. As I understand the system, the
formula is based on the 2008-09 baseline, and any extra patients who
come into an acute hospital over and above that baseline are paid at
30% of the tariff. It costs hospitals 100% to meet the needs of those
people coming in, yet they are paid at 30%; the extra 70% is supposed
to be spent by other health care agencies in providing alternative
centres of treatment, which are intended to divert people away from
acute hospitals. I am pretty well plugged into what is going on in my
constituency, and I have not seen anything since 2008 that looks
vaguely capable of diverting pressure away from Derriford hospital. The
system of allocating 30% to the hospital and 70% elsewhere is simply
not working. I ask our Ministers to look urgently 
<?notus-xml column=414?>at that formula and to find out why, if it is not
working, we are still using it and to address that. I am not calling
for extra money; I am calling for money to be diverted to the acute
hospitals, because they are where the pressure points are. In my
constituency, there have been no realistic options for treatment other
than to go to Derriford hospital. So, such hospitals should be
receiving not 30% but 100% of the tariff.</hs_Para>

learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham (Stephen
Phillips) is absolutely right about demand growing exponentially. In
1979, if a man reached the age of 65, they could expect to live until
they were 77. If a man reaches the age of 65 now, they can expect to
live until they are 88, and of course that age is rising year on year,
so the demand is going up.</hs_Para>

that we are noticing is that although the number of people admitted to
the emergency department at Derriford hospital in the last 12 months
has been stable, there is much higher acuteness—in other words,
people are much sicker and therefore it requires a lot more effort to
treat them. Please, nice Ministers on the Front Bench, may we have a
look at that formula for the funding for people accessing acute
hospitals on an emergency basis?</hs_Para>

point, in the one minute of my time that remains, is that 20 years ago
or so I made a speech in this House saying that the health service had
lots of challenges, issues and problems, but that one of the things we
did not need to touch was primary care as it was working fine. I cannot
make that speech today. I will not hammer the Opposition again about
the GP contract, but in the past few years constituents have been
complaining to me in a way that they never did in the previous 15 years
to say that accessing their GP is becoming extremely difficult. For
someone—whether they are a mum with a young baby, or a senior
citizen—to get a surgery appointment when they want it has
become a serious issue in the past few years. Addressing that issue
does not necessarily require legislation, but may I ask Ministers
whether we can please put in place a system whereby GPs give the seven
o’clock in the morning to seven o’clock at night, seven
days a week service that this country so desperately
deserves?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/8D9806E7268BAD898649DC1093784609A11C1A4D" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 May 2013">Monday

saying: 
<?notus-xml column=415?>“Don’t waste time on this Prime Minister, Mr President. He
has only two years left. He can’t even command the support of

jostle for succession, and he has even told members of his own
Government that they can vote against him on the Government’s
programme. We will have to talk to the people that count in

to everything we are doing in all policy areas is the austerity

next 10 years and a 38% increase in the number of over-85s. There will
also be a large increase in those with learning disabilities. This will
add an extra £10 million to local costs. A lot of complex cases

Government say that local authorities must decide on priorities. That
is true, but it is also a bit dishonest. The national health service
budget, for which the Government are seen as responsible, is protected,
but the social care budget, which is predominantly picked up by local

preventive measures we are seeking to introduce enable people to go
home sooner and have a better experience on their return from hospital,
that will reduce the pressures on the NHS budget but increase the costs
facing local authorities, as they will have to pick up the costs

right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton and Cheam (Paul Burstow)
pointed out that much of the proposed legislation is about intervention
and prevention, on the basis that prevention is better than cure, but
the danger is that today’s moderate needs will become
tomorrow’s substantial or critical needs if they are not met at
the correct time. This is not about cutting our cloth or making do in
times of austerity. It is about, foolishly, making short-term savings
to the detriment of future taxpayers who will have to bear the costs of

Conservative Members talked only about Europe in a very obsessive way,
without any recognition of the fact that constituencies such as mine
that are desperately in need of economic growth rely on our
relationship with Europe. Our region exports the most from this
country, and a huge proportion of our exports are to European

dealing with the problems facing our care system, which need to be
addressed urgently because, as we all know, it is in danger of falling
into crisis. The House of Commons Library has produced research showing
that 10 million people in the UK are over 65 and that by 2030 the
number is projected to rise to 15.5 million. Many of these additional
older people will have care needs, putting increasing pressure on our
care system. At the same time, more funds are being stripped from

firmly believe that this is the right way forward. It has been clear
for some time that we needed to create a long-term solution to allow
people to plan with confidence for their future. Now other generations,
too, can plan how they want to look after themselves in old age because
they know that the cap is there and that there will be a higher
means-testing threshold allowing them 
<?notus-xml column=421?>to put some money aside to address these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:09:13"></hs_TimeCode>. We have
already heard in this debate arguments about the threshold, the cap,

talked about social care, I now want to address NHS funding more
broadly. As I have said, I am proud that NHS spending has risen in real
terms over the life of this Parliament, but the historic formula used
to distribute NHS money around the country needs to be reassessed.
Although it is correct to factor in depravation when deciding where
funds are allocated, a bigger weighting needs to be given to the age of
the local population. A recent Age UK briefing note stated that at any
one time about 65% of hospital patients will be over the age of 65,
while, according to national statistics, areas with the highest
depravation are also likely to be those with the youngest population.
At present, therefore, those parts of the country with the highest
numbers of older people have to deliver highly specialised services and
care without a funding formula to assist them in their work. Moreover,
as a Member representing a semi-rural part of the country, I see at
first hand the effect that geography also has on the delivery of
services and the extra costs involved in delivering quality health care
over a wide
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:10:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051329000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051329000046">Lancaster
is part of the Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. It is a pleasant and
wonderful geographical area, but it is enormous. It has three
hospitals—in Lancaster, Barrow and Kendal. The distance between
the hospital in Barrow, which offers some specialist services, and that
in Lancaster, which offers others, is 50 miles by car, but the hills
and dales mean that it sometimes takes one and a half to two hours to
travel between the two. Nothing in the national formula acknowledges
the problems faced by the
trust<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>.
Specialist services need to be retained in as many of those hospitals
as possible if journey times are to be kept to acceptable levels, which
means that they will require proper funding to allow them to operate. I

want to pinpoint how the problem affects us locally. The Royal
Lancaster Infirmary has a vascular service unit and, despite the
excellent clinical outcomes it has delivered for years, it has been
suggested that it should close. That would leave a service gap between
Carlisle in the north and Preston in the south of nearly 90 miles. It
would leave patients from the more rural parts of my constituency,
especially those from Barrow or south Cumbria, with lengthy journeys if
they needed specialist treatment. Some areas are well outside the
90-minute transport target time, which is already an extension of the
national target of 60
minutes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:12:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051329000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051329000048">That
delay in journey time is a genuine issue for consideration when
establishing where specialist services should be located, as has
already been proven by the decision to retain a vascular service in
Carlisle, where 
<?notus-xml column=422?>an exception was made to most of the scoring criteria because of the
local geography and the time it would take to transport patients
elsewhere. If exceptions are rightly being made in one part of the
north-west, they should apply to other areas where substantial delay is
likely to occur. As I have already said, under the current plans there
is a huge geographical gap in service provision between Carlisle and
Preston<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:13:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051329000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051329000049">The
closure proposal has been referred to the Secretary of State for a
final decision and I sincerely hope that he and his Ministers
will decide in favour of retaining the specialist provision at the RLI.
That, however, is just one example. A more wide-ranging review is being
undertaken of service provision across north Lancashire and there are
concerns that our local A and E unit may be under threat as a result of
geography not being taken into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:13:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051329000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0002.htm#13051329000050">The
funding formula needs to change to take greater account of those parts
of the country with an elderly population. It also needs better to
reflect the difficulties of providing services in large geographical,
sparsely populated areas. Without that and the accompanying
reallocation of resources, hospitals in rural and semi-rural areas will
struggle even more to provide the necessary services to their
residents. I urge the Secretary of State to look into this as a matter
of

Green</B> (Stretford and Urmston) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to
follow the hon. Member for Worcester (Mr Walker). I, too, want
to talk about social care. First, however, let me reinforce the
comments made by my right hon. and hon. Friends about the announcement
on compensation for sufferers of mesothelioma. That devastating illness
affects a number of families in my constituency, as well as many
workers in Trafford Park over many decades. Work was begun by Labour on
a system of compensation for asbestos-related illness where employers
and insurers cannot be traced, and we now at last have a proposal from
the Government although it is disappointingly limited in its
reach.</hs_Para>

scheme will apply only to diagnoses made after 2012, and it completely
misses half the victims of asbestos-related cancers because it is
limited to mesothelioma sufferers and a cap is imposed on the level of
payments. The deal favours insurance companies; it is not good enough
for victims or for the public purse because many sufferers will
continue to rely on payments from the Department for Work and Pensions
as they will not be eligible for the compensation scheme. Although the
proposals in the Queen’s Speech for a system of compensation are
welcome, I hope we will be able to improve the legislation as the
Mesothelioma Bill passes through the House.</hs_Para>

care, everyone agrees that people would prefer to be cared for in their
own home for as long as possible, but community-based provision must be
in place for that to happen. As many right hon. and hon. Members have
said, a lack of community provision is placing excessive strain
on the NHS with regard to A and E and bed blocking, and my local
authority in Trafford has received repeated reports that a lack of
access to rehabilitation, physiotherapy, speech and language
therapies—for example, after a stroke—and to support and
care packages means that it is often impossible to 
<?notus-xml column=428?>discharge someone, even when they are medically fit
to go home. That backdrop is of particular concern at a time when a
significant reconfiguration of our national health service is being
proposed in Trafford. There must be real concern about a squeeze on NHS
services when community provision is not in
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051333000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051333000004">I
am pleased that the Secretary of State has recognised the need for a
single named professional to have oversight of an individual’s
health and social care needs, but the fragmentation and contracting of
NHS services does not help. Competition works against the integration
of primary, secondary, tertiary and social care and, as many colleagues
have said, cuts to local authority budgets are having a massive effect.
Trafford is cutting nearly £3 million this year from
social care budgets, which means cuts to day services, for example, or
increased costs for meals. Curiously, the local authority
intends to achieve a large part of those savings through the
introduction of personalised budgets, which we understood were not
intended as a savings measure.</hs_Para>

to help and keep loved ones at home, but they are under great pressure

of his struggle to use a personalised budget to assemble a care package
for his partner. He called seven potential providers, but most could
not cope with assembling the package she needed to meet her complex
needs. If my constituent could not put together that package,
how—as he rightly asked me—will the more marginalised and
excluded manage? He pointed to the importance of decent brokerage
services, yet at the same time we are seeing cuts to advocacy services.
There is already evidence that personalised budgets do not work so well

help.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051333000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051333000006">It
is not clear what the long-term effects of spreading personal budgets
will be, but they could lead to further fragmentation of services or

even further behind. I invite Ministers to tell the House what steps

Green:</Member></B> I accept what the Minister is saying but evidence
suggests that for certain more disadvantaged and vulnerable
individuals, articulating those needs is very difficult and so
culturally appropriate advocacy, representation and brokerage services

far suggests that the effects of personal budgets are patchy. I am sure

issues relating to social care are also a concern. As others have
pointed out, many of those working in social care earn the national
minimum wage and contract pressures mean that they have little time to
do more than rush in and out of appointments and provide the basic
physical care that clients need. There is little time to stop for a
chat or a cup of tea, or for some of the social interaction that is so
valued by those in receipt of social care. Many providers have told me
they are anxious and that they are being screwed down on pricing as a
result of local authority spending pressures, which could lead to their
contracts becoming unviable. Poor levels of pay— as my hon.
Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mrs Moon) said, staff are often not
paid as they move from one appointment to the next—mean that
they will not be motivated to provide the best care in those
circumstances, and some will be forced to give up their
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051333000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051333000012">Finally,
I welcome the development of extra care for those in need of
residential care, and some good projects are under development in
Trafford. I hope the proposed development in Old Trafford will receive
approval. As colleagues have pointed out, the Dilnot recommendations,
as taken forward in a more limited form by the Government, will leave
many families in my constituency with substantial costs but without
liquid savings with which to meet them, meaning they are
still likely to be forced to consider the sale of the family
home.</hs_Para>

Queen’s Speech needed a much bolder approach to prepare us for
an ageing society, including policies for maximising saving in working
age—difficult when the Government are putting family budgets
under such pressure—and a bolder approach that looks at
combining health and social care budgets, investment in primary and
community health provision to keep people out of hospital longer,
integration over competition, personalisation accompanied by a service
investment programme, and serious attention to work force development.
I regret the many missed opportunities in those areas in the

Government should stay calm, because the foundations of future
prosperity have been laid in the past three years, but we must not be
complacent. The measures announced in the Queen’s Speech are
another step on the journey to national recovery. I am particularly
pleased that the Queen’s Speech tackles head-on two tricky
problems that were classified as too difficult to touch by the previous

years ago, Britain had the best pensions provision in Europe. Our
pensions savings were the envy of the world. Millions of workers were
signed up to excellent final salary pension schemes. Schemes were in
surplus, and workers could look forward to retirement with a good,
inflation-proof income. All that changed in 1997. The scrapping of
advance corporation tax relief blew a massive hole in the
value of pension schemes. That measure cost more than £5 billion
a year—it has now cost pension schemes more than £100
billion, and the average worker has lost around
£100,000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051333000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051333000019">Labour’s
raid on pensions was just one nail in the coffin of final salary
pension schemes. People are living much longer, and the global
recession, the turmoil in the eurozone and our massive deficit have not

is urgently needed, which is why I warmly welcome the inclusion of the
pensions Bill in the Queen’s Speech and the introduction of the
single-tier pension. To ensure that future pensions remain affordable,
people will have to work a year or two longer, so the Bill will bring
forward the increase in the state retirement age and introduce a
five-yearly independent review to ensure that the state pension remains
sustainable. The current pension system is complex and confusing. It is
almost impossible for people to work out how much they will receive.
Under the new single-tier pension, people will qualify for the full
pension of £144 a week provided they have made 35 years of
national insurance contributions. Millions of future pensioners will be
removed from poverty, and people who have saved for retirement will be
able to enjoy the full benefit of their
savings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051333000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051333000021">The
proposals will address the inequalities in the current pension system.
The Bill will support women who have taken time out to raise a family,
and support low earners. The national insurance contributions of the
self-employed will count towards a pension for the first time. Future
generations will also benefit from the option of a workplace
pension, with a contribution 
<?notus-xml column=431?>from both their employer and the Government. The pensions Bill will
provide a clear, straightforward and fair pension for all—one
that is secure as we face the problem of an ageing

big worry for people as they get older is who will look after them in
their old age. The cost of care can be astronomical. For many, the fear
of running out of money or being forced to sell their home to pay care
charges causes huge concern. It is only natural for people to want to
leave something behind for their children and grandchildren, and only
natural that, after a lifetime of working hard and paying taxes, people
want and expect the Government to be there to help. I therefore warmly
welcome the announcement of the social care Bill and the reforms to
long-term care funding. A cap on social care costs will help to ensure
that the elderly do not have to sell their homes to meet their care
bills, and that old people do not feel that they are a burden on others
as their lives draw to a
close.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051333000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051333000023">The

system, such as standardised thresholds for determining whether
individuals are eligible to support from a local authority. It will
include a duty on councils to inform residents about care provision,
and a new right for carers to receive more support. For too long,
Governments have found the problems of social care too difficult to
tackle, and consequently tried to ignore them. I am proud that this

banning smoking in public places. As the shadow Secretary of State for
Health has said, the introduction of plain packaging for cigarettes is
a natural progression, and as the Leader of the Opposition said in his

not a silver bullet, but neither is it the nanny state, as some have
described it. Plain packaging is a means of preventing young people
from taking up a habit that, in the long run, could cost them their
lives. Some 257,000 11 to 15-year-olds become smokers each year, and

should pause to consider the financial costs of smoking, which can be
seen in its impact in towns such as the one I am proud to represent.
The financial costs encompass much more than heightened NHS expenses;
lost output and lost productivity both increase the price associated
with smoking. For Barnsley alone, smoking creates a bill amounting to
£75.3 million each year.</hs_Para>

financial cost is small compared with the human cost. In Barnsley,
there are 485 adult deaths from smoking each year. Despite that, nearly
1,000 children in Barnsley aged between 11 and 15 take up
smoking each year and approximately 1,100 10 to 14-year-olds there are
regular smokers. Like the rest of the UK, Barnsley has paid too high a
price. It is time that action was taken to prevent the costs of smoking
from stretching further and further into the future.</hs_Para>

health and social care spending, to deal with the challenges posed by
an ageing population while not cutting other essential public services.
I encourage 
<?notus-xml column=435?>the Government, over a period of years, to look at
turning national insurance into a national health insurance that, as
now, is based progressively on personal income, and which will provide
the funding for health and, eventually, social care. That would enable
us to have a sensible discussion on the national insurance rate
required to fund health and social care properly, separate from the
wider debate on tax rates and tax

I wish to raise again the question of emergency and acute tariffs, on
which my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T19:59:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for South West Devon (Mr Streeter) spoke so
eloquently. The continuing squeeze on them, coupled with the fact that
activity greater than 2009 levels is paid at only 30% of the
full tariff, is leading inexorably to financial difficulties for acute
hospitals, particularly district general hospitals such as mine at
Stafford. However, it is not only the smallest that are affected. Major
trusts also face deficits. Even if they are not, they will have to pick
up the work load if acute services are removed from their smaller
neighbours. That situation cannot continue. The drift towards
centralising all emergency and acute services in the largest hospitals
has to be stopped—even reversed. It will mean much closer
working between hospitals, as hon. Members have said, and perhaps the
end of many smaller trusts, though not smaller hospitals. It will also
mean that royal colleges will have to get a grip and stop the
fragmentation of health care into more and more specialties that cover
less and less. We need, as the head of a medical school said to me
recently, to rediscover the importance of high-quality generalists. A
publicly funded national health service can only survive on that basis.
That does not mean that specialisms have no place in the NHS—of
course they do—but they must not drive out good general
medicine.</hs_Para>

across the country, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:01:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Lancaster and Fleetwood (Eric Ollerenshaw) said. The
welcome increase in public health funding where there are particular
inequalities was meant to enable per head allocations to become fairer,
but that has not happened. Currently, South Staffordshire
receives at least £40 million per year below its recognised fair
shares allocation, and that is making the work of local clinical
commissioning groups even harder. The Government have committed
themselves to addressing this, but it needs to be done this year or
CCGs will find themselves in a very difficult position right from the
outset.</hs_Para>

it is vital that the Government listen to the public. On 20 April, it
is estimated that 50,000 local people went on a local march and rally,
which I had the honour of addressing, in support of Stafford hospital.
They were speaking out against the idea that emergency, acute and
maternity services could be removed, and were making the point that
alternative services were too far away and, in any case, themselves
under great pressure, and that the proposals did not take proper
account of the increasing population and demography. All of that is
common sense, and I hope that the administrators currently running
Stafford and Cannock hospitals listen to that common sense, and that it
is heard across the country.</hs_Para>

the previous Parliament. However, many will see the thin programme last
week as a missed opportunity to address increasing alarm about the
Government’s poor stewardship of the NHS. It would be too
optimistic to hope that Ministers have had an early change of heart on
the costly and ill-conceived reforms they have just bulldozed through
Parliament. In addition to the lamentable absence of plain packaging
legislation, they could have introduced measures that sought to bridge
the yawning gap between their rhetoric on listening to local people and

so many across the country they love their local hospital, they think
it should have its fair share of the very best, and they think local

basic part of a quality service, not something to be dismissed as an

proving to mean little more than holding a meeting and nodding in an

downgrading services anyway. When my constituents they see the scale of
the upheaval and cuts to front-line nursing staff involved in reducing
the budget of Morecambe Bay trust by £25 million

Government promises that no efficiency savings will be allowed to

live in times of strained resources, but faith in the future of the NHS
may continue to be eroded until we learn genuinely to trust local
communities. When we come to look back at the history of the NHS over
the current decade, I think we will see this as the time when we were
bound overly tightly to the idea that the clinician always knows best.
We will come to see the Government’s blind faith in the
clinical stamp for taking services away as an early 21st century
equivalent of the “Whitehall knows best” mentality that
gripped reforming Governments after the second world war. Just like the
“Whitehall knows best” ethos of the 1940s and 1950s, the
clinician knows best mantra has the best of intentions but is
insufficiently responsive to challenge from the patients who rely on
the services that are being shaped by those at the centre.</hs_Para>

me be clear. It is essential that health professionals make their case

scrutiny. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>Often

local election campaign. On this occasion, he kindly wrote to tell me
in advance—the first time he had done that, despite having made
several visits—so I thank him for that small courtesy, if for
nothing else. He gathered in the shopping centre in the centre of
Cleveleys, with his little pallet, which he stepped on to. Labour

my maiden speech three years ago, I stressed the importance of the

Member for Cynon Valley (Ann Clwyd) and the role she now plays, but
more importantly thanks to the rhetoric around what we recognise as
being important. On my way here today from Euston, I was standing on an
underground train behind a young trainee nurse. In her arms was a thick
folder bearing one title: “dignity”. That message is

we can all recite cases from constituents of cases of care that they
felt were below standards, we must balance that with the recognition
that nurses are the glue that holds the NHS together and that we talk
them down at our peril. For every nurse who might not have ensured that
somebody was adequately fed or had their fingernails clipped or their
conversation in the morning, there is another for whom nursing is a
vocation. We have to recognise that. Nursing is a vocation.
Occasionally, it is a very difficult vocation. The system can be
testing, trying and infuriating for many, but nurses are
there because they want to care for their patients.

<?notus-xml column=440?>Perhaps the secret to health policy lies in allowing
our health care professionals to express that vocation, not to smother
it beneath a system that does not allow that feeling of good will and
desire to do good for our fellow patients to express itself.</hs_Para>

scheduled to close in our constituencies,

immense temptation to man the proverbial barricades. We issue a press
release and set up a photo op outside the threatened location, but do
we always pause to think what is in the best interests of our
constituents, or do we think, “What will get me more

am fortunate, as I have an excellent hospital in Blackpool, the
Victoria. It has one of the premier stroke rehabilitation units in the
north-west. When it opened, it started taking in-patients from as far
away as the south lakes. I am not quite sure, but the area it covers
might even stretch as far as Barrow—I know it goes as
far as Kendal. That was quite controversial at the time, because it
meant that a patient having a stroke would have to drive past about
four hospitals to get to Blackpool. Some people thought, “Why
can’t we go to our local hospital? It’s got wonderful
facilities.” However, since the stroke unit at Blackpool opened,
survival rates have increased for all patients in all groups, because
of the excellence of its specialist care. That is a challenge for every
Member of this House, no matter what our political parties. The easy
answer—the easy campaign, the scare story, or what I call
“campaigning in the conditional”—is not always in
our long-term interests.</hs_Para>

Bridgend, there are 18,000 people providing care for relatives or
friends. Some 5,500 of them provide unpaid care for more than 50 hours
a week—care that is compassionate and dedicated; care of a
quality that we would love to hear is being provided in our hospitals.
I asked a group of carers recently what it meant to be a carer. One of
them said, “It’s like trying to live two people’s
lives and cramming them into one person’s life.” The
other said, “You’re an expert in bodily fluids. Urine,
faeces, blood and vomit are the daily recipe.” Is it any wonder
that the Royal College of General Practitioners recommended last week
that all carers should be screened for depression? It recognises that
carers are particularly susceptible to depression and that there is a
need for greater
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000033">C<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:24:48"></hs_TimeCode>arers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:24:58"></hs_TimeCode>
UK has reported that almost a third of those caring for 35 hours a week
or more receive no practical support, while 84% of carers surveyed said
that caring had a negative impact on health. That is up from 74% in
2011-12, so the problem is getting worse. Four in 10
—42%—of those caring for someone discharged from hospital
in the last year felt that the person they were caring for was not
ready to come out of hospital and that they did not have the right
support at home.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>I worked in
discharge care in a number of hospitals in Wales. Safe discharge was a
major platform on which we worked. The things that are a problem remain
the same. There is a lack of specialist equipment readily available for
carers to assist with discharge—I am talking about beds that
prevent bed sores, hoists, commodes, adapted bathrooms, swallowing
assessments, speech and language therapy, occupational therapists and
physios. It is not just nursing we need to focus on; it is all those
important
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000034"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>We
also need to look at the availability of treatment and medication that
make a difference to people’s lives. I want to talk briefly
about a condition that really shocks me and the carers of those who
have it: aHUS, or atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome. I am the co-chair
of the all-party kidney group. A few weeks ago I chaired a meeting of
people with aHUS. There is a drug available for the condition that is
called—excuse me, Madam Deputy Speaker, but it is a dreadful
drug to pronounce—eculizumab. It sounds like some sort of
African tribe, but that is what it is called. Taking eculizumab can
virtually cure someone with aHUS. They get their life back. We are
talking about a very small number of people who have the
condition—less than 170. The typical form is
triggered by a bacterial infection such as E. coli; the 
<?notus-xml column=442?>atypical form is genetic. We heard tragic evidence
from families in which perhaps three or four generations of children
and adults carried the genetic trigger.
More<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:27:45"></hs_TimeCode>
importantly, the only treatment other than taking eculizumab is to have
dialysis on a virtually daily basis. We heard from carers who have to
place the extremely painful and long needles needed for dialysis into
their children’s arms. Those children cannot have a kidney
transplant because the transplant would almost certainly have the same
condition. Even if they had a transplant, they would continue to need
dialysis.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000035">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:28:06"></hs_TimeCode>
am appalled to learn that the Government have agreed that those who are
taking the drug on a trial basis may continue to take it, while those
who have already been diagnosed but refused access to the drug on a
trial basis will not be allowed access to it. Newly diagnosed patients
will, however, have access to it. That is nonsense. We could save a
large amount of money, and we could save those patients the trauma of
daily dialysis. The drug was recommended for use by the Advisory Group
for National Specialised Services and it has now been submitted to the
National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence for further
appraisal. Sufferers of the condition might therefore have to wait
until 2014 to get access to it, which is totally
unacceptable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000036"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:29:35"></hs_TimeCode>Madam

Duddridge:</Member></B> At the moment, we have piecemeal deregulation,
whereby we look at specific issues and then deregulate. I was elected
as chair of the Regulatory Reform Committee, which as a body deals with
pieces of legislative reform that the Government think can be
fast-tracked for regulation or deregulation in order to avoid
burdensome regulation. That is very much a piecemeal process—we
looked, for example, at veterinary legislation—but it would be
much better to have a big thematic review of issues surrounding care
homes, for example. Rather than look at health and safety, the medical
issues or equipment separately, it would be better to have a thematic
review, cutting across Departments in the same way this debate cuts
across the division between the health service and social services,
local councils and different funding streams. I think it is our
responsibility to do that here in the House of
Commons.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000048"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:37:25"></hs_TimeCode>The
deregulation Bill will be good and tidy up bits of the statute book,

happen. A Joint Committee will be set up between the Lords and the
Commons, and I would very much like to serve on it, but as much as
possible, we should open out the number of Bills that we are looking
at. Setting aside the issue of whether we should be in or out of
Europe, the increase in European legislation demands that we face up to
a two-for-one deregulatory challenge, just to stay standing. We need to
go
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:38:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000049">The
economy is another key theme in the Queen’s Speech. Given our
current economic position, if we had had a Conservative Government from
the outset, I believe such a Government would have tested every single
Bill by asking, “Will this Bill help the economy? If not, it is
marginal, and we should push it to one side—certainly when it
comes to parliamentary time and impact.” I think that the Budget
is much more important. When we highlight the themes in the
Queen’s Speech, we should not judge ourselves by the amount of
paperwork we sign off. The Budget is, in many ways, more important.
Corporation tax, the national insurance deal and so forth will get
Britain booming. I have seen it in my local area, where, for example,
Southend airport has boomed, generating over 500 jobs in the few years
that it has been motoring in a serious way, as opposed to when it was a
rather hobbyist
airport<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T20:39:17"></hs_TimeCode>. There
is much still to be done, but we should not judge ourselves by the
volume of legislation. In fact, through the deregulation Bill, we
should be able to reduce that
volume.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-13?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_13_PT_1/B1620B159ED4672AE6F868C55709353536E17E9C" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="13 May 2013">Monday

health care from the scope of trade agreements as part of a
broader exclusion of public services. I understand that the Prime
Minister is involved in negotiations at this moment, and I hope that
the trade agreement issue is on his agenda, because there is an
increasing fear among Opposition Members that—in that context,

am pleased that the Care Bill is to be introduced in the current
Session. It will go some way towards helping those who are most in need
of social care, as well as their carers, providing as it does the first
ever legislative framework for social care. It is a much-needed first
step in the right direction, which has been a long time coming.
However, it raises a great many issues. As usual with this Government,
we need to look beneath the veneer and establish whether an opportunity
is being taken or missed, and whether we are taking one step forward
and several steps back. It would certainly be a retrograde step to
raise expectations only for them to be dashed as people discover that
the proposals are really quite limited. We need to be honest about what
is on
offer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000053">Members
often receive some shocking and surprising statistics in their
mailbags, but some of the most surprising pieces of information that I
have seen relate to social care. I must thank a range of
organisations—including Scope, Age UK, the Alzheimer’s
Society, the TUC, the British Medical Association, Barnardo’s
and the European Federation of Public Service Unions—for
supplying briefings to me and to other Members. It shames me, and I am
sure it shames Members in all parts of the House, that in Britain in
the 21st century four out of 10 disabled people who receive social care
support say that it does not meet their needs. That was established
recently by research on social care conducted by the disability charity
Scope following the publication of a report by the Joint Committee on
the draft Care and Support Bill, on which I served. It is feared that
the current provisions, and some of those that are proposed, will not
be
sufficient.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000054">Other
Members have welcomed the Bill. However, it is hugely worrying that
local government finance has been hollowed out. That will have major
consequences. It has been said that local government allocations for
social care are protected, but they are certainly not protected when it
comes to provision for transport and other supplementary services that
are of value to members of the group involved. Many organisations have
pointed out that setting eligibility criteria for care at
“moderate” is essential if this framework is to be
effective. As the hon. Member for Bradford East (Mr Ward) pointed out,
according to the findings of a survey by Scope, by 2012 84% of councils
had set their eligibility criteria at the “substantial”
threshold. That represents an increase of nearly a third since 2005. As
a result, only 14% of people with “moderate” needs are
now receiving care, and the findings of recent surveys suggest that the
position will only get worse.</hs_Para>

build a quality care service based on driving down the terms and
conditions of the people who deliver it. I am very concerned about the
increase in the number of zero-hour contracts, through which staff are
paid the bare minimum. Such contracts are increasingly being used by
private care companies seeking flexibility when meeting short-term
staffing needs, and they often lead to job insecurity and a lack of
appreciation of workers. We are seeing the fragmentation of social
care, driven by the pressure to cut costs, which only places obstacles
in the way of quality and of integrating services. Contracting out and
privatisation also make it more difficult to have joined-up services,
and there is a real risk that local authorities will find it impossible
to comply with their new duties.</hs_Para>

honest about what the Bill can achieve. It is a framework. It is paving
legislation. It will not stop people having to sell their homes to pay
for care. Under the existing deferred payment scheme, councils can loan
money to people to cover their care costs, which has to be paid back by
selling the family home after the elderly person has died. The
Government propose something similar, but unlike the current system,
interest is charged on the loan. The care Bill will not necessarily cap
at £72,000 the costs elderly people actually pay for residential
care. As has been said, hotel and other accommodation charges are not
covered. Many elderly people in care homes will die long before they
reach the cap that is being trumpeted as such a success. It certainly
will not mean that pensioners get their care for free if they have
income or assets worth up to £123,000. Elderly people will get
free care only if they have income or assets under the lower
means-tested threshold, which is not being increased and will be
£17,000 in 2016.</hs_Para>

the care Bill does nothing to address the funding crisis in social care
or to help those who face a daily struggle to get the support they need
right now. Elderly and disabled people are facing huge increases in
home care charges, which are a stealth tax on the most vulnerable
people in society. Few older people are getting their care for free,
and more older and disabled people are being forced to pay for more
vital services that help them to get up in the morning and get washed,
dressed and fed.</hs_Para>

after the most vulnerable properly but give incentives to those people
who can create wealth and jobs to do so, and about allowing the economy

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:00:17"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Salisbury (John Glen), as he made an important point about the
economic aspects of the Queen’s Speech, and that serves to
remind us that health is not just a matter of hospitals, doctors,
nurses and medicine—important though all that is—but it
is also affected by Government policies in other areas. I disagree with
the hon. Gentleman in this respect, as I am very concerned that
many of this Government’s policies are, directly or indirectly,
having a damaging effect on the health of many millions of
people in this country.</hs_Para>

first of those effects is illustrated by the growth in real poverty,
which has led to the mushrooming number of food banks throughout the
UK. I now have two food banks operating in my constituency, along with
other sources of free food for those in need, and that situation is
replicated in every constituency across the land. The food provided
through the food banks is healthy food that is beneficial to the diets
of those who receive it. In most cases food is provided only for a
limited period, however, which suggests that at other times those who
depend on food banks do not get decent meals and a decent diet, and
often go hungry. Evidence from the Trussell Trust suggests that about
one third of the people who are dependent on food banks are children,
and we all know that those who have a bad diet at the beginning of
their life can face serious lifelong
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:02:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000080">I
acknowledge that the reasons why people go to food banks are complex.
There is a world economic crisis and increases in food prices at a
worldwide level, so I do not pin all the blame on this
Government’s policies. No doubt in the current global
circumstances we would have seen an increase in food banks under any
Government. I would, however, have liked to have heard some mention in
the Queen’s Speech about policies that would serve to tackle
child poverty and the scandal of so many in our society being dependent
on food

broader area that has a direct impact on health is poor-quality housing
and lack of housing provision.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:04:41"></hs_TimeCode> situation
has been exacerbated by the bedroom tax. There cannot be a single MP on
either side of the House who has not been contacted by constituents who
are suffering directly as a result of the introduction of the bedroom
tax. I shall not comment on the tragic case recently reported in the
media and which was mentioned earlier, but I know of plenty of cases in
my constituency where people’s lives have been turned upside
down by the bedroom tax. It often has a serious effect on their mental
health and sometimes takes away their ability to work, which in turn
affects their ability to feed themselves and their family and to meet
their energy bills. So, too, does the fact that the bedroom tax leads
to people losing benefits, but there was not a word in the
Queen’s Speech to amend a policy that has increasingly been
shown to be
indefensible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:04:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000082">The
housing problem is not just about homes being under-occupied. Many of
us know from our own constituencies about the problems of poor-quality
housing, overcrowded housing and lack of affordable housing. The
Queen’s Speech did not give sufficient priority to addressing
that. Yes, there were policies designed to support the housing market,
some of which will have benefits as regards affordable housing, and I
welcome that. However, the Government still seem desperately keen to
promote a housing boom at the higher end of the market, because houses
worth up to £600,000 will be eligible for their programme.
Again, that is an example of the wrong priorities when the real
priority should have been to tackle poor-quality housing, and not to
force people into the terrible situation in which many find themselves
because of the bedroom
tax<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:05:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000083">Another
area where wider policies have a direct impact on health is employment.
We all know that health and being in a job go together. In many cases,
being unable to work or being in insecure employment is likely
to be extremely damaging to health. I was taken by the comments
of my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:05:36"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Easington (Grahame M. Morris) about workers on
zero-hours contracts in the health service. That is not only bad for
the health service but for the workers whose health may be directly
affected by the insecurity of being in such a
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:05:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000084">No
matter what the official employment figures say, and they are bad
enough, the reality of unemployment, low employment and
under-employment is underestimated. In all our constituencies, people
are working part-time when they do not want to and being forced to take
large wage cuts. We have the spectre of people working on zero-hours
contracts, returning to a day-labourer system where people do not know
from day to day whether they will be in employment. If anyone thinks
that that does not have direct effects on people’s health and
well-being, they are deluding themselves. If we do not tackle these
issues, there will be increasing health problems for many people in our
society. That is why Labour’s job-creation programmes, which we
will discuss in later debates on the Queen’s Speech, are so
important. We also need international action, with a change in
direction to get away from the austerity programmes that are causing so
many problems and so much unhappiness not only in our country but

disappointment in last week’s speech was the lack of reference
to the minimum pricing of alcohol, although there has been some
indication that there may be a change of heart, which we hope
will be the case. Last week I was sent a copy of a study containing
numerous sources, and there are certainly some shocking statistics. Its
findings, among other pertinent points, demonstrate that alcohol is 45%
more affordable today than it was in 1980. Men and women can currently
exceed the recommended low-risk daily drinking guidelines for
£1. That is hard to believe in this day and age, but it is the
truth. Data from Canadian provinces suggest that a 10% increase in the
average minimum price would result in about an 8% reduction in
consumption, a 9% reduction in hospital admissions,
and—this is the big one, Mr Deputy Speaker—a 32%
reduction in deaths caused wholly by alcohol, which is even higher than
the figure suggested in the Government’s impact

Ministers will comment on that, but I sincerely hope it is not the
case. Minimum pricing of alcohol is not to ensure that those on low
incomes cannot have a drink, but to ensure that people of all incomes
are aware how much they are drinking and conscious of the 
<?notus-xml column=456?>health implications of excessive or binge drinking.

take advantage of it.</hs_Para>

there are 1.5 million victims of alcohol-fuelled violence in the United
Kingdom, and it is clear that community safety is threatened by the
misuse of alcohol. Police superintendents have advised that alcohol is
present in half of all crimes committed, and a 1990 study for the Home
Office found that growth in beer consumption was the single most
important factor in explaining the growth in crimes of violence against
the person. The figures are clear. Statistics show that 37% of
offenders had a current problem with alcohol; 37% had a problem with
binge drinking; 47% have misused alcohol in the past; and 32% had
violent behaviour related to their alcohol use. When we mix young
people, who have not had time to develop their moral standards and
ideals, with alcohol, we have a generation who are fuelled by the
desire to live in the moment, with no thought of the consequences.
Alcohol changes personalities, and young people are only learning who
they are. Adding alcohol to the mix means that they will never have a
good understanding of who they are. A minimum price for alcohol will
lessen the number of young people who drink copious amounts of it.
Hopefully, it will also mean a lessening of crimes that are aggravated
or exacerbated by
alcohol.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000127">My

obesity among children. The figures are overwhelming. The United
Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland diabetes strategy ended

want to focus on the measures in the Queen’s Speech on social
care. The current legislation on adult social care is complex and
confusing, and it needs reform. That is why the previous Labour
Government set up the Law Commission review, which has led to many of
the measures in the Care Bill. We support the new rights that the Bill
contains; they build on the rights that Labour introduced in
government, such as the right for family carers to request flexible
working.</hs_Para>

Bill’s passage, we will work to ensure that older and disabled
people and their family carers get the best possible deal. We will seek
to make amendments where there are serious omissions, such as the needs
of young carers, or where improvements should be made, such as
introducing free social care at the end of life. Organisations such as
Sue Ryder and Macmillan Cancer Support have shown that such care can
give people more choice about the place of their deaths and save
taxpayers money by reducing the need for more expensive hospital
care.</hs_Para>

rights, however welcome, risk being meaningless if people cannot get
the services and support they need on the ground. That is the reality
that hundreds of thousands of people now face. The 70 organisations
that make up the Care and Support Alliance are clear 
<?notus-xml column=458?>that the Bill will not solve the crisis now
engulfing social care. They warn that there is now a real danger that
most people—not some, but most—will not get the help they

eligibility criteria for council support mean that fewer older and
disabled people get the help that they desperately need. Let us be
clear. People talk about providing care and support only for people
with substantial needs but not for those with moderate needs, but those
latter needs are serious. I have seen in my constituency that
“substantial needs” involve only people with terminal
illnesses or who are incontinent or blind. There are many other very
high levels of need. We are missing out support for those who
desperately need
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000137">Even
when people do qualify, they routinely face 15-minute home
visits—barely enough time to get an elderly, frail, vulnerable
person with dementia up, washed, dressed and fed. People wait a long
time to get basic help such as grab rails and stairlifts so they are
without the support for basic preventive care that helps people to live
independently at home, which is what they and their families
desperately want. Family carers are left struggling without the breaks
that they need just to keep going or even a bit of emotional support

is not just that older and disabled people and their family carers
suffer; it is that taxpayers end up paying more for the price of
failure. Elderly people have to go into more expensive hospitals or
residential care when they do not need to, because they cannot get the
support they need in the community or at home. One in three family
carers have to give up work or reduce their hours because they cannot
get the help they need to care for their loved ones. Their own health
suffers, which puts more pressure on the NHS, and their income suffers.
The Treasury loses more than £5 billion a year in lost tax
revenues and benefit bills because those family carers have to give up
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000139">The
Government remain in complete denial about the scale of the care crisis
we now face. They have been repeatedly warned by local councils about
what the cuts in budgets and pressures on services mean. Councils are
warning that in 15 years’ time they will not be able to provide
the services that members of the community want and like—the
libraries, leisure services and swimming —because of the
pressures on local council adult social care budgets. The Government
refuse to listen.</hs_Para>

Government are not being straight with people about their future plans
either. The Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister and Health Secretary
have repeatedly said that no one will have to sell their home to pay
for their care. That simply is not the case. In future, all local
authorities will have a duty to offer deferred payment schemes, lending
people money to pay for their residential care. However, the loans will
have to be paid back, after the elderly person has died, by selling the
family home. The Government’s new scheme will charge interest on
the loans, unlike under the current system, so people will lose even
more of their family home than they do now. However, they have not told
the public that they will be paying more, with that interest, under
their new scheme. Will the Minister now come clean and tell families
how much interest they will be charged? Will the Minister tell us 
<?notus-xml column=459?>how much interest families will be charged? Will he give a straight
answer? He is not going to now. I hope he will when he responds to the

also repeatedly claim that the Bill will cap the amount people are
charged for their care at £72,000. The Health Secretary was at
it again when he was at the Dispatch Box today, claiming that the Bill
sets “a finite maximum cost” that individuals will have
to pay. Again, that simply is not the case. The so-called cap on care
costs is based on the standard rate local councils would pay for their
residential care in their area—approximately £480 a week
nationally—and not what people actually pay for their care. The
125,000 people who fund their own care fully, and many more who pay
top-ups, will face far higher bills, particularly in the south and east
of England. Government Members should take heed of that point, because
if they tell their constituents that there will be a finite cap on
their care costs, they will be sorely disappointed. The extra costs,
above and beyond the standard rate that councils pay, will not count
towards the cap. That means that older people will think they have
reached it when they have not. In reality, it will take four years to
hit the cap, yet the average length of stay in a care home is just over
two years, and a quarter of people in care homes die after just a year.
In other words, most people will be dead years before they reach the
cap. Even if they are still alive, the state will pay only the standard
council rate, leaving self-funders no choice other than to either leave
the care home and move somewhere cheaper, or to pick up the extra
costs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T21:37:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051335000142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051335000142">The
Government have failed to explain that people will not get their care
for free if they have income or assets worth up to £123,000, the
new increased upper means-tested limit. They will get care for free
only under the lower means-tested limit, which is not being increased,
and will be £17,500 in 2017. In between, there is a sliding
scale of support. However, the way the means test works will mean that
pensioners on average incomes—those who have worked hard and
saved for a modest second pension of, say, £80 a
week—will not get any council support, even with the increased
upper means-tested limit, because councils calculate it by determining
a notional income based on the capital in people’s homes. That,
combined with the average pensioner income, takes them above the level
at which they would receive council-funded support.</hs_Para>

Members look surprised. That is unsurprising, as their Ministers have
not spelled out the reality of the Government’s plans. Ministers
should be straight about what their plans really mean, so that older
and disabled people and their families can plan for the future
properly. Instead, they tour the TV studios and make statements to this
House giving false reassurances that are simply not borne out by the
facts. We all know that people are fed up with politicians who say one
thing and do another: claiming that people’s care costs will be
capped when they will not, and claiming that raising the means test

their damaging and distracting backroom NHS reorganisation, the

service reforms people desperately need, shifting care out of hospitals
and into the community and more towards prevention. Instead of diluting
Dilnot’s proposals and then misrepresenting them to the public,
they should have engaged in meaningful cross-party talks to agree a
system that helps those on low and modest incomes, not just those
predominantly at the top. And instead of driving greater fragmentation
of NHS care services, jeopardising some of the best examples of
integrated care, such as in Torbay, they should have adopted
Labour’s plans for whole-person care, a single service with a
single budget, funded through a year of care, that would shift the
emphasis out of hospitals and into the community and result in better
care for people and better value for money for taxpayers too.</hs_Para>

way to do that is to try to improve people’s care so that they

together threads from more than a dozen Acts into a single, modern

operational issues arise from the proposals, relating to, for instance,
local, regional and national resilience. I understand that the Fire
Officers Association, the Chief Fire Officers Association and the Fire
Brigades Union have raised them with officials in the Department 
<?notus-xml column=467?>for Communities and Local Government. I shall focus on four specific
concerns. The first is the apparent lack of employee support for the
proposals, and the uneasy lack of public awareness. The second is the
sheer lack of transparency on the part of both the Government and the
fire authority's senior officers. The third is the question of whether
a spun-out brigade would raise additional revenue. If so—as a
caveat—would such a spin-out have an adverse impact on existing
local economy arrangements? Finally, and most importantly, I want to
discuss the real risk that these proposals could lead to the
privatisation of front-line fire services on
Teesside.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051338000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0003.htm#13051338000050">I
am a member of the Co-operative party, and a supporter of co-operatives
and mutuals. I believe that if a mutual is to function effectively, it
will require the support of its members, and that measures should not
be forced on a work force. I am not at all convinced that that would be
the case in Cleveland, given that the proposals appear to be very much
management-driven. The only letters I have received from firefighters
in my constituency about this matter strongly oppose the proposals.
Indeed, at a single meeting attended by more than 250 firefighters,
approximately half the uniformed service in Cleveland, there was
unanimous opposition to them. The FBU, which represents some 85% of
uniformed fire service workers, has identified a total lack of demand
from staff for employee ownership in the fire sector. Instead, there
has been “overt hostility”, except from a
“smattering of principal managers”. Indeed, I doubt
whether there is support even among principal managers, with 40 English
chief fire officers and fire chief executives adding their names to the
CFOA’s pre-consultation response, which highlighted major
concerns with these proposals.</hs_Para>

language used by those promoting the model seems to have been redefined
to address the level of employee support. According to the FBU, the
model was originally promoted as a John Lewis-style, employee-owned
mutual. However, that was only until it became apparent that employees
did not want ownership, and nor would they be afforded shares as per
that model. The title changed to an “employee-led”
mutual, until the vast majority of employees indicated that they did
not support the model, and that the only employees who did were a
select group of senior managers. The latest title employed is a
“locally led” mutual, which in effect acknowledges
employee opposition and in doing so employs the term
“mutual” as a misnomer.</hs_Para>

one senior local manager has indicated that 51% work force support is
the threshold required, although FBU legal advice suggests the fire
authority has the ultimate say. It is difficult even to assess the
extent to which any spun-out fire brigade would in fact be a mutual,
with the authority’s senior officers showing a total disregard
for transparency in these proposals. In the authority’s
meetings, just about everything related to the proposals has been
transacted under “confidential business”, making it
impossible for me, my hon. Friends, the media or the public to
scrutinise them. Although I believe that the authority will be putting
out a business plan to public consultation in due course, I fear it may
be presented as a fait accompli. It is indeed remarkable that the
authority’s officers, prior to spending tens of thousands of
pounds of taxpayers’ money, did not consult stakeholders to
ascertain the appetite for these proposals or involve them in setting
the terms of reference for the creation of any business plan.</hs_Para>

main genuine reasons why some members of the fire authority are even
considering going down this route is their belief that it would
mitigate some of the cuts, due to the spun-out body’s ability to
bid for private contracts. Also, one of the chief fire officer’s
stated aims is job creation. The areas the CFB is exploring are not
related to core FRS activity; indeed, these are services currently
provided by other sectors. The CFB proposals seek to replace these
“others” by providing the same service with their
existing work force, thus removing other workers from employment. That
in no way can be described as job creation; in fact, it is the very
opposite. However, nor do I believe that this would raise any further

Blenkinsop:</Member></B> At the meeting mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T22:09:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stockton South (James Wharton), the main thrust of the chief fire
officer’s argument for seeking a mutual model was to avoid
corporation tax. If that is the sole purpose of pursuing the mutual
model, one has to assume that the mutual is making a profit, but I want
to go into that in more detail.
Spending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T22:10:03"></hs_TimeCode>
£198,000 from the Department of Health’s social
enterprise investment fund, the brigade created an arm’s length
company, the Cleveland Fire Brigade Risk Management 
<?notus-xml column=469?>Services community interest company, to bid for contracts from the
private and public sector, with any profits to be given to the brigade.
However, it operated at a loss of £38,000 in its first year and
has already lost a major telecare contract that it had secured six
months previously. I am no mathematician, and I do not know what the
corporation tax yield would be for the Treasury on a community interest
company running at minus £38,000, but with the CIC struggling to
make a profit as it is, I fail to see how spinning out the brigade
would generate any more contracts or revenue than the current
arrangement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-13T22:10:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051338000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/debtext/130513-0004.htm#13051338000060">The

offering little protection. The authority’s senior officers have
refused to provide my office with information about the procurement
routes it is considering, but none of the “no market”,

are also being considered as part of a wider review generally, in the
case of the fire and rescue sector by Sir Ken Knight, whose report will
be published shortly. However, mutuals are not the only innovative
delivery model that fire and rescue authorities are considering. Some
are exploring other opportunities that deliver benefits for their
communities, while others are looking at closer joint working and

fire and rescue authority, and others of its kind, should be lauded for
exploring pioneering options for delivering its services for the
benefit of its staff and, importantly, the community it serves. It, a

hope that I have responded to all my colleagues’ concerns. We
may not agree on things, but the simple 
<?notus-xml column=476?>fact is that the Cleveland authority has asked us to look at something
and we have said that we will do so. All parties should be working
together to support Cleveland and any other fire and rescue authority

Government believe that those on Housing Benefit in the social rented
sector should face the same choices about where to live as those living
in the private rented sector. That is why we have taken steps to remove
the spare room subsidy in the social rented sector with effect from 1
April 2013, by restricting the amount of Housing Benefit paid to
working age social sector tenants who live in a property that is too
large for their needs. This is not a tax on individuals, but a
reduction in the level of state support for housing costs for those who
under
occupy.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305139000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/petntext/130513p0001.htm#1305139000011">The
Housing Benefit bill must be brought under control. It has increased by
around 50% in real terms over the last decade and in 2011-12
expenditure stood at £23 billion. The Government cannot expect
taxpayers to continue to underwrite people’s housing costs
regardless 
<?notus-xml column=4?>of the size of their accommodation. People receiving Housing Benefit who
wish to remain in accommodation that is larger than their household
requires need to fund part of the cost
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305139000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/petntext/130513p0001.htm#1305139000012">The
Government believe that it is neither affordable nor fair that there
are approaching 1 million extra rooms being paid for by Housing Benefit
at a time when almost quarter of a million people are living in
overcrowded accommodation and there are almost 2 million on social
housing waiting lists in England alone. Over time the removal of the
spare room subsidy will encourage more effective use of social housing
stock and a more strategic approach in both the allocation of property
and, in the longer term, building programmes, ensuring more
appropriately sized accommodation for demand. It is in the interests of
both social landlords and tenants to ensure a better match between
housing need and the size of accommodation
provided.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305139000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/petntext/130513p0001.htm#1305139000013">This
measure is not about forcing people to move. We expect many households
will choose to remain where they are and will find a way of making up
the shortfall, in the same way that those living in properties that are
too large in the private rented sector do. We do not yet know what
decisions claimants affected by the removal of the spare room subsidy
will make. Some may decide to move into work, some may move to smaller
accommodation and others may make up any shortfall from their existing
income or

Government have already trebled funding for Discretionary Housing
Payments and from 2013-14 has added a further £25 million
specifically aimed at disabled people living in significantly adapted
accommodation. We believe this approach offers a more flexible and cost
effective approach and will enable local authorities to provide
additional support such as allowing extra time for those affected to
find suitable alternative accommodation as well as providing longer

significantly adapted
accommodation.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305139000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/petntext/130513p0001.htm#1305139000015">The

have worked with the Chartered Institute of Housing who have produced
an online guide for social sector landlords “Making it
Fit—a guide to preparing for the social sector size

tenants who are affected by this measure and to develop a strategic and
operational approach tailored to their area. This includes a section on
supporting tenants to pay their rent. It is clearly in the interests of
landlords to do all they can to support those tenants who are finding
it difficult to adjust financially and to ensure they are fully aware
of all the financial options available to them. We believe that
proactive work by landlords, together with the support which the
Government have provided via Discretionary Housing Payments, will
ensure that most tenants affected, and particularly the most

homelessness.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305139000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/petntext/130513p0001.htm#1305139000017">The

Mechanism (NRM) for human trafficking victims now that the operational
functions of the former UK Border Agency have transferred into the core
Home Office. UK Visas and Immigration and Immigration Enforcement will
be Competent Authorities alongside the UK Human Trafficking Centre
(UKHTC) and their staff will consider referrals on potential victims of
trafficking just as they did in the former UK Border Agency. To enhance
this process the Home Office is piloting an NRM Hub which will provide
a centre of expertise in making NRM decisions.</hs_Para>

Train and track maintenance vehicles), Network Rail Infrastructure
Limited (the network operator) is prohibited under its licence from
having interests in train operations or engaging in activities outside
network management except in so far as the ORR consents. Network Rail
would also need to comply with EU law requirements for independence
between the infrastructure manager and train operators, for example, in
relation to the infrastructure manager's charging functions and its

matter for the incumbent franchise operators, as employers. The move
from existing franchise agreements to directly awarded contracts for an
extended term will not, in and of itself, affect employees' rights or
contracts of employment, nor will this involve a transfer of staff to a
new employer. If negotiations with any incumbent operator were not to
succeed, Directly Operated Railways 
<?notus-xml column=16?>may need to step in and operate services—if this were to happen
there would be a TUPE transfer of employees on their current terms and

the purchase of renewable energy from independent generators after the

Climate Change, the right hon. Member for Kingston and Surbiton (Mr

Government's view is that Contracts for Difference (CfDs) will open up
new opportunities for independent generation developers and will
support the development of a more competitive market for power purchase
agreements. Government is working closely with industry to smooth the
transition to the new regime, and has included powers in the Energy
Bill to give it the flexibility to act to improve the route to market
for independents if it becomes necessary. Government is also
considering whether there is a case for further action to ensure that
the market, including independent generators, is ready for the
CfD.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13051334000046" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/text/130513w0001.htm#13051334000046">Warm

Greening:</Member></B> Simply making good quality health services
available will not ensure that the right services are used by the right
people at the right time. Wider barriers also limit access to and
utilisation of health care, especially social and cultural factors such
as low and unequal status of women and girls, child marriage, lack of
or inappropriate information, lack of community/social support for
specific forms of health care, and harmful traditional practices. This
is especially the case for minority groups, including indigenous
populations. Understanding health-related behaviours and wider social
practices and norms is a critical step towards empowering people to use
health services and make healthy choices. Our health programmes aim to
help countries develop and implement purposeful policies that target
specific, underserved groups, improve the overall efficiency of the
health system, and meet the needs of all people in
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051334000517" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/text/130513w0001.htm#13051334000517">DFID

operate a facility in accordance with their permit at any time. In
assessing operator competence, the Environment Agency may refuse the

campaigns to raise awareness of the symptoms of cancer and to encourage

practitioner access to diagnostic tests; and more testing and treatment
in secondary care. To support earlier diagnosis of asymptomatic cancer,
breast and bowel screening programmes are being

Lamb:</Member></B> Information about the annual cost to the national
health service of providing religious and spiritual care is not held
centrally. Following the Chief Nursing Officer's review of chaplaincy
services in 2003-04, the Department provided direct annual grants to
support the work of national chaplaincy and spiritual care
organisations. Information on the amounts of grants paid and the
beneficiary organisations in each of the last four years is shown in
the table. Similar information covering the period from 2005 to 2009 is
not available centrally. It is important to note that these figures
relate to grants allocated centrally by the Department and not the
total spend on such services, which will be significantly
higher.</hs_Para><TableWrapper Columns="2" Size="7"><table tabstyle="foots"><tgroup cols="5"><colspec colname="1" colwidth="47*"></colspec><colspec colname="2" colwidth="21*"></colspec><colspec colname="3" colwidth="21*"></colspec><colspec colname="4" colwidth="21*"></colspec><colspec colname="5" colwidth="21*"></colspec><thead><row><entry nameend="5" namest="1" rowsep="0"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right"><I>£</I></hs_TableHeading></entry></row><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"></entry><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right"><I>2012-13</I></hs_TableHeading></entry><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right"><I>2011-12</I></hs_TableHeading></entry><entry colsep="0" rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right"><I>2010-11</I></hs_TableHeading></entry><entry rowsep="2"><hs_TableHeading Justify="right"><I>2009-10</I></hs_TableHeading></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry colsep="0" rowsep="0"><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="1305143000321" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/text/130513w0002.htm#1305143000321">Multi-Faith

short time scale (typically less than a month). However, if further

forces is 16, which reflects the normal minimum school leaving age. The
parents of all recruits aged under 18 years are involved from the
outset and throughout the recruiting and training process; parental
consent must be specifically obtained before an under 18 can undertake
any assessment or selection activity and then again before he/she
enlists.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051412001027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130513/text/130513w0004.htm#13051412001027">In
an increasingly competitive employment market, the UK will continue to
recruit from the widest available talent pool from the age of 16 in
order to sustain the required manning levels for its armed forces.
However, we are very aware of the differing needs of every age group
and we go to great lengths to ensure that their specific needs are met.
The armed forces recognise and value individuals from diverse
backgrounds who bring fresh ideas, knowledge, experience and
talent.</hs_Para>

feasible measures to ensure that members of its armed forces who have
