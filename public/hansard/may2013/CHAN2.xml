The next time the Government cannot find their Education Minister and
have to bring business questions forward, I wonder whether they might
like to give us a little more notice—I am still catching my
breath. I also thank him for advance sight of the written ministerial
statement he tabled today confirming the Bills announced yesterday. I
am sure that you, Mr Speaker, will be as concerned as I am
that while he provided Members with one page of information, the
Downing street spin machine provided the press with 93 pages of 
<?notus-xml column=128?>detail on the same Bills. Will he confirm that he will arrange for a
copy of that briefing to be placed in the House of Commons Library
immediately and that in future he will ensure that Members of this

suspect that last week’s local elections had a more profound
impact on the Queen’s Speech than the Leader of the House can
let on. They were a disaster across the English shires for the
Conservatives, as Labour won in many southern marginals and hordes of
true blue voters flocked to the UK Independence party. I followed with
interest the Conservative implosion in the Leader of the House’s
own backyard of Cambridgeshire, where the Conservatives lost control of
the council for the first time in more than 15 years. The Conservative
leader of the council even managed to lose his seat—and to a
Liberal Democrat. I hope that the Leader of the House has congratulated
his deputy, the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T09:37:44"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Carshalton and Wallington (Tom Brake), on that
success for the Liberal Democrats on his home turf. It is hard to
imagine, but the Leader of the House did better in the elections than
the Prime
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T09:37:59"></hs_TimeCode>, who

for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg) is calling for a big, open

party that cannot even hold on to the Tory shires and whose Members are
starting to behave like headless chickens. They are so bad at listening
to their own members that this week one of them resorted to taking out
a full page advertisement in <I>The Times</I> to tell them how out of

for fixed five-year Parliaments but that they have run out of ideas

again, all we get is a thin, cobbled-together legislative programme
that is completely lacking in ambition. Our last Session saw
parliamentary time unfilled, badly drafted, badly managed Bills, and a

shadow Leader of the House should not trespass on to trying to
interpret last Thursday’s local election results, especially
those in South Cambridgeshire. I know about mid-terms; I ran the

trounced everybody in sight. Labour Members might like to remember that

decision has been made in response to the consultation on that. I think
that the hon. Lady will recall that the nature of the Queen’s
Speech is to put forward proposals for legislation where the Government
have decided what their policy is, not to venture into legislation
where no policy decision has taken place. It is completely false to 
<?notus-xml column=130?>imagine that there was ever a question of including reference to

I said, I have looked at the hon. Lady’s alternative
Queen’s Speech. In contrast with ours, there seem to be just six
Bills, one of which is a finance Bill. It refers to a consumer’s
Bill. There is a draft consumer rights Bill in our proposals. She has a
proposal for a jobs Bill. I do not know quite what that means, because
I have never yet found out how Labour Members can propose policies that
would destroy jobs while guaranteeing people jobs. Where are these jobs
supposed to come from? Jobs come from wealth-creating businesses, and
that is what this coalition Government have been able to achieve in the
past year, with some 500,000 additional jobs. Since the election, 1.2
million extra jobs have been created in the private sector. That is

hon. Lady’s shadow Queen’s Speech refers to a banking

party’s shadow Queen’s Speech also refers to an
immigration Bill. Such a Bill is the centrepiece of our legislative
programme, but the Labour party’s version would not impact on
net migration numbers at all. It might be reasonable to make sure that
migrant workers are not abused, but that is not the issue; the issue is
to ensure that we encourage those people who can contribute to this
economy, while also ensuring that we are not subject to abuse by those

assets of community value to be listed have already proved useful in
saving valued community services such as village shops and public
houses from closure. He may, however, share my concern that some of the
major public house operators—known as pubcos—are seeking
to circumvent the proposals by selling pubs through private contracts
with commercial developers without the sale ever being advertised and,
therefore, without the community having any notice of what is happening
until the pub closes overnight and an application to demolish the
premises, often on specious grounds of security costs, is made the next
day. This has happened in my constituency, where Enterprise Inns
surreptitiously sold the Porcupine public house to Lidl. Will the

recall a GP speaking to me—forgive me, Mr Speaker, if I tell a

when they were leaving and say, “Shall I talk to the
receptionist about payment?” She had to say, “There is no
payment.” They looked at her as if we were mad because at home
they would have paid and they had insurance and were willing to pay.
However, because of the structure of the legislation, the national
health service said, “You are ordinarily resident here so it is
free. End of story.” That is absurd. The students did not expect
it and we should not have got into that position. We need to deal with
that. The issue is not always abuse. This is a system that should be

rates in this country have been too high for too long. Last year,
around 600,000 crimes were committed by people who had broken the law
before. Almost half the number of offenders released from our prisons
offend again within a year. That goes up to a staggering 58% for the
group with the most prolific reoffending rates: those sentenced to
prison terms of less than 12 months. This depressing merry-go-round of
crime has a dreadful impact on the lives of law-abiding, hard-working
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000055"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:45:21"></hs_TimeCode>Reoffending
has a devastating impact on the victims of crime, but it is also
terrible value for the taxpayer. We spend more than £4 billion a
year on prisons and probation, and despite significant increases in
spending under the previous Government, overall reoffending rates have
barely changed over the last decade and are now rising again. The
status quo cannot continue; we cannot go on doing the same things,
seeing the same faces come back through the system time and again, just
hoping to get a different outcome. This has got to
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:46:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000056">Those
who break the law need to be punished. In yesterday's Queen's Speech,
we set out how we are going to clamp down on those who persist in the
low-level crime that blights our communities, and for serious offenders
it is absolutely right that they get a custodial sentence. I want to
ensure that they are punished, and I want to send the strongest
possible signal that offenders will not get away with their crimes.
However, I also want to see them get their lives back on track, and
that requires a thorough and thoughtful approach. Such offenders have a
host of complex problems—a shocking number of them will have
been through the care system, and many have come from broken homes and
are addicted to drugs and alcohol. At the moment, prisoners serving
sentences of less than 12 months are simply released on to the streets
with £46 in their pockets and little
else<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:46:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000057">In
the coalition agreement, the Government promised to bring about a
rehabilitation revolution to tackle the unacceptable cycle of
reoffending. Today I am publishing our "Transforming Rehabilitation: A
Strategy for Reform" which sets out concrete plans to extend and
enhance rehabilitation both in custody and in the
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:47:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000058">Probably
the biggest failing of the current system is that those with the
highest reoffending rates get the least rehabilitation. Our plans put
that right. Today we are introducing legislation so that, for the first
time in recent history, every offender released from custody will
receive at least a year of supervision and rehabilitation in the
community. The Bill will extend statutory rehabilitation to all 50,000
of the most prolific reoffenders—those sentenced to under 12
months in custody. By guaranteeing this support in law, we ensure that
probation providers are working with those who are hardest to reach and
most likely to
reoffend<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:47:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000059">However,
it is not enough just to ensure that everyone who needs rehabilitation
gets it. We heard during the consultation that there is often a
disconnect between 
<?notus-xml column=150?>what happens in prisons, and what happens on the outside. Too many
offenders are falling through that gap. Therefore, in addition to
extending rehabilitation to more offenders, we will create a genuine
through-the-gate service. That has been paid lip-service in the past,
so this time we will do it differently. I have ordered the wholesale
realignment of our prison estate to designate new resettlement prisons,
where the same providers who will be working with offenders in the
community will work with them for three months before release too.
Combined with the reforms to the prison regime that we announced last
month to incentivise engagement in rehabilitation, this is a
significant change. We are, for the first time, creating real
continuity between custody and community, bridging the gap which right
now just leads many offenders back to a life of
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:49:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000060">Our
reforms will also open up rehabilitation services to a diverse range of
new providers, ensuring that we bring together the best of the public,
voluntary and private sectors, at local as well as at national level.
These providers will have the freedom to innovate and to focus on
turning around the lives of offenders. Our plans will also use
competition to drive greater efficiency, which is vital to free up the
resources we need so that we can extend rehabilitation to a wider group
of
offenders.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000061">A
cornerstone of our reforms is payment by results, which will focus
providers relentlessly on rehabilitating offenders and actually driving
reoffending down. We will give those providers the flexibility to do
what works and free them from Whitehall bureaucracy, but the deal will
be that they get paid in full only for real reductions in reoffending
and crime.</hs_Para>

cycle of crime will mean fewer victims in the long term, but we cannot
and will not forget our primary responsibility for public safety.
Therefore, we are creating a new national probation service, working to
protect the public and building on the expertise and professionalism
that are already in place. Probation staff make a vital contribution to
protecting the public from the most dangerous offenders and will
continue to do so. Under the new system, every offender who poses a
high risk of serious harm to the public will be managed by the public
sector probation service. We also know that risk levels can change,
which is why the public sector will have the right to review cases
where risk is more volatile or where circumstances have
changed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000063">We
cannot just carry on with the status quo and hope that things improve.
These reforms may be challenging, but they are essential none the less.
They are part of a radical programme of reform across the whole justice
system, making it ready to meet the challenges of the future, reforming
offenders, delivering value for the taxpayer and protecting victims and
communities. My aim is to deliver year-on-year reductions in
reoffending.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0001.htm#13050918000064">That
would be the right thing to do at any time, but at a time of tough
financial constraints it becomes even more important. We need to ensure
that the taxpayers’ money we spend on rehabilitating offenders
actually makes a difference. The plans we are publishing today will
ensure that all those sentenced to prison or community sentences are
properly punished but that they also get the support they need to turn
their backs on crime for good. Transforming rehabilitation will mean
lower crime, fewer victims and safer communities. I commend this
statement to the House.</hs_Para>

best ways to cut crime, the number of victims and the cost of our

rates are too high. We started to reduce them when we were in
government—especially the rate of youth offending, which breaks
the cycle of reoffending at an early point—but much more needs
to be done. This is an ambitious programme. Unfortunately, it is based
on fewer resources, on untried and untested methods and on putting

extra 45,000 offenders on the Secretary of State’s figures. Can
he explain to the House whether that is an uncosted demand for more
resource or whether existing moneys will be spread much more thinly to
deliver it? Resettlement prisons, as he said, represent a major
restructuring of the prison system. What is the cost of that
restructuring and what additional resources will go into preparing
offenders for release? He knows that the prison estate is still
chronically overcrowded and understaffed, so does he seriously think
that a reorganisation can take place against such a backdrop? In London
there is a major shortage of prison places, which means that offenders
from London often end up housed hundreds of miles away from home and
family, so how is resettlement to work here?</hs_Para>

release, even those who have served the shortest sentences are promised
a year’s supervision and support with addiction, housing and
employment. Who will pay for that at a time when drug treatment centres
are closing? Housing is perhaps the most expensive item for newly
released prisoners. On the “Today” programme, the
Secretary of State speculated that housing associations would help out,
so during the worst housing shortage for a generation are ex-offenders
to get priority for social housing?</hs_Para>

almost 10% so far and those cuts will continue. The service, which
received an award for excellence two years ago, is by definition not to
blame for rising reoffending by short-sentence prisoners, because they
are currently unsupervised. However, it is not probation officers who
will now undertake 70% of the supervision. The Justice Secretary places
a great deal of faith in reformed old lags helping out, but he admitted

reality, it is the Secretary of State’s old friends Serco, G4S

who gave us the

Olympics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:55:17"></hs_TimeCode>. Now he
is to impose his untested and untried payment-by-results methods on
probation. Perhaps most seriously, a dangerous chasm will open up
between public and private providers on the basis of an
offender’s risk level, taking no account of the fact that in 25%
of all cases offenders move between risk levels. Therefore, contrary to
his assurance, private firms will be in charge of the most serious
criminals, and we genuinely fear that that will put the public at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:55:44"></hs_TimeCode>. Failures
in delivering probation services even to medium-risk offenders will

offences and gang activity will walk our streets unsupervised.
Regardless<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T10:59:27"></hs_TimeCode> of
whether private sector providers deliver, they will still get paid at

Thanks to the work done by the Select Committee, we know that probation
officers spend only about a quarter of their time at work on
supervising offenders, while about 40% of their time is spent on
providing support services. Are the Opposition really saying that it is
not possible to run that system more efficiently and deliver support
where it is needed to the offenders who are most likely to reoffend

otherwise there will be more victims of crime. One thing I expect to

organisations and housing organisations to deliver better support for
offenders. I want closer ties between Jobcentre Plus, Work programme

the Member for Kingston upon Hull East (Karl Turner) on the perceived
lack of engagement with those in the legal profession on some of the
proposals, particularly those relating to criminal legal aid? They do
feel that they are not being listened to. Given that payment by results
is at the cornerstone of the proposals, if the Secretary of State
cannot say now whether it will be 25% up front and 75% payment by
results—or 50:50, 75:25 or 90:10—will he indicate when he
can outline the proposals with more clarity? A number of excellent
third sector providers will want to engage with this process and they
need to have that information sooner rather than

prison they will be met at the gate by an organisation that will take
immediate care over their lives. Thirdly, Members will see in the

Secretary of State for the Home Department (Mrs
Theresa May):</Member></B> The Gracious Speech we heard
yesterday put forward a comprehensive legislative programme. Underlying
it is a basic principle: this Government want to ensure that people who
work hard and want to get on in life are able to do so. We believe that
it is part of the Government’s role to help people who want to
work hard to succeed. We want to ensure that those who do the right
thing do not find themselves penalised for their honesty and their
commitment to playing fair. The corollary of that is that those who
cheat the system and who do not play by the rules should be prevented
from being able to take advantage, at the expense of the decent and
hard-working majority.</hs_Para>

is this more true than in the immigration
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:32:41"></hs_TimeCode>. We are
going to make the UK a harder place to live for an immigrant who has
not played by the rules—who has dishonestly overstayed their
visa, for example, or who does not have one at all—or who has
committed a serious crime. The immigration Bill referred to in the
Gracious Speech will do three things. First, it will diminish the pull
factors that make migrants want to come to Britain to take but not to
contribute. Secondly, it will make Britain a harder place to live for
those who have no right to be here. Thirdly, it will make it easier to
remove foreign nationals who have committed serious crimes and who
should be deported. It will streamline the appeals system, making it
much less slow and cumbersome, and give fewer opportunities for using
the Human Rights Act 1998 to avoid
deportation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:33:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050918000182"><Member ContinuationText="Helen Goodman" PimsId="4779" UID="13050918000521" xid="805" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050918000521"><B>Helen

deportation. That is exactly why this Government are bringing forward

of the most fundamental injustices of the present system is one that
many Members will be aware of from the complaints of their
constituents. It is the extent to which immigrants can call on publicly

Our system is one of universal provision, and it will remain so under
this Government, but it is also one that requires some contribution to
be made in order for that provision to be accessed. That is the basic
principle of justice that underpins the system, but it is a principle
that has been flouted. When the Bill becomes law, it will be
respected.</hs_Para>

legislation that penalises businesses that employ illegal immigrants.

should be able to take jobs that ought to be filled by people who are

Bill aims to diminish the extent to which honest and hard-working
people are preyed on by criminals and by bullies who show no regard for

First, it will make it easier for citizens to get the police or local
authorities to take action against people whose antisocial behaviour
disrupts their lives. Secondly, it includes measures to ensure that we
can tackle organised crime more effectively. In particular, we are

Bill also contains a provision to make forcing a person to marry a
criminal offence. Forced marriage is a serious problem in some
communities in Britain today. It is an abomination: it is totally
incompatible with the values of a free society that anyone should be
forced into a marriage. Astonishingly, however, forcing a person into
marriage is not a crime under our law. This Bill will remedy that
situation, and in doing so, it will signal very clearly that this
country does not tolerate the forcing of one person by another into
marriage. The Bill will also 
<?notus-xml column=169?>make easier the prosecution of people who attempt it. Prosecutors will

is sufficient to be able to cover the issues that cannot be covered at

having the dog licence that was held in the past?” Not only is
that quite difficult to administer, but, unfortunately, all too often
the owners of dogs we will need to be concerned about do not bother to
get a dog licence, whereas the law-abiding citizens do. Giving the
police extra powers to deal with dangerous dogs so that they can deal
with them in all situations, even within the private home where the dog
normally resides, gives the important extension of powers to the police
that will enable them to deal with dangerous dogs wherever they may be

A policy that targets net migration means that the Government can claim
to have made huge progress on the things that the British people care
about when they are failing to tackle exploitation in the labour market
and failing to tackle illegal immigration, which is not even measured
in the net migration statistics. Illegal immigration can go on getting
worse and worse, yet the Immigration Minister can make more and more
claims about his target, and the result is that he is not listening to

illegal

that the criminal justice system is a process, not an event. Our
prisons are part of that process and, for all but the very few
prisoners who will live out their lives in custody, they are places of
temporary accommodation into which and from which the
“community”, “society”, the
“outside”—call it what we will—sends and
takes them back. For most of those who are sentenced to prison, custody
is not the end of the journey but a part of it.</hs_Para>

for many of us—those of us on the outside—who have no
experience of the criminal justice system and who have never been into
a prison or met anyone who has been sentenced to a term of custody,
prison is society’s final answer. That is wrong: prison is
itself a process within the wider process of the criminal 
<?notus-xml column=180?>justice system. It cannot be isolated in a silo from the other parts
of the criminal justice system, such as the police,
the courts, the probation service, the drug and alcohol abuse

they can return whence they came as different and better people, ready

free from drug use, better qualified, earning a living, paying their
way and going straight. That is no doubt the unattainable ideal to be
placed beside the hope of the crime-free society, but just because we
cannot have total success does not mean that we should not strive to do
better than we are doing now. I therefore look forward to seeing the

simply ignored, the needs and rights of others. In failing in so many
ways he has caused incalculable damage to those most close to him and
to his immediate and more distant victims. But in sending him to prison

risk, but it is not an irresponsible risk. The outcome that we are
looking for is rehabilitation. The probation service should not simply
be an employment system; it should be a system more widely looked at
that takes prisoners and rehabilitates them so that they can re-engage
in society. If the Government’s proposals work—this is
not a new idea; the Conservative party has been thinking about it for
many years—they should be welcomed. Of course there will be
doubt from the trade unions and from the Labour party, which are more
state-centric organisations than we are, but for goodness’ sake
let us give it a try. The current system is not working. If the

At present, private landlords in Slough habitually say that they do not
want tenants on housing benefit, but in my view that is discriminatory:
it discriminates against disabled people, who are substantially more
likely than anybody else to depend on housing benefit. Lawyers have
told me that it would be impossible to bring a case of disability
discrimination, partly because landlords are not big institutions and
because of the costs involved. If we increase the number of people whom
landlords have a duty to discriminate against, we will create a society

A huge number of reputable lawyers do a fantastic job, but all of us

of what we need to do can be achieved without legislation. Some areas,
however, need legislation and I look forward to proposals in the
immigration Bill, which I hope will contain good provisions and send
the signal that we can do the right thing. I know the Minister for
Policing and Justice agreed with this when he was Immigration Minister,
but there are, for example, specific issues about the status of
children born outside the UK to unmarried British fathers before 2006,
and to married British mothers before 1983. These are slightly odd
cases because those people are not entitled to citizenship, although
they are if they were born to unmarried British fathers after 2006, or
earlier in the case of the mother. I hope that anomaly—I think
that was the word the Minister used—will now be corrected. I
also hope that a number of other proposals will be 
<?notus-xml column=189?>included in the legislation.

idea of landlords and employers having a role is interesting. For
employers the issue is clear, but we need stronger controls on those
who knowingly hire people who are not allowed to work. We also need a
system that makes it easier for employers. I have seen cases where the
UK Border Agency has given employers unhelpful or inaccurate
information about people’s right to work. Employers cannot be
expected to understand all the details of the system—I do not
think any hon. Member in the Chamber would claim to understand every
nuance of it, although I am prepared to be corrected—and we must
have a simple, clear system. If landlords are also to have such a
responsibility, they too need such a system. I do not mind if a
landlord has to enter a passport number and name on a computer and gets
an answer—I can live with that—but if they all are

that simply will not happen. I look forward to seeing how the system

Bills will go through such scrutiny, and that future Governments will
follow the advice, which is useful to ensure good, rather than rushed,
decisions. We must deal with antisocial behaviour, which is a blight on
many communities. I do not think that antisocial behaviour orders
worked; they felt slow, bureaucratic, ineffective, and we know that
many young people treated them almost as a badge of honour. A huge
proportion—more than half, I think—were breached. The
system simply did not work and was part of an effort to sound tough on
antisocial behaviour. I hope that the proposals in the Anti-social
Behaviour Bill will work, and I will be disappointed if it turns out
that they are just another example of people trying to sound tough.

be more effective and produce more effective community

done only as a very last resort, particularly now that so much
information is available on line. The record of a 14-year-old who is
publicly named online will be available when they are 18, 24, 34 or 44,
and we run the risk of stigmatising for ever young people—who
made errors and should not have done what they did—in a way that
would not have happened 20 or 30 years ago. That was discussed by the
Home Affairs Committee during pre-legislative scrutiny, and I am
pleased at the Government’s indication that such a measure
should be used only as a last resort. I hope the Minister will clarify
that although one section of the law on naming is being disapplied,
clear guidance will be given that that should be done only
rarely.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000335" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050918000335"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>I
was happy about the criminalisation of forced marriage, which strikes
me as absolutely right and was recommended by the Home Affairs
Committee, as well as the work  on dangerous dogs. In 2011,
there were 6,500 hospital 
<?notus-xml column=190?>admissions in England for dog bites and attacks, not counting those who
were treated in A and E and sent home, or the many
leaflet deliverers and canvassers who received just a small bite. The
new measures will encourage responsible dog ownership, and I am
particularly pleased to see the category covering attacks on guide
dogs. I spent time with Guide Dogs for the Blind, and I was led
blindfolded around my constituency by a guide dog, which was an amazing
experience that I recommend to all Members—I see some have had
the same experience. There have been a huge number of attacks on guide
dogs, which are particularly damaging because of the effect on the
person involved and because guide dogs are trained to look after their
owner, not turn and fight off the other dog. There are awful cases of a
guide dog leading its owner away while being savaged and either killed
or seriously harmed, and I am therefore pleased to see protection for
assistance dogs included under clause 98, meaning that an attack on a
guide dog will count similarly to that on a person.</hs_Para>

less than 12 months, and many of those will reoffend. The situation is
even worse for women offenders, huge numbers of whom are jailed for
reoffending. Frankly, there are questions about how many women

being tough on crime but about stopping crimes from happening, and that

managers are like. Regional account managers do not always meet their
response target of 10 working days. Responses are often holding
responses even when they come through. Sometimes, no response at all is
received. Rarest of all is a conclusion to a
case.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050918000358">I
raised that problem with the MPs’ inquiry office. I was advised
that Helen McIntosh, who was formerly in charge of that service, had
been moved to other work. At that point, a rota of staff managed the
service. It is a constant problem that staff are rotated and moved to
other duties, leaving half-finished cases to be picked up again only
when the MP chases up the inquiry. In one legacy case last year, we
were given repeated assurances over a period of several years that the
case would be concluded within deadline after deadline, all of which
were not met. Finally, I had a personal commitment from Mark McEvoy to
resolve the case by a certain date. When he did not do so I requested a
meeting with him. Before that could be arranged, however, I was advised
that he had been moved on to other responsibilities.</hs_Para>

me turn to support for family life, something on which the Government

been granted limited leave to remain for 30 months on a 120-month

domestic violence will have to renew her application every 36 months

10 years, she can work but not claim any of the following

want to honour your commitment to letting us move on, Mr Deputy
Speaker, so I will stop talking about immigration and move on to the
final aspect of the Queen’s Speech that it would be remiss of me
not to address: the parts of the speech that were not there. There was
talk of the Energy Bill, a carry-over Bill that needs to be finished
off. The reference to infrastructure in the Queen’s Speech is
clearly part of that. The draft Bill was published and we complained
that it contained no energy efficiency measures. We were told they
would be in the Bill. The Bill was published. It contained no energy
efficiency measures and we were told that they would be introduced in
Committee. In Committee, there were still no energy efficiency
measures. We were told that they would be introduced later in
Committee. By the end of the Committee stage we were told that they
would come later still. I hope that they will appear later, on Report.
I fear that they will appear later in the House of Lords, and that
Members will have no opportunity to scrutinise the key, essential

efficiency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:13:40"></hs_TimeCode>. It

Government have made a classic mistake when it comes to energy policy.
They have looked at energy policy in the way that a phlebotomist looks
at an organism, concerned only with the blood supply. Energy is the
blood supply that keeps an economy working, but they should look at it
like a general practitioner would, by looking that the health of the
whole organism. The Government have singularly failed to do that. It is
essential that we see our energy policy as part of our economic policy
and industrial strategy. That is why the Government have failed to
introduce proposals for the second phase of carbon capture and storage.
That is why their legislation to ensure that no decarbonisation target
for 2030 can be brought into law before at least 2016, and maybe not
after that, is a catastrophic failure. It fails to ensure that the
relevant investment in low-carbon generation is incentivised. That is
locking us, as the Chancellor would have it, into high carbon, fossil
fuel growth well into the future. It is ensuring that our industry, and
the jobs and growth dependent on it, is not being invested in at the
moment.</hs_Para>

However, I hope that the thoughts, feelings and concerns of my
constituents will be taken into account in the new consultation on
compensation. I urge those on the Front Bench to consider seriously the
merits of a property bond. The high-speed link will be a very long time
in coming. Unfortunately, too many of my constituents are trapped in
their homes and unable to move. It is not that their house prices have
dropped in value—they cannot sell at any price. The advantage of
a property bond, whereby the Government underwrite any loss once the
line is built, is that it would enable them to get on with their normal
lives in the interim. I therefore urge the Government to consider this
option seriously.</hs_Para>

Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill is vital. It is all
about the quality of life of our voters in this great country. It is
true to say that antisocial behaviour utterly destroys quality of life,
whether it is violence, bullying, littering or dangerous dogs. All too
often, antisocial behaviour is carried out by kids who have had the
worst start in life. I have spoken many times on this subject in this
Chamber. If we really want to solve antisocial behaviour we have to
focus on the earliest years. In all of our rehabilitation and youth
policies, we need to focus on getting the very youngest a good start in
life, as this will mean that they do not join the conveyor belt to
antisocial behaviour and crime. We need a revolution in
support of the perinatal period. We need to work far earlier with those
who are pregnant to help them deal with poor maternal mental health
and, later, problems relating to poor attachment with their
babies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:22:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050918000368" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050918000368">As
I have said before in the Chamber, all of a baby’s brain
development takes place in the first two years of life. In the first
year, it builds 1 million neural connections per second, while its
entire lifelong emotional resilience—its ability to deal with
the things that life throws at us—is largely determined by the
age of two. Anything we do later to rehabilitate offenders—for
instance, to sort out speech and learning difficulties, attention
deficit hyperactivity disorder or any of the problems that lead young
people into a life of antisocial behaviour and crime—would be
much better done through prevention policies in the earliest years. I
urge again the Front-Bench team to work closely with the Department of

want to talk briefly about the immigration reform Bill. The Opposition
caused these problems. It was undoubtedly their failure to put in place
proper transitional controls that caused the heartache, the sense of
injustice and the resentment against immigration that we see today. I
agree with hon. Members who have said that immigration has been good
for this country. I absolutely accept that point. EU immigration has
been good for this country, but it has gone too far, too fast, without
any controls and, specifically, without a close focus on fairness for
the existing population as against fairness for those who would join
this country.

who wanted to talk about the problems of uncontrolled immigration was
somehow racist. I have just said that immigration has been of huge

will now address that fairness aspect, which is where I think the Bill
is incredibly important. It should ensure that those who have paid into
the system benefit more than those who have not. This is not just a
problem that concerns Britain; it also concerns Germany. The Fresh
Start project, of which I am a founding member, recently went to Berlin
to talk to German politicians and businesses. They feel that
immigration has benefited the German economy, but that the fact that
people can migrate there for the sole purpose of claiming benefits is
simply unfair and generates resentment.</hs_Para>

assessed what happens on the continent. Many countries, including
Germany and the Nordic countries, have a far more Bismarckian system of
benefits payments, which means that if someone who has paid into the
system for years loses their job, they can, for a period, generate half
of their previous income while they get themselves back on their feet.
The system in the UK is very different.</hs_Para>

Goodman:</Member></B> The hon. Lady exaggerates her point about what
she calls benefit tourism, but to say that she has got it out of
perspective is not to say that there are not significant economic
incentives for people to come to this country. Surely, immigration has
more likely been fed by the fact that if someone comes here and works
hard for, say, three years and saves up £3,000, they have enough
to put down a deposit on a house in an eastern European country, but
not here. The disparity in exchange rates means that the incentives are

I would like to deal with an excellent Bill introduced in the last

system. Recent scandals such as LIBOR rigging and swaps mis-selling

I know that the Government have made great efforts, as has
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:26:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

my opinion, however, another reform is long overdue. We need to spark a
revolution in bank competition to facilitate the widest range and type
of new financial services entrants and to force the big oligopoly banks
to reprioritise excellence in customer service. That revolution is bank
account number portability, which would make it possible for us all to
switch banks instantly, taking our bank account numbers with us, and
would remove the need to fill out endless new forms and re-establish
new standing orders and regular payment instructions.</hs_Para>

account portability would have four key advantages. First, it would
lead to a revolution in competition and bring in new entrants. At the
moment, 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises and personal current
accounts are banked with the big four oligopoly banks, so new
competition—new entrants—is essential.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly, it
would spark a revolution in customer service and product innovation in
the payments sector. Thirdly, it would impose a significant reduction
in fraud resulting from systems failures due to the out-of-date legacy
systems in the oligopoly banks. I ran an investment banks team during
the ’90s when there was a massive merger of banks, broker
dealers and funds managers. Each of the oligopoly banks has up to 20
legacy systems. It is unbelievable. The recent failures of RBS-NatWest
systems to make even simple payments highlighted that these systems are

a means of resolution is terribly important in banking. If we have
another financial crisis and bank failure, rather than people lining
the streets to take out their money, we need a means of instantly
transferring bank accounts from a failed bank to a survivor bank.
Cyprus is a case in point. The British Government decided to underwrite
customer deposits in London branches of Cyprus banks, but we had no
means to move customer bank accounts elsewhere. Bank account number
portability would solve the very significant issue of
resolution.</hs_Para>

am delighted that the Financial Secretary to the Treasury is consulting

comment has been made about how the Queen’s Speech was not
widely leaked, but having read it, we can see that there was not a
great deal to leak. It was a very thin Queen’s Speech—the
thinnest I have seen in my  21 years in this place. I wonder
why that is, because for the past months we have been treading water as
Members of Parliament, dealing with insubstantial debates, Opposition
days and lots of less than vital legislation. However, there are some
good things in the speech; I would like to refer to one of
them.</hs_Para>

being introduced to allow sufferers of mesothelioma whose employers
cannot be traced to gain compensation is a positive step forward. This
group of people has been let down for far too long. It is right that we
should do everything possible for them to receive reparation, in many
cases fairly urgently. However, it is rumoured that under the proposed
scheme claimants will receive about 30% less than the standard for
asbestos-related cancer, were it the subject of other litigation. Two
thirds of what someone is entitled to is probably better than nothing,
but justice dictates that they should get 100%, especially as I
understand that the scheme is to be funded by the insurance sector,
which of late has hardly been on its knees financially.</hs_Para>

established in the mid-1970s during the tenure of the Labour
Government. As a price for our support to keep that Government going,
we insisted on compensation for miners and quarrymen. I am proud that
we did that, but it involved a Government-backed scheme. In essence,
the Government are taking a positive step forward, but let us look at
the detail, to ensure that we do right by the people who are

is much to be regretted in this Queen’s Speech, such as
compulsory price tendering for legal aid. I declare an interest as a
former solicitor who practised in legal aid cases and who also did
legal aid-funded work at the Bar. I am not given to hyperbole often,
and I do not know whether hon. Members realise this, but the current
proposals will mean the disappearance of thousands of
solicitors’ firms from the high street. These are firms whose
expertise we have always relied on, and they are often family firms
that do things gratis for people who 
<?notus-xml column=199?>call in. They will be taken over by larger firms that are not full of
legally qualified people. There will be a devastating effect in some
areas, especially in rural, smaller towns, where firms will disappear

reason is quite obvious: the Government’s proposals are a race
to the bottom. The Government confidently expect that any tender for
work would have to be 17.5% lower than current legal aid rates.
However, legal aid rates have been pegged for the last eight or nine
years anyway, so lawyers who practise legal aid are not, in truth, fat
cats. There are one or two silks who do extremely well, but I can
assure hon. Members that most people—both those at the Bar and
solicitors who largely rely on legal aid work—will never retire
with a massive pension or be fat cats. To be honest, they may well end

proposal will quite obviously mean that the client will have no choice.
It will lead to a paralegal system, with people coming out of the
conurbations to try to deal with tens of cases in one day, taking notes
roughly and then reporting back, and then eventually somebody will turn
up for the trial or whatever. That concerns me greatly. The whole idea
of a fixed fee for a trial or plea worries me as well, because there
will inevitably be problems. It is a race to the bottom.</hs_Para>

important point to be made about the Welsh language provision we
routinely have in Wales. Members might not know this—I have
practised in Welsh courts myself—but any trial can be conducted
through the medium of the Welsh language, whether a jury trial, a civil
matter or a case in the magistrates court. That is as it should be.
Welsh has equal status with English in Wales—again, as it should
be. That provision and the work that the Courts Service has done over
the last couple of decades will disappear overnight. There will be a
great deal of anxiety and turmoil in Wales over that. I regret to say
that if the Government go ahead with this proposal, they will be
directly responsible for damaging the Welsh language and culture and
the services available to people in rural and semi-rural areas. That
will happen not just in Wales but in England—although I am

the proposed Bill is very unfortunate. Let me explain why. We need to
move away from scaremongering and put in place measures to protect
domestic workers and prevent employers from undercutting the work force
by paying less than the minimum wage. We all know that the agencies are
doing that. However, all too often the Government use immigration as a
scapegoat, in an attempt to distract us from their failure to create
enough meaningful jobs and secure economic recovery.</hs_Para>

Where he lives is also quite a nice place, although not quite to the
same degree as Dwyfor Meirionnydd. However, let us not go down that
route just now. I obviously know my area intimately. I will be
perfectly honest: over the past few years I have had one or two
complaints from individuals who have said, “Why are these people
from eastern Europe working in hotels?” They asked why such
people are doing this or that. I told them why: because very often
local people are not prepared to do that work. They are not prepared to
work the long or unfriendly

can speak with some authority on this matter. A local college in
Dolgellau has an excellent reputation for catering courses, among other
things, yet none of its students is going into the local hotel
industry. They are just not interested. Instead, several well-meaning,
hard-working young people have come in from various eastern European
countries to do that work. They are putting in the hours and some of
them, to their credit, are even learning Welsh. They are working hard
and doing the stuff that local people do not want to do.

number of pieces of proposed legislation in the Queen’s Speech

sense. I am particularly interested in the rehabilitation revolution,
as it is known. We heard earlier that the probation service had
recently acquired a gold medal for the excellence of its service. Now,
however, we see evidence that those who have been in prison for 12
months or less are the cohort most likely to reoffend. That is
something that we have all known for a long time, yet that cohort has
never fallen within the ambit of the probation service’s work.
It is little wonder, therefore, that those people reoffend, and
something needs to be done. Not a great deal is being done to
rehabilitate those people in prison, and once they are out, they are
left without any assistance at all. On that, I agree with the

welcome the draft Wales Bill, as far as it goes. It will transfer
powers over elections to the Welsh Government, introduce fixed
five-year terms for the Assembly and overturn the ban on dual candidacy
for Welsh elections. I must, however, express my profound
disappointment that there was no slot in the Queen’s Speech for
a full, proper government of Wales Bill. The pressing need for such
legislation is quite obvious. As I am sure hon. Members will know, the
Commission on Devolution in Wales, chaired by Paul Silk, recently
published its first report, on the financial powers of the Welsh
Assembly. It received broad cross-party support. It recommended that
the Welsh Government should have control over minor taxes as well as
job-creating levers and borrowing powers, so allowing the Welsh
Government to raise and invest money in Wales’s public services
and infrastructure, thereby improving the economy. The Silk report
recommended that those levers be devolved as soon as was
practical<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>. Lest
we forget, this Government have been effectively treading water for the
past nine months or so, and have failed to bring forward any really
important pieces of legislation. All things considered, there is surely
a case for a legislative slot for such an important vehicle. We are
already falling behind, and time is of the essence.</hs_Para>

also believe that we should introduce what we describe as an economic

Wales, to correct the anomaly that Wales is at present probably the
only country in the world that has a legislature, but no legal
jurisdiction of its own to serve it. There is already a very
substantial corpus juris establishing itself in Wales that does not
have a jurisdiction to serve it, and the need for one is now urgent. It

would like to take the opportunity briefly to support the measures in
the immigration Bill that was announced yesterday in the other place.
Last September, during the previous parliamentary Session, I had the
privilege to introduce a private Member’s Bill, called the NHS
Audit Requirements (Foreign Nationals) Bill, which was intended to
tackle the large-scale abuse of our national health service that occurs
when people not entitled to receive free NHS care do receive it. That
Bill came about as a result of my submission of Freedom of Information
Act requests to every health trust in the country. I asked how many
foreign nationals they had treated and what level of costs they had
managed to recover from the treatments of those foreign
nationals—either directly or, more typically, through reciprocal
agreements such as the European health card insurance
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000037">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:53:15"></hs_TimeCode>
responses I received were really quite shocking, as about half of all
health trusts said that they did not record information on the
treatment of foreign nationals at all. Many of those who responded with
some data provided confused information. Some had treated British
citizens who had moved abroad and some had treated those who had served
in the armed forces abroad as foreign nationals, while others recorded
data only on EU nationals or on European economic area nationals.
Frankly, the general picture of how the NHS records data about the
treatment of foreign nationals was in a very parlous state
indeed.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050920000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000038"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:54:04"></hs_TimeCode>Technically,
people are entitled to free treatment on the NHS if they have been
habitually resident in this country for a year or more. The reality,
however, is that 
<?notus-xml column=204?>free treatment is available to people—in many cases literally as
soon as they step off the plane and arrive in this country. That is
certainly the case in my constituency, which has Gatwick airport within
its boundaries. I have heard reports of about 150 heavily pregnant
women arriving at Gatwick airport every year, and of my local
area’s East Surrey hospital having to support and treat those
women from the pregnancy process through to birth. Indeed, it was
reported to me just this morning that women who are 35 weeks pregnant
have often presented themselves at Gatwick airport. That is, of course,
a burden on the national health service; it is essentially an abuse of
the generosity of our
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000039">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:55:22"></hs_TimeCode>
problem, however, is much more wide scale than that. Where people
present themselves to a local GP surgery, the GPs are encouraged to
register the individuals and not to ask about their eligibility to
receive primary health care or free health on the NHS at all. Once
someone is registered with a doctor’s practice, they will
receive an NHS number and will then be free to be referred on anywhere
in the health care system without any further checks. In the majority
of cases, such people will be entitled to free prescriptions as
well.</hs_Para>

we essentially have in this country, then, is not so much a national
health service as an international health service. I do not think
anyone in this place would want to deny the very best treatment that
our health system can offer to people in this country and around the
world, but people should be able properly to contribute to the system,
and the system should be able to recover the costs of treating foreign
nationals through reciprocal arrangements or, where such arrangements
do not exist, the costs should be directly
recovered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:56:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000041">I
received an e-mail this morning from the Surrey and Sussex Healthcare
NHS Trust, my local acute health care trust. It detailed the latest
available figures on the cost of treating foreign nationals—to
its credit, it does audit them—as more than £500,000. Yet
the amount it was able to recover through reciprocal arrangements or
directly was in the order only of about £130,000. That is a
pretty typical picture across our health service and trusts up and down
the country.</hs_Para>

privilege of visiting the immigration facilities at Gatwick airport. As
part of our discussions with immigration officials at the airport, we
spoke to a desk officer who liaises with the Department of Health and
NHS trusts in order to try to recover costs from foreign nationals who
have used NHS services. The picture presented was again that we were
successful in recovering those costs only from a minority of those
foreign
nationals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000043">It
is incredible that we have allowed this sort of situation to become
commonplace in this country. If we look to other European countries, we
find that they are much more rigorous in ensuring that the treatment of
their foreign nationals, including Britons, under their health system
is properly recorded so that those costs can be recovered—in the
case of our European neighbours, through the European health insurance
card scheme. They achieve that by checking eligibility at the point
where health services are received. If someone needs to see a doctor
for primary care, a gateway mechanism is introduced. In the case of
emergency treatment, it is of course important that care is delivered
as soon as possible, 
<?notus-xml column=205?>but in other countries it is again commonplace for the costs of such
emergency treatments to be recovered after the individual has been
treated, stabilised and capable of being discharged. It is incredible
that we do not do that, which is why I am very supportive of the
measures announced in the Queen’s Speech to ensure finally that
we have some rigour, because this is ultimately about fairness to the
taxpayers who fund our
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000044">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>
is right that we have an NHS that is universally available regardless
of ability to pay, and it is right that that system is largely paid for
out of taxation, but it cannot be right that that system is then freely
available to anybody arriving in this country without any meaningful
checks. By introducing these checks to ensure that our health service
is not abused in that way, we can restore confidence in our system and
create greater fairness, and also ensure that the health budget is not
unnecessarily overburdened, as it is at present, to the tune of
hundreds of millions of
pounds.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13050920000386" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0002.htm#13050920000386">2

Jones:</Member></B> I have just clarified it for the hon. Gentleman,
but let me say this to him. The results of that policy are very clear.
Just when the country needs to be united, what this Government are
about is promoting division. They are about making people suspicious of
one another: those in work fearing those out of work; the rich behaving
as if the poor are a problem; those who lose their jobs, even in areas
of low immigration, being made to think immigration is the
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000062">We
have seen the results: a country fearful and disunited. That does not
build a confident, prosperous Britain, because when people are fearful,
they do not take risks and innovate—they cling to what they
have. It does not build a Britain at ease with itself either, divided
between rich and poor, north and south. We are a better country than
that, and we can be a better country, but it requires leadership from a
Government willing to change the priorities. The first priority is to
build a prosperous economy throughout the regions and nations of this
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000063">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have systematically taken money out of many of our regions,
which have already been hit by unemployment. They have transferred
£1 billion out of the north of England in their local government
settlement alone. They have hit those big cities suffering most from
unemployment through their welfare reforms; for example, Birmingham
will lose £10 million on council tax changes alone, and
Liverpool is losing more than £7 million in bedroom
tax. That is money that would otherwise be spent in local shops and
businesses, promoting those local economies. That is why it is
important to have a British investment bank, at arm’s length
from 
<?notus-xml column=208?>government, that not only lends to small and medium-sized enterprises,
but ensures that we invest in the different regions of our country,
promoting their economic strengths and building up
their capacity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:11:36"></hs_TimeCode>.

was talking about jobs. There needs to be a matching of not only our
jobs guarantee for young people, but our guarantee of jobs for older
people who have been out of work for more than two years. We also want
to switch money from a tax cut for millionaires to support tax credits
for the very people are who are out working in low-paid jobs, doing the
right thing. We have to protect people’s rights at
work—the Prime Minister wants to negotiate them away—not
only because doing so is morally right, but because the strongest and
most prosperous economies work through partnership between employers
and employees; they work through training and investment in employees,
not through a quick hire-and-fire culture. We will never compete with
developing nations on low wages; we have to compete with them on
skills.</hs_Para>

housing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>.
Constituencies such as mine are desperate for homes for those who want
to get a foot on the ladder and for homes to rent, yet the builders who
come to us want to build homes for commuters. When they do agree to
build some affordable housing, they often buy themselves out of that
commitment—the Government’s permission to renegotiate
section 106 agreements has not helped—and such an approach
simply builds ghettoes. If we are to build viable communities, we need
to look at other ways of building the affordable housing we need. We
need to look at co-ownership and at councils being allowed
to build by accessing money through the use of their pension funds. I
have long believed that local authorities should be able to build not
only for sale, but for
rent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:14:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000068">Getting
that economy right is key to many of the things we want to do, to

things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000071">I
want to focus my remarks, in my few minutes, on the upcoming
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill. Just how much good
progress we have already made in keeping our neighbourhoods safer and
secure was made clear to me when I was lucky enough to help launch the
UK peace index a few weeks ago. As the completely independent figures
show, violent crime is coming right down, in no small part because of
the work that the Home Secretary and her team have been doing over the
past couple of years. I am sure that the measures promised in the new
Bill will build on that
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000072">The
Bill will also cover one of the issues I have been most active in
working on and one closest to my heart: dangerous dogs. I do not expect
other Members to remember this, but a plea to do something about the
problem was one of the main points I made in my maiden speech, almost
exactly three years ago. I said then that tackling the scourge of dogs
being used as weapons—a massive antisocial behaviour
issue—must be a priority, and I have been campaigning along
those lines ever
since.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000073">I
have always said that the issue is as much about dangerous owners as
dangerous dogs—in fact, it is more so. It is imperative that
measures against antisocial behaviour focus on the owners who train
their dogs as weapons to use for intimidation and as a badge of status.
They blight the lives of communities with their threat of aggression,
just as much as do the actual attacks that sometimes, sadly, occur. We
need measures that will tackle this head on by giving communities and
their local police necessary enforcement powers. I am pleased with the
progress made by this Government on making microchipping compulsory.
Although that will not itself solve the problem of vicious dogs, it
will introduce greater accountability and responsibility through
detailing ownership, which will go some way to deterring irresponsible
ownership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000074">It
is absolutely right to extend section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991
to cover private land. It has long struck me as extraordinary that a
postal worker posting a letter could get his finger chewed off by a dog
at the other side of the letterbox with no comeback, yet if the owner
of the dog, in a crazy world, had substituted themselves for the dog,
they would automatically be chargeable with an
offence—presumably, grievous bodily harm, so although this
measure is very late in coming, it is none the less very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:18:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000075">We
need clarity on what happens when a dog attempts to protect its
owner’s home from an intruder. It is right that when this
happens with the owner present, there should be no penalty attached.
However, there are concerns that, as things stand, if the owner is not
present while the dog defends the property, there may well be a penalty
to pay and the owner will be held liable 
<?notus-xml column=210?>for an attack on the intruder. That would be ridiculous and would fly in
the face of all common sense, so I hope very much that this matter can
be sorted out
sensibly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000076">Another
major area of concern has already been mentioned today, and those of us
who have been campaigning on this issue are well aware of it—I
refer to the growing problem of attacks by out-of-control dogs on guide
dogs. This is a particularly nasty trend, because guide dogs have been
trained to be passive and docile, and such an attack is, of course,
incredibly upsetting for the owner, who depends so much on the support
of their dog. I am delighted that this appalling problem has now been
recognised by the Government, and I hope that the penalties will be as
tough as possible.</hs_Para>

question of dangerous dogs is not strictly the responsibility of the
Home Office, the Government should consider what encouragement can be
given to local authorities to deal with it. Some, such as Wandsworth
and Ealing, are already working on finding ways to use tenancy
agreements on their estates to control dog ownership. This seems an
obvious route to take as so many of the problems with dangerous dogs
arise on unruly estates where the local council has significant
control, if it wants to exert it. That is an underused tool and it
needs joined-up government thinking, along with work by the Local
Government Association and London Councils. The truth is that even
where councils are considering such an approach, enforcement is not
always carried through. The Government need to send a strong message
that local authorities will be expected to play their part in helping
to tackle this blight. Local authorities have the powers and they
should be
used.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000078">I
will finish by touching briefly on one or two other measures in the
Queen’s Speech that I welcome. There are three bills in
particular: the national insurance contributions Bill, the deregulation
Bill, and the intellectual property Bill. They will all contain
measures that should genuinely help small businesses. Giving people
confidence by saying to them, “If you’ve got a good idea,
go for it,” must be at the heart of our agenda. It is the key to

as generous as it might be, but it is a good start. We also need to do
all we can to support carers themselves. In particular, when families

comfortable that the police can react and in a sufficiently timely

extremely serious issues and I accept that there will be times when
they may have to delay their investigation, but I hope they will
investigate. I am afraid that there have been too many instances when

the Front Bench nodding in agreement—they are not really, but I

about such matters, and if they feel more comfortable with their

we all know that the main economic levers are held by the UK

struggling to make ends meet, particularly as prices are rising very
quickly, while those earning more than £150,000 are given a tax
break. This is not only unfair, it is economic nonsense, because the
least well-off spend their money quickly and it goes back into the
local economy, whereas the better-off may wish to stash it away or
spend it abroad. We have only to look at our town centres to see the
dire effects of squeezing middle and low-income families. Research also
shows that greater equality between the better-off and the less
well-off members of society makes for greater community cohesion. We

working for less than £50 a week, most of which was taken away
for her bed and board. Does my hon. Friend agree that that needs to be

isolated one; there seem to be many such cases. A report from the

problem sufficiently. It has been suggested that a commission is needed
to look into that. Whether or not that is the right way forward, we
certainly need some action. It would have been nice to see a concerted

has recently seen a failure to secure justice for care home residents
following the collapse of serious criminal charges, which has left the
families of an alleged 103 victims feeling aggrieved and abandoned. An
£11.6 million investigation known as Operation Jasmine began in
2005. It produced 10,500 pieces of evidence and led police to brand the
negligence discovered as “death by indifference”.
However, just two convictions have been secured for wilful negligence

have been speaking to the families affected by the stymied Operation
Jasmine, who are still grieving over this shameful crime—a crime
without punishment. The neglect and indifference in these care homes
continues to appal. There are little things, such as losing a
mother’s false teeth for days on end or dressing her in a
neighbour’s damp or dirty clothes, and big things—the
stories that chill the blood—such as the dad who challenged his
family on his return to a care home, “Why have you put me
here?” The same father was left curled up like a dog for hour

underneath.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000146">How

we must look at the law on wilful neglect. If a patient does not die
from poor care and does not have a loss of capacity under the Mental
Capacity Act 2005, the guidance of the Crown Prosecution Service says
that a criminal offence is difficult to identify. The Prime Minister
was therefore wrong when he told me on 1 May that the criminal law was
already there to deal with care home abuse. It is

depth and quality of evidence obtained in this inquiry and the
engagement throughout with expert witnesses and the CPS was
substantial. And it is not only frustrating, but difficult to see how
if such cases occurred in the future (where the death of an elderly
person in a care home was attributed to omissions as opposed to
deliberate acts) the police could ever produce sufficient evidence to
reach the threshold test for charging these
offences.”</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13050920000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000152">Others
agree with that view. The Joint Committee that scrutinised the draft
Care and Support Bill recommended that organisations—not just
employees—that are found to have contributed to abuse or neglect
in a care setting should be liable to criminal prosecution for breach
of corporate responsibility. Age UK believes that neglect should be
classified as abuse, whether wilful or not, because of the difficulty
of proving intention. Therefore, if someone is abused or neglected as a
result of incompetence or indifference, it should still be seen as
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:08:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000153">I
hope that the Government will engage with voluntary organisations and
MPs of all parties to improve the legislation. Prevention is the best
option and inspection procedures must be robust and transparent, but
when neglect occurs, those who are responsible must be brought to
justice so that everyone knows that callous and degrading care will be
punished. Finally, high standards of patient care must not be
sacrificed to boost personal profit, as when Dr Das enjoyed his
Rolls-Royce while penny pinching and cutting the supply of incontinence
pads to the residents in his
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:09:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13050920000392" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000392">3.8

Diane Abbott</B> (Hackney North and Stoke Newington) (Lab):</Member> I
am very glad to have an opportunity to say a few words on the
Queen’s Speech. It was a Queen’s Speech that could best
be described as the creation of one Lynton Crosby, the chief Tory
strategist. It is extraordinary that an important, symbolic and
historic event that takes place every year should this year have the
fingerprints all over it of an Australian huckster. The Lynton Crosby
effect can be seen in both what is in the Queen’s Speech, and
what is not in it. What runs through the speech, the way it was briefed
and its theme, show that this speech has anti-immigration measures as
its centrepiece.</hs_Para>

the wake of recent local elections, politicians on all sides are
clearly focused on the UKIP vote and what we need to do to appeal to
that. There are, however, too many myths about immigration. It is a
myth that we have not been allowed to talk about immigration during 
<?notus-xml column=222?>past decades. My Government had a major Bill on immigration or
nationality in every Parliament, and I do not think a day has gone by
over the past 20 years in which a tabloid paper has not run an
anti-immigrant story, whether it is asylum seekers eating swans or
Romanian ladies in headscarves who are the latest threat to the body
politic. The myth that no one is allowed to talk about immigration is
just that.</hs_Para>

is also a myth that Labour had an open-door policy on immigration. I do
more immigration casework than most Members of the House because of the
nature of my constituency, and we have filing cabinets full of cases,
many of which went on for months, moving into years. The assertion that
under the previous Government immigrants and asylum seekers could just
walk into the UK is a myth that wants quashing.</hs_Para>

do not doubt that the polls are right when they reflect concern about
immigration. I note, however, that the more diverse an area, and the
longer immigrants have been there, the less frightened people are of
immigration. Fear takes hold in parts of the country where there are
hardly any immigrants. Some Labour Members like to point to the
children or grandchildren of earlier waves of immigrants who have
difficulty with immigration and say, “Look, this West Indian and
this African are worried about eastern European migrants.” I
have been an MP for more than 20 years, and in a part of London that
has seen successive waves of immigration I have noted that it is always
the last group of immigrants but one to arrive who feel that they can
complain about the latest group. It is almost as if being able to
complain about the latest group of immigrants cements someone’s
status as a real British national.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:12:23"></hs_TimeCode>I do not say
that that does not reflect real concerns about immigration, and where
there are such concerns, whether about job insecurity, low wages, or an
absence of housing, this House and my party should address them.
However, it is important not to get swept up in myth making.</hs_Para>

an extraordinarily cynical manoeuvre, the Government —on
the instructions, I imagine, of Mr Lynton Crosby—have made
immigration one of the centrepieces of the Queen’s Speech, yet a
number of the measures that they suggest will not, in practice, achieve
the effects that the general public might think. For instance, the
Prime Minister spoke about being able to throw out foreign national
prisoners almost as soon as they are sentenced. Well, we will see
whether that can happen. All prisoner exchange agreements with non-EU
countries turn on the consent of the prisoner, and until now, prisoners
from Jamaica, which has the largest number of foreign nationals in
British jails, and prisoners from Nigeria have always refused to go
back to their countries of origin to serve their sentence. I do not
know what will change.</hs_Para>

issue was raised in the context of the Queen’s Speech about
stopping immigrants who are not entitled to NHS treatment from
receiving it. Of course we should not facilitate health
tourism—no Opposition Member defends that—and of course
hospitals should be able to get back money that they are owed. There
is, however, a danger of blowing this up into a huge issue when the
sums of money, given the total NHS budget, are not necessarily that
great. If hospitals and doctors are to query the entitlement of people
who walk through their door, given the nature of things the danger is
that they will query those from visible minorities who may

nationals. What will that do for community

Abbott:</Member></B> I am glad my hon. Friend raises that public health
aspect of the rhetoric and the media narrative of stopping immigrants
from approaching doctors and the health service. Many who are perfectly
entitled to approach their doctor will feel inhibited, and there is a
danger of disease incubation—people might finally go to the
health service only when they are far gone, which will cost a lot more.
Another danger is communicable disease. The pronouncements on stopping
immigrants from unwarrantedly accessing NHS health care are not just
wrong, toxic and unworkable, but inimical to good public
health.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000162">The
Queen’s Speech is a Lynton Crosby public speech partly because

Lynton Crosby effect is both what is in the speech and what is not in

British American Tobacco in Australia to fight plain packaging. I put

Under-Secretary of State for Health, the hon. Member for Broxtowe (Anna
Soubry), who has responsibility for public health, said just weeks ago
that she was persuaded having seen the evidence—the Department
of Health has seen the evidence. What happened between the Department
of Health forming a view on plain packaging and the Under-Secretary
coming out in public in favour of it, and a Queen’s Speech that
does not mention it, even though it is the preferred solution of
medical experts and smoking cessation campaigners? Lynton Crosby
happened. The idea that thousands of people could have their health
endangered because of the malign influence of Lynton Crosby on Tory
party policy is very

House must remember that tobacco remains the biggest cause of health
inequalities in terms of death rates—it is more significant than
any other factor. As I have said, there is complete consensus,
including among the British Medical Association and medical and smoking
cessation campaigners, that plain packaging is a key aspect in reducing
levels of smoking and improving the health of the population, but
because Lynton Crosby raises an eyebrow, it seems to have been dropped

measure missing from the Queen’s Speech that has tremendous
public health implications is a minimum price for alcohol. I am proud
to tell the House that the Labour party’s policy is to support a
minimum price for alcohol because there is a
consensus—again—among campaigners, doctors’
organisations and anybody concerned about alcohol abuse, and even among
some Government Members, that something must be done about the deluge
of cheap alcohol. We have gone from the situation in the 19th century
when people were worried about pubs and clubs, to worrying about men,
women and children buying cheap alcohol in the supermarket and corner
shop and doing themselves real damage drinking at home. We are seeing
rising levels of liver disease as a result of the consumption of cheap
alcohol. At one point the Prime Minister said that he was persuaded by
the arguments for a minimum price, and brave statements were made by
the Home Secretary. What happened then? Lynton Crosby came in as chief
political adviser and the commitment to a minimum price on alcohol
disappeared, again to the detriment of the health of thousands of our
people.</hs_Para>

I was made Minister with responsibility for roads—painting white
lines on national roads—and someone asked me what I was going to
do to improve road safety. I asked how one measured the change in the
level of road safety. Within 20 minutes, we were discussing casualty
reduction. Casualties can be counted, however inaccurately. I asked
what was the dominant factor, and was told that young men drinking more
than the legal limit of alcohol and then going driving mattered a lot.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:22:51"></hs_TimeCode> received
consistent advice from virtually every respected group in the country
that three things had to happen: the legal limit had to be lowered,
which would criminalise more people; policing had to be stepped up; and
penalties had to be increased.</hs_Para>

those days, there were approximately 2 million occasions a week when
young men would drive a car having consumed more than the legal limit
for alcohol. They were not necessarily over the limit when they drove.
The number of drink-related deaths when the driver or motorcycle rider
was above the legal limit when killed, or the passenger was killed, was
1,200 a year.</hs_Para>

the difficulties that younger people face, whether they are our own
children or somebody else’s, does matter. If we had an
18-year-old who said, “Do you know that interest rates have been
at 0.5% for a long time, the rate of unemployment has fluctuated
between this, that and the other, and the rate of inflation on
different measures is between this and that?” we might say in

lifelong smoker of 20 a day, seven packs a week, at more than £7
a pack in after-tax income, so you, the parent, are more likely to bury

estimate that the figures for those taking up crime for the first time

more.</hs_Para>

raised the matter, the Home Office claimed it did not have the
information, but it did—although it is probably now with the
Ministry of Justice. As part of our national statistics, those figures
should be coming out regularly, both nationally and regionally, so that
the media might start paying attention to how it is that so many of our
young people—a third of males by the age of 30—have been
convicted of a serious criminal offence. That is why I told the Home
Secretary earlier that we need to pay attention to the numbers who
commit offences for the first time and for how long, on average, they
go on doing so. There are relatively few lifelong serious
criminals.</hs_Para>

her speech yesterday,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:25:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Totnes (Dr Wollaston) said that 200,000 teenagers took
up smoking every year. If 40% of our young people are taking up
smoking—almost the same level as 25 years ago—all the
measures taken since then, such as removing promotions from the front
of tobacconists and raising prices significantly, must have been
inadequate.</hs_Para>

do people take up smoking? Very few take it up after the age of 21. It
is something that teenagers take up. Ask a young person who is smoking,
“How old are you?”, and they might say,
“I’m 15”, “I’m 13” or
“I’m 18”. If we say, “You’re too
young to smoke,” effectively we are saying,
“You’re doing an adult thing.” We ought to say,
“Oh dear, a child. Only children take it up. I’m sorry
you’re one of them,” and walk away.</hs_Para>

say to that child, “If you are a smoker, try not to be the first
person to light up in any group and try not to smoke in front of
someone who is younger than you.” Whatever the merits or
demerits of 
<?notus-xml column=226?>plain packaging—it is not an argument I want to get
into—what is certain is that smoking is a social disease: people
pick it up because those around them are doing it. We need to change
that culture. In effect, we need to make smoking like picking your
nose: it goes on, but it should be in private, not public, and people
should just disapprove. Before we changed the law, people did not smoke
in a church, chapel, temple, mosque or synagogue. It just was not done.
It was not expected.</hs_Para>

must do for smoking what we did for drink-driving. What was effective
for drink-driving was, first, telling hosts, whether in a pub, club,
party or at home, “Always have alcohol-free drinks within reach.
No one should ever have to ask for an alcohol-free drink.” That
is not just for drivers, but for those who are temperate, who make up
10% of the population, for those who were alcoholics, who also make up
10% of the population, for those who are pregnant, those who want to be
pregnant, those who have drunk too much and those who are on a
diet—there are all kinds of reasons.</hs_Para>

want to ensure that
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>passengers pick
an alcohol-free driver. If I were going on a holiday to the Costa Lot
from Gatwick and saw the pilot coming out of a bar and tottering
slightly as he walked up the front steps of the aeroplane, I might
think, “This plane is not for me”—planes can fly
themselves, but cars cannot.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:27:17"></hs_TimeCode>In my time, five
young men would get into a car and drive to the pub. Each would buy a
round of drinks and four passengers would get back into the car knowing
that the driver had had five drinks and that they had paid for four of
them.</hs_Para>

if<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:27:27"></hs_TimeCode> like me
someone drinks and drives, they should decide in advance which it is
going to be that night. If in years to come, I get held for
drink-driving, people will point to this speech and say,
“Ya-ha-ha, hypocrite!”, but the fact is that between host
responsibility, passenger choice and the drinking-driving choice,
things become much better. That has become the norm and young people,
instead of being four times as bad as their parents, are probably four
times as good.</hs_Para>

abortion. We have nearly 400,000 abortions a year in this country,

sex and personal education, the availability of contraception, the

thing we cannot inherit from our parents is celibacy, unless we are
conceived in a glass dish. We say to people, “Think about family
planning or birth control.” After a good party, we might think
about having it off. If we do, do we wait for the embarrassment
afterwards of saying, “Cripes, we’ve conceived,
we’ve already got five children” or “What did you
say your name was?”, or “I know we’ve lived
together for two years, but we hadn’t planned this.” We
need to give people the confidence to use more than the words
“family planning” and “birth control”. It
is a choice between what embarrassment people want: between talking
beforehand about contraception or afterwards talking about the
consequence of having conceived.</hs_Para>

often in politics we believe that the law is the answer to questions.
The law can make something into a crime, but it does not necessarily
stop it happening—we would not have 80,000 people in jail
tonight if it did. The law can give people rights, but they cannot
always use them. The law can also provide a system of dispute
resolution, which can often be useful, but not always.</hs_Para>

last thing I want to talk about is fairness. One of the issues that
came up at the end of the last Session was leasehold reform. I believe
we have to go much further. There are 3 million leaseholders in this
country. There was a time, 40 or 50 years ago, when George
Thomas—later Lord Tonypandy, but in between the occupant of the
Speaker’s Chair—was campaigning for leasehold reform
because so many people living in the terraces in the Welsh valleys were
being exploited by the leasehold system.</hs_Para>

enfranchisement came. Now we have leasehold valuation tribunals, which
are supposed to be a cheap, simple and effective way of resolving
disputes between leaseholders and freeholders and their managing
agents. There is an organisation called Lease that provides advice. It
gets just over £1 million a year from the Government, but it
needs much more help. I am seeing Lease tomorrow and I hope to work
with it to tell Government what they need to do.</hs_Para>

are two or three Departments involved: the Department for Communities

some cases do not get to a leasehold valuation tribunal fast, why they
cost far more to resolve than the £500 advertised as the fee and
why clever lawyers manage to put down the leaseholders and let some
freeholders—not all, but some—abuse the system. I will
give the House one example of abuse. The freeholder, through their
managing agent, can arrange insurance and make the leaseholders pay the
premium without saying openly what the commission is and without
necessarily testing the market. That is just one example; I could give
a number of
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000191"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>When

children start smoking each year in the UK and around two thirds of

Yesterday’s Gracious Speech was, I think, the third since I was
elected to represent West Dunbartonshire in 2010. As with the previous
two, however, I am afraid that yesterday’s was simply another
wasted opportunity by a Government who should be getting to grips with

include than for what it
contained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000215" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000215"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:44:07"></hs_TimeCode>Across
the UK, people are really struggling. They may be unable to get a job
because of the flatlining economy or struggling to make ends meet
because of the cost-of-living crisis. I can assure Members and
Ministers that the people of West Dunbartonshire are absolutely no
different; in fact, they are at the sharp end of this
Government’s crisis. The Prime Minister promised there would be
a change for the better when he went into Downing street in 2010, but
the truth is that things are getting much worse, not better. In West
Dunbartonshire unemployment is up, youth unemployment is up and
long-term youth unemployment is now 10 times the level it was in May
2010—more than 1,000 young people are looking for a job. It is
an absolute

does not look as though things will be changing any time soon.
Currently in my constituency, more than 12 people are chasing every

people out of work for every advertised job in the last three years. In
fact, I frequently hear of jobs—part-time jobs that do not
require any skills or qualifications—for which more than 100
people have applied. That, if nothing else, should be setting off alarm
bells for this Government.</hs_Para>

to see how what the Government are saying to us here in this Chamber
matches up with what they are doing to people around the country. There
are simply not enough jobs for people to go into. The vast majority of
people who are sitting at home are not doing so because they do not
want to work: they are being failed by a Government who are unwilling

desperately need.</hs_Para>

welcoming some things in the Queen’s Speech. First, I welcome
the inclusion of Bills for High Speed 2. I fully support the project
which cannot come a day too soon, because faster and better
infrastructural links to Birmingham, to the north-west and, ultimately,
to Crewe, with proper connections to various regions, will bring great

welcome the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, but I would
welcome it even more if budgets such as that for North Wales police
were not facing cuts of 20% and antisocial behaviour orders were not
being scrapped. I welcome the inclusion in the Bill of gun-related
laws, but I hope that the Home Secretary and her team will consider
carefully the points about gun ownership and those with a history of
domestic 
<?notus-xml column=235?>violence that were made earlier by my right hon. Friend the Member for
Normanton, Pontefract and Castleford (Yvette Cooper). We only have to
see what has happened in America and the power of the National Rifle

chance to discuss immigration in this House. Indeed, as some Members
have said, it has happened at fairly regular intervals and I do not
believe it is an issue we should be frightened of. We should discuss it
in a sensible and constructive way. If there is a debate more widely in

some serious issues and omissions that the Government need to address.
Why is more not being done to tackle the use of foreign labour to
undercut local workers? As residents of Black Park and Chirk in my
constituency told me at the last election, how can it be right that
some jobs are advertised only in eastern European languages for agency
workers and offer only the worst possible terms of employment? The
constituents who ask those questions, and others like them, are
absolutely right to do so.</hs_Para>

are we to make of the fact that there have been no prosecutions for
breaches of the national minimum wage in the past two years when a
recent King’s college study found that between 150,000 and
250,000 workers in the care sector alone are being paid below the
national minimum wage? Is it any wonder that many people in this
country are angry when such abuses go unpunished? Why can we not extend

immigration, it is beyond belief that the Government are considering
the measures that they have announced. I remember that two or three
years ago we were told that a national register for landlords would be
impossible. It would be too bureaucratic and difficult for the
landlords, and would add red tape to the work that they already did,
yet now we are told that landlords are expected to be almost the main
body policing the system of immigration by identifying illegal tenants.
It is nonsense that on the one hand the Govt can say it is too

are some issues that never made it into the Queen’s Speech.
Plain packaging for cigarettes is one; a lobbying Bill is another. Dare

I turn to another matter that I would like to have seen in this
Queen’s Speech, one that I know has great support across the
political spectrum and has been raised in various guises in this House
by various Members, including me on numerous occasions. I refer to
death or serious injury on the roads caused by uninsured, unlicensed or
careless drivers. In last year’s debate on the Queen Speech, I
welcomed the aspects of the Crime and Courts Bill that brought into
effect new 
<?notus-xml column=236?>provisions on drugs and driving. It is in the spirit of welcoming this
change that I call on the Government to be bolder on the

have raised in the House before the case of Robert James Gaunt. Robert
was a nine-year-old boy who was tragically killed in March 2009 while
crossing the road in the village of Overton in my constituency by a
driver with no licence or insurance, who failed to stop. He was a
driver who did not report the accident and, even worse, who attempted
to cover up his crime by re-spraying his car. For ending the life of
this innocent young boy, the driver incurred a pitiful sentence of 22
months. That was at the very limit of what was possible under the law
for that offence. When 1,300 people signed the Justice for Robert
petition to back longer sentences for this crime, I promised to stand
up for Robert’s memory on their behalf and I will continue to
raise the issue here in the House.</hs_Para>

undertake a review of the maximum penalties for driving offences that
lead to death or serious injury, for I believe that this measure and

Qureshi</B> (Bolton South East) (Lab):</Member> I am not alone in being
disappointed with the Queen’s Speech as it failed to deal with
any of the real issues and challenges facing our country, such as 1
million young unemployed, the rise in the cost of living, especially
for those on low wages, no investment in the growth of our economy, and
no real reform of the banking system. The Chancellor said that his
austerity measures would bring the budget deficit down by 2015. He has
already accepted that that will not happen, and the triple A rating
which he considered a holy grail has also gone. In real terms he is
borrowing even more to balance the budget. The GDP to national debt
ratio is heading towards
80%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000244" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000244">When
Labour came to power in 1997, the GDP ratio to the national debt was
42%. By early 2008, it was down to 35%, just before the global
recession started. The Government then had to act to save the banks and
avoid a worsening financial crisis. As a result, they had to borrow
additional money, and the national debt went up, but figures show that
by 2010, the GDP ratio to the national debt began to fall again.
However, with the austerity measures of the current Chancellor, without
a growth plan for the economy, the GDP ratio to the national debt is
now some
80<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:05:17"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000245">These
figures are important because it is often said that the Labour
Government left the country in an economic mess, but the Opposition
know that that is not the case, because the facts and figures from the
Treasury and other Departments show that we were financially prudent.
It is not just me who says that; that famous Left-wing body, the
International Monetary Fund, has said the same. It has stated clearly
that the actions taken by the previous Prime Minister and the
Chancellor were the right ones in light of the situation that we faced
and—these words are important—the global recession. Much
as the Labour Government would have liked to control the whole world,
we certainly 
<?notus-xml column=237?>did not run the USA or Japan, or any of the other advanced nations, but
they experienced a similar global crisis. That is important: it was a
global crisis and had nothing to do with the suggestion that somehow
the Labour Government were financially mismanaging the economy.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:06:31"></hs_TimeCode>If anyone is
mismanaging the economy, it is the current Government, who are
borrowing £164 billion extra to cover the budget

makes sense that, if one is not going to invest in the economy, if
there are to be no jobs in the economy, and if people are not paying
their taxes, the revenue that a Government receive will obviously be
less. In order to continue to meet the budget deficit, they will have
to borrow more, which is exactly what the Chancellor has done. As a
result we now have a higher national debt, the economy is not moving,
and again the famous Left-wing socialist institution, the IMF, has said
that the Government need to change their course. The Chancellor needs
to change his course. He must bring in programmes and investment to
stimulate growth in the economy. Austerity alone will not be
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:07:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
who have suffered the most from the austerity and cuts have been the
disabled, the elderly, those on low wages, and often women with small
children. Their economic situation has been made worse, and their cost
of living has risen the most.</hs_Para>

the Government are not just satisfied with taking away people’s
economic rights and financially hitting them; they are also taking away
some basic civil rights. The cuts to civil legal aid for bodies such as
the employment, health and disability tribunals, and in family cases,
has meant that many people are now unrepresented. There have been cuts
to funding for the citizens advice bureaux, which last year in Bolton
South East saw 14,000 people who were suffering, including the
vulnerable, disadvantaged and poor, and those on low incomes, and now
they will suffer even more. If they have a problem, they will not be
able to go to a tribunal. They will have no legal representation and
there will be no one to explain their rights to
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:08:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000248">There
are further proposals to cut criminal legal aid, which again affects
ordinary people most. We hear about the famous few rich defendants, the
big criminals, but the majority of those who face criminal charges are
not the rich, but ordinary people. The myth that all criminal lawyers
earn millions and millions of pounds is another complete lie. Yes,
there is the odd Queen’s counsel or barrister who will earn that
sort of money from legal aid, but more than 95% of the members of the
Bar and people practising criminal law earn nowhere near that. In fact,
their earnings are often very average, compared with those in other
sectors. The idea that the majority of barristers somehow get £1
million a year from legal aid is a complete distortion of the truth. In
fact, it is a complete
lie.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000249" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000249"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:09:56"></hs_TimeCode>The
Ministry of Justice now wants to introduce something called

damage our judicial system. People should be able to choose a lawyer on
the basis of quality, rather than being given the one with the lowest

least 17.5% below the current magistrates’ rates, and if they
get the contract they will also be able to continue working in the
Crown courts.

sad thing in politics in this country is that for a number of years now
there has been constant criticism of our judges when they take
decisions that the Executive are not happy with. I practised law for
more than 20 years, in different courts, and there were times when I
did not agree with the judge’s decision, but I did not start
bad-mouthing the judge. Instead, we had a system of appeal that allowed
us to take the matter further so that someone more senior could
consider it, because errors can occur and it can be useful to have
another pair of eyes to look at decisions that have been taken. Surely
that is the only proper way for politicians to behave in cases
involving judges.</hs_Para>

judges are of a very high calibre. They are not ignorant people who do
not know about the real world. They know what the real world is like
and they know the law. I think it is about time politicians across all
political parties started giving the judiciary the respect it deserves.
Ultimately, an independent judiciary is very much a hallmark of a
civilized democratic society. That is something we should be proud of
in this country. We should not constantly be denigrating
judges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000253">Things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:12:59"></hs_TimeCode>
that we now take as being accepted were not accepted 20 years ago, and
that is because our judges have effectively been applying the law in a
way that has benefited many people. For example, it is now perfectly
acceptable to take on a public authority or a Department for any
wrongdoing. That was not the case until a number of years ago. It is
only because our judges have said that public authorities and bodies
should be accountable and scrutinised that that is now accepted as
normal business in this country. That was very much down to
judges.</hs_Para>

years ago, Lord Denning brought in the equitable principle in the
famous High Trees House case. I know that ex-lawyers sometimes tend to
go on about the law, but I mention that case because it was the first
time people in common law partnerships, especially women, were given
some rights over the properties in which they lived and were looking
after the children but where they were not the income winners and had
no rights at all. That case allowed them to have some rights.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:14:22"></hs_TimeCode> have a lot to
be grateful to our judges for, so denigrating them is just not right.
If a Government are not happy with a judge’s decision, they have
a mechanism of appeal, and the final appeal is to the Supreme Court,

decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000255">I

health issues that are big challenges for our society, such as drinking

an opportunity for the Government, who said themselves that they want
to deal with this, but it seems that because of powerful lobbyists and
other groups plain packaging is now off the agenda and alcohol is not
being tackled. Members have already talked about the impact of alcohol
and cigarettes on people’s lives and the illnesses they cause.
It is therefore sad and regrettable that this action has not taken

disappointing aspect of the Queen’s Speech relates to
immigration. It is right that there should be a debate about
immigration, and nobody is running away from that. People who have come
to this country should be able to claim benefit if they have paid taxes
to the Treasury. If they have not made those contributions, it is right
that they should not be able to benefit from welfare provision. No one
is arguing that that is wrong.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:16:08"></hs_TimeCode>, the
Government, who are trying to deal with UKIP in a knee-jerk reaction to
what happened recently, have brought in policies requiring landlords
and doctors to act as policemen. Instead, they should be making sure
that the border is being patrolled properly so that people are not
coming into the country illegally. They should also be making sure that
the UK Border Agency becomes more effective in dealing with people who
should not be in this country and should be sent back. That is the way
to deal with it; it is the state’s responsibility. Making
individual citizens act as spies is wrong; it is like George
Orwell’s society coming to fruition. Yes, some big landlords
with thousands of homes in their property portfolios might be able to
carry out the searches suggested by the Government, but in my
constituency a lot of people who have a small home and may be renting
one room will now be criminalised if they do not carry out certain
checks. That is plain wrong, as is asking doctors to spy on people. The

Queen’s Speech did nothing at all to try to stimulate our
economy. We would have liked a jobs Bill that meant a paid job for
every adult who had been out of work for more than two years;
guaranteed six months’ pay for young people; a
requirement—this is very important bearing in mind the wholesale
privatisation that is taking place under this Government—that
large firms should agree to apprenticeship schemes whenever they are
given a Government contract; a Finance Bill that reversed the VAT rise
and the 10p tax rate; and a consumer Bill that dealt with rising energy
costs, which now average £300, and rail fares, which are going
up by 9%. The rail companies should be offering people the cheapest
available fare, not expecting them to search around for hours on end
trying to find a good deal. We should ensure that energy companies are
regulated properly and are not exploiting the

England.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000260" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000260">I
spent almost all of the previous four weeks home in the beautiful shire
county of Derbyshire, specifically in my home town of Chesterfield. For
those few short weeks we Derbyshire people seemed to be very popular

is hardly surprising that Derbyshire was the focus of so much
attention. No Government have lost in Derbyshire and won the country
since the war. The verdict of the people of Derbyshire was
pretty clear: a huge win for Labour, with 43 Labour councillors
compared with 18 Conservatives, just three Lib Dems and not a UKIP
councillor in sight. UKIP if you want to, but the people of Derbyshire
certainly did not. It was a triumph for Labour leader Anne
Western and the Labour team at county
hall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000262" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000262">In
electoral terms it was a decisive win, with Labour majorities in many
seats that we hope to win in 2015. Despite the victory, however, those
of us who spent considerable time on the doorsteps could not escape the
sense of despair among voters—the sense that politics should be
capable of offering so much more, that our Government are running out
of ideas and that our great country, which fought off the massed forces
of fascism from 1939 onwards, had the vision to create the national
health service, has been present at the birth of so many of the
world’s great inventions and is home to some of the greatest
educational establishments in the world, should be capable of so much

Queen’s Speech had Crosby’s fingerprints are all over it.
They left quite a mark—besmirched it, we might say—but as
my right hon. Friend the Member for Doncaster North said yesterday, the
speech failed completely to grasp the magnitude of the moment. It is
ironic that the person in charge of the Government’s xenophobia
strategy is himself an immigrant. I am from a family of immigrants: my
family have only been in the UK since about 1066. In fact, Her Majesty,
who gave the Gracious Speech, has Germanic roots herself. We should
embrace our country’s history and the fact that it is made up of
so many different
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000264">Is
this really it? Is this all the Government have to offer? The response

leaving
power.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000265">What
is this Government’s vision? They have lost the triple A status
and there has been no reduction in the deficit in the past year. What
do they want the last two 
<?notus-xml column=241?>years of their cruel, divisive, incompetent and directionless reign to
be about? The Home Secretary seems to think it is funny, but the people
of Derbyshire were not laughing when they reflected on her and her
party’s record last week. Austerity has failed, so what is the
alternative vision for which this Government will be remembered? Will
they now simply indulge in the most pernicious kind of blame game? If
the Government have no vision or cannot agree on what they want to do,

we have seen on immigration is incompetence and confusion. Only one in

the very same time that the Government are doing so little to
investigate potential abuses of the system, we have seen a big drop-off

the Government turn a blind eye to abuses of the minimum wage. Indeed,
with their workfare policy, they seem as keen as ever to send out the
message that people should be grateful for what they get and to push
more workers into poverty. People are concerned that foreign workers,
legal and illegal, are working for less than the minimum wage. The
fuzzy line between the cost of housing and work is enabling
unscrupulous firms to exploit workers’ desire to put money on
the table. I am talking not about those who do not contribute, but
about the very people who are fighting day and night to earn enough
money so that their family can
eat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:25:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Where was

toughened up to ensure that firms that act in that way are stopped and
that British workers get a fair crack of the whip when they are trying
to get into the jobs market. Where was the Government’s
commitment to do something about that?
Is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:26:03"></hs_TimeCode> it any wonder
that the voters in Derbyshire rejected the governing parties so

on other reasons why Derbyshire’s voters rejected the
Government. On banking, we needed to see real
reform. Government net lending has fallen  in 18 of the last 24
months as more and more of the Government’s money has been given
to the same big four banks. That was a problem when the Government came
to power, and yet it has got worse in month after month. Failed
Government strategy follows failed Government strategy. In the three
months to February 2013, there was an additional £4.8 billion
fall in lending to small
businesses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:26:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000273" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000273">Labour
proposes something bigger. We propose a local banking network to put
banks back at the heart of their communities. There must be a
fundamental change in decision making to ensure that decisions about
businesses are taken by people who understand those businesses, not by
somebody 70 miles away. Bank lending should no longer focus more and
more on London; there must be proper regional and local banking that
sees money lent to small businesses within local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000274" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000274">The
people cannot be fooled. They know that they are worse off under this
Government than before 2010. They will be £891 worse off by
2015. They know that there is a cost-of-living crisis, but they have
seen no action on train fares, payday loans or fuel costs. They have
seen no action on the construction industry at a time when it is
struggling. Labour has proposed a reduction in the VAT on home
improvements to 5%, which is supported by the Federation of Small
Businesses. Young people face a jobs crisis. Let us end the debate on
whether they want work or not. Let us expose those who do not by having
a jobs guarantee that ensures that all young people know that they will
have an opportunity to get into
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000275" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000275">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:28:13"></hs_TimeCode>
is no serious growth strategy. The only growth strategy seems to be,
“Let’s see if we can get kids to buy fags or get people
to drink themselves stupid on cheap supermarket booze.” The
Government have dropped the plans for plain cigarette packaging and
minimum alcohol pricing that the Prime Minister promised. Where was the
promised legislation on pub companies that we expected to hear about in
the Queen’s Speech? We must support our pubs. We must ensure
that more people drink in them and that less people drink at home,
where much more problem drinking
occurs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:28:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000276" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0003.htm#13050920000276">As
colleagues have said, the Queen’s Speech was an opportunity for
the Government to show that they had listened to the message that came
from people across the country last week and to show that they have a
strategy to do something about the problems that face us. We now know
that the Government will not take the serious action that is required,
but will limp on with the Liberals and Conservatives unsure about what
they can agree on. The Queen’s Speech has demonstrated that this
is a mongrel Government without a proper agenda. The country is ready

provided stricter controls on the use of CCTV, cut police numbers over

me turn to the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which
was introduced today. It will radically reform the way in which
antisocial behaviour is tackled, putting the needs of victims and
communities first. The Bill will ensure that the front-line

effective and streamlined powers. The community remedy, which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:53:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

the community trigger, give victims and communities a real say in how
antisocial behaviour is dealt with. The community trigger will empower
the most vulnerable in society, giving them the power to make agencies
take persistent problems seriously. He asked about the details. We have
introduced a safeguard, which will mean that councils and the police
cannot set the threshold higher than three complaints, but can set it
lower if they wish. I am also happy to confirm to him that the
legislation makes it clear that third parties, including Members of
this House, can activate the trigger on behalf of victims,

securing an antisocial behaviour order

perpetrators.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:54:59"></hs_TimeCode> criminal
behaviour order will be available to deal with the most antisocial
individuals and will carry a maximum sentence of five years on breach.

try to stop certain behaviour before it escalates. While breach would
not result in a criminal record, it would still carry serious
penalties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:55:03"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are those who say that agencies should act on the first report, rather
than on the second or third reports. Of course they should, but local

legislation will give them more powers, and I hope that they will

We spend more than  £3 billion a year on prisons and
almost £1 billion a year on delivering sentences in the
community, but reoffending rates have barely changed. That is why the
system needs to change. Many Labour Members oppose the proposals on the
ground that they represent some kind of privatisation, but they need to
get out of their ideological straitjackets and look at the wider
picture. Everyone wants reoffending rates to come down, and we all know
that the vast majority of crimes are committed by a very small
proportion of the population. Every one of those habitual repeat

important, the measures will ensure that those serving sentences of
less than 12 months will receive rehabilitation services for the first
time. All those measures will make a radical difference. Our using the
expertise of the private sector and of the many really good charities
that work in this area will result in a rehabilitation revolution,

record the fact that I am one of the vice-chairs of Labour Friends of
Israel. I am pleased that we are having this important debate today; it
presents a timely opportunity to discuss the nefarious role of
Hezbollah in the middle east and beyond. This organisation is
aggravating the current situation in Syria, creating instability in
Lebanon and threatening not only Israel but nations across the globe.
The heartbreaking news coming to us from Syria every day reminds us how
complex and fragile is the situation all over the middle east. One
large cloud lurking over all these difficult situations is the presence
of Hezbollah, and it is that presence that led me to seek this
debate.</hs_Para>

turning to the current political situation in Syria, Lebanon and the

organisation with a strong paramilitary force, independent of the
Lebanese state. It was established in the early 1980s, and its fighters
were organised and trained by a contingent of the Iranian revolutionary
guards. Iran and Syria are its main sponsors, providing financial,
political and military support to the organisation. The deputy leader

reason for the new impetus was the acceptance that Hezbollah is not
merely a Lebanese-based militant and political organisation, but a
growing international terror network, working in tandem with Iran.
Anyone in any doubt about the need for European action need only look
at the number of international plots allegedly initiated by Hezbollah
in recent months, one of which tragically succeeded when a bomb killed
five Israeli tourists and their Bulgarian driver outside
Bulgaria’s Burgas airport in July last year. Two weeks prior to
that deadly attack, the Cypriot authorities arrested dual
Swedish-Lebanese citizen Hossam Taleb Yaacoub, a self-confessed
Hezbollah member, for plotting to murder Israeli tourists in Cyprus. In
court, the suspect said that Hezbollah had spies around the world
monitoring locations that Jews and Israelis frequented, in order to
plan
attacks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:11:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000340">This
debate is about Hezbollah and other Iranian-supported terrorist
organisations. According to Matthew Levitt of the Washington Institute
for Near East Policy, what we are seeing is the result of new,
heightened co-operation between Hezbollah and the Iranian Quds force,
itself under EU sanctions for its operatives’ role in supporting
Bashar al-Assad’s violence against Syrian civilians. In addition
to the bombing in Bulgaria and the foiled attack in Cyprus, there have
been recent foiled attacks linked to Iran and Hezbollah in Bangkok,
Baku, Tbilisi and Mombasa, as well as a bombing in New Delhi, in India,
which caused severe injury. Since the bombing in Bulgaria and the
emergence of clear evidence of Hezbollah’s role in Syria, there
has been greater pressure on the EU to list Hezbollah as a terrorist
organisation, something that a number of European countries are
resisting.</hs_Para>

is there resistance? Although the previous Government proscribed
Hezbollah’s military wing, Hezbollah’s significant role
in Lebanese politics is often cited as the reason why the UK has not
gone further and proscribed the whole organisation, which even its
leader says operates under a single command structure. The misplaced
belief that Hezbollah’s politicians are legitimate and
independent from its deadly terrorism is also behind the EU’s
inaction. However, with Hezbollah politicians recently being
responsible for causing the collapse of the Lebanese
Government—a Government they have long dominated through
military strength rather than votes—now is the time to expose
Hezbollah’s supposed role in supporting Lebanese stability for
the fallacy that it is. Hezbollah’s evil role in perpetuating
the brutal military crackdown by Bashar al-Assad against his own
people—again, as much a political as a military
operation—further demonstrates that any attempts to draw some
military/political distinction are naive at
best.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000342" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000342">Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:14:03"></hs_TimeCode>,

Hezbollah<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:13:56"></hs_TimeCode>, as
recent developments in Lebanon and Syria appear to have undermined the
Government’s argument that has sought to separate out
Hezbollah’s military wing from its political operations. I urge
the Government to extend the UK’s proscription of
Hezbollah’s military wing to the whole organisation, and I would
go further. With cracks beginning to show in French and German
opposition to proscription, now is the time for the Government to use
the cross-party consensus and make the case for tough EU
action.</hs_Para>

a full ban on Hezbollah may be difficult to achieve, but even an EU ban

the politics and social fabric of Lebanon for many years, most recently
by undermining the Lebanese Government through a joint political and
military effort. It also remains a clear and present military danger to
millions of Israeli men, women and children, with tens of thousands of

Tehran.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000345" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000345">It

for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow (Mr McCann) for raising
this important issue; for the clear and unequivocal support that he has
given to the forces of stability in the middle east; for the way that
he has pointed out the risks and the dangers that Hezbollah action
poses in the area; for his support 
<?notus-xml column=255?>for the state of Israel; and for his courtesy in sending me a copy of
his speech, which has helped me to tailor my response. I will make some
comments for the record on the activities of Hezbollah, and on how the

terrorist organisations.</hs_Para>

Gentleman set out at the beginning of his speech his view and his sense
of the origins of Hezbollah. Let me add my own comments. The United
Kingdom Government concur that Hezbollah was born during the Lebanese
civil war and in the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in
1982. From the outset, resistance to Israel has been an important part
of Hezbollah’s raison d’être. Hezbollah seeks to
represent Lebanon’s Shi’a community and over time it has
gained significant electoral support. As a major political force and
the largest non-state military force in the country, Hezbollah clearly
plays an important role in Lebanon, but its actions have often been
highly destabilising.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050920000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000348">Four members
of Hezbollah have been indicted by the Special Tribunal for Lebanon for
involvement in the killing of former Prime Minister Hariri in 2004, as
the hon. Gentleman mentioned. Hezbollah’s provocative actions
led to the 2006 conflict with Israel, which caused extensive damage and
casualties within Lebanon. It has refused to disarm, despite the
requirements of UN Security Council resolution 1701. Indeed, it has
continued to strengthen its arsenal, with Iranian and Syrian
assistance.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050920000349" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000349">The hon.
Gentleman was good enough to recognise the dilemma facing not only this
Government but other Governments in the EU that at other times
Hezbollah has played a pragmatic political role in Lebanon—there
might be all sorts of reasons for that—including as a member of
the current caretaker Government. Also, in recent years it has helped
to ensure that the southern border with Israel has remained relatively
quiet.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000350" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000350">As
the hon. Gentleman also noted, Hezbollah has a relationship with Iran
that stretches back to the establishment of the movement. Iran has
provided Hezbollah with money, arms and advice from the outset, and it
continues to do so. Iran’s supreme leader is also a source of
religious authority for Hezbollah. In Syria and elsewhere, Hezbollah
continues to work closely with Iran and in ways that the UK would argue
certainly do not represent Lebanese interests.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050920000351" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000351">However, it
is difficult to say that Hezbollah is simply an Iranian proxy.
Hezbollah’s leaders do not act solely at Iran’s behest
and they tend to factor in domestic considerations, including the
impact on Lebanon and on the Shi’a community, when making
decisions—and sometimes when not making decisions.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050920000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000352"><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>My
right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has asserted yet again that the
EU proscription of Hezbollah, which the hon. Gentleman made a
significant part of his remarks, has become a topical issue in recent
months with the announcement by the previous Bulgarian Government on 5
February, implicating Hezbollah’s military wing in the atrocious
bomb attack on a bus in Burgas last July, which killed five Israeli
tourists and the Bulgarian bus driver. The assessment of the
involvement of Hezbollah’s military wing is shared by the United
Kingdom<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:20:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The
guilty verdict in the trial of a Hezbollah operative in Cyprus,
concluded on 21 March, is still further evidence of Hezbollah’s
role in terrorist attacks or planned attacks on EU soil over the past
12 months.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=256?><hs_Para UID="13050920000353" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000353">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>
response, therefore, to the murderous terrorist attack at Burgas
airport, and in light of the disrupted plot in Cyprus, we are calling
for Europe to deliver a robust response. We firmly believe that an
appropriate EU response would be to designate Hezbollah’s
military wing as a terrorist organisation. That would be in line with
our national proscription of Hezbollah’s military wing, to which
the hon. Gentleman referred. The UK proscribed Hezbollah’s
External Security Organisation in 2001. In 2008, the proscription was
extended to include the whole of Hezbollah’s military apparatus,
namely the Jihad Council and all the units reporting to it—that
is, the military wing.</hs_Para>

is worth highlighting from the outset the distinction that I am making
between Hezbollah’s political and military wings. I am referring
to Hezbollah’s military wing, and not to Hezbollah as an
organisation, as a terrorist group. It is a difficult distinction to
make. The hon. Gentleman set out his case very well. At present the
United Kingdom is still persuaded that the military and political wings
of Hezbollah are organisationally distinct. It is important to
recognise that Hezbollah’s political wing is and will remain an
important part of Lebanon’s political scene. The EU shares that
consensus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:21:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000355" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000355">However,
I believe very firmly that EU designation of the Hezbollah military
wing would send out a clear message, as the hon. Gentleman stated, that
we condemn the terrorist activities of the military wing of Hezbollah
and that terrorist activities on European soil will not go unpunished.
We believe the evidence gathered from the investigation into the Burgas
attack and from the Cypriot trial into the foiled attack by a Hezbollah
operative to be sufficient to warrant designation action under the EU
common position 931—the EU’s designation process. We will
continue to work closely with our European partners on this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:22:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000356" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000356">Let
me say a little more. From the tone of the hon. Gentleman’s
remarks and the sense behind it, he wants to be very clear about what
we are doing and how determined we are to carry it through. We will
take the lead in the EU in initiating CP 931 action in response to what
we believe has been an attack on EU soil. A number of other EU member
states and the US, Canada and Israel have also called for the EU to
take action. We are sharing information with our EU partners before
calling for a meeting of the common position 931 working
group to discuss our proposal for a designation. We expect this meeting
to take place in the coming weeks—within the next four weeks.
The UK has compiled a core script to address any concerns raised by
member states ahead of the working group and to explain the
implications of proceeding with
designation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:23:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000357">One
of the issues which is obvious and which might be raised is the fear of
some that proscription might contribute to instability in Lebanon. I am
sure that the hon. Gentleman shares my view that EU designation of
Hezbollah’s military wing would not run contrary to our shared
support for Lebanon’s stability. We see no reason why
designation would in itself affect the EU’s positive
relationship with the present Lebanese Government or the EU’s
assistance to the Lebanese Government. So we do not assess that our
designation of Hezbollah’s military wing and the EU’s
designation of Hezbollah’s military wing would affect the
legitimate political role currently played by Hezbollah in Lebanon. In
fact, we 
<?notus-xml column=257?>believe that there is a greater risk in Europe in doing nothing or not
enough in response to Burgas and
Cyprus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:24:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050920000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130509/debtext/130509-0004.htm#13050920000358">Moving
on to other elements that the hon. Gentleman raised, we are also deeply
concerned by credible information that Iran and Hezbollah are providing
military support to the Syrian Government. Iran’s assistance
extends to providing technical advice, training, equipment
and weapons to aid Assad’s brutal repression of the
Syrian people. Such support is unacceptable and in direct contravention
of the UN embargo on the export of weapons by Iran in UN Security
Council resolution 1747.</hs_Para>

too, is providing significant support to Assad, through both direct
military intervention and through assistance and advice to the Syrian
forces. We condemn this involvement. As well as aiding Assad's brutal
repression of the Syrian people, such involvement violates and
undermines Lebanon's policy of dissociation and so threatens the
country’s security. During my visit to Beirut last week, I urged
all Lebanese parties to put Lebanon's interest first and to stop
sending their sons over the border to Syria to die, because the only
certainty that will result is that Syria’s war will come over
the border to Lebanon. The policy of dissociation has worked so far,
despite the fragility in Lebanon, and it is essential that that

to other Iranian-sponsored terrorist groups, we are seriously concerned
by Iran’s support for terrorist groups that undermine regional
stability. Iran provides  
<?notus-xml column=258?>financial resources, military equipment and training of groups not only
to Hezbollah but to other groups such as Palestinian Islamic Jihad and,
to a lesser extent, Hamas. Such support undermines Iran's claim to

are also increasingly concerned by Iran's involvement in terrorism
outside its borders through the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Quds
force, including in Thailand, India, Georgia, Azerbaijan and Kenya,
where two Iranian men were recently sentenced to life in prison by a
Kenyan court for planning to carry out bombings in Nairobi and other
cities last year. We are committed to the toughest possible

confirm for clarity that we recognise the grave concerns regarding
Hezbollah and Iranian-supported terrorist groups and we are taking what
action we can accordingly. We believe in particular, very much on the
lines set out by the hon. Gentleman, that Europe can and must act, and
I hope that I have been able to persuade him that I and my ministerial
colleagues will continue to engage with our European counterparts in
pursuance of that objective. What the middle east needs most
desperately now is peace and stability. It is difficult to see the part
being played by Hezbollah’s military wing or by Iran in relation
to that. The time for ending the cycle of violence perpetuated by Assad
and his regime is now, and the time to bring peace and stability to the
