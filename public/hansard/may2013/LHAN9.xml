My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:04:59"></hs_TimeCode>
Lords, we estimate that 54 deaths and 185 serious casualties would be
avoided annually across Great Britain if single/double summer
time were adopted. However, this would have a much
wider effect on the economy and society, which must also be
taken into account. The Department for Transport does not hold road
casualty statistics from before 1979. Officials are investigating
whether other organisations hold the statistics. If they can be
obtained, I will make them
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:06:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000003"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Tanlaw" PimsId="4200" UID="13052251000555" xid="1459" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000555">Lord
Tanlaw:</Member></B> If I heard the noble Earl correctly, it is very
encouraging that the Department for Transport now recognises the
connection between daylight saving and a reduction in accidents.
Indeed, the statistics seem to prove that. Is the noble Earl aware that
it is 45 years since 1968 and that 40 transient Transport
Ministers have taken on the job since then? The Minister seems to be
the first one who has seen this connection. Will he therefore consider
having a debate to deal with the full implications of daylight saving
and give an undertaking that, whatever happens with Scotland over
independence or any concessions given to it, the time in Scotland will
remain the same as south of the
border<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:08:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Attlee:</Member></B> My Lords, the department’s admission that
there would be casualty savings is not new, but the available savings
for each year as we reduce the overall number of casualties are only
approximately one-third of the annual reduction in casualties that we
expect. I would be delighted to have a debate in your Lordships’
House, but of course that is a matter for the usual

in the order of £5 billion. He was much vaguer about the

serious disadvantages. In the aviation industry, for instance, in the
long term it would be positive. However, it would take three years to
adapt to the time change, and the aviation industry would need five
years’ notice of the change. In addition, it would need another
three years if we wanted to go

worth while looking at the history book rather than the crystal ball on
this issue? It has been tried once and Parliament, the
Government and presumably public opinion—my memory is not that

successful and that we should revert to the previous situation. In the
spirit of openness, will the Minister place in the Library a copy of

<I>Hansard</I> will be very illuminating as to why at that point it was
decided not to persist with the experiment. As the aviation industry
has developed considerably since the trial, it would have much greater
effect on that industry. It would probably not have such an adverse

because much more artificial lighting is now used by

which this matter will eventually be resolved will be through a
political solution. It is important that we bear in mind the change in
circumstances. As the noble Lord is aware, we have at stages changed
the way that the arms embargo has been applied. We started by providing
very basic equipment such as cameras and satellite phones, and
training, with a view to making sure that the abuses that were being
committed in Syria were documented. We then stepped that up: we
supplied generators, water purification tablets and other items of
humanitarian support. However, after January of this year, when the
arms embargo was amended, we stepped up support again and this time
provided protective gear and protective armoured vehicles. We are
seeking a further amendment to increase the pressure on the Assad
regime to say that, at this stage, no options are off the

the Russian-American conference will be successful. We should give it
every possible support. I suggest to my noble friend that one of the
things we might do at the upcoming G8 discussions is to try to recruit
as many people as possible to commit themselves to funding the huge
refugee problem in Turkey and in Jordan. She will be well aware that
Jordan is almost breaking under the strain. Sadly, in the past few
days, for the first time, we have seen refugees from Syria being turned
back because Jordan, which is a well intentioned state, is simply
unable to deal with them. Will she consider suggesting that Ministers
at the G8 make the best pitch they possibly can to get multilateral
support for the refugees in Turkey and, even more, in
Jordan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:17:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000023"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Warsi" PimsId="5263" UID="13052251000576" xid="1971" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000576">Baroness

friend’s comments. She comes to these matters with great
expertise. Of course, I share her concerns. There has been the largest
humanitarian aid appeal ever, of $1.5 billion—71% of that has
been funded, but it is still tragically underfunded. The latest Friends
of Syria meeting, which took place in April, was about making sure that
donor countries that had pledged actually put their money on the table.
We have seen an increase, and we continue to push for that increase.
The Foreign Secretary is today in Oman, again at a core group of the
Friends of Syria meeting, to build the basic foundations for a
political solution to be more likely at the Geneva meeting. Of course,
the issue of humanitarian aid will be discussed there, as it will be at

Was it de jure

it recognition as a belligerent status? All these matters are governed
by strict rules of public international law, as the noble Baroness will

relation to the specific legal recognition. The recognition at this
stage is because we feel that the transitional national coalition
represents a broad coalition of the views of the Syrian people.

Resolution 1325, it was agreed in 2000 and further in 2010 that
women—both women from the country and women from

apply as strictly as they can what seems to me  to be the
essential criterion: that, as a result of any intervention, the people
concerned—the mass of the population in Syria—will be
better off? Unless the Government can be assured that they would be

are no no-risk options. Every option on the table and every potential
option carries with it risks. That is why we firmly stand by the
position that a political solution is the way to resolve this matter.
Of course, at the same time, we cannot just stand by and allow a
situation that has led to 80,000 people being killed, half the
population of Syria being displaced and abuse happening on a daily
basis, and say that the best option is to do nothing. That is why we
have developed our policy on an incremental basis. We will continue to
do so, and I assure noble Lords, including my noble friend, that I will
continue to come back to this House and ensure that its
views are fully taken into consideration in developing that
policy.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/C93FB7B03ACC08E46CEAA2BE93EEBCE9B7AE24BB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, the first thing to say is
that e-lending is indeed increasing. It is still about 3% of the total,
but it is undoubtedly increasing. Non-print book rights holders are
currently conferred lending rights by the Copyright, Designs and
Patents Act 1988. The law requires library authorities to reach
appropriate agreements with non-print rights holders and with other
parties on behalf of those rights holders. Indeed, library authorities
offering e-lending must do so by contracting the services of
third-party aggregators, who liaise with publishers on their
behalf<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:24:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000035"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Howarth of Newport" PimsId="4870" UID="13052251000588" xid="1872" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000588">Lord

It really is a horrible thing to happen. It has happened to me, so I
sympathise with them. Our view is that action taken to reduce flood
risk is the best way of keeping insurance available and affordable,
which is why we are spending more than £2.3 billion over four
years to tackle flooding and, indeed, coastal erosion risks. I have a

Commons have been asking questions at almost weekly intervals ever

of the infrastructure that allows waste water to be taken away when

Chairman of Committees (Lord Sewel):</Member></B> My Lords, on 2 June
2010, the House agreed to appoint Mr Paul Kernaghan as the Commissioner
for Standards for an initial period of three years. In April of this
year, following consultation with the commissioner himself and the
chairman of the sub-committee on Lords’ interests, the noble
Baroness, Lady Manningham-Buller, the Clerk of the Parliaments invited
the House Committee to agree that Mr Kernaghan should be appointed for
a further three years. The House Committee approved the reappointment
for a further, final three-year term. I therefore beg to move that the
House do extend the term of appointment of Mr Kernaghan to 1 June

Committees give assurances that this will be the final contract? I have
no objection to the extension, but there are good reasons for giving a
parliamentary commissioner a fixed contract. It would be a worrying
situation if, perhaps in 2016, the chairman or another chairman came
along and said, “Perhaps we will extend again”. That

Lords, following the gracious Speech, predictably and understandably,
there was considerable interest in the Bills which were read out. One
major newspaper chose to use a scaling system of one to five to
describe the importance of each Bill in terms of its impact on our
lives, with a crown motif. The Intellectual Property Bill was given no
less than three—perhaps best described as the triple crown.

recognise the importance that intellectual property rights play in our

background to the Bill. In November 2010, the Prime Minister
commissioned a review of intellectual property and growth—the
so-called Hargreaves review. It examined how the intellectual property
framework could better contribute to UK economic growth. The Government
responded in August 2011, broadly accepting the recommendations and
committing to bring forward policy proposals. Some of these require
primary legislation, others secondary legislation, and some can be
handled outside the legislative framework. A number of proposals were
brought forward in the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act
2013, which was given Royal Assent last month, as your Lordships will
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:43:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

called on the Government to take action on the important and growing
design sector and to deal with the “patchwork” of
intellectual property rights for designs which puts it at a
disadvantage 
<?notus-xml column=849?>in comparison with other sectors. The
Government’s call for evidence on the UK design legal framework
in September 2011 led to further thinking and analysis. This was
followed by a formal consultation in September 2012. I am now pleased
to bring to this House a Bill which seeks to implement the results of
that

mind, the Bill before your Lordships has three broad aims: first, to
simplify and improve design and patent protection to help businesses
and, in particular, small and medium-sized enterprises; secondly, to
clarify the intellectual property legal framework; and, thirdly, to
ensure that the international IP system supports UK businesses
effectively. The Bill proposes changes to help businesses to better
understand what is protected under the law, reduce the need for costly
litigation and to provide greater certainty for investors in new
designs and technologies.

turn to the issues facing businesses which the Bill seeks to address.
Businesses will benefit from greater legal certainty and clarity over
what can be protected. This will allow investment in new design, with
lower risk of copying, and a potential for an increase in trade.

particularly small businesses, have told the Government that their
designs are often blatantly and deliberately copied. The Government

introduces a new criminal offence for deliberate copying in the course
of business. To clarify: if a person deliberately copies a registered
design without the consent of its owner in order to profit from it,
they would be subject to criminal sanctions. A conviction would require
the high standard of proof necessary in any criminal case. In addition,
enforcement agencies would bring proceedings in criminal cases only if
it were in the public interest to pursue a
conviction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T11:46:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000082">Extending
criminal sanctions to registered designs would create a coherent
approach to enforcement and protection. Infringers do not divide up the
rights they plan to steal. If criminals produced a fake product, for
example a golf club, they would steal the golf club design as much as
the trade mark and any copyright existing in the instructions for use
and the packaging. The sanction would act as a deterrent and provide
proportionate punitive measures. A criminal offence will only apply to
deliberate and intentional copying of a registered design. Where
someone has infringed a registered design right unintentionally it
would continue to be up to the parties to pursue any case with the
civil courts if they chose to do so. We will have ample opportunity to

Government are also seeking to simplify the law and intellectual
property framework to provide better support to businesses. This will
include making it easier for businesses to enforce their design rights

international regimes. In particular, we want to make it easier for
small businesses and individual designers to use and navigate the

businesses who want to register in a number of countries and will lead
to direct savings. A legal firm has estimated that the cost of
registration in six countries is currently up to £7,500. In

addition to reducing costs for business by streamlining processes and
registration systems, this Bill also seeks to reduce costs for business
in the area of litigation. At present the cost of IP litigation is seen
by many as prohibitive. For example, a small or medium-sized enterprise
responding to our consultation told us that it had received advice that
it would cost it £100,000 to bring revocation proceedings
against a competitor’s patent. The potential for this level of
cost meant that it was unable to challenge in court a patent that it
believed to be invalid. In this Bill we are expanding the Patent
Opinions Service and introducing a new design opinion service. The
services will provide low-cost alternatives to costly

proposes a number of changes to aspects of patents legislation, to
provide clarity and legal certainty to users of the patent system. An

intellectual property for innovation and growth. It noted, however,
that IP policy development was characterised by an incomplete evidence

as an incentive to improve the way in which policy development takes

greater protection for design work. However, the Hargreaves report

to protect designs—UK registered designs, UK unregistered
designs, UK copyright, community registered and community unregistered
designs. Indeed, the Hargreaves report recommended that no action be
taken until a much more detailed survey of evidence had been
prepared.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000108">The
issue is complicated by the wide range of industries involved.
Different industries have different levels and types of need from the
IP framework. For example, the fashion industry lives with a high rate
of appropriation of its designs. It does, however, frequently pursue
infringement of trade
marks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000109">Evidence
submitted to the Hargreaves review was predominantly concerned with
protection and enforcement issues and raised the discrepancy in levels
of protection between design rights, which protect technical design,
and copyright, which largely protects artistic designs. This applied
both in terms of the duration and availability of rights and their
enforcement. Unlike copyright, which is supported by criminal sanctions
and is therefore of interest to police and trading standards officers,
design rights offer only civil sanctions. However, Clause
13, which sets out to change that, applies only for registered designs,
not unregistered
designs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000110">Clearly,
there is a case for offering effective remedies to designers who find
that their ideas are simply taken over and used without compensation,
and this situation is exacerbated in the small companies that make up
the design community, which have often invested time and money in
developing these designs but either could not afford to take
enforcement action or found the law inadequate to do so. Can the
Minister explain the rationale for excluding unregistered designs, when
ACID reports that the majority of the UK’s 350,000 designers
rely on unregistered design rights, with 18,000 to 25,000 unregistered
designs lodged with ACID each year, compared with only 4,000 registered
with the authorities annually? The development of the copyright hub may
well be relevant to the design sector and perhaps the Minister could
say whether it is envisaged that it will include design interests of
interest to this Bill. If it does, that needs to be taken into
account.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000111">The

participating EC countries. The agreement means that it will be
possible to apply to the European Patent Office for a single patent
that will have effect across all participating countries and, for some
issues, can be litigated in the new unified patent court. This seems to
be a very good example of the EU working together and countries coming
together to harmonise regulation and assist businesses. I trust that
this is not one of the issues on which the Prime Minister will be
seeking a UK opt-out. There is likely to be sufficient work allocated
to the UK to justify two centres for the UPC in the UK. Can the

Clement-Jones:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
characteristically careful exposition of the Bill and for the
amendments to legislation briefing that he provided beforehand. I am

not re-rehearse some of the points made on the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill, when we had a full canter through the
intellectual property policy issues. As the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, said, later in the year we will have the statutory
instruments bringing forward further policy recommendations of the
Hargreaves report. I agree with him, however, that the separation
between the DCMS and BIS in terms of intellectual property and the
creative industries is unfortunate. It was not done by the previous
Government. It is not being done by this Government, but a common
intellectual property and creative industries Minister is much to be
desired.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000120">I
broadly welcome the changes in the field of patent and design law made
by the Bill. As the Minister says, it is particularly technical in
nature. The setting-up of a new unified patent court is an essential
ingredient of the new unitary patent, which is effectively the
realisation of a long-standing, six-year ambition by the IPO, strongly
supported by successive British Governments. There will be a branch of
the central division of the court in London. Here I must declare an
interest as a partner in a global law firm. I hope that the parties
will have the freedom to choose which branch of the court to litigate
in. I welcome many of the other provisions relating to patents, which
will benefit small business in terms of simplification and cost. I hope
that the Minister will confirm that court fees in particular will be
affordable to small
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000121">There
is, however, clearly confusion between the Government’s press
release, which estimated some £200 million of
benefits, and the Explanatory Notes, which put them at £2
million per annum over 20 years—yet another
demonstration of the benefits of EU membership. Generally, by doing
away with the need for validation in every country, it should mean that
the cost of protecting 
<?notus-xml column=857?>inventions for the whole of the internal market will be much reduced.
However, my noble friend will be aware of considerable concern about
the changes to the opinion service under Clause 15(4), which gives
power to the comptroller to revoke a patent after issuing an opinion.
This, it is strongly argued, would be a deterrent to using that
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000122">I
welcome many of the detailed measures in relation to registered and
unregistered design right which, as the Alliance for Intellectual
Property says, has long been a forgotten IP right. It is also one which
Anti Copying In Design, or ACID, has been pressing for. In particular,
there is: the change in ownership of unregistered designs commissioned
by a third party so that the designer will be the initial owner of the
design, not the commissioner; clarifying the meaning of
“qualification by first marketing”; the introduction of a
non-binding opinion service for registered designs; and enabling UK
SMEs to gain protection, in addition to the EU, through territories
covered by the Hague

the scope of the Long Title provides an opportunity to extend some of
the provisions of the Bill relating to designs and to correct some
anomalies within existing IP law. I would like to outline those today
and I hope we will be debating them on further stages of the Bill. On
measures relating to design, Clause 13 introduces a new criminal
offence of deliberate infringement of a registered design right. While
this is a welcome move—and I do not agree with some of the
points made by the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson—to be of any
benefit to the vast majority of designers in this country, the Bill
needs amending so that criminal sanctions will also apply to the
deliberate infringement of unregistered
designs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000124">Design
is of key importance to the UK economy. It is estimated that there are
in the region of 350,000 designers in the UK, as has been mentioned,
and that UK businesses spend some £35.5 billion on design each
year. The majority of the UK’s design community are lone, micro
or small and medium-sized enterprises. Eighty-seven per cent have fewer
than 10 employees and 60% have fewer than four. Yet there are only
approximately 4,000 designs registered annually in the UK. Each year,
between 18,000 and 25,000 unregistered designs are lodged with
ACID’s data design bank by its approximately 1,100 members, so
it is reasonable to assume that the majority of the UK’s
designers rely on unregistered design rights and
copyright.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000125">The
introduction of criminal sanctions for deliberate registered design
infringement is of course a progressive step, as this is the first time
that criminal sanctions will mirror those for copyright and trade
marks, but why is this new criminal offence limited to the infringement
only of registered designs? Surely, criminal sanctions need to apply to
unregistered design rights, as they do to copyright, to have any real
and lasting benefit to UK designers. I plan to make the case in greater
detail in Committee, but criminal sanctions have been available for
copyright infringement since 1862, and for trade mark infringement
since 1994. Criminal prosecutions have been used sparingly, sensibly
and appropriately. Copyright, trade marks and unregistered design
rights are all property rights, and so is a registered design. But
whereas persistent copying of the first two constitutes 
<?notus-xml column=858?>a serious criminal offence punishable by up to 10
years’ imprisonment, persistent copying of designs is currently
not a criminal offence at all. This is completely
anomalous.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000126">Persistently
copying a two-dimensional drawing of a design or a design document can
therefore give rise to criminal liability. Yet when this 2D work is
converted into a 3D design, unless it is protected as a work of
artistic craftsmanship—and we have many happy memories of
discussing that on the enterprise Bill—copying that 3D version
would not be a criminal offence. I fail to understand the reason for
the policy decision behind that. How do the Government justify giving a
higher level of protection to a 2D design than is given to the 3D
manifestation of that
design?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000127">Civil
action is often very difficult, given the inequality of arms between
designer and infringer. I will give further examples of that in
Committee. In some cases we have a designer with a turnover of
£50,000 a year versus an £8 billion-turnover company. It
is grossly unequal when one considers the possibility of taking civil
action. One might argue that this was an attempt to incentivise design
registration and increase revenue for the IPO, which, of course, we
should be reminded is a trading body. I hope that the Minister will
confirm that financial considerations have not been elevated above the
needs of the majority of UK designers who rely on unregistered rights.
Finally on the new criminal penalties, why have Section 110 of the CDPA
and Section 101 of the Trade Marks Act, which ensure that company
officers are liable if conniving or consenting, not been replicated
here? Surely that is a crucial
omission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000128">I
turn to Clause 20 and the content of the annual report. The clause
contains a very welcome requirement for the Secretary of State to
report annually on the activities of the Intellectual Property Office
and how it has supported innovation and growth. The clause is, in part,
a response to the recent consultation on the role of the IPO. Overall,
this is a positive step and provides a much-needed focus for the
IPO’s activity. However, it is at the moment limited in scope
and needs to be expanded. During the consultation, UK Music argued that
there should be a requirement to report on how the activities of the
IPO have maximised growth and innovation arising from the creation and
exploitation of intellectual property. The Government accepted this
point in their response to the consultation, while acknowledging that
such a requirement cannot be restricted to existing industries and
business models. However, the commitment is not currently explicit
within the clause. Committee stage presents us with an opportunity to
incorporate a clear reference as to how the IPO’s activities
have supported IP
businesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000129">Similarly,
paragraph 91 in the Explanatory Notes that accompany the Bill suggest
that the report will cover new legislation and policy developments,
including those related to copyright licensing. The music industry made
a voluntary commitment, as part of Richard Hooper’s <I>Copyright
Works</I> report last year, to report annually on progress around joint
licensing. This is a welcome step and I believe that we can expect the
first such report from the industry via UK Music later this year. But
the Minister gave an assurance at Grand Committee stage of the
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill in January that this would be
included in 
<?notus-xml column=859?>the annual report. This is reflected in the Explanatory Notes. However,
it is not included in the clause in the Bill. Why

Report, the Minister encouraged us to think that the report would also
include updates on the state of protection of metadata and
of cross-border co-operation. The noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport,
was keen for the report to contain discussion about how the
Intellectual Property Office seeks to balance its defence of the
interests of intellectual property holders with the interests of the
dissemination of knowledge. I am sure that he will expand on that
today. Will the report also review the operation of the unified patent
and the court? I very much hope that the Minister can confirm these

are other areas where there is the opportunity to correct anomalies in
intellectual property law for potential inclusion in the Intellectual

copyright theft to match that available for physical copyright theft.
Criminal offences for online copyright theft have maximum penalties of
two years’ imprisonment. However, criminal offences for physical
copyright theft have maximum penalties of 10 years’
imprisonment. This discrepancy came about because the new offences were
introduced by secondary legislation, using the European Communities Act
1972, as part of the UK’s implementation of the copyright
directive in 2003. Penalties for new criminal offences,
introduced by secondary legislation via the ECA, are limited to two
years’ imprisonment. That was also after my right honourable
friend Vince Cable’s Private Member’s Bill, which
increased penalties for criminal copyright offences to harmonise them
with those available for trade mark offences at 10 years. I very much
hope that I have a receptive audience. Surely, criminal sanctions
should not be dependent on whether the offence is taking place in an
online or physical environment. Intellectual property is being stolen

the discrepancies in the level of financial penalties available in

aim reflects what I and many others in this House have long recognised:
that this country has a strong and vibrant creative industries sector
which, as the Secretary of State for Culture recently stated, should be
central to the UK’s economic growth. I have to say that it is a
bit rich of the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, to begin his
speech by saying that this is a sign that the Government have finally
woken up to the importance of intellectual property. I might say that
his previous Government never woke up.</hs_parafo>

the Minister that we must have a copyright regime which is fit for the
digital age. However, this should not mean that we cannot also protect
our most valuable assets—simply put, our creators. Indeed, the
title of the Bill suggests that this is what this legislation is all
about. It suggests to me that creators will at last be properly
recognised and properly paid for their works in this digital age. The

is much to commend in the Bill. However, I want to take it a step
further. Given our rich cultural history of Shakespeare, Dickens and
Elgar, it might be easy to take for granted our world-leading creators

are enriched by them, culturally and economically. Without artists, who
rely on a fair and secure copyright regime to be paid for their work,
we would be a much poorer society in so many

current copyright climate is regrettably highly divided. There is a
wide perception that large and well funded businesses such as Google
and Yahoo! have more influence than creators on decision-makers around
the world. These companies are too often portrayed, usually by
themselves, as pioneers on the frontier of digital development, held
back by the creative analogue luddites. I believe that this view of the
search engines is wrong and, more importantly, short-sighted. These
digital businesses need creators and their content to drive their
businesses as much as they need the software developers to provide new
ways to develop that

the future, as the markets converge, these businesses will demand more

However, there is a problem here, a huge problem which

to make it clear at this point that I am not joining some
populist—this week’s—bandwagon. This is an issue
which I have been raising for over a decade and I now feel I must spell
it out very simply for those who might think it has to do with tax. It
does not. It is about how these search engines, otherwise known as
content aggregators, make their money in the first place. It is also
something of which I have personal experience. As chief executive of
the Advertising Association, I visited Google back in 2005 to talk to
its management about following its mantra of “doing the right
thing” and supporting the system of self-regulation for
advertising. Its firm and first response was that it was a technology
company and that somehow that is where its value-added, its income,
came from—not
advertising.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000143">Where
is the integrity in that? If you do not think the right thing, you will
not do it. I remember thinking then that these people make the BBC look
almost humble—no mean feat. Let me explain how it works. The key
question is: how do search engines—content
aggregators—make money? How, for example, will Yahoo! recoup
more than the $1 billion it has paid for Tumblr? Yahoo! will, I
suggest, judge when the time is right to seek to attract advertisers to
Tumblr. What attracts advertisers? Good content. Yahoo! will treat that
valuable content produced by hard work and so many brilliant, creative
minds—many of them British—as free and advertisers will
pay Tumblr to appear next to that content. It is essentially a David
versus Goliath situation—David is the creator. What we as
legislators should be doing is making sure, to the best of our ability,
that David is paid. If the Google model is followed, David will
probably not be paid.</hs_para>

protecting our valuable British intellectual property. That protection

address this? I fear it will not. I am afraid that this Bill, while a
good Bill and one, I should stress, I wholeheartedly support as far as
it goes, is tinkering at the edges. Perhaps legislation is not the

said, of course, there are many positive proposals in the Bill. There
are in the region of 350,000 designers in the UK and UK businesses

welcome the greater protections which the draft Bill proposed, in
particular a more proportionate response to deliberate infringements of
design rights, although I hope that the Government will consider
further how the rights of unregistered design can equally be protected.
There will clearly be many opportunities for this House to discuss
these issues. However, as this House begins these discussions and
begins to scrutinise the Bill, I would urge the Minister and the
Government to remember the need to secure a copyright regime which
protects and nurtures our creators and creative industries. More
importantly, I urge them not to be distracted by those big businesses

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, in the introductory remarks
of the noble Viscount, for which I thank him, he used the active verbs
of strengthening, improving, simplifying and clarifying the law. The
robust contribution from the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, indicated
the metrics against which the Government may be judged in relation to
their ambition to strengthen, improve and clarify the law. The House
should be grateful to her for setting that metric, even if it appears
an impossible task, if I may say so from my inexpert

leads me to my second point. I consider my engagement with this Bill to
be a learning process. During in excess of 20 years of practising law
in Scotland before I was elected to the House of Commons, I had only
the most fleeting engagement with intellectual property law, so in
preparation for this short speech I tried to acquaint myself with some
of the complexity in this area of law. I have to say that I found it
extremely complex. I came in this morning and my heart sank somewhat
when I saw that immediately 
<?notus-xml column=863?>following me was the noble Lord, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, who will
be making his maiden speech. I suspect that my inexpertise will be
exposed substantially by his learned contribution to our debate. None
the less, I am looking forward to it, even if it has that
consequence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000151">I
welcome the Bill—I suppose that I should say that, as everyone
else has—as far as it goes. It is part of a process and it is
perfectly clear that the Government are engaged in a process and will
be judged against a number of metrics, including some that they have
set for themselves, which I shall return to in a moment. I will make
three general points and three specific points in my short
contribution. First, I welcome the Bill because it gives me, a Scot who
is a unionist, an opportunity to celebrate the United Kingdom. This is
a not entirely unique event in your Lordships’ House, but they
are fewer and further between than they used to be. This is an
opportunity for us to consider an area of UK law that is extremely
important to the whole United Kingdom, including Scotland, and we
should make the most of it. We should make the most of it particularly
in the context of what is going on in Scotland at the moment and the
important decision that the people of Scotland will have to make next
year in their
referendum<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:34:14"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is important because the Hargreaves review suggested that changes
effected at a UK level but in the context of proper international
priorities had the potential to add of the order of

are debating this Bill the day after the SNP Government in Scotland

Economy: the </I><I>C</I><I>ase for </I><I>I</I><I>ndependence.</I> For
noble Lords who have not had a chance to read it, the document does
what Scots always do when talking on this issue: they celebrate the
achievement of innovation, innovators and inventors in Scotland. I can
do it as well as everybody else: from the discovery of penicillin by
Alexander Fleming, who was born and brought up in the constituency I
represented, through the invention of television—the list is
endless, and all Scots can recite it as we learn it at our
mother’s knee—to the creation of Dolly the sheep and the
bio-industries in Scotland. However, conspicuously absent from that
document is some of the detail of how an independent Scotland,
separated from the United Kingdom and consequently from this body of
law, would seek to recreate what already exists, with all the
criticisms we have heard or that have been implied in the reviews, and
so on? How will it be done in a way that will not make Scotland a good
hunting ground for those who wish to exploit other people’s
intellectual property rights, even if for a comparatively short time in
an interim period? There is no engagement in this document with the
nuts and bolts, the detail and the
complexity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000153">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:36:07"></hs_TimeCode>
most of us who have been engaged in this debate since it started, that
is not surprising. There is a consistent failure to engage with the
nuts and bolts and the challenges of independence for Scotland, even
against the reasonable request that Scotland should be maintained at
the level that it is in a number of areas of life through this
transition period if the people of Scotland choose independence. I do
not think that there is any indication that they will, but we cannot be
complacent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is incumbent on the Government and politicians to highlight
opportunities that show the people of Scotland and of the United
Kingdom the value of the union. This is a great opportunity to do so.
This body of law is being reviewed in this considered way for the
protection of those who are innovators and inventors in Scotland. It is
a good opportunity for Ministers of the Crown legitimately to be in
Scotland, talking about something at a UK level that affects the nuts
and bolts of Scottish society in a way that does not look as though
Ministers are going there to frighten the Scottish people against the
consequences of independence but are there just to engage with them and
explain how important this area of law is. I encourage the Minister and
his colleagues in government to do just that during the process of the
Bill, and to overtly engage and make it clear to the Scottish people
how much they benefit from having this degree of
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:37:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000155">My
second general point is that this Bill highlights the value of good
regulation—the contributions thus far reveal that. There has
been a tendency in this House, particularly recently, which I fear has
been driven by the Government—to undermine the value of
regulation. Good regulation that addresses the protection of just the
sorts of skills and innovation that have been addressed in this debate
is important. It is important and valuable to the country that we are,
and it is slightly ironic that our Prime Minister should have set the
challenge to those who reviewed this to find a form of regulation that
will necessarily involve additional regulation. We have had some debate
already about the possibility of increasing and creating criminal
offences. The Prime Minister charged those responsible for this to
increase regulation in a way that will be a driver of the economy. We
should be honest that there are two sides to regulation. I make the
point that the Government should be
honest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:38:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000156">The
other area in which the Government need to be honest is that the Bill
highlights the value of the European Union. I understand that the
Hargreaves review attaches the highest immediate priority to achieving
a unified EU patent court and patent system. That is utterly
counterintuitive to the direction of travel of the public discourse on
the European Union that is going on at the moment. Why is this voice
not being heard? Where are the Government Ministers who are saying,
“Actually, there is a place in the structure of our society for
an additional European court? We think that it will help innovators and
others in a positive way to build our economy and to drive innovation
and wealth in the country”. I regret that the Government do not
have the courage to put this argument forward as strongly as they
should, and instead concentrate on the negatives in relation to the
structures of Europe while—one might say through the back
door—adding to those structures and doing it in the form of a
patent court. It is
remarkable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000157">My
specific points have already been addressed, but I will highlight them.
They relate first to Clause 13, which concerns the creation of a
criminal offence. I am compelled by the logic of the argument that if
one is to create an additional criminal offence in this area, it is
illogical to restrict it only to registered designs, when unregistered
designs in particular are such a 
<?notus-xml column=865?>significant element of this area of practice. However, in the broad
analysis, I am persuaded that the Hargreaves review recommendation in
this regard was the right one, and that the preponderance of evidence
suggests that there is no justification for an additional criminal
offence. It strikes me that in this very narrow area the creation of a
criminal offence, potentially carrying these quite significant
penalties, is taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut. It may operate in
the way in which has been suggested, which is that no one will ever
need to be prosecuted, because it will be a deterrent, but I doubt very
much that that will be the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000158">I
suspect—in fact, I probably know—that in Scotland there
is likely to be very little capacity for the investigation of offences
of this complexity. It is unlikely to become a priority over all of the
other issues that we face in relation to criminal prosecutions. I
wonder whether the noble Viscount might indicate at some stage what
degree of engagement there has been with the Crown Office, with the
Scottish Law Commission and with the Scottish Government about the
necessity or the sheer value of an additional criminal offence,
particularly in Scotland, which is a separate jurisdiction in the
criminal sense. It would be helpful to me, with the background that I
have and the ambition that I have that the Bill will have some
visibility in Scotland, to know what degree of communication there has
been with the Scottish Government and other institutions in
Scotland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000159">My
second point relates to the challenge that the Government have set
themselves to report annually in relation, effectively, to the success
of the Bill and this area of law in meeting and achieving the
objectives they set themselves in Clause 20. I wonder why the
Government have restricted this method of reporting to this area of
law. Why is it only in the area of IP law that we are to have reports
about the success of legislation against the objectives that they set
themselves? It would be an interesting principle to apply. The House
and Parliament may be encouraged to replicate this provision in other
pieces of legislation that are presented to it, so that reports over
time will show whether or not the amendments that we make to the law,
often having been persuaded by the Government that they will have
certain consequences, are having those consequences. I wonder how we
are to judge these reports. What metrics have to be applied to judge
whether or not the changes to the law are as successful as the
Government hope? I would be assisted in that regard if the noble
Viscount would, in summing up, indicate how this is to be
judged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000160">My
final point is to reinforce what my noble friend Lord Stevenson said
about the unitary court. Is it the Government’s expectation that
there will be two of these courts, and is it their plan that one of
them will sit in Scotland? If that is right, that again would be a very
welcome fact to communicate to the people of Scotland so that they
understand the importance of their place in this law in relation to
their ambitions to share in the prosperity that this suggests. I
reinforce the point I made about the United Kingdom to the noble
Viscount and I would welcome it if he gave me some indication, either
in summing up this debate or separately, of what communication there
has been 
<?notus-xml column=866?>between the Government here, the Government in
Scotland, the Scottish Parliament, the Scottish Law Commission and
other institutions in Scotland so that I can follow that up during the
course of my continued learning process in this, and can ensure that

and learned friend Lord Scott
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:47:04"></hs_TimeCode> Foscote, who
I see is lurking behind me. He rang me up and said he was going to make
me a judge of the Patents Court. I should explain, perhaps, that the
Patents Court is a sub-division of the Chancery Division, and that most
of its work is done by judges who have been patent experts all their
lives. However, because patent litigation goes on for a long time and
judges cannot sit in judgment on cases on which they have advised,
there is a need for some supernumeraries. I said to the
Vice-Chancellor, “I ought to tell you that I do not have a
single O-level in any science subject”. I am not proud of that,
but it is true; I had a very old-fashioned education. This carried no
weight at all with the Vice-Chancellor. He said that I would find it an
interesting intellectual experience, and hung up on me. It has indeed
been a most interesting intellectual experience and I have learnt just
a little bit of science along the
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000163">Maiden
speeches are not meant to be controversial. I hope it is not
controversial to say that one of the most important and problematic
provisions of the Bill is Clause 16, which introduces a new Section 88A
to the Patents Act 1977, and provides for a unified patent court. This
is a remarkably bold step forward, on which successive Governments are
to be congratulated, because it has been a very long haul indeed. It is
a long, and in many ways sad, story. The European patent
convention, which was signed in Munich in 1973, was in fact a
pan-European measure; it was not an EU measure at all. Part of the
difficulty, I suspect, is that it took the EU a very long time to
recognise that the Community patent convention was simply dead
in the water, because it was signed by only seven member
states, including the UK, when unanimity was required. It is perhaps
right to say that the failure 
<?notus-xml column=867?>of the EU to recognise that it was dead in the water is one of the
reasons why it was been such a long and hard struggle to get
to the agreement signed in Brussels last February.</hs_para>

difficulty under the European patent convention was that, although a
single application produced a bundle or sheaf of patents good in each
contracting state, enforcement of the patent rights required litigation
in different countries. Where a European patent was attacked as invalid
or enforced in infringement proceedings in the courts of a number of
different states, there were several well known—indeed, I might
say notorious —cases in which national courts administering the
same law under the European patent convention reached different
conclusions. In particular, there were several cases in which the
courts of Germany and the Netherlands reached different conclusions
from those reached in the courts of
England.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000165">That
has sometimes been explained by the very different procedure that
applied in different member states. Typically, in this country, there
would be a long trial—long oral proceedings with, perhaps, days
of cross-examination of expert witnesses—whereas, in Germany or
the Netherlands, the procedure would be conducted much more on paper.
It is therefore a truly bold and radical move that jurisdiction is now
to be divided not by national boundaries but by sectors of the fields
of science and technology in which patents are granted. It is a bold
and unpredictable move. As so often, I suggest that the devil will be
in the detail. For instance, we are told that there are to be
procedural changes made in the new unified patent court. It will be
important to see
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000166">As the
clause would enable the Secretary of State to act merely by a draft
order that requires the approval of both Houses, it will be important

order placed before both Houses by the Secretary of State to understand
just how far the unified court, as far as it sits in London—or,
as it may be, in Edinburgh—will adopt a different procedure from
that applied in the court at present. All those are matters that I hope

me, because my brother and niece were also called to the Bar at the
same Inn of Court. He has built a career filled with remarkable
achievements in the legal profession, including appointment as a
Queen’s Counsel in 1982 and serving as a High Court judge and as
a Lord Justice of Appeal. Most notably, his career as a judge

am pleased to speak in the Second Reading of the Bill, as it has
personal resonance for me. I briefly talked about the matter in a
speech that I made in your Lordships’ House following her
Majesty’s most gracious Speech. On that note, I declare an
interest in that I was previously the chairman and chief executive of
an organisation that arranged insurance schemes for the protection of
patents and copyrights. I therefore have first-hand knowledge of how
part of an organisation’s resources and finances are often
utilised for the purposes of intellectual property.</hs_para>

have been heartened by our Government’s commitment to reforming
intellectual property law ever since coming to power. We have seen a
strong and consistent desire to see the changes through in the
interests of removing obstructions for businesses and ultimately
assisting economic growth. Ian Hargreaves and his panel should be
commended for their work, particularly in the light of the Government
accepting the majority of its findings and recommendations. The
legislation in this area, as the report stated, is falling behind what
is needed and must be reformed to make the most of today’s
challenges—and, indeed, those of the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:57:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000172">At
the very heart of the Bill is the concept of helping to release
innovation that is otherwise being stifled by current intellectual
property laws. For me, some of the key proposals that will no doubt
provide the greatest returns are those intended to allow a greater
degree of flexibility to aspiring designers and creators. The
Government made clear in their response to the Hargreaves report that
they are concerned at the extent to which businesses and entrepreneurs
are restricted and prevented from realising their full potential due to
the heavy chains and shackles of outdated
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:57:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000173">I
believe in the free and competitive spirit of the market and
everybody’s right to reap the rewards of their creations, but I
also realise that innovation and creativity do not always come from
completely original, alien concepts; they are also bred from
inspirations, from the merging, adapting and fine-tuning of ideas. I am
very supportive of limiting the protection of trivial features of
design both to curtail overly opportunistic designers from making
unreasonable claims and to clear up uncertainty where cases are taken
before the
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000174">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>
also believe strongly in the provisions enabling a right of prior use
by third parties of designs that are subsequently registered by others.
Again, that is a concept based on fairness and the recognition that
substantial work is often undertaken before the process of legal
registration. It also allows for what the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills has referred to as the “limited
exploitation” which such third parties should rightly be
entitled to in the circumstances. 
<?notus-xml column=869?>However, it is also crucial that we implement measures to ensure that
our talents here at home are adequately protected and thus encouraged
to develop
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000175" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000175">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:57:07"></hs_TimeCode>
am particularly pleased to see provisions being made to amend the
Freedom of Information Act for continuing programmes of research
intended for future publication. I believe that the increased
transparency provided by the Freedom of Information Act has, on the
whole, been good for the public, not least in the name of political
accountability. However, in some circumstances, such disclosure will
inevitably pose a threat to the integrity and potential economic gain
of such research. When the Justice Select Committee looked at this
matter last year, it was informed by Universities UK that there was
strong concern across the country about how such early releases of
information are threatening the competitiveness of our universities
against each other and, perhaps more importantly,
internationally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000176">Freedom
of information is a concept introduced on the basis of it being very
much in the public interest, and I would argue that this tweaking of
the original legislation takes it even further down that road. A
natural extension of this is the introduction of protection from
infringement in relation to acts undertaken privately and, in
particular, in teaching and experimenting. It simply does not make
sense for activities undertaken with no commercial purpose to be
susceptible to laws designed to protect designers from commercial loss,
and it is good to see that the Bill takes note of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000177">In order
adequately to protect our designers and creators, we must also ensure
that the law is accessible to them and properly serves their interests.
The Bill makes very clear that the deliberate copying of a registered
design is to be rightly designated a criminal offence that is dealt
with by criminal courts, and clearly outlines the conditions and
circumstances in which an offence is to be considered as such. This is
perhaps the most important advance made by the Bill, giving designers
the concise guidance they need, further deterring those who look to
produce and sell counterfeit products, and helping to bring the law in
this area uniformly into line with that of breaching copyright and
trade marks. I am also pleased that time has deliberately been taken to
ensure appropriate lines of defence for those accused of such offences.
This is a firm policy that still ensures that genuinely innocent
individuals who unintentionally break the rules will not be caught by
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000178">As well as
ensuring strength and clarity in intellectual property laws, it is also
crucial that we streamline internationally where possible. We live in a
globalised world, and these laws must reflect that. The power which the
Bill provides for ratification of the unitary patent court agreement
will provide an essential step in seeing this beneficial mechanism
finally implemented. The opportunity for businesses to create single
EU-wide patents for products, rather than separately across all
countries, as well as to litigate where necessary in one unitary court
covering all countries, will reduce costs and administration
substantially. In fact, the Intellectual Property Office estimates that
this will benefit UK business by about £40 million per year. The
negotiations 
<?notus-xml column=870?>on this have been long and arduous for all countries
involved, and we must now seize the opportunity to make it
happen.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052251000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000179">I am
sure all the noble Lords in this House will agree that small businesses
form the backbone of our economy and will be the driving force behind
our economic recovery. I am therefore supportive of any and all
measures designed to help SMEs better utilise the systems of protection
that are available to them. In this vein, it is long overdue that we
accede to the Hague agreement, and I am extremely pleased to see this
included in the Bill. The current anomaly whereby companies can apply
for protection covering only the whole of the EU has been hampering our
small businesses for too long. They are unlikely to require such wide
protection and often find it difficult to meet the costs of such a
substantial registration. The Hague system is a sensible system, and it
is about time we implemented it in the United Kingdom, both in the name
of simplicity of administration and, even more importantly, in giving
our small businesses a route to target specific markets with their
products and services. It will also enable us to encourage other
countries to sign up, thus opening up our markets
further.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000180">Finally,
the proposed IPO opinions service for UK-registered designs seems to be
the most obvious and progressive step forward in furthering direct
government support for innovation, particularly given the success of
the existing service, which has proved both cheap and efficient to use,
and with the vast majority of opinions requested being issued within
the target timeframe of three months. In 2010, the IPO conducted a
survey of the users of its opinions service, and 70% declared that they
would be in favour of the service’s expansion. Several reviews,
including Hargreaves, have found that the expense and time needed to
resolve intellectual property disputes can actually prevent small
businesses from making proper use of their rights, and thus act as a
barrier to innovation. Therefore, such a service can be a valuable tool
in helping to avoid costly litigation. Such a service will help to
ensure that intellectual property remains the preserve of innovators,
rather than those with the deepest
pockets.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000181">Reform

the Bill. He will be very welcome there and, no doubt, in the other
debates that he will take part in as he chooses. I was not surprised
that the consultation document said that the law relating to design is
complex and difficult to understand. It went on to say that it is
difficult to enforce the law relating to design. I therefore suggest
that the Government’s proposal in Clause 13, whereby civil
remedies are given the benefit of criminal sanctions, provided there is
a deliberate breach of a registered design, will be an extremely
helpful addition.</hs_para>

was not getting paid by their suppliers, a loss of cash flow
and so on. I suggested that a public official is needed to assist them.
It is rather a similar proposition that I make now—namely, that
with registered designs it should be possible for SMEs and other
designers to have the benefit of a public official to put forward the
possibility of a criminal charge against deliberate infringements. The
public official in this case will be trading standards officers up and
down the country. I declare an interest as a vice-president of the

I want to make clear today is that, over the years, I have also had a
long interest in competition policy or competition law and the need to
deal firmly with anti-trust or anti-competitive practices. The new body
that we in this House set up—together with the other House, of
course—the Competition and Markets Authority, will be a much
more significant body than those that it replaces; it will be very
powerful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000185">I
want to make it clear that, in relation to intellectual property, there
is sometimes a tension between the general importance of competition in
promoting efficiency in the provision of goods and services and the
value of intellectual property. As many people have already said in
today’s debate, the invention of new products and new designs
and other outcomes of creative talent in the industry requires
intellectual property. However, I suggest that intellectual property
rights may be inherently anti-competitive because they create barriers
to entry into the market by others who are not the first people, and
therefore have not managed to register their property rights. If the
intellectual property is particularly powerful and lasts for an unduly
long time, surely it is anti-competitive and not what we in this House,
with this Bill, are encouraging with regard to people who are granted
intellectual
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:11:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000186">Once
obtained, intellectual property rights, whether patents, copyright or
registered design, can all operate initially as being pro-competitive,
of course, but if the protection continues for too long, beyond a
reasonable time, clearly that restricts competition from other parties
and people. For that reason, I have some doubt about the proposition in
the Bill that unregistered designs should receive the benefit of
intellectual property rights along with registered designs. It is
interesting that an unregistered design lasts for 15 years. That is a
monopoly position for 15 years, which may be less than justified. In
relation to unregistered designs, and indeed other aspects of
intellectual property, are the Government content with the period of
benefit that the owner of the patent, design or whatever it is has for
its invention and its creative
outcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:13:20"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

very welcome provision in the Bill, as other people—although not
all of them—have said, is the obligation on the Intellectual
Property Office to give a non-binding but none the less authoritative
opinion. The validity of the design is then given a firm basis, with an
opinion available that will not be costly. I noticed that the
consultative document talks about a 
<?notus-xml column=872?>modest fee of £200. As this has not been
referred to today, I do not know if the Minister could confirm whether
that is the intention, but clearly that is a very modest sum compared
with any sort of legal action that someone would otherwise have to
bring for infringement. The Federation of Small Businesses, which no
doubt has written to many of us on the subject of intellectual
property, feels very strongly that the service has helped with regard
to patents, where it has been available for some time, and could be
very useful regarding designs, enabling one to get a firm opinion from
an authoritative body without having to go through court
proceedings.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/A0C38E6075FF16434B93F26D6C9ECBAB5A8C958D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Earl of Erroll:</Member></B> My Lords, the excellent maiden speech by
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe, suddenly
reminded me of something from about the time when I had just about
finished my A-levels. My parents were great friends with the late Lord
Jauncey of Tullichettle, and they were having lunch with him in
Edinburgh when he was just an advocate. I found him struggling with
some simple chemistry and science books. I had done physics, chemistry
and maths. He was struggling to understand polymers, because he was
taking a case regarding coatings on razorblades. I gave him a quick

of the interesting things about the Bill, as people have pointed out,
is the anomaly of the silos in government. The copyright and culture
side of it sits in DCMS, while the other stuff, which generates huge
amounts of jobs, industry and work, sits in the IPO, which comes under
BIS. However, the two things are basically related. When we talk about
the creative industries, where does the creativity cross over between
the two? There are a lot of anomalies as a result of this approach of
splitting the area into two when it comes to legislation. There is a
principle, I think, that we cannot have two departments sponsoring one
Bill, or something like that—I am not quite sure how it works.

ever to make any money off it—lasts for the life of the author
plus 70 years, which causes huge problems elsewhere and does not
advance the cause of other intellectual property and research there.

essential and very good, says that we can use these things in teaching

obvious, so why could we not also have had it in the other Bill with

copied from the design. The trouble is that if the design that they are
copying from is unregistered, how do you prove that they copied it from
that design unless you actually find evidence of that? I can see an
opportunity for a nice little business looking at unregistered designs,
getting some money and then invoking the prior use clause so that you
actually have use of it. Then if you wanted to extend the use, you
would have to enter into an arrangement with the person who had the

Bill between registered and unregistered. DCMS sees no such difference
regarding copyright; copyright is copyright, whether it is registered

the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act where it applies to copyright,

enhanced by the participation of the noble and learned Lord, Lord

very good plums: protection from infringement of private acts,
experiments in teaching, the improvement in the right to prior use, the
extension of the opinion service, the improvement in the small claims
service, accession to the Hague agreement and the part of the Bill that
deals with the unified patent court and its somewhat Solomonic partial
presence in London. The provisions on the court are a real feather in
the Government’s cap. They indicate, by the way, that colleagues
in the European Union do expect the United Kingdom to remain as members
of the European Union. If the Minister should suddenly withdraw Clause

a necessary evil. The question for us as policy-makers and legislators
is whether it is now right to continue to reinforce traditional
approaches and build on traditional structures, as this Bill does; or
has the time come when we need to rethink more radically how
intellectual property policy and legislation should be formulated in
the era of the digital economy, when knowledge can instantly, easily
and costlessly be transmitted across the globe and when we are seeing
that the conventional configuration of policies—not just in the

course, it is necessary to incentivise innovation and it is just to

development, not least in testing the safety of new products, and we
all want the industry to be successful in producing a new generation of
antibiotics. However, let us not forget that the protection of
intellectual property is protectionism; it creates monopoly and
restrictive practice and restrains trade. Therefore, it should be kept
to the necessary minimum. How to establish what that minimum is must be

hypocritical attitudes on this matter. The G8, the IMF and the World

just on the developing world, but on great areas of the world that are
in abject poverty and could not be said to be developing. Yet,
historically, in our own economies, we were protectionist. We did not
operate free-market systems in the early phases of the
industrialisation of our economies. We continue to be protectionist in

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will start by declaring an interest.
My husband is a research engineer who works for Cambridge Consultants,
which works with clients to develop patents and copyright protection. I
also remind the House that in the past—it is not a current
interest—I was a venture capitalist, helping mainly academics
spin ideas out of university and into the commercial world. That was a
long time ago, in the
1980s<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:39:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

I start I will address the comment made by the noble Lord, Lord
Howarth, who said that perhaps we have too much protection. I disagree
with him very strongly. It is important that people who have designed
items, whether that is electronic design, music, or a creative work of
art, should be recognised and should have any recompense due to them
for that. We live in a world where the counterfeit and fake are
commonplace, and they are a form of theft. One thing the Bill will do
is to make it that much harder for those who want to go against the
authorship and ownership of
works<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:40:31"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Lord raised a valid point about monopoly, and the issue of the Windows
operating system. However, that is not a case of intellectual property
but of competition law, which is a different
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:40:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000221">I
support the Bill—almost exclusively across it—but I will
focus my remarks on three clauses, given many of the comments made by
noble Lords earlier in the debate. I will address Clause 4 on the
arrangements for teaching and experimentation not infringing design
rights, Clause 16 on the unified patent court, and Clause 19, which
provides qualified exemption from freedom of information requests for
pre-publication
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000222">I
will start with the last clause. I had hoped that we would not hear any
noble Lords opposing the inclusion of this clause, so I was slightly
concerned that my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones said that we would
have to come back to look at this in further detail in Committee. We
fought long and hard during the passage of the Protection of Freedoms
Bill to have a review of this case. We argued that it was absolutely
essential because those engaged in research, including universities and
publicly-funded research centres, would be at risk from the increased
access to information set out in the 
<?notus-xml column=879?>Protection of Freedoms Bill. Although we did not win the argument then,
I was grateful that the Minister undertook to pass the complex and
thorny issues to the Justice Committee’s post-legislative
scrutiny committee in another place. As we know, it confirmed that
there was a need for a specific exemption, and I thank the Government
for the addition of Clause 19, which sets this
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000223">The
clause makes it clear that the exemption requires that disclosure of
the information would be prejudicial to the interests of the research
programme, of the institution or even the individual undertaking it, or
of an individual participating in it. Therefore it is not a carte
blanche for those carrying out research to hold anything private longer
term. It is also important to note that exemptions with similar effects
exist in the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act, and in Irish and US
legislation. While I, too, am a unionist, I say to the noble Lord, Lord
Browne of Ladyton, that Scotland got it right first on this
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000224" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000224">The key
reason that this exemption is necessary is, as I have already
mentioned, the risk of harm to the quality and reputation of UK
research. Misleading information can enter the public domain before it
has been cleaned, checked, and subjected to analysis
and—importantly—to peer review. Researchers can be
challenged on their approach or findings before they have had a chance
to address flaws in their work. Very particularly, in relation to
health-related research, individuals who get some information might
misdiagnose or medicate themselves on the basis of misleading
information that is gaining currency but is supported by incomplete
research. That could damage the UK’s reputation for quality
research.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000225">As
other noble Lords mentioned, it could also undermine the competitive
position of UK research. University research is fundamental to our
global competitiveness, and is considered second only to that of the
United States. It is also a highly competitive field. Premature
disclosure of research information will enable international
competitors to profit from work undertaken in UK universities before
the originators have had a fair opportunity to protect their ideas or
secure grants for future research. I am sure that that is why the US
legislated in this area.</hs_para>

difficult or impossible to secure publication opportunities in
reputable journals if findings are already in the public domain.
Publication records influence university income via the Research
Excellence Framework, as well as universities’ ability to secure
future grants and commercial contracts, and, importantly, to attract
academic staff and students. This harms our universities’
competitive interests, if not necessarily their commercial
ones.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0001.htm#13052251000227">Research
at an early stage may have a potential but not actual commercial value,
and it is worrying that without this clause it is possible to
discourage research partnership with commercial and charitable bodies.
We went through quite specific examples during the passage of the
Protection of Freedoms Bill that showed that had this continued, the UK
would not have been a good place to have a commercial arrangement.
Universities

now move to Clause 4, on exceptions to the infringement of design
rights. As others have already mentioned, we had considerable debate
during the passage of the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill on this
very issue. I respect and understand the concerns put forward by my
noble friends Lady Buscombe and Lord
Clement-Jones<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:46:20"></hs_TimeCode> in
those debates and others, making sure that those who had designed
things had the right to any recompense and recognition that came
thereby. However, taken in the extreme, it has meant that institutions,
whether colleges, specialist conservatoires or universities, would not
be able to use examples of unregistered design to teach the next
generation of brilliant designers in this country. That seems
completely counterintuitive. I am therefore delighted that
Clause 4 remedies
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:47:07"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble
Earl, Lord Erroll, expressed a concern that this would not pick up the
points that we discussed during the passage of that Bill. As I

I turn to Clause 16, which establishes the unified patent court system.
I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Walker of
Gestingthorpe, who in his maiden speech eloquently set out the
difficulties of the old system, some of which I remember from the
1980s. Clause 16 will benefit UK businesses, especially, as has been
mentioned, SMEs and researchers, but I will focus on individual
entrepreneurs who do not necessarily have the support or the funding
that companies may have, or that institutions have through
researchers.</hs_para>

about saving money, which is absolutely critical. We absolutely must be
able to protect inventions and designs and sell them to different

infringement, is that the cost of having to sue through a number of
courts to get justice has often killed the product itself. This has
come at the worst moment for a patent holder, who may be trying to get
the next round of funding to commercialise their product. It is not
just individuals and small businesses. Dyson spends a very large amount
of money rightly defending the patents on its products. Some of the
reduction in costs here and the simplification through the unified

UK argued consistently that existing exemptions are inadequate, but
also made it clear that universities are certainly not hostile to the
Freedom of Information Act, or to greater openness in research.
Universities have in fact done a great deal to ensure that the majority
of FOI requests are complied with. A recent survey carried out for
Universities UK by Jisc showed that universities complied with 63% of
FOI requests in 2010. There have also been real moves towards further
openness in research through a commitment to open access. Most
universities have a repository that could be used to showcase and share
all their open-access publications, as well as doctoral theses and
other material. Increasingly, such repositories are also used to
support research management and reporting. UK universities, backed by
the Government and funders, are leading the way internationally in
providing free online access to research publications and
data.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000244">Having<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>
said that, universities are fairly unusual among the so-called
“public authorities” that are subject to the Freedom of
Information Act. As independent bodies that are decreasingly reliant on
public funds, they also operate in a highly competitive environment. I
do not believe that the Freedom of Information Act fully anticipates
the complications that arise when dealing with FOI requests in the
university context. This has been demonstrated to good effect by a
number of recent cases involving university

now universities have had relatively few requests for information

high-profile instances illustrate how FOI requests can be used to
intimidate researchers working in controversial fields or to gain
competitive advantage. To give one example, during the passage of the
Protection of Freedoms Act, I understand that the University of Oxford
received a request for research data from a large nationwide health
study, submitted by a company with a significant commercial interest in
it. Although the request was subsequently not pursued, the research
group lost significant research time in attempting to rebut the
request, and the university incurred significant legal costs in the

have got it all right; it was an unfinished work, as it ended up being
decimated in the wash-up. Nevertheless, we understood and recognised
the importance of this area of
policy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000249">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>,

who said that this is a slim Bill. My experience is that it can soon
become obese, given the weight of amendments that it is likely to
attract. It makes important changes to the UK design framework in line
with some of what was proposed in the Hargreaves review. Measures that
we have already heard about include changes to the scope of design, the
protection and ownership of design, new routes of appeal against
decisions made by the registrar relating to design, a power for the
Secretary of State to provide for a non-binding opinions
service—as a number of noble Lords have said, a very welcome
provision—and provision for the inspection of documents. The
Bill puts in place provisions to allow the UK implementation
of the Geneva act of the 
<?notus-xml column=884?>Hague agreement. Most of these provisions are straightforward and
positive and go some way towards strengthening and clarifying the
framework, although we fear that they might not go very far in
addressing the complexity of what the Hargreaves report referred to as
a “patchwork of
protection”.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/9F7AAAD3049C6E73A62A8D04C04CB5298C002879" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

agreement establishing a unified patent court—a provision which
seems to have met with universal approval around the House today and we
should congratulate the Government on. An interesting question about
whether there would be two courts was posed and I have no doubt that
the Minister will pick it up. The noble Baroness, Lady Brinton,
mentioned lower-value patents and keeping those costs down, which is
also very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000252">Finally,
as we heard from the noble Baroness and from my noble friend Lady
Warwick, Clause 19 introduces an exemption into the FOI Act in relation
to research and a duty on the Secretary of State to report to
Parliament on how the IPO’s activities are supporting growth and
innovation, both of which we support. The idea of reporting on growth
and innovation was commented on by a number of noble Lords, including
my noble friend Lord Browne. Both the extent of the report and whether
this idea could be extended were raised. I do not think that I need go
any further on research and the FOI Act, because they were covered
extensively by my noble friend Lady Warwick and the noble Baroness,

of what is proposed in the Bill is intended to simplify the law and to
ensure that it is understood, enforced and better supports innovation.
As my noble friend Lord Howarth said, an interesting balance needs to
be achieved between the desire to reward creativity and innovation and
ensuring that competition and further innovation are not stifled. That
will be a difficult judgment for us to make, and probably one of the
most crucial, as we take the Bill through its Committee stage. The
devil will be in the detail and we will ensure that the Bill gets the
scrutiny it
deserves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000254" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000254">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:02:29"></hs_TimeCode>
will look at each clause in detail to see how the Bill may be improved,
and I must admit that I have some sympathy with the Minister as he
tries to deal with the range of issues that have already been raised.
Another issue which came up in relation to innovation versus
competition was the domination of Microsoft over the years. Of course,
it has not been total domination, as open source software, Linux and
other systems became available. The noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, made
a strong contribution to the debate on the power of the search engines.
It was interesting, but I was not quite sure that I grasped what her
solution would be to that world domination—no doubt that will
emerge in

was a significant difference of opinion on  the key issue of

thought occurred to me: why do we not do something about the cost of
registering designs? I would welcome the Minister’s comment on
that. In this day and age where most things are being dealt with
online, it should not be beyond the wit of man to reduce costs in this
area; and if we are serious about stimulating the creative industries
then we should be able to do so. A number of noble Lords expressed
concern about extending criminality in this area. At this stage, all we
would say is that we will pursue this matter extensively in Committee

designs will give them the same level of protection as the infringement
of copyright and trade marks. This will create a coherent approach to
enforcement and protection and also recognises that the creativity of
design is as important to the UK economy as music protected by
copyright and brands protected by trade marks. Creating a criminal
offence for the copying of a registered design could help to reduce the
scale of design theft in the UK. It will do so by acting as a deterrent
against those who deliberately copy the designs of

they belong to and when the right started. That information is not so

Erroll, raised the issue of 2-D and 3-D and asked specifically whether
the Bill would mean that 2-D works would be treated differently from

currently covered by criminal sanctions, applies to, for example, a
design drawing but not to a design made from that drawing. In
proceeding in the way that we have, we have recognised the difficulties
associated with proving matters such as subsistence and in relation to
those rights, but there are also other issues not associated with
copyright that need to be considered. For example, unregistered design
rights can be exploited legitimately subject to licensing agreements by
third parties for the last five years of their existence. This could be
jeopardised if criminal sanctions applied before that period. For

local divisions are in addition to the central division,

Lord Browne, alluded to that in his speech. The UK could host a local

emphasis should be placed on fines. The issue was addressed in the
Digital Economy Act, which increased financial penalties on conviction
for digital and physical copyright theft of up to £50,000 so
that they are now the same. Prosecutors also now use fraud legislation
to obtain convictions more effectively. Increasing sanctions under the
CDPA is therefore unnecessary at present although the Government will
certainly keep the issue under
review.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000280">My

the protection afforded can reward innovation and creativity properly
without being anti-competitive. The Government believe that the various
periods referred to for different rights are, on balance, the right
ones. They reward creativity and innovation while encouraging the
sharing of information. This allows others to innovate further, but in
a fair and balanced way. This issue mirrors some of the points that the

Media and Sport is giving careful consideration to the extension of the
public lending right to onsite loans of audio books and e-books. This
is following William Sieghart’s review of e-lending in public

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Communities and
Local Government (Baroness Hanham):</Member></B> My Lords, the local
Audit and Accountability Bill is another important step in our plans to
strengthen local democracy and transparency. It is the final step in a
programme of reforms to local audit that will secure millions in
savings, protect important local freedoms and further increase the
localism agenda in three specific
ways.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000288" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000288">First,
it will allow local bodies to take control of their own audit
arrangements, and replace the Audit Commission with a new framework for
local audit that is robust and retains a focus on value for money.
Secondly, it safeguards the contribution that our independent local
press makes to local democracy. Thirdly, it protects the taxpayer
against excessive increases set by the levying
bodies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000289" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000289">I
should like to focus on each of these in turn but, before doing so, let
me rehearse the context of the Bill. The Government are doing
everything we can to bring down our inherited deficit, achieve sensible
savings for the taxpayer and give local people greater say in
decision-making. As part of this, the coalition agreement pledged to
reduce the cost and number of quangos. It also pledged to end the era
of top-down government by giving new powers to local councils,
communities, neighbourhoods and individuals. We have already ended
assessment and inspection of local authorities—that is,
comprehensive area assessments and local area agreements—freeing
local authorities from centrally imposed targets and £25 million
in annual compliance costs. Currently, the Audit Commission appoints
auditors for nearly 11,000 local public bodies, which are responsible
for some £200 billion of public expenditure. It is however no
longer fit for purpose, its remit and functions having expanded
significantly beyond their original intention. It has become
unnecessarily centralist and bureaucratic.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052251000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000290">Local independent audit
is essential to ensure that those who handle public money spend it in
the public interest, but there is no reason why local authorities
should not be able to appoint their own auditors—something the
private sector, charities, foundation trusts and academies do as a
matter of course. We have been open about our plans to abolish the
Audit Commission and replace it with a local regime. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=892?>consulted extensively on the proposals, including publishing a draft
Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny. Over the past two years, we have
stopped the Audit Commission exercising many of its functions,
privatised its in-house audit practice—resulting in a 40%
reduction in audit fees for local bodies—scaled back its other
activities and cut overhead costs. The Bill is the final piece in the
jigsaw and it will now abolish the Audit Commission completely. It will
bring down the curtain on the centralised arrangements for the audit of
local bodies and replace them with a new framework.</hs_para>

firmly in the driving seat. Under the Bill’s provisions, they
will appoint auditors of their own from an open and competitive market.
They will have to publish information about the appointment of an
auditor within 28 days of that appointment being made. To safeguard the
integrity of this process, they will need to consult and take into
account the advice of an independent auditor panel. We know, because we
have been told so, that local government has concerns about these
auditor panels but the Bill provides a flexible approach. These local
bodies will be able to use an existing committee, if it meets the
independence requirements, establish a small new panel or combine with
other public bodies to appoint auditors collectively.</hs_para>

views, we will be retaining a limited audit regime for smaller
authorities: that is, those with a turnover below £6.5 million.
Local bodies with an annual turnover below £25,000 will be
exempted from automatic external audit altogether, although a mechanism
will be retained for auditor-led scrutiny if problems are perceived to
have arisen. New transparency requirements for smaller authorities will
enable electors to access the information about accounts and governance
that they need to hold the authority to account.</hs_para>

arguments that this Bill will affect the independence and quality of
the audit process, so it is important to underline that we are
strenuously safeguarding the integrity of the local audit system. The
scope of that system will broadly remain the same: auditors will look
not just at the accuracy of the financial statements but at value for
money. Auditors will continue to be required to comply with a code of
audit practice and have regard to accompanying guidance, which will be
set by the independent and impartial National Audit Office. Parliament
will retain its oversight role by approving this code.</hs_para>

Office will also slightly increase the number of value-for-money
studies it carries out to enable it to undertake examinations that take
account of local delivery. This will enable a wider view to be taken on
the use of public money. There will continue to be a statutory duty on
auditors to make public interest reports, and they will be able to
recover their costs from the audited body for undertaking an
investigation. There will also be a new requirement on local bodies to
publish any public interest reports and their response.</hs_para>

Council will oversee the monitoring of the quality of audits, as it
already does for the private sector. This will align the regulatory
system for local public audit more closely with the private sector and
remove unnecessary duplication. 
<?notus-xml column=893?>Recognised supervisory bodies—professional accountancy

also protects the rights of local taxpayers to inspect a local
authority’s accounts and to raise concerns with the auditor, who
may report on these matters if necessary. Whistleblowers will also be
protected by amending the relevant whistleblowing legislation so that
they can raise matters of concern confidentially with the auditor or
the Comptroller and Auditor-General, without prejudicing their
employment. The Government also recognise the value of the national
fraud initiative. The Bill transfers the Audit Commission’s
data-matching powers to the Secretary of State, the Minister for the
Cabinet Office or another authorised Minister, so that the work to
prevent and detect fraud at local level can
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000297">The
local audit system we are proposing to put in place will maintain, we
believe, a high quality of audit. It will also be markedly improved in
terms of efficiency and cost effectiveness. Overall, these reforms will
deliver estimated savings of £1.2 billion over 10 years, which
is rather more than originally anticipated. Authorities will not just
have greater control over how much they pay for the services; they will
have greater incentives to keep their costs down, since they will no
longer have to fund the Audit Commission’s overheads and other
activities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000298">I
know that consultation respondents and Select Committees have raised a
question about the current lack of competition in the audit market.
However, the outsourcing of the Audit Commission’s in-house
audit practice has already increased the number of suppliers in the
market from five to seven, with at least a dozen firms passing the
pre-qualification questionnaire. We expect a greater number of smaller
contracts to be available once local bodies start to appoint their own
auditors. This will open up much more opportunity for smaller
firms.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052251000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000299">The
other provisions covered in the Bill include those relating to local
authority publicity. We have made it clear all the way through that we
expect local authorities to conform to the publicity code. Many are not
doing that at the moment; councils such as Tower Hamlets and Greenwich
are not. We are therefore taking powers in this Bill to make that code
something that local authorities will have to apply.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052251000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000300">The final matter here
is the question of levying bodies. We have been conscious that levying
bodies are not part of the council tax system or the referendums, while
they can have an enormous effect on council tax bills. In some areas,
levies account for over half of the local council tax requirements. In
Liverpool they account for 56%—a very high percentage, which is
not given any democratic oversight. Percentage increases in levies
year-on-year have consistently outstripped the increase in council tax
as a whole. In 2011-12, levies in England increased by 4.1% at a time
when Band D bills were frozen, and this year authorities in Greater
Manchester 
<?notus-xml column=894?>have increased their bills by more than the 2% referendum threshold set.
Without the Bill, any tax increases by levying bodies effectively mean
that large elements of council tax demands remain beyond direct
democratic control. Local taxpayers must have the right to approve or
veto all council tax increases above the approved amount, without
having to worry that some elements of that increase are beyond their
control.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000301">The
provisions contained in this Bill will strengthen localism and
democracy. They will put local bodies in charge of their own audit
arrangements, help save council tax payers money and ensure that
elected representatives can continue to be held to account. I commend
this Bill to the

unrelated matters: amendments to the council tax referendum rules and
draconian powers concerning observance of the code on local authority

council tax referendum provisions, which we discussed a couple of years
ago in what was then the Localism Bill. The effect of this clause
is  to include in the definition of a relevant amount of
council tax certain levies and these have hitherto, as we have heard,
been excluded in the calculation, such that any increase in council tax
resulting from an increase in the levy would not of itself
cause a determination that any level of council tax would be excessive
or trigger the requirement for a referendum. In future, levies will be
included so that a disproportionate levy increase could trigger a
referendum requirement by the local authority or, more likely, the
local authority will seek to absorb a sufficient part of that increase
within its budget to avoid a referendum, a potentially awful dilemma
given the precarious state of the finances of most local
authorities.</hs_para>

calculations of future limits to reflect circumstances where local

retrospection and perhaps the Minister would say in what circumstances

examine the gaps which potentially arise from the demise of the
commission, which means that no single body will have overall
responsibility for supervising and co-ordinating local public audit. We

the Bill is that by transferring the commissioning of local audits to
local public bodies and by the provision of audit to be transferred to
private sector audit firms, there will be a strengthening and growth of
an open and competitive audit market. We think the jury is very much
out on whether this will be the case with the risk that, over time, the
big four will come to dominate the market, certainly among larger
authorities, as they do in the private sector. They earn some 99% of
audit fees paid by FTSE100 companies at present. It is understood that
there were only some 13 audit firms—I think the noble Baroness
mentioned 12—which pre-qualified when the Audit Commission was
going through the process of outsourcing 70% of its audit practice.
That is an advance on four but still only a fraction of the audit firms
in the market. For the year ended 31 March 2013, of the
nearly 800 local authorities, health bodies, fire and rescue
authorities and so on audited by private sector firms, only seven
different firms were appointed, as we have heard, but more than 90% of

four plus Grant

wider scope of public sector audit, a point

arrangements for assuring the quality of audits—major and
others—are sound. Whether all of this leads to lower audit fees
remains to be seen. What seems clear is that foregoing the prospect of
a single buyer means that the huge savings which the commission was
able to generate—a quarter of a billion pounds over five
years—will not be available in the future. The savings will
endure for a few more years because I believe that the contracts run to
2017, although they can be extended to 2020. But if there is
market concentration over time, this will eventually lead to higher,
not lower, fees, although joint procurement and framework agreements

Tope:</Member></B> My Lords, as always, I must begin by declaring my
interest as a London borough councillor and, again as always, I thank
the Minister for the careful and considerate way in which she explained
the main provisions of the Bill. I am also pleased that my noble friend
Lord Shipley will again be working with me on the Bill, bringing with
him his many years of experience, some of them as leader of Newcastle
City Council. In particular, I welcome the return to local government
business of my noble friend Lord Palmer of Childs Hill, who I think has
been insulted by the suggestion that audit is anything approaching
dull. My noble friend is one of the relatively few chartered
accountants I know of who actually understands public sector
accountancy and, indeed, has much experience as chair of a local
authority audit committee—a post to which, I believe, he was
unanimously re-elected only yesterday

Audit Commission has been a very long time going. Few of us regret its
demise and I am pleased to hear that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, is
not campaigning for its resurrection. Much of what it did, particularly
in its early days, was good and helpful but, as the Minister said, its
mission grew and grew. Few of us in local government will regret the
passing of the assessment and inspection regime. By the end, it was
expensive and, frankly, oppressive and rewarded most those who knew
best how to play the
game.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000319">As the

the Council of Europe is carrying out one of its local democracy audits
this year to assess how well the UK conforms to its Charter of Local
Self-Government. I am pleased to say that the ending of this regime is
judged to allow the UK to meet the requirements of Article 8.2 of the
charter for the first time since the UK signed it in 1997. That is an
important step forward that I did not wish to pas unnoticed in your

must, however, be careful that we do not throw the baby out with the
bath water, and that we keep the best and get rid of the rest. In
particular, we must address concerns of CIPFA, the Chartered Institute
of Public Finance and Accountancy. It feels that the Bill presents an
opportunity to embed the wider scope of public audit. Given that this
point was well made by CIPFA and others in the consultation, will the
Minister explain why the Government have clearly decided not to do
so?</hs_para>

of CIPFA, the LGA and others about the proposed arrangements for audit,
the relationship with a council’s audit committee, many of which
are chaired by a member of the opposition, and the appointment of
auditors. My noble friend Lord Palmer will no doubt speak more about
this with considerable personal knowledge and we shall certainly need
to examine it in detail in Grand Committee. Let me say at this stage
that I really do wonder why the Government believe it is either
necessary or desirable, or indeed possible, to have independent auditor
panels. In my long experience of local government, I have yet to meet
anyone who has been clamouring to be a member of an independent auditor
panel. That is not usually the way in which public engagement is sought
by the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000322">There
is also much to be said for national procurement of auditors, and I am
pleased that the Minister has made clear that local authorities will
certainly be able to procure collectively. The LGA is arguing that
national procurement should at least be an option. That is one of the
measures that will no doubt be examined in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000323" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000323">The
proposed role of the National Audit Office will also be explored in
more detail and I hope that it will prove useful. Certainly the
requirement to consult with relevant parties on any studies is very
welcome, but there is concern about mission creep, based at least in
part on experience with the Audit Commission, to which the Minister has
already referred, which started well but grew and grew. We will not
wish that to happen to the National Audit Office. With these proposals
it should not happen, and I am sure that we will explore ways to
prevent even the possibility. For instance, the LGA is suggesting a
statutory limit for the number of studies each year. Given the
financial regime in which we are working, I am sure that that will be
desirable. Perhaps the Minister will say a little more in her summing
up about the role of the National Audit Office, which essentially
reports to Parliament, as distinct from local government, and how the
parliamentary exercise will be carried out.</hs_para>

controversial part of  this Bill is Clause 38, giving statutory
backing to the existing publicity code. As the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie said, most if not all in local government support the
publicity code as a voluntary code. However, there is widespread
concern and perhaps some misunderstanding about why it is intended to
back the code with statutory provisions. As usual, we ask the
Government for objective evidence that the problem is so widespread and
so serious that this action, which is hardly consistent with localism,
is necessary and why existing powers are insufficient to deal with the
very few well publicised cases of abuse, such as in Tower Hamlets or,
arguably, Lambeth. I am looking forward to the no doubt robust defence
by the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, of the activities in those boroughs
and perhaps one or two other authorities—certainly not the
majority. All we have had from the Government is rather silly and
misleading statements from the Secretary of State about “town
hall Pravdas”. That might in itself be a breach of the publicity
code.</hs_para>

majority of local authority magazines or newspapers fall well within
the scope of the publicity code and are not in the least controversial.
In my experience, in every survey of public opinion that I have known,
the public say they want more information, not less, and all of us
would say that they have a right to that information. Local authority
publications that comply with the publicity code are one way, and
arguably still the best way, to provide it for the great majority of
the public who do not regularly search their council’s website,
or who have neither the ability nor the wish to do so at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000326" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000326">It has
been argued that local authority newspapers or magazines are a threat
to local newspapers, but there is no evidence to support that. A
quarterly magazine with little or no advertising is hardly a threat to
a weekly newspaper. Indeed, the opposite is often the case and there
are far more places where the practical partnership between the local
council and the independent local press brings mutual benefit to each
than places where anyone thinks there is a
problem.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000327">Many
regret that the Bill does not remove the requirement to publish
statutory notices in the local press. The LGA states that this
requirement alone costs local authorities £26 million a year,
yet no one would seriously argue that it is either the best or most
cost-effective way of communicating information to the public, or even
to those with a particular professional interest in the subject matter.
I understand that the Government are carrying out a review of this
requirement, coincidental to but separate from the Bill. Will the
Minister tell us more about this review and whether its conclusions
will be reached in time for them to be included before the Bill is
enacted, possibly early next year? I am sure that we will spend much
time on this part of the Bill, which has caused great alarm, yet I am
sure that the Minister will be able to reassure us today that its
proposals will make no difference at all to what the great majority of
local authorities do
now.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000328" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000328">Finally,
we come to the issue of extending council tax referendums to include
levies and precepts from other bodies. As I have said many times in
your Lordships’ House, I am strongly opposed to council tax
referendums, which are really just the latest manifestation of capping
by central government. It has always seemed to be a fundamental
democratic principle that the role of a local elected councillor is to
balance the needs of the local community with the cost to that
community of meeting those needs—and to be properly and
effectively accountable to the local community for the decisions taken
in doing so. Council tax capping by whatever name or disguise runs
contrary to that democratic
principle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000329" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000329">It
follows therefore that I would be much happier if the Bill abolished
council tax referendums altogether, rather than extending their scope;
but given that this is not going to happen, I can certainly understand
the logic of this proposal and we will examine its effects in greater
detail in Committee. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, has already asked
about the retrospective nature of this provision. By the time the Bill
is enacted, we will be almost completely through the current financial
year and attention will be entirely focused on the coming financial
year, 2014-15. I hope that when 
<?notus-xml column=900?>the Minister replies, she will be able to reassure us and say something
helpful about the retrospective nature of this, and whether we will be
seriously looking in the early part of the next financial year at
decisions legitimately taken about the current financial
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000330">I
understand that we are currently offered the prospect of 24 hours in
Grand Committee to better understand the Bill and its implications. I

the detail on this, which I think would be quite important. I shall
concentrate fundamentally on the application to parish and town

welcome in this Bill. On audit, as has already been said, I accept that
it is an absolutely basic tool for holding to account those who control
and handle significant sums of taxpayers’ money, or, in the
private sector, shareholders’ assets. The core ingredients,
however, are that it should be purposeful, cost-efficient and
proportionate. It does not make sense to remove centralist mechanisms
by creating some dispersed arrangement that is complex or uncertain,
fails to provide real transparency or is excessively costly. Like the
noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, I fear that long-term there will be higher
costs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000334">NALC
has made it clear that it looks for six key factors on audit. The first
is a proportionate and cost-effective but limited assurance audit
regime for parish and town councils, with particular exemptions for
very low-spending parish and town councils. Secondly, it feels that the
national procurement of external audit—already
mentioned—may well be the most efficient way of procuring audit
on the most cost-effective basis. I think NALC is at one with the LGA
on this. It then wants the establishment of a self-financing,
sector-led body to undertake this audit procurement, particularly for
smaller local public bodies, including parish and town
councils.</hs_para>

vital important that there is a right for electors to
inspect the accounts of parish and town councils, but that any new
transparency arrangements need to be proportionate. They need to be
practical and cost-effective and there needs to be a financial
safeguard for parish and town councils in the event of auditor-led
scrutiny; in other words, to guard against parish funds being hijacked
by those with some deconstructive agenda, of which the Minister will be
well aware. While reading the Bill and the various bits of paperwork we
received, I wondered how one would have an audit panel with a majority
of independent members on it. In my limited knowledge of local

code of publicity, I understand that this is the
“accountability” that sits behind the title of the Bill.
I understand that the Government have consulted, but they are asking
the House to agree these proposals without our knowing the outcome of

Government’s response. I hope this was not an instance of

considerable contrast to the direction of travel of the audit. It

additional statutory powers. I am bound to say that it walks and looks
like a Henry VIII clause. It is a puzzle to me, because I am not
aware—I echo other noble Lords—of any instance in which
the Secretary of State has actually intervened under the current code

the statute?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000338">I
noticed the comment by the noble Lord, Lord Tope, about the issue of
the regional press. I recall that my late father once christened a West
Country local newspaper the “Trumpet of Truth”—not
its real name —on account of its serial and culpable
inaccuracies, bias and other mischief. I leave that particular point
parked, but there is no particular evidence that parish and town
councils compete unfairly with local newspapers and there is no reason
why the code should be put into primary legislation. The existing code
provides for action to be taken if there is evidence. Again, there have
been no breaches of which I am aware. Giving more powers to the
Secretary of State looks anti-localist, and we need to ask whether it
is necessary for parliamentary time to be taken up by this and whether
there is a problem in the first place.</hs_para>

lawyer’s matter—forgive me if I tread on others’
toes—but the code as it stands seems to be couched in nebulous
terms. I wonder whether it is the right sort of document to form the
basis of a statutory code? My final point concerns parish polls. In
this respect, the Bill needs some strengthening. The Localism Act, as
originally drafted, included provisions that were subsequently removed
with other clauses on referendums. That leaves us with Schedule 12 to
the Local Government Act 1972, which sets out the circumstances in
which a poll at a parish meeting may be demanded. The trigger is
unbelievably low: fewer 
<?notus-xml column=902?>than 10 electors or one-third of the local
government electors present, whichever is the lower. This is far too
lax. It is an open door for the vexatious use of parish polls on
matters that may not even directly affect—or affect at
all—the local area. The responsibilities of the parish and town
councils are what should be in focus. If they are not, it is a waste of
taxpayers’ money. I am concerned about a comment made by the
Audit Commission that it could be a matter of an auditor deeming that
the money so expended had not been correctly incurred. That is not very
good if the thing happens after the accounting period is finished and
you are in a parish council meeting and have to make a decision. The
guidance needs to be a lot clearer so that everybody knows where they
are up

look forward to the further deliberations on the Bill. I sometimes
wonder whether the philosophy and direction of travel of the Bill, and
of localism more generally, is entirely coherent. On the Growth and
Infrastructure Bill, the Government argued that businesses need
certainty. I buy that to a considerable degree but so do municipalities
and parishes. Uncertainty adds cost and risk, and in this case
increases public expenditure. We need to do everything that we can to
avoid falling into that trap. I wish this Bill in all other respects a
good passage, and I am sure that we will have plenty of interesting
times trying to knock it into slighter better shape that it is

of the Local Government Association, of which I am a former chairman. I
also declare my interest as an elected member for Bingley Rural since
1986 on Bradford Metropolitan Council, where I had the privilege of
being the leader between 2000 and 2006. I thank my noble friend the
Minister for the clarity of her explanations and her willingness to
have briefing meetings. I regret that I was unable to attend
yesterday.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000342" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000342">We
are very well aware of the significant implications of the Bill for
local government. As someone who has worked in local government for
many years, I warmly welcome the Government’s commitment to
cutting back on external inspection. Any measures that reduce
interference with, and the burdens on, local government have to be
welcomed. It is therefore regrettable that many of the proposed
measures in the Bill centralise powers to the Secretary of State and
allow central government to interfere with matters that should rightly
be decided at a local level. The provisions to extend the referendum
powers introduced in the Localism Act strike me as being anti-localist
in nature and difficult to implement in
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000343">On a
point of principle, local elections exist so that people can pass
judgment on the performance of their councils and the amount of council
tax they charge. The United Kingdom is a representative democracy. We
do not hold referendums every time the national government raise taxes,
quite often by more than 2%, so why should we impose referendums on
councils for managing their own finances? Elsewhere, the Bill reads as
if it is possible for the Secretary of State to impose a different
referendum limit on local authorities where their council tax increase
for 2013-14 would have been 
<?notus-xml column=903?>excessive under the new definition, but not under the current
definition. That is not fair to those who obeyed the rules, only to
find out that the goal posts might be moved. It is like revising the
speed limit downwards and then fining any motorist who has not obeyed
the new limit before it was
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000344">From
my experience as the LGA chairman, local government in England is
subject to a variety of different levying arrangements in different
areas, covering issues such as transport and drainage. As the proposals
are currently drafted, there is the risk of serious perverse outcomes.
For example, a drainage board in an area of high flood risk might be
denied the funding it needs to improve flood defences without
subjecting the local authority to one or more council tax referendums.
Not only is this an additional cost to the local authority, it inhibits
the delivery of government policy on flood defences. Likewise, growth
measures, such as the building of new transport infrastructure, might
be caught by this provision. Will the Minister please look further at
these concerns? If there are particular issues that the Government have
with individual levying authorities it makes more sense to sort these
out individually rather than modifying the entire structure of local
government finance.</hs_para>

further measure in the Bill that is causing concern for councils has
already been mentioned by my noble friend Lord Tope. I refer to the
proposal for a statutory code of practice on local authority publicity.
This clause is unnecessary as there is no evidence that
council publications are competing unfairly with local newspapers and,
by the Government’s own admission, very few councils are
breaking the existing recommendations. The Bill, as currently drafted,
will introduce some very wide-ranging powers that will allow central
government to direct a local authority regardless of whether it is
complying with the code. That strikes me as a charter for central
government to interfere, meddle with and second-guess
councils.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000346" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000346">It
is also worth noting that the majority of councils produce newsletters
because they are the most cost-effective way of reaching 90% or more of
the local population. In my authority, which has well over 500,000
people, the publication does not look like a newspaper, has no
political content whatever and is used regularly to inform people of
changes in refuse collection, summer play schemes, and many things that
they may well not have the benefit of enjoying but for the knowledge
that they gain from the publication. By way of comparison with the
council newsletters, 1% of local newspapers reach 90% or more
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000347" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000347">Before
Parliament legislates to change the status of the code, I feel that the
Government should set out  the evidence for their decision.
Will my noble friend the Minister therefore consider commissioning an
independent review to establish what, if any, impact council
publications have on local
newspapers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000348" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000348">As
I said at the opening of my speech, the Government's commitment to
cutting back on the red tape of central inspection has been most
welcome. This Bill makes provision for the appointment of local audit,
the duties on auditors and local authorities and the role of the
National Audit Office. Procuring local audit is a costly exercise for
councils. In Clause 9, the 
<?notus-xml column=904?>Bill requires councils to have an independent audit panel that will
advise the councils on their appointments. Others have mentioned, and
certainly early indications show, that councils will have considerable
practical difficulties finding enough suitably knowledgeable
independent local people willing to serve in this capacity. I was
pleased that the Minister did say that there is going to be some
flexibility. Even so, I think that this area needs a great deal of
thorough consideration during the Committee stage if this whole process
is not to be incredibly
burdensome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000349" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000349">It
is also worth noting that national procurement of external audit is the
most efficient way of procuring audit, at the best possible cost to
local councils. This was demonstrated by the recent tendering exercise
carried out by the Audit Commission. That exercise delivered savings to
councils of £250 million. As a result, I would like
the Government to ensure that sufficient flexibility is retained in the
Bill to allow national procurement to continue as a way of helping
councils secure savings for the future. As the Local Government
Association has said, amending the Bill to allow for national
procurement does not imply ministerial agreement to the approach. It
simply demonstrates a willingness to keep the option available for the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000350" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000350">I
should like to finish by talking about the role of the National Audit
Office. Having been critical of some of the provisions in this
legislation, I am delighted to see that the Government have listened to
advice from local government on the need for the National Audit Office
to consult relevant parties when developing value for money studies. It
is crucial that the National Audit Office works with councils on its
programmes of studies, as this is the best way to achieve the most
efficient
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000351" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000351">I do,
however, share the view held by the LGA that there should be a
limitation on the number of studies the National Audit Office is able
to conduct each year. I am concerned that there is potential for
mission creep given the absence of any constraints or limits regarding
the total number of studies per year. This burden is precisely the sort
of the thing the Government have rightly tried to prevent under the new
audit regime and it would be a shame for the National Audit Office to
become the “Audit Commission
lite”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000352" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000352">The
reduction in central inspection and changes to the audit regime are
largely welcome. But I do hope that the Minister takes my constructive
criticism of the council tax referendum and publicity code provisions
in the spirit in which they are meant. I would welcome a Government
response to my fears of the unintended consequences of the council tax
clauses. I would also like the Minister to explain why the provisions
for the publicity code create such wide-ranging powers for central
government when there are hardly any councils breaking the spirit of
existing
guidance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000353">I

Christopher:</Member></B> My Lords, I first declare a specific
interest. For six years I was one of the commissioners of the Audit
Commission. I found that a very rewarding and learning experience. We
are approaching this whole matter with some risk. It is worth recording
that the commission was set up by Lady Thatcher, who only a few weeks
ago was said farewell to and regarded by very many as the finest Prime
Minister that Britain has had since Winston Churchill. I am not going
to argue about that, but that was the feeling. The Bill that proposed
setting up the Audit Commission was put through Parliament by the now
noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, a man held in high regard and called back
to serve only recently to advise the Government on how to advance
business. He made a report on this not that long
ago.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000355">The
second controller of the Audit Commission was Sir Howard Davies, who
only last week was called in by the Government to produce a report on
what should happen to London airways. The Audit Commission did not
involve people of minor importance or minor ability. We are now seeking
to get rid of it. It is worth quoting something that the noble Lord,
Lord Heseltine, said at the time, which was that he saw
this,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052251000478" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000478">“in

chairman of the commission under whom I served was Sir David Cooksey,
one of Britain’s most successful and efficient businessmen.
However some people may have seen the commission, it was certainly not
what I have heard described. It was a catholic bank of people drawn
from a number of walks of life—local government, central
government and the opposition. Over that period, I very rarely, if
ever, sensed that one’s political views mattered in the context
of the issue on the table. The objective was invariably: there is a
problem, what is the best solution? Now we are looking at a proposal
that will effectively move it to the status of a profession. With
respect to the noble Earl, Lord Lytton, whose views I find most
interesting and helpful, even the president of the organisation that
runs accountancy indicated that it was in dire need of some reform. He
expressed the reasons
why.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000357" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000357">I wonder
why this is being done. I have been what I would call an outside
insider in local government for a number of years. I have never had a
phone call, a letter or a representation from a member of a local
council—county or district—to say, “Please get the
Audit Commission off my back”. As for citizens, I have never
heard anyone complain to me, “I feel deprived and lonely because
I do not have close access to the auditors”. What people are
complaining most about in this context are potholes and planning
applications. They are little concerned about structures, as is
demonstrated by the poor turnout at elections for local
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000358">The
coalition is demolishing a very successful professional asset of this
country. It has been a source for the map which local government was
holding to operate with true cost-effectiveness, and it has worked
extraordinarily well. The idea suggested here, and by 
<?notus-xml column=906?>the Secretary of State from time to time, is that it has outgrown
itself. It could easily have been restricted economically had that road
been
chosen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000359" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000359">Most
people sense that this is a bone-dry issue, but it was not and is not.
Perhaps I may cheer up your Lordships with a couple of cases that I saw
dealt with—rare perhaps, but underneath will still lie the deep
anxieties of auditors. One is from Labour and one is from the
Conservatives, so I am not being selective. The Labour example was the
somewhat left-wing authority of Hammersmith and Fulham which, towards
the end of the 1980s, had what one might describe as an interest rate
swaps crisis. It had massive exposure to interest rate swaps, all on
one side of the market, relying on high interest rates when they were
falling. The borrowing was £308 million, and it was distributed
worldwide at the time. Who assisted in clearing it up? The Audit
Commission. How, under the Bill, could such a case be dealt
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:27:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000360" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000360">The
Conservative example, which most people will remember, is the Dame
Shirley Porter scandal. She was the chairman of Westminster Council. At
the time, in 1987, it owned 23,000 council homes; 10,000 people were on
the housing list; and 9,800 homes were designated as being for sale.
The proposal was to ship out of Westminster enough people to allow it
to select the people who would replace them in their council houses. I
pay tribute to John Magill, the accountant, who kept his nerve
throughout that extremely difficult case, which went on for several
years. I can see the box files of evidence now; they were yards long.
The commission stood its ground; the accountant stood his ground. I am
sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Pannick, has left the Chamber. It was
towards the end of the operation when, wondering whether we were right,
the council decided to get independent advice on our judgment to appeal
at the end of the day. In his absence, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Pannick, for giving us the advice needed to allow us to keep our nerve.
The sum involved was £12 million. It would have been a very
serious problem for any local auditor to deal with and hold their
ground with that potential bill facing
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000361" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000361">Parliament
is proceeding with the Bill on very limited knowledge. The Minister has
already told me in answer to a Written Question, and I am sure she will
repeat it, that Parliament knew exactly what our intentions were and
what we were about. What I contest is that Parliament has been given
information of a nature that would materially assist it in arriving at
a sensible conclusion. There has been a pre-emption of Parliament here
in a way that may just get through on the basis that it has been told
what we are about, but it has certainly missed out on vital
information. This would be a rather interesting case for the Public
Accounts Committee to look at in the context of the House of Lords
Constitution Committee’s report on this matter, published
recently. At the heart of that is that a Bill should receive, if one
wants to pre-empt it, a demonstrably successful Second Reading in the
House of Commons. We have a Second Reading here, with hardly a massive
audience, on the eve of a bank holiday. I wonder whether that was a
sensible arrangement.</hs_para>

considerable sums of money. The studies show that the potential savings
are over £1 billion. I know that the Government say it is the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:55:00"></hs_TimeCode> Lords,
following on from that resounding vote of confidence, I need to declare
an interest, although I think that my interest has already been
declared for me by my noble friend Lord Tope, my friend of 27 years and
currently on Barnet Council. I am probably the only Member of your
Lordships’ House who still chairs an audit committee of a London
borough. As my noble friend said, I was rather stupidly elected last
night and, as noble Lords possibly know, the protocol in most boroughs
and local authorities is that it is an opposition councillor who
fulfils that post. That is what we did when we were in power, and I am
glad to see that this is what has happened in the borough of Barnet
when the Conservatives are in
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:37:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to put the publicity code on a statutory basis, to prevent councils
wasting public money on council-produced newspapers and magazines,
often containing political propaganda, even at the level of,
“Aren't we doing well?”—and very often it is
purely at that sort of level. Putting it on a statutory basis, as
framed, is unnecessary and heavy-handed. Local authorities need to
communicate and local newspapers are useful, but are not as effective
as they were. In my locality I find that I no longer know who the
editor is, or even if they have one. I do not recognise the names of
the local journalists, who are reduced in number, mainly office-based
and changing with great rapidity. The journal, be it local authority or
commercial, is in the end only as good as the guy delivering
it—or not delivering it, as the case may be. London boroughs
support commercial newspapers; I think that my noble friend Councillor
Tope referred to a figure of £26 million nationally. Some
£4 million per annum in London is spent on
advertising.</hs_para>

aspect of the Bill is aimed at that small minority of councils that
misuse public money for overtly political purposes. I hope that the
Minister will confirm that during the passage of the Bill we can come
up with a less heavy-handed way of dealing with this. My noble friends
Lord Tope and Lady Eaton both referred to this. My noble friend the
Minister said this Government are against top-down government, but what
is this if not top-down government?</hs_para>

now turn to the abolition of the much-reduced-in-size Audit Commission,
and the setting up of a system of locally appointed external auditors.
A main concern of the Bill is the preserving of auditor independence.
Currently, it is the Audit Commission that appoints external auditors
and that is seen as preserving auditor independence. It prevents
cherry-picking of audit opinions and helps the interaction with the
local authority start on a level playing field. There might also be a
concern from auditors, who quite naturally might believe that issuing
unfavourable audit opinions may adversely 
<?notus-xml column=909?>impact on their ability to obtain contracts in the future, as the very
people that they might criticise in their audit opinions will have a
say in their future
appointments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:40:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000375" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000375">The
Bill attempts to cover this through an independent panel to appoint
auditors, but, again, these panellists—as has been mentioned by
other noble Lords—will need to be skilful individuals who
understand what is important in terms of external auditor
characteristics and can assess value for money. Moreover, these panels
will be joint panels, appointing to a number of local authorities, and
will—with difficulty—need to ensure that conflicts of
interests are resolved. The conflict I envision is between internal
audit and external audit. In the London Borough of Barnet, one major
accounting firm has been appointed by the Audit Commission to carry out
the audit while locally, the internal audit team is enhanced by a
contract with a separate team from a major accounting firm. Therefore,
if this goes out to an independent panel, one can see pretty clearly
that there could be conflicts where an internal auditor might have to
resign in order to be the external auditor. It is incredibly
complex<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:41:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000376" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000376">The
Bill concentrates on the appointment of external auditors, but the
reality—and I am speaking as the current chair of an audit
committee—is that external audit at a reasonable cost is only as
good as the internal audit team of that local authority. In carrying
out the external audit, the auditor will first look at the internal
audit process and determine what reliance could be placed on it. I
cannot see any comment on this in the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000377" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000377">Then
there is the process and transparency of the
authority’s audit committee. In Barnet, we have a
committee of Labour councillors, Conservative councillors, two
independents who are not councillors and me, a Liberal Democrat
opposition councillor, as chairman. We involve the public, many of whom
are investigative bloggers, who have a space in the agenda to ask
questions and supplementary questions, which I must admit officers
sometimes find extremely uncomfortable. At the last meeting, there were
15 questions plus supplementary questions which I, as
chairman, had to answer, even though I am not a member of the
administration. The audit committee sessions are often recorded on
video by these members of the public and appear on their blog sites,
Facebook and the like. I must tell your Lordships that I find this a
great benefit because it is actually challenging and brings
transparency, however much at times it might seem
uncomfortable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:43:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of audit of process is done by the internal team which, if necessary,
buys in extra accountancy capacity. Any service area of the council
that is seen to have produced less than a satisfactory grading is then
required to send its service area director and/or assistant director to
come and explain how they intend to tackle the problem. It is not a
blame culture: if the report at the next meeting is still
unsatisfactory, they have to come back to be grilled again by the audit
committee, which is all-party and no-party. I am pleased to say that it
is rarely necessary for a director or assistant director to come back.

potholes, which concern most people. This shows he does not know what
happens on an audit committee. If there was a problem with potholes, it
would at least be brought up by members of the public, if nobody else.
It would be addressed by the audit committee. The director and
assistant director of that service area would be called to that
committee to explain and, by the next meeting, one would have to have
some resolution of that problem. That is what the audit committee of a
local authority

Christopher, also mentioned the millions of pounds lost through
incorrect investment. We have experience of that in the London Borough
of Barnet. A former Conservative administration borrowed money at a
good rate of interest; the noble Lord mentioned the same thing. It
invested £27.4 million in Icelandic banks. That was not a good
decision. What happened? How was this dealt with? Not by the Audit
Commission. It was dealt with by a combination of local authorities led
by Kent County Council, which combined to deal with the Icelandic
Government and banks. Most of that money, amazingly, is coming
back—they are actually very lucky. It was nothing to do with the
Audit Commission. It was, and can be, done
locally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:46:28"></hs_TimeCode>. The

changes in where the audit committee procures audit services to the
Companies Act model is that they will increase competition, reduce fees
and increase quality. My question is whether it will. I am not
convinced. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, spoke about the transfer of
audits from the Audit Commission to other firms of accountants. Is it
not amazing that the Audit Commission, which used to do a lot of the
audits itself, has over the past few years transferred 70% of audits to
audit firms? The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, raises the point that few
of those firms have had that. He also mentioned that the firm in
addition to the four main firms was Grant Thornton, which is still very
large. Is it not amazing that, to my knowledge, Grant Thornton got the
maximum number of audits permitted of those direct audits lost by the
Audit Commission? It took on a
lot<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:47:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to other firms. As a practising chartered accountant, a local
councillor and someone dealing with people in business, I can say that
a large organisation such as a local authority has to be extremely
courageous, as Sir Humphrey would probably have said, to go anywhere
other than the larger firms. Although it might seem a good
deal—maybe it is more cost-effective and you will get a good
deal—if something goes wrong, you will be criticised very
fiercely for not having gone to KPMG or PricewaterhouseCoopers. Many
local authorities will naturally take the safe course of going to one
of the larger firms. We must consider during the passage of the Bill

hope I do not surprise my noble friend too much by saying that this
Bill is welcome in many ways. I join other noble Lords in saluting the
abolition of the giant bureaucratic industry of performance assessment
and so on that grew up under the Audit Commission after 1997. I do not
for a moment take away from what the noble Lord, Lord Christopher,
whose work I respect immensely, has said. He is right to point to the
many good things that were done by the Audit Commission in the past,

the other hand, as others have said, there  are in

authority organisations. They fear that the clause leaves on the

of potential auditors. We have just heard a very powerful speech on
matters of audit, and I will not follow that specific line. However,
some arrangements in the Bill look very cumbersome, and I agree with

local audit and accountability, this Bill goes wider than just local
authorities, as it refers to other local bodies, including some NHS
bodies but not others. I shall spend a
little time on that. The Bill misses an opportunity for
local authorities to play a more constructive role in securing
effective audit and accountability of public bodies operating in their
local authority area. I will dwell specifically on the local
accountability of the NHS for its use of resources. This omission from
the Bill—the NHS weaves in and 
<?notus-xml column=912?>out of it at different stages—is a little disappointing, at a
time when the Government are rightly promoting health and social
services integration, a process in which my own authority has been
actively engaged for some time. The Government have also
acted—again, it is greatly welcomed by many
authorities—to give local councils a greater role in health. I
do not believe that as local authorities, health trusts and
commissioning groups grow together, audit arrangements can stay apart
and be handled through separate strands of legislation. There is a
growing perception that parts of the NHS regard themselves as beyond
reach in questions of local
accountability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000390">I
cite the example of Croydon Primary Care Trust, where, in 2011, a new
management team uncovered serious financial problems. An investigation
by Ernst &amp; Young followed, which confirmed a discrepancy in the
accounts of some £28 million, roughly equivalent to the cost of
a new secondary school or more than a fifth of my local
authority’s annual discretionary budget. Even then, when faced
with such findings, the NHS represented Ernst &amp; Young’s
report in its own way to gloss over some of the realities of what had
occurred. Had that taken place in a local authority, I would have been
forced to consider my position. Instead, the board member within the
trust who first raised concerns was eased out as a disruptive
influence, and a massive black hole in the accounts was apparently
covered by the stroke of a pen and the insertion of balancing items by
what proved to be an unqualified person. In the private sector this
would have counted as false accounting, and would have had the direst
consequences for those involved. In a local authority it would

of top management, who had failed to exercise due supervisory control

transfers of money held centrally on their behalf, to the detriment of

will be brief on other matters. On publicity, I am a slight dissenter.
I share the views of others that the system we have now operates
relatively well, and no doubt we will review the evidence base for the
proposals. However, when I took office in 2010, I abolished my own
authority’s glossy newspaper. I would do the same again, as it
did not in my view add much to the sum of human knowledge, so fast is
the world of communications evolving. However, local authorities must
communicate with local people and, increasingly, hear back from them.
Increasingly, this will be done by online and web-based methods.
Despite the limits on penetration, online communication is growing
fast. It is a necessary instrument of dynamic, localist initiatives in
which often differentiated approaches and priorities are enabled within
local authority areas. Already in our own localism initiatives, for
example, we so far have six separate web-based newsletters that allow
two-way communication between the public and the local authority. This
is a vital emerging instrument for effective and responsive governance.
I will want to be assured that regulations under the Bill will not

with the main thrust of the Bill in terms of audit. It was right to
abolish the Audit Commission and the complex inspection regime that it
had created. Probity and soundness in council finances can be assured
without the overly centralised machinery of the Audit Commission, which
acted as regulator, commissioner and provider of services as well as
the setter of its own fees. Councils should be accountable to their
electors rather than to the centrally imposed target culture which the
Audit Commission introduced and which took so much officer and member
time to deal with. However, in abolishing the Audit Commission, we have
to ensure that the public interest in what councils do is safeguarded.
With a few amendments, this Bill can do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000402" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000402">When I
was a board member of One North East, the regional development agency,
and a member of its audit committee, I found it hard to understand why
the RDA was audited by the National Audit Office whereas my council was
audited by the Audit Commission. I never felt that two national
auditing organisations were needed. I felt that
savings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T16:04:37"></hs_TimeCode> could be
made and the public interest secured more cheaply. It is no surprise to
me that there have been large savings of 40% in recent audit
procurement exercises— savings that councils can redirect into
services.</hs_para>

by value for money and I welcome that. It must beware of mission creep,
trying to do too much and spreading itself too thinly. It must also
beware of simply identifying problems rather than solutions. The Audit
Commission was excellent at financial audit and sometimes good in
value-for-money studies, although too rigid in its tick-box inspection
regime, but it was much poorer, at least in my experience, in devising
solutions. Time and again we would be criticised for a problem that we
already knew about and understood—an example is health
inequalities—but it was rare to get a clear statement on actions
needed or budgets required to deliver solutions. I hope that the
National Audit Office does not fall into the same trap of thinking it
has been useful when really it has not. But I doubt it will, because
the change to the NAO undertaking thematic studies is the right
approach.</hs_para>

I offer to the Minister some ideas as to what the NAO might look at in
its early days? It could examine the benefits or otherwise of unitary
councils or perhaps the potential for increasing local procurement.
Here we have a proposal for audit to be procured more locally, but
actually there is potential for greater local procurement and improving
the relationship of local suppliers with their local council. Might it
also look at the impact of the living wage in those places and on those
councils where it has been adopted with an assessment of its potential
for wider
application?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000405">Like
other noble Lords, I understand the concerns about the local public
audit section of the Bill for the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy. I am surprised that these have been made both at the
public consultation stage and in evidence to the Pre-legislative
Scrutiny Committee but none of it has been acted on. I am keen to hear
from the Minister why that is. Maybe we should be looking at this
specific issue very carefully, as other noble Lords have said, in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000406">Public
auditing needs to be conducted in the public interest. Put another way,
private sector auditing primarily concerns providing an audit opinion
on financial statements. Public sector auditing requires something more
in terms of propriety, probity and value for money. I have come to the
conclusion, particularly from listening to this debate, that we have to
be very clear on this matter during the passage of the Bill.</hs_para>

arisen in the course of the debate, which was raised by
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T16:08:05"></hs_TimeCode>CIPFA, and that
is the auditor panels. I agree that where audit committees already
exist, it might be sensible to build on those rather than establishing
separate auditor panels. I hope that we can look very carefully in
Committee at audit committees, where they exist, and auditor panels.
But above all, we have to maintain two things. First, we must maintain
the independence of the audit structures away from any suggestion of
party political influence or control. That takes us to the issue of
independence. Audit committees and auditor panels have to have a
majority of independent people externally appointed  
<?notus-xml column=916?>through robust mechanisms to make sure that the right people, who will
be working in the public interest, are appointed to those

second need is to ensure real competition in the provision of audit
services. Again there has been discussion in the House about that and
about how it can be done. I am encouraged to hear that many more than
the big four audit companies will be involved in auditing local
councils. Competition keeps costs down. I hope that we will see regular
changes in auditors by a specific authority, too, to ensure that things
never get too cosy. We must have a discussion on local as opposed to
national procurement and I hope that we will do that effectively in
Committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000409" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000409">Can
I mention briefly the publicity code, referred to in Clause 38? It is
not a problem for me that there is to be a statutory code. Here I
support the Government. The reason is simple. The Government do not
publish newspapers, and nor should local councils. It is one thing for
councils to publish information; it is absolutely right that they
should, be it on the web, or be it a quarterly or bi-monthly
publication. I have no difficulty with that. I do have a difficulty
with weekly newspapers, which run the risk of being seen as propaganda.
If we want a free press it has to be free of any suggestion of
party-political influence. I see a weekly newspaper as a step too far.
It is likely, inevitably, to verge on the propagandist.</hs_para>

issue around the notices, however. Requiring councils to advertise them
in local newspapers can be expensive, at around £40 million a
year. I am not sure that that is as cost-effective as it might be and
conceivably it is outside the requirements for the National Audit
Office to deliver value for money. Councils should be free
to devise their own solutions to this. There are many ways in which it
could be done, not just on the web but in regular reports to ward
committees, and so on. There are things that can be done to reach a
wider
audience.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000411" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000411">Finally,
on referendums, my position differs from that of the Government. I have
never liked the power given to the Secretary of State to cap council
tax rises and order a referendum over an arbitrary figure selected in
Whitehall. There are four
reasons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000412" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000412">First,
it is against the principles of localism. Secondly, accountability is
better done through the election of councillors at local elections.
Thirdly, the Government do not hold referendums when they increase
taxation. When VAT was increased two or three years ago there was no
national referendum on it. It is unclear to me why it should be thought
that referendums are right when local councils increase council tax.
Fourthly, council tax levels can differ widely, something we do not
talk enough about. Levels in neighbouring councils, whether you compare
at band D or compare the average amount paid in a council area, can
vary by several hundred pounds. If one council decides to raise a bit
more money to protect essential services, such as libraries, swimming
pools or local facilities, or to provide a decent standard of adult
social care, why should it have to hold a referendum to do
so?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000413">The Bill
could make things worse. I am not clear why Clause 39 is needed at all.
I have major problems over the issue of levies. What is being proposed
as 
<?notus-xml column=917?>regards levies counting as part of the Secretary of State’s
decision about the maximum council tax rise is not acceptable. I
believe that it will have to be amended in Committee. It certainly
cannot be retrospective but, more than that, even if a referendum
decides that an increase should not be permitted for a levying body, a
local council would be left picking up the bill for it. In doing so the
council would therefore have to cut services. I do not think that this
is acceptable. I am starting to wonder whether Clause 39 is needed at
all in the Bill and hope that we will explore that too in
Committee.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/ADF3DCBCC72B2C10A325C9BCCA3C8172D0E40736" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

both central and local government, and that is unlikely to take place
under the auspices of the National Audit Office, if it is to carry out
its responsibilities in the way that we learnt yesterday. That is
particularly regrettable in the health and social care fields, which,
after all, we in your Lordships’ House have begun debating and
in which the need for closer working relationships is emphatically
emphasised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000430" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000430">Health
will now potentially have a separate field of auditors, although the
same firm might end up auditing the clinical commissioning group and
the local council, presumably with different staff. There is a notion,
ventilated in the ad hoc sub-committee’s deliberations, that the
Local Government Association will be able, in some respects, to replace
the commission’s work and to sustain its improvement programme.
I am afraid that is illusory. The Local Government Association has been
the target of another of the Secretary of State’s obsessions. He
has cut its funding, topsliced from the revenue support grant, from
£41.3 million a year to £25.5 million, or by 38%. That
has significant implications for its staffing and capacity to represent
the sector and enhance its effectiveness. Interestingly, £25
million is the sum that local government is paying into the coffers of
the local press for the statutory advertisements to which other noble
Lords have referred.</hs_para>

McKenzie has pointed out, the privatisation of district audit and the
new tendering system leaves a handful of large accountancy firms, many
of which have other services to sell to the councils that they are
auditing, and have an effective oligopoly of the audit role, at least
in the larger councils. The noble Lord, Lord Shipley, exaggerates the
benefits of the change. There are not a large number of firms. Seven
are accredited nationally, two of which are arms of just one
organisation. Therefore, there are effectively five firms, one with a
couple of branches. That does not offer a vast choice. There will be a
requirement to retender every five years but your Lordships might think
that it would be better if the requirement were to be a change of
auditors every five years to ensure that there is a turn-around and
that the relationship does not get too close. That is a matter that we
can perhaps pursue in Committee.</hs_para>

the abolition of the Audit Commission. I did not 
<?notus-xml column=922?>get a sense of any great exasperation—except perhaps from the
noble Lord, Lord Christopher—that the Audit Commission was
coming to the end of its days. However, I understand that there are

have sheaves of answers to questions and I do not want to go through
all of them. Because of the time, everybody will want to go. I will
deal with just one or two areas. The question was raised about the
training and supervision of auditors. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie,
raised this point. Recognised supervisory bodies are being put into
place and they will lay down the rules and the training that must be
implicit in auditors applying to do work for local authorities. We can
discuss this further, but we can be sure that there is an understanding
that auditors must first understand local government finance, apart
from anything else; that seems pretty basic. They will also have to be
independent from the authority. This point was made by the noble Lord,
Lord Palmer. There should be absolutely clear independence between the
audit committee and the auditors. I think we shall be able to satisfy
the noble Lord that this is what will
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000443" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000443">A
number of noble Lords raised the question of whether just four
companies would bid for this audit. I said in my opening remarks that
we expected considerably more than those four. Thirteen fulfilled the
pre-qualification when it was put out. With the expectation that local
authorities will seek auditors independently, or perhaps come together
in a small cohort, there will be a requirement for more local auditors
who are smaller companies. They will have to be properly qualified and
be able to do their job, and while the suggestion is that for
safety’s sake everybody will go for the big four, I hope and
believe that there is an opening for others to take
part.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052251000444" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-0002.htm#13052251000444">The

fulfil the role of being independent and who have some idea of what it
is all about. It is not unusual for local authorities to have to find
independent members; they do it for standards boards and other things,
and many of them have them on their pension fund committees as well. It

point was made by the noble Lord, Lord Palmer, who is obviously very
experienced, and he will recognise that that is the situation. The
regulations are made under the Audit Commission Act but we intend that
those regulations made under Clause 31 will make similar provision in
the future. The requirement for health service bodies to maintain the

not taken. We understand that the audit of public funds needs a broader
scope than the audit of companies. After consultation we decided that
the same scope of the audit provides a good balance between maintaining
the high quality of audit and audit fees. The noble Lord, Lord Palmer,
again with his experience, suggested that auditors will be reluctant to
criticise that appointment for fear of not being reappointed. They have
statutory duties to consider whether they need to make public interest
reports; so they cannot be so biased in favour of the local authority
that they do not do that. Local people have a right to appeal and they
will have to deal with that as well. I do not think that they will be

often that they are becoming a pressure on the local press. We all
agree that the local press is a very important part of being able to
inform local people of what is going on, and what the councils are
doing. It is worth pointing out that taking action about these papers
was not only in the coalition agreement but was a pledge in the general
manifestos of both the coalition partners. There is a publicity code

Dubs:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a very serious housing crisis in
this country. Too many families are homeless, badly housed or in
temporary accommodation. The situation has got worse largely as a
result of coalition policies: first, too little housebuilding,
especially for the poorest members of our society; and, secondly, the
results of government policies on welfare. The more I have looked into
this situation, in preparation for this debate and even before that,
the more I feel that one cannot look at housing in isolation; one has
to look at the whole social welfare system in order to understand the
effect of changing the social welfare on housing. Part of what I want
to say will be to do with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000003">One
has to ask: why is there such a housing crisis? No peacetime Government
since the 1920s have presided over fewer housing completions than this
Government of the past two years. It is actually getting worse. In
2012, housing starts were 11% lower and dropped below 100,000.
Housebuilding in Britain has now hit new lows. The actual figure of
housing starts last year was 98,280. New home starts have been lower in
every single quarter than when Labour left power in
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000004">We have
a definition of statutory homelessness—I do not believe it
covers all homelessness but it is a working definition—and that
has risen by more than a third since the election that brought the
coalition to power. At the end of the second quarter of 2010, the
number of homeless people stood at 10,100 and hit 13,890 in the last
quarter. In practical terms, homelessness may be higher than that
because the statutory definition is somewhat
limited.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000005">The
Government have introduced the benefit cap, which I believe will make
more people homeless. In London alone 7,000 families stand to lose more
than £100 a week. Mr Leslie Morphy, the chief executive of
Crisis, the homelessness charity, said:</hs_para>

of cutting just a few pounds a week from their benefits, families and
individuals are being forced out of their homes, to be put up in
B&amp;Bs or temporary accommodation that costs us all far
more”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13052252000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000280">The
Labour Party’s contention is that there are regional variations
and the Government’s benefit-cap approach has not taken account
of that fact—it is not a matter of one size fits all. The Labour
leader, Ed Miliband, said that the benefits cap should take into
account housing costs in each region. He
said:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="13052252000296" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000296">“We've
said we're in favour of a benefit cap but it has got to be adjusted
regionally depending on housing costs in each region. The danger of the
way the government is doing the cap is that it 
<?notus-xml column=54?>forces people into temporary accommodation, bed and breakfasts, which
drives up costs not reduces them. And actually what we're seeing with
the welfare bill is, despite the cuts the government is making, the
welfare bill rising and not
falling”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13052252000281" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000281">That

we all call the bedroom tax is going to have a very important effect on
housing. Frankly, it is hard to find anybody who has a good word to say
about this policy. It is likely to cost far more than it saves. It has
been estimated that 31% of working-age housing benefit claimants in the
social rented sector—that is, 660,000 claimants—are
likely to be affected by this measure. The problem is that there simply
is not the smaller accommodation for people to move into. If there
were, it might just about be a viable policy. For example, in the Hull
City Council area, 4,700 tenants are likely to be affected by
the policy but the council has only 73 one- or two-bedroom
properties to let. It does not make any sense. How can it be possible
to force, drive or coerce—whatever word one wants to
use—tenants out of accommodation in which they are alleged to
have an extra bedroom when there is nowhere else for them to

that two-thirds of the households being hit contain within the home
someone who is disabled. The Government have tried to meet the needs of
disabled people in such circumstances, but it is going to be very
cumbersome to measure those needs. Indeed, we know that disability is
not a constant. People with disabilities often find that they have a
developing condition, so that someone who is a bit disabled one day may
be more disabled in the future. If they are forced out of their home,
the situation can become particularly difficult for that

that, over the past four years, the cost to councils of bed and
breakfast hostels and shelters has been £2 billion. The problem
is that the figure is increasing, which makes any savings to be made on
the welfare bill look even more remote. There is a now a clear pressure
on families to move out of central London simply because they cannot be
rehoused in their own local area; that is to say, never mind that they
cannot afford the rent because of the benefits cap because there is
also the bedroom tax. London boroughs in particular are rapidly
accelerating the rehousing of homeless households outside their home
boroughs. During the year up to this April, almost 11,000 households
were rehoused in this way, a rise of 16% on the previous 12 months.
Most of those households left inner London for the cheaper outer
suburbs, but some were moved to towns completely outside the capital,
such as Dartford in Kent and Slough in Berkshire, or to the borough of
Spelthorne in Surrey. Inevitably this has put a strain on local
services and many council leaders outside London are now complaining
about it. For example, Mr Edward Smith, a Conservative councillor in
Enfield, has said:</hs_para>

trouble is that the policy is not happening. He may be insisting on it,
but it is simply not the way it is working. I should mention in passing
that rough sleeping rose by 23% two years ago and by 6% last year,
which represents a rise of a third since 2010. Rough sleeping is, of
course, one of the most serious aspects of housing
difficulties.</hs_parafo>

issue of temporary accommodation. The latest Government figures show
that 53,130 households were living in temporary accommodation at the
end of 2012, a rise of 9% on the previous year. The statutory limit for
families living in bed and breakfast accommodation is six weeks.
However, estimates suggest that a third of British local authorities
are in breach of this limit, largely because of the shortage of
suitable temporary accommodation. Last year, 12 of Britain’s
biggest cities spent £464 million on temporary accommodation, an
increase of almost 6%, while the London boroughs are budgeting for
significant further increases this year.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052252000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000011">Before I conclude, I
want to say a word about overcrowding. There is a definition of
overcrowding, but even accepting that definition, it varies according
to the type of accommodation in which the household or family is
living. Under the definition, almost 7% of social renters and 6% of
private renters are overcrowded in their accommodation. I appreciate
that the Government’s answer is that the bedroom tax will deal
with overcrowding and that the Minister will quote figures to show how
many people have spare accommodation. I have already talked about why
the policy is not working. If one could simply switch people from one
to the other property within the same neighbourhood, it might be
easier, but housing does not work that way and the Government must
surely know that.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:09:43"></hs_TimeCode> problem is
that the policy is causing enormous dislocation to households and
families. If people have to move a long way away from where they have
been settled, that is upsetting for them, it is not desirable and it is
yet another sign that the Government’s policies are not working.
There is a real crisis here and everyone who is looking at it says that
it is getting worse. I hope that the Government will do something about
it because the next Labour Government will certainly have
to.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/6B96AD4F8FBEBE9B1E6703A811F324BBCBE87E6A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Maddock:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for
introducing a housing debate, which we have far too infrequently in the
House of Lords. Twenty years ago when I entered the House of Commons, I
devoted considerable time in my first or second year there—I am
not sure which it was—to the Housing Bill which was then
proceeding through Parliament. We focused a lot on the duties of local
councils to the homeless. Not long before that, one of 
<?notus-xml column=56?>my colleagues who was at that time the MP for the Isle of Wight, had
successfully introduced a Private Member’s Bill to establish
some of the first duties to be imposed on local authorities with regard
to homeless people. But here we are, 20 years later, still facing a
situation in which we are unable to provide sufficient housing for
people in our country. I find it even more amazing that for many of
those years our economy was doing very well, yet we did not address the
need for more affordable homes. We were raking in huge amounts of stamp
duty. At the beginning of the previous Labour Government’s term
of office, less than £1 billion was received in stamp duty; by
the end, it was many billions of pounds. I said at the time that we
should have used some of that money to address the shortage of social
housing. If a fraction of that money had been spent on social housing,
we would be in a much happier situation
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:11:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000013">The
noble Lord, Lord Dubs, described the housing crisis. I agree that when
the coalition came to power in May 2010, we inherited a housing crisis.
Some 1.5 million homes had been lost from the stock under
previous Governments since 1979. Those Governments continually failed
to build enough homes to cover the social housing that was sold off. We
saw social housing waiting lists soar from 1 million in 1997 to 1.8
million in 2010. Housing targets were routinely missed. Even the
top-down regional spatial strategies of the previous Labour Government
consistently failed to meet that Government’s targets and, in
the last year of that Government, they fell short by 78,000. We find
ourselves with not enough affordable homes to go round and a difficult
task for the coalition to address when we are also trying to address
the effects of the economic crisis we are still going through. The
coalition announced in the comprehensive spending review that it would
build 150,000 new social homes during this Parliament, and it now
expects to exceed that. I am sure that my noble friend the Minister
will give us a little more detail on that when he replies to the
debate. The coalition has also committed more than £160 million
to bringing empty homes back into use as social and private
housing—another issue on which I have campaigned for the past 20
or so years. A total of 11,200 homes will be brought back into use as
part of this fund. This comfortably exceeds the target that was set of
3,300. However, another 5,000 homes will be brought back into use as
part of the £300 million capital programme, taking the total to
over
16,000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000014">The
noble Lord, Lord Dubs, rightly discussed how we deal with families
living in temporary homes and in bed and breakfast for rather longer
periods than anybody would want, and asked what the Government were
going to do about that. Local authorities have a duty to provide
temporary accommodation and it is up to them how they meet that duty,
although it is, of course, subject to central government guidance.
There are two main reasons why we need to deal with this. One, of
course, is the human cost, which has already been mentioned. It is not
only the awfulness of not having a home of your own to imagine living
in for a period but the effect on children’s education and so
on. We would all agree that human misery is one of the most important
reasons why we have to deal with this.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=57?><hs_para UID="13052252000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000015">At the same time as
trying to alleviate human misery, one spends money, and therefore the
financial cost of putting people in temporary accommodation is huge, as
the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said. A recent report stated that the 12
largest cities spent nearly £2 million on temporary
accommodation in the past four years. That is enough to build 72,000
homes. In the past year, the cost of bed and breakfast has risen by
more than 25%. If you look at the financial benefits of building more
homes, it is clear that the money should be focused on this because we
get a benefit of around £2.84 for every £1
spent.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052252000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000016">As I
intimated earlier, part of the action and a lot of the solutions have
to be local. I declare an interest as a vice-president of the Local
Government Association, and I am grateful to it for some of the
information that I will mention about how local authorities are dealing
with this. As the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, it is clear that the way
local authorities deal with those in bed and breakfast and temporary
accommodation varies hugely. In December last year, the worst offender
was, amazingly, Conservative-run Croydon which had 156 households in
bed and breakfast for more than six weeks, followed by Labour-run
Barking and Dagenham which had 69 households. Some of the councils run
by Liberal Democrats have very low numbers, but I shall not labour that
point.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052252000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000017">The
picture is emerging for a variety of reasons. The noble Lord, Lord
Dubs, pointed out the changes to benefits and so on, and there are new
pressures on councils. Even councils that have a very good record on
dealing with people in this situation are finding it very difficult. I
asked the Local Government Association for some information about what
the best local authorities are doing in this respect. One thing is very
clear: if local authorities maintain a balanced portfolio of
accommodation, they are in a much better position to spread the risk
and to respond when markets and funding change. The other key thing is
having an efficient housing benefit service that landlords who are
taking people can rely on. Councils that work very hard to maintain
good relationships with providers by not messing them around and being
very responsive do better at keeping people out of bed and

Borough of Sutton which, as noble Lords will know, is run by the
Liberal Democrats. My noble friend Lord Tope was the leader of the
council for many years. It was considering closing a local
authority-owned care home, not an easy thing to do, because of the way
care was changing. It decided to use the building for temporary
accommodation. The path was quite tricky because it was closing a care
home and the stereotypes that people discuss when homeless families are
coming to live in their area had to be overcome. It has been a long
process, but the council envisages that the converted property will
provide accommodation for between 40 and 43 families that would
otherwise face the dislocation of living outside the borough for
several months. That backs up the other point that I made about the
importance of councils working with private sector providers to find
tenancies for families. They have worked very hard to attract
landlords, keep them and deal with them. I particularly noticed that
they prepare a helpful and 
<?notus-xml column=58?>innovative welcome pack for landlords, and they have
been advised that they value this very much. That way, they have been
able to keep a pool of landlords that help them to meet their statutory
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:20:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000019">I
hope that my noble friend will be able to enlarge on some of the issues
that I have talked about. It is important that we deal with this,
because, as I say, the most important thing is the human misery for
families who have to live in these conditions. My mother left my father
when I was 11, and we went to live in a small town on the south coast.
We lived in private rented accommodation and never stayed more than
nine months in any place. I am pleased to say that, in my grown-up
life, I have not had to do that—so I can say from first-hand
experience that this is not satisfactory. We are a wealthy nation, we
have known about this for 20 years, and we still have not managed to do
anything about it. We all need to work to try to spread best practice.
We are where we are with the money and benefits and so on, and I hope
that the Government will work with local authorities to help to spread
best practice to try to reduce the misery for families in these
conditions.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13052252000320" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000320"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:21:06"></hs_TimeCode></I>12.21

social housing, and she is a great stalwart of it. Indeed, she has

noble friend has dealt with the subject of the housing shortage. It
might seem quite a crass statement to make, but I believe that the
people out there could not care less about political policy or about
who is dealing with it and who is right or wrong. They care about
having a home, which provides so much to the rest of their lives. It
brings stability, a feeling of well-being, security, and the
opportunity for them to bring their children up in the family
environment that they want. At the other end of life, for older people
who may be occupying accommodation that we may agree is rather larger
than they need, it is nevertheless where they have been for years and
years—and it provides the opportunity for their daughter or son,
or another member of their family, or even a carer that they may need
from time to time, to stay with them. So the housing shortage is not
just about housing; it is about the whole of our
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:22:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000022">The
bedroom tax, as it has been christened, is not a new idea. It was
something that was discussed and sought to be applied—and was
applied, in some respects—many years ago. But then it was
concentrated on students going off to university and the family having
affordable rented accommodation from a housing association or local
authority, when it was said that the bedroom was no longer needed. So I
do not want this to be a party-political debate, but let us put one or
two things straight. With the new affordable homes budget, the money
available from central government to the provision of affordable
housing has been cut by 60%. The previous Government allocated
£8.4 billion for the three-year period from 2008 to 2011, under
the 
<?notus-xml column=59?>last comprehensive spending review that they applied. The current
Government have allocated just over half of that, at £4.5
billion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:24:03"></hs_TimeCode> for the
four-year period 2011 to 2015. The Homes and Communities Agency has
announced—and the agency knows, because they are the people who
allocate the funding for affordable homes—that it is down 68%
year on year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
That figure meant that in 2010-11 just under 50,000 new-build,
affordable homes were started. It was the first year of the new
coalition but the last year of the previous Government’s
comprehensive spending review. That was the number of new homes in the
first year of this Government but in 2011-12 it dropped substantially
to 15,700 homes. So here we are with a housing shortage, and it is
going to get worse rather than better.</hs_para>

Minister, Grant Shapps, announced that the Government claim that by
2015 170,000 new homes will have been provided under government
funding. However, what he did not say was that 70,000 of that 170,000
were started by the previous Government. So let us get the facts
straight: the previous Government were not an utter failure. They did
not build as many homes as I would have liked and I would have been
critical of the policy, but it is not all down to the previous
Government. In any case, even if there is a part of you that feels it
was and you want to rectify the situation, you do not do it by cutting
the budget by half or, indeed, by claiming that you are building houses
that you did not actually
commence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:26:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Not only was it searing for people who were homeless and interested in
the subject; it really shocked the country. The day after the programme

did then start to be done by the then Conservative
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:26:37"></hs_TimeCode>. If

brought home to me when, as chairman of the Housing Corporation, I went
to a lot of areas. It was the simple statements that brought home to me
the difference that housing could make. I remember one mother standing
up at a local conference that we had organised. She said, “Since
we’ve moved into this council flat, it has made two key
differences to my kids. One is that one of my children was always off
school with colds and being unwell. Now we are in a decent home,
I’ve suddenly realised that they’re going to school
regularly. Their health has improved substantially. But also their
attention at school has improved because they have somewhere to sit and
do their homework. Yes, they do it in the kitchen—we
don’t have a spare room—but there’s a homeliness
there and there’s peace and quiet for them, and it’s made
a substantial difference to our family’s quality of
life<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:27:57"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

bedroom tax and housing shortage we concentrate on areas of biggest
need—London and the periphery of London—but we should 
<?notus-xml column=60?>not forget the provincial cities, which increasingly also have problems
with homelessness. Nor should we forget the rural areas, as many people
tend to do. They think that they are sublime areas in which to live,

centre of our lives and impacts on our lives, and where it impacts
negatively, society picks up the bill further down the line, whether it
is a bill relating to health problems or children not concentrating or

factor, which is the overall medium and long-term impact on registered
social landlords. If they are not getting the money to build, obviously
they will not build, so what are the long-term prospects for the
prosperity of these organisations? If the registered housebuilding
sector, such as housing associations, is diminishing, what does the
future hold? What will happen if we start to dilute or reduce their
ability? Remember that, although they are called housing associations,
one great asset they bring to housing is that they do not just build
houses. Until recently, I was a non-executive director of Taylor
Wimpey. We were not in the regeneration game; we were in the game of
building houses. Housing associations are great regeneration agencies.
They look at the whole community and provide services that other
organisations cannot or do not provide. If because of their balance
sheet they are restricted on their investment, and therefore on their
overall strategic policy and have to draw back—and remember that
they are also substantially funded by the private sector through bonds
and other means—when we come through the Government’s
austerity measures, we will not have the facilities to pump-prime the
massive housebuilding programme that we

Collins of Highbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank my noble
friend Lord Dubs for initiating this debate. As he said, even using the
limited definition of “statutory homelessness”, that went
from 10,100 at the end of 2010 to 13,570 at the end of 2012. As a
result, local authorities are placing a worrying number of families in
temporary accommodation. There were 53,130 households living in
temporary accommodation at the end of 2012, 9% higher than the previous
year. The failure to tackle this problem, as highlighted by my noble
friend Lady Dean, is devastating for many families and, according to
new research by the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, referred to by
my noble friend, is proving incredibly costly.</hs_para>

£2 billion over the past four years housing vulnerable homeless
families in short-term, temporary accommodation. In that time,
£1.88 billion has gone on temporary accommodation in 12 of
Britain’s biggest cities—enough to build 72,000 homes in
London and house all 53,000 or so households which are currently
homeless, as the noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said. As my noble friend
Lord Dubs highlighted, London Councils are rapidly accelerating the
rehousing of homeless households outside their home boroughs; 32,643
homeless households have been rehoused out of their borough since 2009.
In the year to April, 10,832 households were rehoused in this way, a
15.86% rise in the previous 12 months, and 44,860 households in
temporary accommodation—84%—were in self-contained
accommodation. Moreover, 40,860 of those in temporary accommodation
included dependent children and/or pregnant women, in which households
there were 76,790 children or expected children. Of these, the number
placed in bed-and-breakfast accommodation increased from 630 at the end
of March 2010 to 1,690 at the end of
December.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000032">Official

noble friend Lord Dubs said in opening this debate, we face the biggest
housing crisis in a generation, and the Government’s housing and
economic policies are not helping. The first priority must be to
address, by building more homes, the housing shortage that is the
underlying cause of homelessness, overcrowding, high rents and low
standards of accommodation. House-building is crucial to the economic
recovery and in helping to get families on the housing ladder. The
Government have launched four major housing schemes in three years and
made more than 300 announcements on housing, yet all these schemes have
so far completely failed to tackle the housing crisis. By simply
stimulating demand through plans for help-to-buy mortgage guarantees
and equity loans rather than directly boosting supply, there is a
danger that they will simply push up prices. Although we had
some positive news this morning from the Nationwide Building Society
that first-time buyers are beginning to get into the housing
market, it is still too little and, perhaps, a little too
late.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052252000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000034">As we
have heard in this debate, we also need subsidised housing for those
who cannot afford to purchase or to pay full market rents. Action on
affordable homes is needed, and the announcement that an extra
£225 million will be available is welcome news, but only
£125 million will be spent before 2015 according to the OBR and,
as my noble friend Lady Dean said, that is dwarfed by the £4
billion cut in funding for affordable housing that the Chancellor made
in his first budget.</hs_para>

department introduces measures to support housing, another exacerbates
the problem, as we heard from my noble friend Lord Dubs. The bedroom
tax, the levy on housing association and council tenants deemed to have
a spare room, penalises those in work as well as those who must find
the money from their other benefits by cutting back on essentials.
While scrapping this measure would be best, when the Government are
reviewing its impact, will they consider the current discretionary
housing payments, which local authorities need to deploy in the many
cases of hardship where tenants cannot be offered a suitable smaller
property?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000036">As
chair of a credit union, I am only too aware of the issues that my
noble friend Lady Dean raised. Many housing associations have tenants
who are going to be hit by the welfare changes and are anticipating
major problems of rent arrears. This not only means they must cut back
on spending on new housing investment just when the Government need
them to do more but, as the noble Lord, Lord Best, highlighted in his
contribution on the gracious Speech, they will be less able to
undertake broader community work, such as addressing those with special
needs, tackling anti-social behaviour and supporting young people into
training and
jobs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000037">At the
root of the temporary housing problem is the failure to build enough
affordable housing. With the huge squeeze in living standards and a
faltering economy, the Government’s failure to provide
affordable housing means that millions of families are priced out of
living in a decent home. As my noble friend Lady Dean pointed out,
official statistics from the Homes and Communities Agency show that
affordable housing starts collapsed in the last financial year by 68%,
dropping from 49,363 in 2010-11 to only 15,698 in 2011-12. Furthermore,
at 80% of market rent, many of the homes under the Government’s
affordable homes programme are not affordable in many parts of the
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000038">The

should say from the outset that the Government see—and certainly
I saw this at first hand during my tenure in local

not by politicising it, as the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said. This is
about people’s 
<?notus-xml column=63?>future and their lives, and often their families, who are desperately in
need of support to get themselves on their feet. I totally share the
sentiments, as expressed by the noble Baroness, about ensuring that

also recognise that the issues raised by noble Lords in the debate

This is not something new; the housing crisis is a reality that has

turn to a few facts. I acknowledge that, if one casts one’s mind
back to about 2003, there were then about 135,000 households in England
that were accepted as being homeless by local authorities. At the end
of last year, this figure was just in excess of 53,000. I would like to
clarify one point. The noble Lord, Lord Dubs, raised the issue of
53,000 in terms of temporary bed and breakfast accommodation, which is
currently 4,000. Overall numbers in temporary accommodation are much
smaller than they reached in 2004, when it was closer to 100,000. That
said—and we can talk about statistics—I acknowledge the
fact that, after 2004 the previous Government took some stringent steps
to address that particular need, and also to bring it to the attention
of local authorities, which are at the forefront of tackling this
particular
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:43:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000043">The

homelessness work at what are, as my noble friend Lady Maddock
acknowledged, very challenging times for the Government. The Government
have invested £470 million over the spending review period in
prevention of homelessness, including the reduced use of temporary
accommodation. There has been an additional £70
million this year, including £18.5 million to tackle rough
sleeping, targeted at local authorities and £20 million for a

share the sentiments that have been expressed by several noble Lords.
The Government are keen to ensure that local authorities support
homeless households into stable, secure and suitable long-term
accommodation as soon as possible. In my time as a local councillor, I
saw for myself the importance of this issue, particularly where
children have spent long periods in temporary accommodation. It can be
very damaging. That is why we have retained the order introduced by the
previous Government in 2004 to limit the use of bed and breakfast
accommodation, and I will return to this in a moment. The order makes
it illegal to place families in this type of accommodation for any
longer than six
weeks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:45:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that despite the order, during the first half of last year we did see
an increase in the use of bed and breakfast accommodation, but I am
pleased to say that when the latest figures were released in March, the
numbers had dropped in comparison with the preceding quarter. However,
I reiterate that the Government are in no way complacent about this.
Where authorities are placing families in bed and 
<?notus-xml column=64?>breakfast accommodation for longer than six weeks,
let me make it clear that it is unlawful and unacceptable. I share the
concerns expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, in this
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:45:59"></hs_TimeCode>.
Officials at the Department for Communities and Local Government are
working closely with those local authorities which have the highest
number of families in bed and breakfast accommodation to help them
address the issue. We are confident that the numbers being left in this
type of accommodation for longer than six weeks can be
reduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:46:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Dubs, also mentioned the issue of rough sleeping. We will make sure
that we continue to tackle and prevent rough sleeping, and I am greatly
encouraged by the success here in London of the mayor’s No
Second Night Out pilot project, which has ensured that 87% of new rough
sleepers do not spend a second night on the streets of London. We are
rolling out the No Second Night Out project nationally, and all local
authorities are planning to introduce the scheme. Many key rough
sleeping areas like Merseyside, Greater Manchester, Oxford and
Northamptonshire are already operating schemes. Again, I am very
supportive of this. I focused on a project for my own party which
looked in particular at inner cities, and I know how acute the
challenge and associated problems of rough sleeping can
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:47:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the location of the housing being offered by local authorities.
Vulnerable households need protection and it is not acceptable for
families to be dumped en masse long distances away from home. This
matter has been raised by my honourable friend Mark Prisk, the housing
Minister, and it is a point that he has reiterated and made clear to
councils. For our part, we introduced new powers in the Localism
Act 2011 so that councils can now use good quality private
rented sector accommodation to meet the main homelessness duty, thus
helping to reduce the need to use temporary accommodation. Where
councils do feel the need to move families away from their home
borough, they must by law take account of the suitability of the
accommodation being offered to each homeless household and consider the
impact that the change in location will have, including
possible disruption to employment, education and, of course,
caring responsibilities. The law is clear, and councils not doing this
will be
challenged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:48:15"></hs_TimeCode>.
During the consultation for the suitability order, both the London
Development Agency and London Councils welcomed the flexibility
afforded to local authorities to discharge their homelessness duty in
the private
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:48:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

suitability order and outer borough policy was again a concern of the
noble Lord, Lord Dubs. It will ensure proper accommodation. For the
information of noble Lords, it will look at five broad areas: the
physical condition of the property, health and safety, matters relating
to the property such as electricity and fire safety, licensing for
houses in multiple occupation, landlord behaviour and elements of good
management<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

including the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, and my noble friend Lady Maddock,
mentioned overcrowding. As has been acknowledged by various speakers,
the Government aim to deliver some 200,000 new affordable homes by
2016-17. This 
<?notus-xml column=65?>will be achieved through our new Affordable Homes Programme and
additional homes under the Housing Guarantee Scheme. With a total
investment that includes £19.5 billion from the private sector,
our main affordable programme remains on track to deliver 170,000 new
affordable homes for rent and ownership by March 2015. I totally
acknowledge that this is not just about quoting figures; we need to
ensure that we build those houses—a sentiment aired by the noble
Baroness, Lady Dean, which I share. Up to a further 30,000 homes will
also have been started on site by March 2015, supported by our
affordable housing guarantee of £10 billion and a grant of
£450
million<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:50:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Taken
together, the reforms to social housing allocations, homelessness and
tenure in the Localism Act 2011 will make it easier for social
landlords to manage their existing stock generally to reduce
homelessness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:50:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to the fact that 200,000 new affordable homes will be delivered, and we
are on target to achieve that. Almost 58,000 affordable homes,
including first-buy homes, were delivered in 2011-12, which is a third
more than the average delivery in the 10 years between 2001 and
2009-10. We are also confident about delivery. In 2011-12, the HCA
exceeded its target by more than 13,000. Almost 60,000 completions have
been delivered in the first 18 months of the affordable
homes programme—that is, 37% of the 170,000 being delivered
between 2001 and 2015. The UK Statistics Authority has confirmed that
there was a loss of 421,000 social rented homes under the previous
Government. The extension to the affordable homes guarantee programme
to 2016-17 will, we believe, help providers to develop stronger bids
for more homes. In the 2013 spending round, we will be looking at the
range of policy options on the supply of affordable housing beyond
2015. This will give providers greater clarity on the policy relating
to affordable housing beyond 2015 to inform their long-term business
planning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:51:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Maddock raised the issue of certain local councils. I know the
challenges faced by, for example, Croydon, which she highlighted. It is
a borough not too far from where I used to serve as a local councillor.
I know for a fact that the Government are working with Croydon to
reduce those figures. We are informed that they have come down
significantly and, indeed, are set to reduce further. However, I would
highlight that, because of new arrivals into the UK, Croydon faces
particular acute challenges in housing

noble friend Lady Maddock raised the issue of best practice among
councils, and this is very important. Perhaps I may again quote the
noble Baroness, Lady Dean: this is not about politics; it is about
ensuring that we get the right result. Where there is good practice,
whether it is in a Conservative council, a Lib Dem council, a Labour
council or a council of whatever other colour we may conjure up in the
years ahead, it is important that that practice is adhered to and
shared. I acknowledge the work done by, for example, London Councils in

this point, I want to turn to a concern raised by the noble Lords, Lord
Dubs and Lord Collins of Highbury, and indeed by other noble Lords, not
just in this debate but previously, relating to what has been referred
to in the media as a bedroom tax but was in fact a subsidy granted by
the Government. There are specific exemptions and mitigations that I
wish to highlight in this regard. Those mitigations and exemptions
apply, for example, to approved foster carers and to the parents of
adult children in the Armed Forces who normally live at home but are
deployed on operations. People living in supported exempt accommodation
are not affected by this measure. DWP guidance is that local
authorities may also allow an extra bedroom to address issues of
disability, particularly where a disabled child or children are unable
to share a room because of their severe disability. As I believe the
noble Lord, Lord Collins, acknowledged, a discretionary fund is
available. I do not want to go into individual cases but we are
encouraging this, and the Government have made £350 million
available in discretionary housing payments across the spending period
to help the most vulnerable people through this reform. These will be
distributed at local authorities’
discretion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:55:24"></hs_TimeCode>. If
local authorities are very much on the front line in dealing with these
issues, it is important that they address them and that money is
provided to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:55:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000057">The
noble Baroness, Lady Dean, talked about the cut in the housing budget.
We have increased the supply of affordable housing compared with the
average over the years 2001 to 2009 and 2010. The affordable rent
product allows us to achieve much better value for money and the
average grant is in the region of about £22,000 per unit.
However, I acknowledge the point made by the noble Baroness in her
usual articulate fashion that it is not just a question of stating what
is being built but of ensuring that new houses are built to address
local needs. The Government remain committed to fulfilling our promises
and targets in this
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T12:56:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000058">I
believe that I have covered most of the issues that were raised. The
noble Lord, Lord Collins of Highbury, referred to bed-and-breakfast
accommodation. I acknowledge that some councils are not fulfilling
their pledge on the six-week limit. My honourable friend the housing
Minister has looked at this and the ministerial working group on
homelessness is calling on local housing authorities to deliver on the
10 challenges, which include a commitment not to use B&amp;B
accommodation for families. Recently, Mark Prisk, the Minister
concerned, held a round table with London boroughs with high
homelessness numbers, including families in B&amp;B accommodation, to
address these issues and to share good practice across boroughs, to
which my noble friend Lady Maddock referred.</hs_para>

once again reiterate that the Government remain absolutely committed to
addressing homelessness. We believe that progress is being made in
reducing current homelessness levels across the country. Does more need
to be done? Of course, it does. We need to look at the extended use of
bed-and-breakfast accommodation beyond six weeks and to ensure that
there is greater affordability in the market by increasing the supply
of affordable homes. Through the ministerial working group on
homelessness we are working across government to tackle the complex
drivers of homelessness. Although these remain difficult times for all
of us, we are calling on local authorities to play their part in
tackling this issue. There is no excuse for housing families in
unsuitable accommodation, be that bed-and-breakfast or other unsuitable
accommodation. We continue to work with local authorities,
organisations such as London Councils and the LGA to ensure that good
practice prevails. No council should send tenants en masse to different
parts of the country, so we have changed the law to ensure that local

opposite sides, but to their credit both men have now agreed to attend
the hearings to clear their names. However, it has produced an
extraordinary situation with no coherent way forward at the present
time. Kenyans remember that during the 2008 post-election violence,

elected individuals, and a much expanded lower house, the National
Assembly, comprising 349 MPs, divided into 28 parliamentary

government with 47 counties each with its own governor and supportive

Anderson of Swansea:</Member></B> I am delighted to follow the noble
Lord. He and I share a common love affair with Africa, along with the
noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and I agree with all that he has said in his
analysis. The elections in Kenya were good news, in part for what did
not happen. There was no repetition of the awful events of 2007 and the
tribal massacres and there was an ending of what had been a muddle in
Africa, where Presidents in uniform had often been the order of the
day. That was the case for a number of reasons, including the new
constitution, the new electoral commission, the Supreme Court and, as
some might more cynically say, because two of the opponents at that
time had now become the President and Vice-President. Of course, there
were allegations of vote-rigging, but the President received a majority
on the first round—the turnout in the elections of roughly 80%
puts us to shame in terms of enthusiasm for voting. It was an excellent
example of the loser, having first questioned the results, then
wholeheartedly accepting it as soon as the Supreme Court had given its
ruling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000076">I need
hardly stress the importance of Kenya, as the noble Lord has done, with
its internal growth and the extent of UK interests. Externally, Kenya
has been a force for good in the region. Like the noble Lord, I think
not only about Somalia and Kenya’s assistance against piracy,
including with the courts, but also about Kenya as a key ally against
terrorism in the region—and, of course, as a good Commonwealth
partner.</hs_para>

the noble Lord said; it is the one posed by the International Criminal
Court, especially for us, now that the President and his Vice-President
are both indictees. It is something of an embarrassment for us and for
the international community. Clearly, the indictees have been properly
elected—the first time that that has happened. Do we shun them
or have minimum contact? What consultations have there been with our
European Union partners and with the Commonwealth? Already the
President has been to the Somalia conference in London and I assume
that he will attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Sri
Lanka. The experience of the indicted President al-Bashir in Sudan is
quite different. Here we have a good ally, too big to ignore. Is it
still the case that the proceedings are scheduled to begin in July or,
as some rather hope, is the case collapsing? I suspect that the British
Government would want the whole procedure at the International Criminal
Court to fade far away so that we can forget
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000078">This
raises a general point about the work of the International Criminal
Court. After the series of ad hoc tribunals in the 1980s and 1990s, the
Rome treaty on the International Criminal Court was warmly welcomed at
the time. Yet, of course, there is not universal membership—I
believe that the current membership is about 130 or 140—and
there has been only one conviction in the period since 2002. Equally, a
number of key countries, including the United States and other P5
members, are not members of the International Criminal
Court.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000079">Perhaps
philosophically we have here a clash between justice and politics. Some
will say, “Let justice be done whatever the result”, yet
there is the question of politics. For example, suppose in Syria
President Assad were to say, “Yes, my time is up. I will be
prepared to go into a friendly country in exile, together with members
of my family and entourage, so long as no proceedings are taken against
me”. There would be a great temptation in the international
community to proceed against him because of the very clear massacres
and human rights violations in Syria. However, allowing him to move
into a safe haven could save many thousands of lives. This is part of
the dilemma that the international community would face.</hs_para>

criticisms made at the inauguration of the new President by President
Museveni of neighbouring Uganda. He said—and perhaps we should
not pay too much attention to this—that it is to be noted that
all the indictees thus far have been African. Is there a degree of bias
against Africa in the ICC? Is it right that there has been poor
evidence-gathering on behalf of the ICC—for example, too great a
willingness to collude with Presidents, as it is alleged happened in
the Congo and perhaps with Prime Minister Odinga in Kenya? I think that
that probably is answered by the fact that the indictees
included members of both Mr Odinga’s party and that of President
Kenyatta. At least, those criticisms need to be
examined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000081">What

Earl of Sandwich:</Member></B> My Lords, this is an interesting subject
and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for introducing it. We can
all feel considerable satisfaction with the Kenyan elections. Not only
were they peaceful and the outcome decisive, but the electoral process
was internationally approved as free and fair. This was a great relief
to all who remember the terrible experience at the end of 2007. I was
in Kenya with a CPA delegation shortly after that. Having visited
Kisumu, where many of the killings took place, I can still feel
a chill on hearing first-hand accounts of what had
happened.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000083">We
cannot simply dismiss it as ethnic violence between Luo and Kikuyu, as
we are prone to do when we are talking about Africa. It was on one side
armed gangs, stirred up for political and ethnic reasons, but on the
other it was the police, with a shoot-to-kill mandate, who simply
opened fire. This is still, for Kenyans, a very recent experience.
There are still burnt-out buildings and camps for the displaced, who
still await proper homes.</hs_para>

watched traffic police beating up minor offenders in Nairobi and it is
not a pleasant experience. The police in the latest election also used
excessive force and even live ammunition against some demonstrators in
Nairobi and Kisumu. However, according to the International Crisis
Group, they generally showed much more restraint and efficiency this
time, as in the rapid deployment to put down further violence in
Mombasa.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000085">The
election violence of five years ago is of course the reason for the
uncertainty surrounding the ICC indictment of President Kenyatta, who
is to appear before the court in July. The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey,
and I visited Khartoum a couple of years ago, and we are both well
aware of the irony of the Kenyan position alongside that of President
al-Bashir in Sudan. President al-Bashir has taken little notice of the
ICC and, despite the obvious inconvenience of sanctions, he carries on
normally and goes on unauthorised visits abroad. At the same time, on
the l0th anniversary of Darfur, the Foreign Office happens to have
mentioned in its latest report that there has been progress on human
rights in Sudan, such as the appointment of an independent commission
on human rights, so perhaps good behaviour somehow pays
off.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000086">Long-term
African presidents, even elected ones, seem to think that they have
earned some impunity because of their long service. In passing, I could
also mention the apparent integrity of President Museveni of Uganda,
whom we have all admired. This week, he decided to close down the
highly respected <I>Daily Monitor</I> and two radio stations simply
because they reported disaffection among the generals about his
son’s possible succession in three years’ time. When you
are high and mighty in Africa, you get away with a lot.</hs_para>

ICC does appear to Africans to be biased against African states,
although I know that our Government would deny that. It is a very
contentious issue. The Minister may well say that due process is being
followed and that the ICC has merely taken over from the local
tribunals. The UK was one of the original backers of the ICC in 2002
and has consistently supported it at the Security Council. It is argued
that the extent of violence in Africa justifies a higher level of
international judicial involvement, which can take the weight off the
courts in the countries concerned. In that direction, much is expected
of the ICC’s first African chief prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, a
former justice minister in the
Gambia.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000088">However,
perceptions also matter, and inevitably there is post-colonial
resentment of Britain and other European powers suspected of trying to
influence the political scene in Kenya. There was already some feeling
during the elections that European diplomats were playing a negative
role, although this was denied. People see that, as the noble Lord,
Lord Anderson, said, the ICC has an Achilles heel in that major powers,
including the US, China, Russia, Japan and India, have refused to join
it, so that it therefore has no genuine international
standing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000089">I
enjoyed reading the Commons debate about Kenya on 20 March, in which
Eric Joyce raised the issue of the ICC’s image. He has a lot of
experience of the rough and tumble of life, especially in central
Africa, and he analysed—I thought very fairly—the limited
status of the ICC as a world arbitrator, showing that in practice it
has drawn up indictments only in Africa. Perhaps the Minister could
explain how it is that the ICC suddenly seemed to take over from the
local tribunals in Kenya, of which much was expected after the last
elections. I remember that we debated that. The Mombasa court, of
course, has since rightly earned a reputation for its role in the
EU-backed Operation Atalanta campaign against Somali piracy and for
taking the lion’s share of the prosecutions
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000090">Because
of the high rank of those accused for inciting post-election violence,
political pressure was bound to be brought to bear on the Kenyan
judiciary in the years after 2007. Witnesses are withdrawing or
changing their statements even now for this reason and because of the
time that has since elapsed. I gather that William Ruto’s case
has been deferred, and therefore there is a real risk that the whole
ICC prosecution will be postponed again and, ultimately, cancelled.
This would not reflect well on the new Jubilee Alliance Government, who
have declared themselves anxious to conform to the new constitution and
preserve the independence of the judiciary. Mr Uhuru Kenyatta, as the
son and namesake of the founder of Kenya’s independence
movement, will want to get on with the business of governing and, we
all hope, ridding the country of its worst excesses, many of which lie
within government
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000091">To
begin with, as the International Crisis Group has argued, the new
Government need to show robust commitment to the implementation of the
new constitution, in particular to devolution, land reform, the fight
against corruption, and national reconciliation. Ask anyone involved in
wildlife conservation and tourism in Kenya and Tanzania about
corruption and they will 
<?notus-xml column=74?>say it is their worst enemy because it flouts the law, condones poaching
and enables very senior civil servants to draw salaries without
actually doing
anything.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000092">There
is always a correlation between corruption, violence and poverty,
especially in crowded urban areas such as Kibera. To mitigate this,
DfID Kenya has many innovative projects throughout the country; I will
not list them all. It concentrates on a whole range of issues,
including: improving maternal and reproductive health; increasing
school access and the quality of education; and helping Kenya to
develop green energy and adapt to a changing climate. Good governance
is another priority. Parliamentary exchanges, including training and
shared technology, are carried out very effectively by the CPA and the
Westminster Foundation for Democracy, as I saw for myself in

that the noble Baroness has a human rights brief and is closely
associated with the Government’s campaign to join the
once-despised Human Rights Council, for which I applaud her. As a
younger-generation Minister, she will understand that the UK cannot
condemn human rights abuses without accepting its own historic
responsibilities. I am thinking of the compensation claim of a limited
number of Mau Mau victims of British Army torture following their
successful High Court ruling in October 2012, for which negotiations
are under way. This case sets a precedent and will have significant
repercussions in other Commonwealth

the noble Lords, Lord Chidgey and Lord Anderson, have said, despite
this cloud on the horizon Britain has enjoyed very good relations with
Kenya; for example, inviting the President to the Somalia conference.
The whole east African region has benefited from Kenya’s growing
international trade and the oil boom. Kenya’s success in curbing
the power of al-Shabaab in Somalia has won worldwide admiration. The
training in Kenya of British troops, which was mentioned by the noble
Lord, Lord Chidgey, seems likely to continue. Our FCO and Trade
Ministers have promoted Kenya’s Vision 2030, which involves
leading British investors. All that must be to the good. On these and
many other fronts, Kenya can be proud of its relationship with Britain,

It had taken massive levels of policing to achieve, but it is of the
greatest significance to Kenya and to sub-Saharan Africa as a whole
that the process was vindicated. Mr Kenyatta was sworn in, as noble
Lords know. I rehearse these facts only because the issues which should
now focus our attention have to be understood against that
backdrop.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052252000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000102">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:32:10"></hs_TimeCode>
me there are three sets of issues upon which I would welcome the
Minister’s view. The first is that the new president is
currently charged with crimes against humanity at the International
Criminal Court. He may well be the first person who has been elected as
head of state while facing such charges. Inevitably, these
circumstances produce a real diplomatic difficulty in calibrating our
relationship with Kenya and its new president, a difficulty all too
evident when he recently visited the United Kingdom for the Somalia
conference. That was handled very carefully and sensitively in all the
circumstances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:32:48"></hs_TimeCode> by
the Prime
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The
charges relate to allegations, which he has consistently denied, that
he choreographed inter-communal violence after 
<?notus-xml column=76?>the 2007 presidential election. He has repeatedly said that he would
work with the court to clear his name. Since we are clear that there
should never be impunity, it must follow that the legal process must be
completed satisfactorily to yield a decision in one direction or
another. He appears to share the view that that is what is desirable,
which is in my view to his
credit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000103">Let
me be plain that when I have read criticisms, particularly from
President Museveni of Uganda, that the ICC process constitutes
“blackmail”, to use his word—an unfortunate word
in the circumstances—or demonstrates why Africans should
distrust the ICC generally, I do not accept that view at all. Where it
has acted, as it acted in Africa with Charles Taylor, in events with
which I was directly involved as a Minister, or seeks to act with
respect to the president of Sudan over Darfur, there has always been,
or is currently, a case to answer. These are cases about crimes that
have been committed in Africa. But the proposition is also true for
President Milosevic, and General Mladic in Bosnia. No impunity in my
view means no impunity, and that has been the attitude that, generally
speaking, the ICC has taken, and which I believe that Governments of
all persuasions in this country have systematically
supported<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The
notion that it has been directed specifically at Africa seems to fly in
the face of almost all the recent
evidence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:34:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

saying this about President Kenyatta or what happened in 2007, but I am
encouraged by his willingness to answer the charges and his intention
to clear his name. His intent may also be signalled by some of
the appointments he has made to his Government, because they could
hardly be said to be people who are desirous of avoiding legal
consequences or proper processes. I mention particularly the
appointment of Mrs Amina Mohamed as Secretary for Foreign Affairs. She
is a world class diplomat and has an outstanding legal reputation. Her
work in international organisations has been first class.</hs_para>

Minister may be able to tell us by how much the position has altered
since the election campaign, or if it has altered. During the campaign,
the EU and the United States limited themselves to what they described
as “essential contacts” with ICC indictees, but that, I
suspect, can be only a short-term position. We must balance such a
policy with fostering close ties with Kenya. It is a vital ally in
sub-Saharan Africa and, I think, across Africa more generally, both in
economic terms and in the regional battle with militant Islam. It would
be a mistake to abandon political or trading influence in Africa, and
certainly not in east Africa, to the commercial interests of China or
some of the other major Asian powers. How will the Government strike
this balance and how rapidly will they do so? Does the Minister agree
that the earliest possible attempt to grasp what I think is a new
opening in relations with Kenya would be
prudent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

commentators, including Mr Kenyatta, have suggested that the United
Kingdom interfered in the elections by deploying abnormal numbers of
British soldiers to Kenya both before the polls and since, and have
claimed that our high commissioner, Dr Christian Turner, who I believe
is an excellent diplomat in the FCO, had somehow taken part in what was
described 
<?notus-xml column=77?>as a “rather animated involvement” in Kenya’s
election. Let me be clear: I do not believe the allegations. I know the
people involved and I have thought about it, and I repeat that I do not
believe them. However, it might be as well to put on the public record
through <I>Hansard</I> the statement of the Government that these were
not interventions of that kind, and they should not disturb our
relationship with
Kenya<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T13:37:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

briefly to the Kenyan economy at this new juncture. There are different
assessments of the prospects for the Kenyan economy. I have read papers
by the World Bank, the African Development Bank and the International
Monetary Fund. Many see the prospect of significant developments in
what is a very entrepreneurial economy that involves significant
numbers of the Kenyan people, not least the women who run so many of
the small businesses in Africa generally, and certainly in east Africa.
Equally, if the country were to become more isolated and it was
impossible to create the kind of relationship that I have tried to
describe, it may well be that rather than moving upwards and becoming
more successful, the economy will drop through several layers. In my
view, it is hard to get on to the first rungs of the ladder of economic
development and to take the steps towards prosperity that we all desire
for sub-Saharan Africa. It is very easy to fall off those first rungs
and find yourself back where you started. I would be pleased to hear if
the Minister takes a view on the Kenyan economy and what steps might be
taken by the United Kingdom and, indeed, by the European Union, which
is no small player in this, to ensure that the 44 million people of
Kenya receive their entitlement; that is, to look with optimism to the
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/702C3FA1FA5609EBA273456E36BE366C2B462FB1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

much of what has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Triesman. I also
echo his support both for the ICC and for our general relationship with
Kenya. Our partnership with Kenya is both deep and broad. We enjoy a
shared history that has given us strong personal links. Some 20,000
British nationals live in Kenya and some 200,000 visit Kenya each
year—more than from any other country. The noble Lord, Lord

assure the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that the modern-day relationship
should be, and is, viewed as a partnership. We have a mutual interest
in strong trade, defence and security co-operation. Britain is, for
example, the largest commercial investor in Kenya. Last year,
DfID’s Kenya programme was worth more than £92
million, and this year it is forecast to rise to 
<?notus-xml column=78?>£143 million. The UK trains 10,000 troops in Kenya
each year and we work together closely on regional security issues,
such as Somalia and counterterrorism. We look forward to building on
this substantial shared agenda in our partnership, including on the
economy and in
trade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000113">Kenya’s
general election in March was the most complex in its history, with
voters electing candidates in six separate votes. It was also one of
the most peaceful. We congratulate the Kenyan people on this
achievement, and we congratulate President Kenyatta on his victory.
After the terrible violence of 2007-08, in which more than 1,000 people
were killed, this outcome could not have been taken for granted. It
means that Kenya is now in a position to build on the reforms started
under the previous Government and described in its 2010 constitution.

important role in supporting successful elections. We provided
£16 million in funding to support peaceful and credible

noble Lord, Lord Triesman, referred specifically to the election

production of a more accurate voter register, using separate optical
mark technology and putting in place an independent parallel vote
counting system. This helped to ensure that more than 14 million
Kenyans were registered to vote and therefore had greater confidence in
the vote. I utterly reject any allegations of interference by the UK
Government and the British high commissioner. We have always said that

Anderson, asked broader questions about the ICC, including the question
of bias against Africa. I echo the words of the noble Lord, Lord
Triesman. The ICC is an impartial, professional and independent court.
It is a court of last resort which is complementary to the national
legal system, and it gets involved only when national authorities are
unable or unwilling to prosecute. Kenya and 121 other countries are
state parties to the Rome statute of the court, including half the
countries in Africa. That is a positive sign. There are more parties to
the Rome statute from African states than from any other
region.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052252000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000120">The
noble Lord, Lord Anderson, also mentioned the criticism of the ICC by
the Ugandan President. Of course, the ICC is a young institution and
has a long road ahead. It is the first organisation of its kind; it
breaks new ground with every case and ruling, and is required to cover
most of the globe, often while conflict is still occurring. It is only
10 years old and criticism is therefore inevitable. But I know from my
own dealings with, and policy responsibility for, the ICC, it is a
system that we must continue to support. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich,
asked how the ICC came to take on the Kenya cases. Initially we
encouraged a local process but it was the Kenyan Parliament’s
decision not to establish a special tribunal that led to the ICC taking
on the
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000121">Returning
to Kenya’s broader relationships in the region, we are pleased
that President Kenyatta was able to attend the Somalia conference.
Kenya is one of Somalia’s most important partners and has a
vital role to play in bringing stability to Somalia. It has nearly
5,000 troops in Somalia and is actively engaged in discussions on local
administration arrangements. It is also host to more than 500,000
Somali refugees, more than any other nation. It was therefore important
that Kenya was represented at the conference at the highest

right honourable friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary

are grateful to Kenya for providing protection and assistance to
refugees from Somalia and will continue to support it in shouldering
that burden. But the Somalia conference also recognised the importance
of scaling up efforts to create the security, political and

sustainable return of refugees viable. We also endorsed the tripartite
dialogue initiated by the Somali and Kenyan Governments alongside the
UN High Commissioner for Refugees, which we hope will lead to a

UK-Kenya co-operation in the region concerns piracy, which again is
linked to Somalia. Encouraging progress has been made: 12 May was the
anniversary of the last successful hijacking by pirates off the coast
of Somalia. Pirate attacks in the waters off Somalia have fallen. Kenya
is on the front line in responding to this reprehensible practice. It
currently holds 130 suspected or convicted pirates in its prisons and
has previously accepted the transfer of 14 suspected pirates from UK
vessels for prosecution. However, it is important that we continue to
co-operate closely to sustain this progress. We are in discussions with
the Kenyan Government to renegotiate a memorandum of understanding that
would facilitate the future transfer of additional pirate suspects to
be brought to justice in the Kenyan
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000125">Kenya
plays an important role in other regional issues, such as Sudan. Kenya

is also a regional economic hub, with the biggest economy in the
region. The IMF estimates that GDP growth will be 5.8% this year. Other
East African Community countries rely on its infrastructure, as we saw
at the end of the previous decade, when the crisis in Kenya resulted in
a quadrupling of oil prices in Uganda. Through TradeMark East Africa,
the UK is supporting regional trade and infrastructure integration. The
programme aims to see a 15% reduction in transport time, above-trend
increases in intraregional trade and exports, and a 60% reduction in
non-tariff
barriers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000127">Supporting
regional integration and better infrastructure is also good for UK
business. Britain remains the largest cumulative investor in Kenya and
bilateral trade amounts to £1 billion each year. UK firms are
leading the way in helping Kenya to develop its resources in the energy
sector. These efforts are supported by the Foreign and Commonwealth
Office and UKTI. My honourable friend the Minister for Africa is
leading a high-value opportunity programme that highlights
opportunities for British businesses in the oil and gas sector in east
Africa and helps them to access these markets.</hs_para>

Internal Security in Kenya in October last year. Officials in Kenya
have raised it with the Police Inspector

Policing Oversight Authority currently reviewing the police
investigation has not offered an assessment of progress to date, or
given us an indication of when the investigation will be completed. We
continue to urge the Kenyan authorities to conduct a thorough and
urgent review of the case and to keep the Monson family informed of
developments. I am sure that this is not the best news that the family
would like to hear, but I can assure them, through the noble Lord, that
we are doing all we can. The prospects of a public inquest into this
case are unclear, at least while the investigation remains ongoing, but
we are committed to supporting the noble Lord, Lord Monson, in his

We understand the pain and grievance felt by those on all sides who
were involved in this divisive and bloody event of the emergency period

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, there are good reasons why the
international community needs to pay attention to the upsurge of
religious violence and hatred in 
<?notus-xml column=82?>Pakistan over recent years, and indeed to the
related political violence during the recent elections in which more
than 100 people were killed. Pakistan is due to be the largest
recipient of UK aid in the world when it gets £446 million in
2014-15. It also receives billions of dollars from the United States in
both economic and military aid in the effort to shore up the
country’s stability. However, since 2001, an estimated 30,000
civilians have been killed in religious and political assassinations
and massacres—all that aid money has not reduced the level of
violence in Pakistan. There was a temporary lull during Pervez
Musharraf’s presidency between 1999 and 2007, but over the past
few years there has been a further
deterioration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000132">At
the same time, the stability of Pakistan has become vital to the peace
of the region, with the withdrawal of allied forces from Afghanistan.
The new Prime Minister, Nawaz Sharif, has said that he will help the
process by allowing NATO to use Pakistan’s roads for the transit
of troops and equipment, but large convoys of US or UK forces on their
way home will make a tempting target for the local Taliban and its
associates. The presence of well organised and well armed groups of
terrorists in Pakistan also poses a threat to neighbouring states, as
we saw from the Mumbai atrocity in
2008.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000133">Last
Wednesday, my noble friend Lord Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon
perceptively suggested that Russia’s support for Assad was not a
matter of looking after its only remaining supporter in the Middle East
but a consequence of its experience in Dagestan and other Muslim
republics where there was a war between Sunnis and Shias. My noble
friend Lord King of Bridgwater also referred to the Shia-Sunni
conflict, and he coupled this with the spread of jihadism and
fundamentalism. In Syria and Iraq, there are interreligious civil
wars.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000134">The
agenda of Sunni extremists such as al-Qaeda and its imitators across
the Islamic world is to eliminate the Shia and other varieties of
Islam, as well as the Kaffirs or unbelievers, from the face of the
earth. Their ultimate goal is a universal caliphate based on what they
imagine were the principles of governance under the four
“rightly guided caliphs” who followed the Prophet in the
seventh century. In Pakistan, one active and ruthless group of
terrorists belonging to this loose coalition is the Lashkar-e-Jhangvi.
This outfit tried to kill Nawaz Sharif when he was Prime Minister in
1999, and the suicide bomber who killed Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto
and 26 others in 2007 was probably a member of the organisation. It
claimed responsibility for the murder of four American oil workers in
1997 and for the bombing of the Protestant International Church in
Islamabad in March 2002. But its main target has always been the Shia,
as it brazenly acknowledges when it takes credit for the atrocities
that it commits. The group says that the Shia are infidels, that they
should be labelled as non-Muslims under the law, and that they are
“wajib-ul-qatl”, an Urdu expression meaning
“worthy to be
killed”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000135">A
semi-legal organisation with the same ideology of hatred is the Ahle
Sunnat Wal Jamaat, which took over from a banned organisation called
Sipah-e-Sahaba. The ASWJ fielded 130 candidates in the recent Pakistani
elections, generally under the banners of the PML-N 
<?notus-xml column=83?>and an alliance of five Sunni religious parties generally known as the
MDN. Under one of these labels, a man who had spent five years in
prison for murdering six people in 1998 was elected to a seat in
Punjab, and other terrorists may well now also be MPs. The Election
Commission of Pakistan directed that in 55 constituencies, listed
sectarian terrorists should be disqualified from standing, but it
turned out that this was not within the powers conferred on returning
officers by the ECP itself.</hs_para>

recite the whole appalling history of the crimes perpetrated by these
terrorists because it would take all day, but a couple of examples
illustrate their mode of operations. On 3 April 2012, six buses were
stopped in Chilas in the northern territories en route to Gilgit,
Baltistan. The male passengers were taken off the buses and their
identity cards examined for Shia names. At least 25 were shot dead on
the spot. No official report has been published on this massacre and,
although I understand that four or five people were arrested, no trials
have taken
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000137">In
January, twin bomb blasts in the busy market area at Alamdar Road,
Quetta, killed at least 108 people and injured 120. A LeJ
spokesman telephoned the media to say that it had committed this
outrage and threatened that no Shia would be allowed to leave
Balochistan alive. In February, a bomb contained in a water tanker
exploded in Hazara Town, Quetta, killing at least 92 people and
injuring more than 200. The police arrested 170 suspects, but there has
been no news of trials, let alone convictions. In March, a bomb in the
Shia area of Abbas Town in Karachi killed 45 people and wounded
150. These atrocities and the targeted assassinations of Shia
intellectuals are part of a concerted attempt to wipe out the entire
Shia population of Pakistan. That is genocide, as defined in Article 2
of the UN Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of
Genocide.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000138">I
have been sent hundreds of eyewitness statements and other reports from
Shia organisations throughout Pakistan on these events, and have
forwarded them to the UN Special Rapporteurs on Religious Freedom and
on Extrajudicial Executions. I know that the Government do not
intervene in the choice of subjects the special procedures take up, but
as this is obviously one that would demand resources well beyond those
available to the special rapporteurs, I would be grateful if we might
consider making a one-off contribution to the Human Rights Commission,

pursued.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000139">The
special procedures should also take action on the relentless
persecution of the Ahmadi Muslims, in spite of the enormous
contribution they have made to the development of Pakistan; for
example, in the persons of Sir Zafarullah Khan, the first Foreign
Minister of Pakistan, and Dr Abdus Salam, Pakistan’s only Nobel
Prize-winner. The most heinous atrocity against this community was in
May 2010, when simultaneous terrorist attacks on its two principal
mosques in Lahore during Friday prayers killed 94 people and
injured more than 120. The Ahmadis have been declared non-Muslims, are
victims of relentless persecution under the blasphemy laws, are denied
voting rights and are in practice denied access to the higher ranks of
all the professions.</hs_para>

with the Shia, the Ahmadis are victims of targeted assassinations,
encouraged by another extremist organisation, the Khatme Nabuwwat,
which is free to spread its messages of hatred and violence. In
2012, 20 Ahmadis were killed, and the leader of the community
in Rabwah, the centre of the community, was tortured to death by the
police. Ahmadi places of worship were demolished, mostly in Punjab, and
the police themselves demolished graves in Faisalabad and Mangat Uncha.
A dozen armed men vandalised 120 gravestones in Model Town, Lahore.
Dozens of Ahmadis were arbitrarily arrested, and Ahmadi publications
were summarily banned. The<I> Friday Times</I> said that the fetters
imposed on the Ahmadi community were reminiscent of the restrictions
imposed on the Jews by Nazi Germany in
1935.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000141">I return
to the ideology which threatens the survival of religious minorities
and poses an even wider menace to the safety and stability of Pakistan
itself, being promoted as it is in mosques and madrassahs financed by
Saudi money to the tune of an estimated $100 million a year.
It is intolerant and exclusivist, maintaining that all who do not
subscribe to the Salafist version of Islam are infidels belonging to
the Dar al-Harb, the realm of the unbeliever. In the extreme forms it
takes in Pakistan, it promotes sectarian and religious hatred and
teaches that killing unbelievers is approved by God. We need a
worldwide strategy to combat this monstrous ideology. I believe that
such is the magnitude of the danger it presents to world peace, only
the United Nations Security Council has the authority and
resources to grapple with it. I hope that the Government will consider
how best to raise it at that
level.6</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/9870689B78226685D15C9F67C0D5DC5393DD6162" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Lord Avebury, for bringing this topic to our attention. He described
the problem, and I do not need to add very much. I shall concentrate on
the why of this problem and on what we can do about it as an interested
party.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000143">A
persistent problem since the foundation of Pakistan is its duality.
Although Muhammad Jinnah supported a Muslim nation in pre-independence
India, he was not an Islamist or a very religious person. He wanted a
western, liberal regime for the large Muslim population in the
subcontinent. As it happened, the majority of Muslims lived in
Hindu-majority areas, and Muslims in Muslim-majority areas were a
minority of Muslims. Pakistan was established, but soon after its
establishment, Jinnah and Liaquat Ali Khan died, so there has been an
identity problem. Is Pakistan a western, liberal-type democratic regime
or a state founded upon the Islamic faith that should put forward
Islamic policies? Along the way, especially after the departure of East
Pakistan—Bangladesh—a persistent problem has been the
tendency to emphasise Islamic anger, most particularly by military
dictators who have no democratic legitimacy. Zia-ul-Haq played the
Islamic card and was encouraged to do so because at that time the
Americans were interested in getting the Russians out of Afghanistan,
so they aided Zia-ul-Haq in his programmes.</hs_para>

the emphasis on orthodoxy and Islamism has been engendered by
international forces, but there is a problem that even in establishing 
<?notus-xml column=85?>an Islamic nation, sectarian violence within Islam is the most serious
problem of Pakistan. As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, has already
pointed out, it is a Sunni/Shia, Sunni/Ahmadi battle. There is also a
battle against Christians. There has been violence against the
non-Muslim minority in Pakistan, which was 10% at the time of
independence, but has now dwindled to about 2% or 2.5%.</hs_para>

and tackle this religious violence? As the noble Lord pointed out, you
have to see Pakistan not as a part of south Asia but as the eastern
limit of western Asia. The tensions in Iraq, Syria, Egypt and Iran
between Sunnis and Shias—Iraq is the battleground of Sunnis and
Shias—are now happening in Pakistan. One thing we ought to be
able to do is to contribute to a real understanding of why it has
happened. In UK universities, government, NGOs and embassies, we have
expertise; we ought to understand why the problem persists. How much of
this problem is religious and how much economic and social? Are there
economic and social roots to this battle between Shias and Sunnis? In
India, for instance, some of the so-called communal riots have economic
and social roots. They may be jockeying for land, jobs or economic
resources.</hs_para>

think that going to the UN Security Council, as the noble Lord, Lord
Avebury, suggested, would be a drastic step and I do not know if the

Alton of Liverpool:</Member></B> My Lords, the combination of
inadequate religious freedom protections and an entrenched climate of
impunity has strengthened the position of the more violent groups in
Pakistani society, described by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, which
have long been allowed to promote their own interpretation of Islam,
narrowing the space for difference. What begins as an anti-minority
sentiment can later divide the majority.</hs_para>

Avebury and Lord Desai, rightly referenced the alarming growth of
anti-Shia violence in Pakistan. In 2012, at least 325 members of the
Shia Muslim population were killed in targeted attacks. In this
context, counterextremism discussions with Pakistan are clearly
incomplete without measures intended to bolster the protection and
promotion of religious freedom or belief. Pursuant to the Written 
<?notus-xml column=86?>Answer that the Minister gave me on 17 May, I would be keen to know when
we will raise these questions with the new
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000151">Pakistan’s
blasphemy laws and anti-Ahmadi provisions remain key concerns. The
blasphemy laws lack any definition of terms and ignore the question of
intent. False accusations can be easily registered, as evidential
requirements are inadequate. Dozens were charged in 2012 and at least
16 people remain on death row for blasphemy, while another 20 have been
given life sentences. In 2010, Asia Bibi, a Christian from Punjab
province, became the first woman in Pakistan’s history to be
sentenced to death for blasphemy, and continues to languish in prison.
Can the Minister tell us when we last raised her case with the
authorities in Pakistan? The resolution of last year’s case
against the Christian teenager Rimsha Masih was cited by Pakistan as an
illustration that the situation is improving, but the subsequent
blasphemy-related attacks on hundreds of Christian homes in Badami Bagh
in Lahore in March this year suggests otherwise.</hs_para>

problematic for all vulnerable communities in Pakistan, including
minorities. Perpetrators are rarely brought to justice, which means
that minorities are often viewed as easy targets. Ahmadis, Christians,
Hindus, Shias, Sufis and Sikhs have all been badly affected, with Shia
communities suffering by far the most casualties. Hate speech and the
propagation of inflammatory messages is a standard precursor to
religiously motivated violence, but it is rarely punished in Pakistan,
despite the fact that relevant legislation already exists. Even
government officials inciting violence have not been held accountable
for their actions.</hs_para>

perpetrators of previous mob incidents—Gojra in 2009, Sangla
Hill in 2005, Shanti Nagar in 1997—had been adequately dealt
with. Official investigation reports exist for at least the
high-profile cases. Will the Minister be pressing the incoming
Government to make these public, or indeed to shed light on the murder
of the federal Minister, Shahbaz Bhatti, whose killers have never been

Soley:</Member></B> I agree with a great deal of what has been said. I
commend the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, on the way he spoke and his well
known commitment to freedom and religious tolerance. Let us deal with
the political point first. I think that we all accept that Pakistan
came very near to being a failed state with nuclear weapons. As the
noble Lord, Lord Desai, hinted, there are indications of a movement
away from that towards being a more stable state. We must do all that
we can to encourage that, and I know that the Government, as did the
previous
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:22:14"></hs_TimeCode>, are
doing all that they can to help development and structure the rule of
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:22:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000160">The
problem then becomes the issue of religion. We need to discuss that
more openly, and I commend the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, for the way
in which she has raised this issue in public. At times, we tip-toe
around it, for understandable and good reasons, because we are afraid
of making a difficult situation worse or because we do not have the
necessary depth of understanding and are afraid about making statements
that might be
misunderstood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:22:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
Yesterday we saw an example in Iran, where a religious leader decided
to exclude certain people from standing in the forthcoming elections.
That is based on the assumption that the state is run on a religious
guidance principle and that there is not a political judgment below
that. I take the view that religions—not just Islam, but most
religions—are a form of ideology. The problem then becomes how
far you pursue that in a very heavy ideological way 
<?notus-xml column=88?>and how tolerant you can be of minorities. The noble Lord, Lord
Alton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:23:26"></hs_TimeCode>, has
indicated a number of ways. When it becomes very authoritarian,
religious minorities of any type are

follow what the noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, said in response on the
Statement on Syria on Monday on the Floor of the House. I asked how we
dealt with the struggle between Sunni and Shia, and she indicated that
in her background that difference between them was not a problem some
20 years ago. I agree with that; I knew of the differences, but I was
not aware of any problem. I have certainly become aware of them
strongly in recent years. What troubles me—and I had difficulty

believe strongly in the rule of law and democratic principles, so I do

the fastest growing religions in the United Kingdom. That might give us
some influence. Perhaps what I was heading towards on Monday last with
my question about Syria to the Minister is this: could we not play a
role in what is almost a civil war within Islam in setting up
discussions between the competing factions in a safe situation; that
is, in Britain? That is because, frankly, they cannot do that in
Pakistan. If you tried to arrange meetings between the Sunnis and the
Shias in Pakistan in its current state, or indeed in Iraq or Syria,
everyone would be in acute danger. We have seen that in the
assassinations, bomb attacks and so on. There is a case for looking to
see whether we can help, and that requires using the established
leaders of Islam within the UK who recognise that there is a struggle
for the heart and soul of Islam. It is a great religion. Although I do
not like religions of any type—I am not religious and never have

Hussain:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend Lord
Avebury for securing this debate. Over the past couple of decades,
reports of religious and ethnic intolerance in Pakistan have hit the
headlines in the world’s media many times. Pakistan’s
current scenario provides many examples of the increasingly intolerant
behaviour of its society, including the tragic murders of Salmaan
Taseer, the governor of Punjab, and of Federal Minister Shahbaz Bhatti,
and the burning of properties belonging to religious minorities in
Shanti Nagar, Bhamiwala and Gojra. In the city of Quetta during January
and February this year alone, nearly 200 Shias of the Hazara ethnic
group were killed in two separate bomb attacks, while in March in
Karachi, some 50 Shias were killed in a truck bombing that caused
extensive damage in the Shia neighbourhood. Ahmadi, Christian and Hindu
communities are continuously being reported as the victims of sectarian
violence in many parts of Pakistan.</hs_para>

workers have been targeted across the country, often by criminal gangs
and sectarian groups that are hostile to their work. The death
on 13 March 2013 of Parveen Rehman, a leading NGO activist in
Karachi and the director of the Orangi Pilot Project, one of the
largest housing and drainage projects in slum areas in all of Asia,
caused outrage in Pakistan and around the world. Her killing showed how
powerful the land-grabbing mafia, whose abuses she brought to light,
have become and the impunity they enjoy. Her tragic death followed the
killing of some 16 aid workers in separate incidents during December
and January.</hs_para>

this surge in religious tension to Pakistan’s blasphemy law,
which prohibits blasphemy against any recognised religion, providing
penalties ranging from a fine to death. However, I am not aware 
<?notus-xml column=90?>of any executions having been undertaken under the
blasphemy law so far. It has to be said that, from the date of its
inception, Pakistan was a moderate, liberal and tolerant Islamic
country. Very few cases of intolerance were reported during the best
part of the first 35 years of its
life.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/8F21CE1C26DB506CCD7804DAD485B366B1BB2336" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

view, biggest reason for the drastic change is the direct result of the
western countries’ response, led by the United States, to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. Pakistan was asked to play a
front-line state role by allowing its soil to be used to harbour, train
and launch mujaheddin to fight the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. After
the Soviet withdrawal, the western allies walked away from the scene
and left Pakistan with tens of thousands of armed mujaheddin, hundreds
of madrassahs and millions of Afghan refugees to deal with. Those
mujaheddin became Taliban and turned on Pakistan in their witch-hunt
for what they perceived to be anti-Islamic forces. With their misguided
and narrow interpretation of Islam—often described as Salafi or
Wahabi ideology—they targeted non-Muslim communities as well as
various Muslim sects that disagreed with their interpretation. Their
actions included bomb attacks, shooting, suicide attacks, arson and
kidnapping. Rival factions responded in the same manner, making the law
and order situation even
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000171">The

had to use its armed forces to clear the Swat Valley and many other

many people’s view, different criminal gangs use these
situations to their own advantage. For example, human traffickers would
help to spread fear and insecurity successfully in the victim
communities and offer advice—which is often very
costly—to flee the country and obtain asylum. This advice is
quite popular in some parts of Pakistan. In my own experience,
religious violence in areas of Azad Jammu and Kashmir is almost
non-existent, yet in the past few years thousands of people from these

other country that has been fighting the war on terror. People have
been killed in mosques, houses, businesses, bazaars and offices; even
Pakistan’s intelligence service headquarters in Lahore,
Peshawar, Quetta and Karachi have been attacked. I say this because I

last year 1,450 deaths were recorded, and there were targeted killings
in Mardan, Kohistan, Mansehra, Gilgit and Karachi—and the list
goes on. Even though under Pakistan’s constitution there is
complete equality for every citizen, we know that in this part of the
world religious extremists, whether the BJP in India or the Islamists
in Pakistan, use religion for political power. Even Sunni tribes have
been driven out of the villages of Beshara and Bohra. There is
lawlessness in Baluchistan, whether by nationalists or the
al-Qaeda-linked and banned organisation Lashkar-e Jhangvi, and there
are attacks on the Hazara community. The worst thing is not the
appalling terrorist attacks that take place but the fact the Government
were silent and did nothing, until the coffins of victims were left on

about the allegations made in London about a political mafia. We know

an e-mail from an association of journalists in Pakistan stating that
journalists’ families have been threatened. In his address,
which was televised on 11, 13 and 15 May, Mr Hussain made
direct threats against people who were protesting at the Three Swords
roundabout. People have drawn my attention to the offences committed
under Sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Serious Crime Act and inciting
terrorism overseas. The British high commissioner in Islamabad and the
British Government have been approached in relation to that. Will the

I turn to what is needed in Pakistan. Strengthening the criminal law
against terrorism is very important. People who were arrested for
attacking the GHQ are now out. Every speaker has mentioned people not
being prosecuted, but that is because they have been able to run free
as the laws are not tight enough. Pakistan needs help, and I ask the

tightening up criminal and terrorism laws.</hs_para>

appointed on merit, although in Karachi the MQM has been insisting on
police officers belonging to its group. No wonder there are so many
problems. The rest of Pakistan is the same; it is not only happening in
Karachi. As I said, such appointments must be based on merit, witnesses
must receive protection and be free of intimidation, and there must be
protection for officers and judges. There must be engagement with
political forces which are disenfranchised and want to be part of the
mainstream politics. There also has to be targeted action against
al-Qaeda-linked organisations, whoever they are; they cannot hide
behind political parties. We have to encourage this.</hs_para>

Triesman:</Member></B> My Lords, I join in thanking the noble Lord,
Lord Avebury. As I suspect is the case for other noble Lords, the
preparation for this debate has made some pretty depressing reading. I
have looked at the Questions from Richard Burden MP and Angus Robertson
MP, as well as the very many Questions from the noble Lord, Lord Alton,
which have raised the issue of a whole sequence of really appalling
circumstances. Questions have been robustly replied to by Mr Burt in
the other place. Having read the replies, I think that the noble Lord,
Lord Alton, has every right to be proud of his determination to test
the Government on these and other issues, but he is perhaps also
entitled to feel a little frustrated when the responses are that we are
engaged in close monitoring and raising the issues. Perhaps that is all
that one can reasonably say we are in a position to do, but I think we
should explore some other options.</hs_para>

parliamentary discussion, there has been a great deal of other
discouraging and dispiriting coverage. Hindus and Christians say that
they are living in hell. Their accounts say that they will try any
means to get their families out of the country. Other newspaper
accounts—not always with the detail that might be most
useful—describe the violent persecution of Shias by Sunnis, who,
as the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, regard some or perhaps all of
the Shia population as heretical, and in some instances not Muslims at
all. There is systematic suppression, targeted killings and endemic
discrimination. Just a few moments ago, the noble Lord, Lord Hussain,
added to the depressing story and, quite rightly, reminded us of the
history of the way in which the western powers dealt with the Soviet
invasion of Afghanistan and its consequences. I thank him for that
insight<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:43:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with one or two basic points. First, these terrible events and
persecutions are taking place in a nation which has itself become the
subject of more terrorist violence than almost anywhere else on the
planet.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>,
despite the threat of international terrorism, there seems on occasion
to be some ambivalence in Pakistan about how to deal with it. That is
illustrated by the relative ease with which Osama bin Laden could live
in Abbottabad without anybody trying to remove him from Pakistani
territory. As has been said in this debate, there seems on occasion to
be a lack of response to extremist violence. There has been little
discussion of nuclear proliferation issues, and the threats seem, as a
number of noble Lords have said, to mean that we have to focus still
more intently on Pakistan and recognise that the strategic content of
what is taking place is fundamental to us as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:44:08"></hs_TimeCode>. Thirdly,
it is important for America to engage and to resist calls to sever
links—something that one hears around the international circuit.
I should be grateful if the Minister could set out the extent of our
co-ordination with the United States on this question.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052252000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000186">I ask these questions
and make these points because, with the sixth largest population and
the sixth largest military in the world, and with a nuclear arsenal,
the country is—to borrow a concept from the world of
finance—too big to fail. My noble friend Lord Soley was right to
point out that there is a risk of it becoming a failed state. It is
also too mission-critical for us in relation to Afghanistan and the
withdrawal from that country. Other noble Lords have covered that
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:44:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Desai asked why Pakistan is in its current position and made the point
that the transition to democratic government is at least a positive
sign. What are the sources of our influence? I accept that they are
limited and they certainly require us to understand with greater
sympathy what might be possible. For a start, nearly 1 million citizens
of this country have direct ties to Pakistan. I wonder whether we have
tried to encourage the discussion that could be held here among that
very significant number of well meaning and honourable people, as my
noble friend Lord Soley
suggested<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>. As
the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, said, aside from our becoming
Pakistan’s largest aid donor, we are its second biggest investor
and fourth biggest trading partner. What leverage does this kind of
economic engagement offer us? Might it be in any respect a vehicle for
knowledge transfer and economic stimulus? 
<?notus-xml column=94?>Unless religious zealots try to prevent the modernisation of the

respect of religious freedoms, which are at the centre of this debate,
and the active engagement with women’s rights that we wish to
see, I wonder whether in the Commonwealth the Harare principles could
be extended, better codified and urged on all Commonwealth members.
This is one of the occasions when people talk in an interfaith sense of
the need to win hearts and minds. That need certainly exists, but I
confess that when I hear those words, I fear that they are a formula to
avoid dealing with something that is rather more profound and
difficult<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T14:46:54"></hs_TimeCode>. When
we call for gradual influence from the Commonwealth or comment on the
impact of the diaspora here, it should not come to mean doing very
little else.</hs_para>

share the view that has been expressed, not least by the noble Lord,
Lord Avebury, that some of the persecutions that have been described
are crimes of concern to humanity. I choose the word carefully and do
not seek to be offensive, but they are crimes, and they would be in any
part of the international community. Persuasion is, of course, very
important and reshaping attitudes is vital but the buck must stop
somewhere in all this. We need to explore urgently the role of the
international community, perhaps through the United Nations in the
discussions it has about the responsibility to protect, or, indeed, in
the need to look further east to other Asian communities to begin to
build a regional dynamic which is also economically sustainable. As I
say, these are things that need to be explored with some urgency.
Pakistan is too big to fail and I am afraid that some crimes are too
big to fail to act upon.</hs_para>

Senior Minister of State, Department for Communities and Local
Government &amp; Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Baroness
Warsi):</Member></B> My Lords, I start by thanking my
noble friend Lord Avebury for allowing us the opportunity to discuss
this important and, indeed, timely matter. As I listened to so much
expertise around this Chamber on religion, Pakistan, human rights and
minorities, I began to think that my record of finishing within the
allotted time, in which I take pride, might well be broken today.
However, I will try not to go beyond my time. As the Minister with
responsibility for both Pakistan and human rights policy, I am
increasingly concerned about the levels of interreligious and
intrareligious violence in Pakistan, as are all noble Lords present.
Pakistan remains a country of concern in the annual FCO report on human
rights and democracy, with the treatment of minorities representing one
of the several acute human rights challenges that the country faces.
Noble Lords will be aware that this and the intertwined issue of
freedom of religion or belief have long been personal priorities for
me, and I shall continue to use every opportunity I have to address
them.</hs_para>

very interesting thoughts were raised by my noble friend Lord Hussain
in relation to intrareligious tensions. I am thankful for his expertise
and what he brought to the debate today. The noble Lord, Lord Desai,
again raised the issue of the interpretation of 
<?notus-xml column=95?>faiths, while the noble Lord, Lord Soley, asked whether we could have
some of these more difficult debates on UK soil if the opportunity
presents
itself.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/0C4D09566F767AAF8F2CA3443842F752817D65D4" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

expertise on religion and in understanding these very difficult
intrareligious disputes. To repeat what I said in the House the other
day, 25 years ago when I was growing up, being from a mixed
Sunni-Shia background was not discussed or seen as being unusual. The
good that has come out of the intrareligious harmony in this country is
that this debate is not live in the United Kingdom. Many of the
national bodies that speak on issues affecting British Muslim
communities are represented by both Shias and Sunnis—long may
that
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000193" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000193">Returning
to the concerns raised in the <I>Human Rights </I><I>and</I><I>
Democracy </I>report, the promotion and protection of the right to
freedom of religion or belief is one of the Government’s key
human rights priorities; there is also the UN Declaration on the
Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on
Religion or Belief. Violence and persecution such as we have seen in
Pakistan and in other countries across the world are the ultimate
manifestation of intolerance and discrimination. We regularly see that
where minorities are being attacked, other fundamental freedoms are
also under
threat.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000194">I am
committed to international action to address these issues. I spoke
about this at the UN General Assembly last year. In January this year,
I hosted an international ministerial conference in London on the
freedom of religion or belief, where I felt it was important to build
political consensus on the red lines around tolerance and the basic
practice that we could expect each state to implement. Those
discussions are continuing and are starting to solidify international
consensus around the need to do more to combat religious intolerance
and promote the right to freedom of religion or belief. Pakistan is
engaging internationally on these issues both through that
process—the adviser to the President on religious affairs was
present—as well through the OIC-led Istanbul process, the UN
Human Rights Council, the UN General Assembly and our bilateral
discussions.</hs_para>

Avebury asked whether we need to raise this at the United Nations. I
know that the Secretary-General has taken note of the extremist attacks
in Pakistan. He has been very vocal in condemning them. We continue to
discuss these matters at multilateral UN level and, of course, at
bilateral
level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000196">We
value our partnership with Pakistan, with its many distinctive
characteristics, including the close personal connections between our
citizens. There are more than 1 million journeys between the two
countries every year. Britain is committed to an enduring relationship
with Pakistan built on mutual trust and respect and on our many shared
interests. As David Cameron said on his first visit to Pakistan as
Prime Minister, there is the opportunity for “naya
aghraz”—a fresh start. We are an unswerving supporter of
Pakistan’s development and its democratic future. It is a broad
relationship. Yes, it is based on security and terrorism, the economy
and trade, but it is also based on culture, community and—dare I
say?—cricket. Our understanding 
<?notus-xml column=96?>is nuanced and measured and the relationship is stronger than ever
before. The noble Lord, Lord Triesman, asked what leverage we have. I
would say that all of the above are opportunities for us to leverage
and make that relationship respond
better.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000197">I take
this opportunity to applaud the recent elections in Pakistan. The
elections on 11 May were a crucial milestone in Pakistan’s
democratic history. It is the first time that power has transferred
democratically between one civilian Government and another after a full
term. I welcome the strengthening and laying down of deep roots of
democracy in Pakistan. These elections were among the most credible in
Pakistan’s history. There was an improved electoral register and
the highest ever number of female and new voters. To protect that
credibility, we hope that all allegations of malpractice will be
thoroughly investigated.</hs_para>

elections have strengthened democracy and the voice of the Pakistani
people. They have given the incoming national and provincial
Governments a clear mandate to meet the very significant challenges
that Pakistan confronts, which we would like to help Pakistan in
meeting. The new Government, whatever their make-up, will face some
real challenges in their first 100 days, including a very difficult
economic situation and critical energy shortfalls. We encourage all
political parties to work together to use the start of the new
parliamentary term to tackle the country’s problems.</hs_para>

working closely with Pakistan on these challenges. Where appropriate,
we can share our experience of the need for tough decisions to deliver
future growth and prosperity. Our friendship and close ties mean that
we feel Pakistan’s losses deeply. As was said by many noble
Lords today, Pakistan has lost a shocking 40,000 civilians in the
battle against terrorism and extremism. We feel the sacrifices that
Pakistan has made, and we feel for the people who continue to make
those sacrifices, specifically the minorities that suffer violence and
discrimination. I have seen at first hand the positive impact of
Pakistan’s minority communities on society. The focus of my
visit to Pakistan in January last year was to meet and show solidarity
with the Christian community in Karachi. I was able to meet the
Archbishop of Karachi and see the inspirational work of Sister John
Berchmans Conway, a nun from Ireland who has lived in Karachi for most
of her life educating the next generation of young girls in Pakistan.
She recalled fondly her memories of teaching the late Benazir Bhutto. I
am delighted that she has been awarded a civil order by the Pakistan
state for her contribution; it is well deserved.</hs_para>

shocking incident of religious violence, rioters targeted a poor
Christian community in the Joseph Colony neighbourhood of Lahore,
damaging property and forcing people out of their homes. At the time, I
discussed the attacks in detail with Paul Bhatti, who was then
Pakistan’s Minister for National Harmony and Minority Affairs
and is, of course, the brother of the tragically assassinated Shahbaz
Bhatti. I expressed my sympathy and pledged our ongoing support in
tackling sectarianism and religious persecution. Those riots were
sparked by an allegation of blasphemy against one member of the
Christian community. 
<?notus-xml column=97?>The blasphemy laws remain a highly sensitive subject in
Pakistan. Indeed, some of those who have called for its reform have
been tragically targeted by extremists, as my noble friend Lord Hussain
mentioned in his speech</hs_para>

laws are frequently misused against both non-Muslims and Muslims, a
point that I continue to stress. I will make sure that we continue to
raise the issue and that we carry on working closely with civil society
in Pakistan and with groups in the UK to encourage interfaith dialogue.
This is a sensitive issue, but that will never deter us from raising
it. We will continue to do so at every opportunity.</hs_para>

sharing dinner with Shahbaz Bhatti only weeks before his assassination.
We talked about the work that we were going to do together, and I am
pleased that, despite that tragedy, his brother Paul Bhatti, who has
been in government, will continue to work with me. However, it is only
right that those who assassinated Shahbaz Bhatti are brought to
justice, and we will continue to raise the issue at every
opportunity.</hs_para>

is not alone in being targeted. I am increasingly concerned about
attacks on Shia Muslims, in particular, those of the Hazara community.
I was saddened by the bombings in Quetta and Karachi earlier this year
which killed many innocent members of the Hazara community. Such acts
of sectarian violence demonstrate an appalling contempt for religion
and for human life. However, this year is not a one-off and, as Human
Rights Watch and others have highlighted, violent attacks against Shia
Muslims have been on the increase. Moreover, the violence is not
isolated to Shia Muslims. We have also seen terrible attacks on Sunni
mosques in the Malakand district. We have condemned those attacks. As
the Prime Minister has said, when it comes to terrorism,
Pakistan’s enemy is our enemy.</hs_para>

discrimination against the Ahmadi community remains a matter of
concern. We have again expressed these concerns in this year’s
<I>Annual Human Rights</I> <I>and Democracy Report</I>, as we did
during the universal periodic review at the UN Human Rights Council
last October. Of course, I had the benefit of the great expertise of my

Alton, asked when we last raised the case of Asia Bibi. I referred to
the case directly last year with Shahbaz Sharif, then the chief
minister of Punjab, who is tipped to be the chief minister again, and
who is, of course, the brother of the potential future Prime Minister.
They are powerful figures who are now in position in government and
thus able, it is hoped, to take these matters further.</hs_para>

Hussain asked about the aid being provided to Pakistan. Over the next
four years, we will support 4 million children in schools, many of them
girls. In the light of the Malala Yousafzai case, we can see why
support for education is so important. We are also supporting
programmes that allow women to access credit, prevent mothers dying in
childbirth and provide practical job training for tens of thousands of
people. Pakistan could become the UK’s largest recipient of aid,
averaging up to £350 million a year, but this increase is
dependent on securing value-for-money 
<?notus-xml column=98?>results. It will also be linked to the Pakistan Government’s
progress on reform at federal and provincial levels, including taking
tangible steps to build a dynamic economy, strengthen the tax base and
tackle corruption. As I have said before, it cannot be right that the
taxes of the people of this country are used to support the poor in
Pakistan when the rich in that country refuse to pay their taxes. UK
aid is helping to address the underlying grievance that creates an
environment in which extremism can flourish. It tackles inequality and
promotes social justice.</hs_para>

Ahmed, raised the MQM and Altaf Hussain. Again, I am saddened by the
recent outbreak of violence in Karachi, including the assassination of
Zahra Hussain, a respected and popular political figure. The UK
Government strongly condemn all acts of violence in Karachi, and we
sympathise deeply with the victims, their families and all the
law-abiding citizens of the city. The noble Lord referred specifically
to the role of the MQM in the violence. Let me reassure noble Lords and
the many members of the public who have written in that there is no
place for the incitement of hatred or violence in the UK, and we have
strict laws in place to deal with it. The Metropolitan Police has
received an unprecedented number of complaints about alleged comments
made by Mr Altaf Hussain. It is now formally investigating those
comments and in due course it will take appropriate action.</hs_para>

all our interests for Pakistan to be stable and prosperous. Religious
tolerance is vital for peace and prosperity to flourish in that
country, and the UK is committed to supporting efforts to achieve that.
The British Government will continue to stress the importance of
improving religious tolerance with the newly elected Government in
Pakistan. Lastly, I apologise for breaking my record and not
sticking to the

Sharkey:</Member></B> My Lords, like most noble Lords, I very much
welcomed the cross-party agreement on press regulation, and I very much
hope that the current apparent contest between two rival versions of
the royal charter is resolved in favour of the charter approved by
Parliament. I am certain that our royal charter will help to prevent
the kind of gross, shameful and even criminal behaviour that the
Leveson report detailed so graphically. But no matter how very welcome
this progress towards regulation is, I believe it is entirely timely
for us to remind ourselves that Lord Justice Leveson was charged to
look at both regulation of the press and ownership of the
press—both important and, I believe, equally
important.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=99?><hs_para UID="13052252000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000210">It
is worth recalling briefly why we have had to discuss regulation of the
press at all. The obvious and shameful behaviour of elements of the
press is the proximate reason, of course. However, much of this
behaviour was also illegal or in clear violation of the press’s
own code of conduct, which raises the questions of why the law was not
enforced and the code not applied. The reason for these failures is to
be found in the historic cosiness between politicians, the police and
some parts of the print media. The cosiness existed—and perhaps
still exists; we shall see—because of the perceived power of the
press to punish or reward political parties or individuals. This
perceived power exists largely because of the sheer size and reach of
some parts of the print media, and it was this perceived power, by
virtue of size and influence, that allowed parts of our press to
consider themselves above the law or immune from the consequences of
breaking it. It was the sense of power and immunity that fostered the
widespread and corrupt culture that Leveson detailed in his
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000211">I am
certain that regulation of the press is a necessary condition for
reforming this culture, but I am equally certain that it is not
sufficient. Size and reach have been the drivers of press misbehaviour
and of the complicity of other of our institutions in that
misbehaviour. As long as there are great concentrations of media
ownership, the drivers of potential future misbehaviour will always be
present. To make sure that regulation of the press achieves
long-lasting and deep cultural reform, we must also address the issue
of concentration of media ownership. If we do not do that, the chances
are that not far down the road we will find ourselves back again in the
last chance saloon commissioning Leveson mark
2.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000212">It is quite
striking, looking back at the various media crises of the past few
years, to see how little discussion there has been in the media of the
issue of media concentration and pluralism. One can see why this may
be, of course, but it will have to change. There needs to be more
public discussion, more examination, more analysis and simply more
noise about the whole area of who owns what and what they do with it.
There is a clear lesson from the setting up of the Leveson inquiry,
which is that the public is slow to take notice and the Government are
slow to act unless there is a clear problem to address. Of course, I
acknowledge that there is already a considerable body of research and
argument about what to do about concentration of media ownership.
However, as I shall illustrate in a moment, much of that work has not
entered the public consciousness, and quite a lot of this work seems,
at first or even second glance, to be as easy to grasp as quantum
physics.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000213">It is
in this context that I should say how very much I welcome the inquiry
currently being held by the Lords Select Committee on Communications
under the chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood. I have seen
the written evidence so far submitted to the committee in the very
helpful documents provided for this debate by the Library.
Although I shall touch on some of the themes and
characteristics of these documents, I shall, as is proper, leave
their full examination to the committee. I should also 

<?notus-xml column=100?>say that I very much look forward to hearing the
remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, in a few
moments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000214">There
are those who say that the whole issue of media concentration is just
too complex to deal with in any satisfactory way. It is easy to see why
people might say that. The problem is not in setting down what we would
like to achieve. Ofcom defines the desired outcome of a plural market
as,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052252000312" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000312">“ensuring
there is a diversity of viewpoints available and consumed across and

agenda”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13052252000290" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000290">This
is a pretty good objective and, as Lord Justice Leveson noted, it seems
to be generally acceptable. The problems arise over how much is too
much, and over how you measure it. Here is an invitation to complexity,
eagerly seized by
Ofcom.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052252000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000215">In
its report to the Secretary of State, Ofcom considered three types of
broad metric: availability, consumption and impact. Within these, it
considered five different types of consumption metric. The measurement
proposals were certainly comprehensive, but also very complicated.
Leveson noted this. He said
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052252000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000313">“its
complexity is also a disadvantage, in that it will be difficult for
most people to understand and could come under sustained attack from
those media providers who feel that they may be the subject of
plurality
concerns”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13052252000291" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000291">There
is a very important point here: a complex system of ensuring plurality
simply will not work. It will be opaque, user-unfriendly, difficult to
explain and a bonanza for lawyers. What we need is simplicity and a
measure that acknowledges the reality that the media exist in a revenue
and profit-driven marketplace. When profits can be magicked
away—something that we have seen quite a lot of
recently—revenue is the best and simplest indicator of
dominance.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052252000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000216">There
are already simple proposals for a measurement framework based on
revenue, some put forward by Claire Enders and Professor Barnett. I
urge the Minister to consider very carefully the merit of those simple
proposals. Everyone will understand a rule that says that you cannot
have more than X% of market revenue. If you can measure market presence
easily, as I believe you can with such a simple rule, then
Leveson’s next question applies: what action should be taken if
plurality rules are breached? Again, simplicity and the commercial
world should be our guide. The answer is that rule breach should lead
to divestment. That is what happens when the size of an ordinary
commercial company presents a danger, and it is what should happen to
media organisations
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000217">One
frequent additional source of complication in discussions of what to do
about media plurality is the internet. Or, more precisely, should we
include Google, Facebook, Twitter and others in our list of media
organisations that should be scrutinised for possible concentration of
power and influence? I know there has been a lot of discussion about
all this, but again I think there is a simple and simplifying approach
available to us. There should be a very simple test. Do these and
similar very large internet players exercise meaningful editorial
control? If they do, include them; if they do not, then do not. As
things stand, I do not believe that 
<?notus-xml column=101?>any of these companies exercise meaningful editorial
control. If it is simply their size that presents a
problem, it is surely a commercial problem and best dealt with by the
CMA.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0001.htm#13052252000218">In
the time available, I have been able to deal with only some aspects of
the issues surrounding media plurality. I am very much aware, for
example, that the place of local and regional media in all this
deserves detailed discussion at some point. I very much look forward to
hearing the contributions of other noble Lords on the subject of
plurality.</hs_para>

want to say to the Minister that I do not underestimate the
difficulties that the Government will have in finding a solution to
this problem, just as I hope that the Minister does not underestimate
the need actually to find a solution in the near future. I realise that
when the Minister replies to the Question—which is, it is worth
repeating: “To ask Her Majesty’s Government how they plan
to take forward issues of media plurality in the light of the Leveson
Report”—he will almost certainly not be able to give us
dates or a very precise plan, but I should be very grateful if he could
at least describe the process and the road map by which the Government
intend to progress the matter, assuming that they intend to do
so.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/CC7C8BE2359F325630128E99B5145C8B985E54EA" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Inglewood:</Member></B> My Lords, as my noble friend Lord Sharkey
pointed out to the Committee, the House’s Communications Select
Committee determined on 19 March that its next inquiry would be
into media plurality. On 26 March, members of the committee agreed a
call for evidence that was issued shortly thereafter. It had a deadline
for submissions of 1 May. We intend the inquiry to be as far-ranging
and wide-ranging as possible. We believe that is right and proper. We
shall consider as diverse a range of views right across the spectrum of
opinion as we can, and we intend the inquiry to be
comprehensive.</hs_para>

May, we received a response from the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport that struck me, the chairman, as—I shall put it this
way—disappointing. After all, it was a response to a call for
evidence from a Select Committee of Parliament. Having shared the
response with other members of the committee, they agreed that it was a
bit thin and, as a result, I wrote back to the Secretary of State for
the department, drawing her attention to the committee’s
concerns and the response’s shortcomings. Today, at 2.22 pm, in
an example of what you might describe as “just-in-time
government” the Secretary of State responded. I shall share one
paragraph of her letter with the committee. She wrote that media
plurality is an important and complex issue, and the questions raised
in our inquiry get right to its heart. She went on to say that the
Government will shortly be setting out how they plan to seek views on
these issues and how they may take forward Lord Justice
Leveson’s recommendations and that, in the light of that, it did
not seem appropriate to give a government position at this stage. She
wrote that the Government are grateful that we have launched an inquiry
to look at this area in greater depth and envisage the
committee’s scrutiny and findings providing valuable help and
support to the Government’s work 
<?notus-xml column=102?>in this area. I understand what the Secretary of State is saying and,
perhaps more importantly, I appreciate what is behind her
words.</hs_para>

without any reference to other members of the committee, I accept the
point she makes, subject to what seems to me to be a very important
proviso, which is that we need to know with certainty what this
timetable is going to be. I am rather more emphatic than my noble
friend Lord Sharkey about what the road map—to use the current
phrase—for this process might be. During this Parliament, first
there was going to be a Green Paper, which was delayed and then
disappeared and was replaced by a White Paper. The date of publication
of the White Paper seems to have been delayed and further delayed. If
noble Lords remember the play “Waiting for Godot”, the
characters were waiting for Godot at the beginning of the play and they
were waiting for Godot when it concluded. Against that background, I
ask my noble friend a very simple question: can he give us firm
indications, to which the Government will adhere, about the process to
which the Secretary of State has alluded? I invite him to put the reply
in the Library of the House.</hs_para>

committee wishes to co-operate with the Government in consideration of
these matters but, at the same time, we have to deal with each other in
good faith. My noble friend may not be able to give a precise reply now
but I hope very much that in his concluding remarks he will indicate
that he will, in an appropriate period—for example, within a
couple of weeks after we get back from the forthcoming short
recess—provide the House with a very clear indication of exactly
what is going on and, as and where appropriate, furnish the committee,
which feels very strongly about this, with the information that will
help it in the inquiry. In considering a topic such as media plurality
in the way that this House’s Select Committee is doing, it
matters that we have some idea—and I am using the slightly vague
words “some idea”—of what on earth the Government
think, even if as a result of the inquiries and consultations that have
been carried out they subsequently change their mind. It seems to me
that it has never been a problem for a Government to change their mind
to a conclusion that is better than their provisional one. I look
forward to hearing my noble friend’s
response.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:16:24"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

underestimate the benefits that some of the big media companies have
brought to the people of our country. Sky, for example, has
revolutionised everything from sports coverage, where its standards
have had to spread to other broadcasters, to, for example, the arts,
where Sky Arts is frankly often upmarket of the pot-pourri that is now
BBC Four. Therefore, there are advantages and they must not be
forgotten<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:17:18"></hs_TimeCode>. I
have had advantages myself since News International provided me with a

general is a bad thing and monopoly in media is a particularly bad
thing, as it affects not only one sector but the whole of
society. I just want to reflect on some episodes in recent
history that I think have brought home the extreme importance of,
certainly, holding the line against further media concentration and,
preferably, rolling back the concentration that still exists, despite
the impact of the internet. It is a scary thought that if it had not
been for the fact that the hacking scandal broke precisely when it did,
the then Culture Secretary, Jeremy Hunt, would have waved through News
Corporation’s takeover of the 60.9% of BSkyB that it did not
own. He came within days of doing so before the company realised that
it would have to withdraw the bid. It came that

dangers of monopoly in the way that the Leveson debate has been
conducted. I have felt that we have been living in parallel universes.
There has been the universe of the reasonably rational debate that has
been occurring in Parliament, taking a progressive direction
and ending with three-party agreement—a rational process and a
rational debate where advocates of minimal parliamentary interference
have made their points along with those who have said that something
had to be done. I think that we came to quite a good solution. But you
would not have the faintest idea of what that debate had comprised had
you relied on the

debate, the noble Lord, Lord Black—and I will choose my words
with great care—made a contribution that most noble Lords
present did not feel was among the most distinguished of that
particular evening. But in the newspapers next day, in particular the
News International newspapers, only one contribution to that debate
received a single mention—that of the noble Lord, Lord Black, in
defence of the very extreme position that he has taken. That is not

example and an important caveat is that sometimes the newspapers say,
“Yes, we must be allowed to amalgamate to develop things. Of
course, we will offer safeguards if there are threats”. I now
draw attention to another incident of which very little will have been
read by anyone in any national newspaper. When James Harding decided to
quit as editor of the <I>Times</I>—we will not go into the
reasons—Rupert Murdoch wished to appoint as his successors John
Witherow at the <I>Times</I> and Martin Ivens at the <I>Sunday
Times</I>. I should say that I have the reverse of any objection to
either of them. Martin Ivens has been a good friend of mine over a

a system was set up at News International as a result of the contested

today, although I may at some future point, they have not approved the
appointments. What has happened?

final point that I will make might have some appeal to the Minister and
the Government. If the British Government do not do anything, Brussels

interfere in a very fundamental way with the press. I quote from the
consultant Alison Sprague. She says that a recent EU
consultation,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052252000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000314">“advocates

was in the House recently when a pressure group was advocating
precisely such interference on a European basis. By God, I do not know

sector confirmed to me that free markets and competition do not reach a
steady state equilibrium where competition markets ensure fair and free
competition. Most owners seek more market share to give them greater
dominance and control in their markets, to better control prices, set
higher margins and increase profits, particularly if greater market

Sharkey described the Ofcom definition of plurality as ensuring there
is a diversity of viewpoints available and consumed across and within

element of subjectivity, particularly determining what “too much

is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000235">One
overriding conclusion from Leveson must be that one media group did
have too much influence. But sadly, in my view, Leveson did not address
plurality concerns as much as he should have done and there will be
much less point in adopting his recommendations on standards and
complaints unless we do. There is a danger that prolonged arguments
over complaints regulation and standards means that plurality is being
pushed into the long grass and ignored when it should be central to
everything.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000236">The

challenged the 
<?notus-xml column=105?><I>Telegraph</I>, and undermined other competitors
through aggressive pricing campaigns made possible by much larger
resources. The growing importance of Sky as a non-domestic satellite

low.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000237" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000237">A lot of
issues arose from this combined market dominance of News International.
It affected the way politicians dealt with the company and the
grovelling it indulged in to gain a political competitive advantage. It
affected the way its power could be regulated as any attempt to
restrain the company could be repulsed by aggressive and
effective lobbying, as we saw when issues of control arose relating to
Sky and News International. It affected the industry’s plans for
investigating complaints. It also affected the police, who always felt
that they had to keep the company on side. Fortunately, dominance
eventually bred arrogance as executives and editors whose hinterland of
judgment was faulty severely damaged the reputation of News
International. However, it could fight back and undermine anyone coming
for it, whether politician, policeman, journalist or major competitor.
It began to think that it was untouchable, and for a time it was.
However, that reputation was damaged once the pack of cards was
convincingly
challenged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000238">What
we need now is a new policy and definition of plurality to build on the
work of Leveson: otherwise, it will all be in vain. I find it
inconceivable that News International should be able to hold onto its
news market share while coming again to gain total control of Sky. As
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, said, it is incredible how near it got
with another faulty proposal for independent directors. The current
procedure for mergers must be retained, but it will need to be more
open and transparent. We have to ask ourselves why a 25% share of
revenues should not be the simple control. We will need a more explicit
definition of plurality for the four-yearly Ofcom review of the sector
if it is maintained, as I believe it should
be.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/3DF82C5FF9B4997EF729A55AA9D97EBAED324B77" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Parekh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey,
for securing and introducing this debate. I want to approach this
question slightly differently. In the Leveson report and elsewhere
there is an enormous emphasis on who owns what, on what percentage of
shares in the media are owned by News International or any other
body.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000241">Ownership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:29:34"></hs_TimeCode>
is certainly important, because our ultimate concern in a democracy is
to ensure that the media are balanced, objective, impartial and
represent a diversity of points of view. This is what the political
culture of a democracy is about. Ownership becomes important only in so
far as it stands in the way of these objectives, which of course it
does. I do not doubt that at all. After all, Murdoch’s 173
newspapers worldwide supported the Iraq war. That kind of homogeneity
does not spring up from nowhere; somebody is imposing it.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:29:34"></hs_TimeCode> good friend,
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, just told us what happened when one
particular Peer speaks and he alone is mentioned in the
newspapers.</hs_para>

supposing we had not one but five Rupert Murdochs—not one press
baron but five press barons—would that necessarily guarantee the
kind of democratic 
<?notus-xml column=106?>culture that we want? That happens in India, where
not one but half a dozen barons have control. What happens? They
collude, form a cartel and break rules, as various oil companies and
banks have done; or collectively, they are subject to certain
commercial pressures, and therefore end up behaving in exactly the same
way; or they have certain common interests as proprietors, and
therefore while they may compete, when their common interests are at
stake they are all as
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000243" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000243">While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:29:34"></hs_TimeCode>
ownership is important, it is not enough. I do not want us in this
country to make the mistake of thinking that if no one owns more than
30% or 40% of shares in the media, somehow the problem will disappear
or the problem will be solved. It will not; it will continue to haunt
us. As I said, it is perfectly possible for press barons to collude,
unite, form a cartel and continue the ugly practices that we would
rightly
condemn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000244" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000244">It
also does not matter whether or not these people are domiciled because
indigenous capitalists are not necessarily better than those settled
abroad, nor does it matter whether or not they pay taxes here. We seem
to be clutching at straws. I suggest that the problem is so deep that,
although ownership is important, we need to concentrate on other things
as well. We should be prepared for a world in which you might have
multiple ownership but still the problem that worries us continues to
haunt us. There may be a lack of balance and impartiality, no diversity
of views and all the phone hacking and ugly practices that brought the
Leveson inquiry into

do I think it is terribly important to inquire how often the Culture
Secretary or the Prime Minister has met this or that media mogul. It is
all right for public consumption but this is not how decisions are
made. Friends of the Prime Minister talk to friends of media moguls and
things get decided, or the media create a climate which channels the
Prime Minister’s or Culture Secretary’s thinking in a
certain direction. Looking at the log or the e-mails sent would not by
itself help us to understand how decisions are made. Therefore, I
suggest, with great humility, as I am not a media man but a boring,
abstract philosopher, that we need to concentrate first, on how to stop
this sort of thing happening irrespective of how many owners we have,
and, secondly, on the concrete, positive mechanisms of self-correction
that we can build into our
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:31:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000246">I
want to run though half a dozen ideas which I have canvassed in my
writings and in various speeches I have made in your Lordships’
House. First, I entirely agree that we need a strong regulatory
mechanism and must insist on and enforce certain standards that Leveson
has urged. Secondly, we must have an independent and publicly funded
body to audit the media coverage of important issues; assess how they
have covered these issues on the bases of accuracy, impartiality,
balance and self-correcting procedures; and inform the public which
media have behaved in which way. I refer to the example just given by
the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. We should name and shame the media in
exactly the same way that we name and shame schools, teachers and NHS
trusts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:32:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000247">Thirdly,
we should make sure that the media give regular space to alternative
points of view. There is no reason why 10% or 15% of the space in any
newspaper 
<?notus-xml column=107?>or media—as used to be the case in Canada and
elsewhere—or 15% or 20% of the space could not be allocated to
those who take a different point of view. Public funds should be made
available to marginalised groups to enable them to articulate and
promote their point of
view<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:32:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000248" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000248">Fourthly,
we must safeguard the integrity of publicly owned institutions such as
the BBC and ensure that they remain objective, command popular support
and provide an alternative to the profit-driven media. Fifthly, there
is no reason why Parliament cannot have a Select Committee on media
coverage and hold public hearings where newspaper proprietors,
journalists and others are required to explain why they have covered
events in a particular way. Such a committee could examine systematic
lies about membership of the European Union or about immigration. There
is no reason why a parliamentary committee could not call press barons
to account and ask them to explain their actions. I will speak for one
minute more and then I am
through<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:33:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000249">Sixthly,
MPs and Peers are expected to declare their interests, and I have never
understood why journalists are not required to declare theirs. If a
journalist has enjoyed the hospitality of a party or is a member of
that party and writes about an event, it is important that he should
declare his political and financial interests. Similarly, a newspaper
editorial should not comment on an issue in which the owner of that
newspaper has a stake. The constraints imposed on MPs and Peers should
also be imposed on media proprietors and
journalists.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/A616A2AFCDEFD4C5EF15C4938DCD2A2E7FA948AF" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

Whitty:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey,
for raising this debate. I put my name down because I am suffering some
frustration in this area. Since Leveson reported, we have focused on
the behavioural aspects of journalists and not on what is not the
longest part of Leveson but is an extremely important part, and deals
with
morality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000251">While
I do not disagree with some of the suggestions made by the noble Lord,
Lord Parekh, about action, ownership is absolutely important. I go back
to what I said on the first Statement on Leveson, which is that
a truly free press requires diversity of opinion, and diversity of
opinion requires plurality of ownership. We do not have anything like
plurality of ownership. Oligopoly can be as bad as monopoly and
sometimes, whatever the structure of ownership, people will behave
badly, but if you have a press and a media system that are
overwhelmingly dominated by very large companies, the public interest,
and the interests of democracy and diversity of opinion, are not
served. Leveson recognised that and made a number of proposals on that
front.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000252">Since
then, we have had hours of parliamentary debate in this House and
elsewhere on the behavioural aspects. We have at least two propositions
on various forms of royal charter and have had acres of coverage in the
newspapers. I therefore understand why emotions are raised by the issue
and I sympathise with both sides to some extent. I recognise the hurt
that victims feel and that they want to see something done. Likewise, I
recognise that journalists are concerned about the 
<?notus-xml column=108?>freedom of the press. I understand why we have had
that debate. However, the other side of it, the plurality side,
deserves equal attention.</hs_para>

first day that Leveson was reported to this House and was told by the
noble Lord, Lord McNally, that any decision on it was above his pay
grade. I got a similar reply during the passage of the Enterprise and
Regulatory Reform Bill, which dealt with the competition structure and
would have been a perfect vehicle for the Government to come forward
with some proposals. Eventually, they did not, even at the last minute.
When I tried again at that final stage, it was not really discussed
because of the kerfuffle about the royal charter. I received a letter
from the noble Viscount, Lord Younger of Leckie, saying that in his
recommendations Lord Justice Leveson did not address the technical
means of achieving his outcomes but acknowledging that this is an
important issue. It then
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13052252000303" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000303">“In
light of that, the Government will consult to seek views on these

will be in place before the summer

light on the horizon is the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord
Inglewood, and his initiatives in this respect, but the reply that he
got from the Secretary of State, which he has just related to us, does
not give me great encouragement to believe that the Government are
moving forward. Certainly, it does not suggest to the Select Committee
that it is going to get much from the Secretary of State before the
Summer Recess. I wish the Communications Select Committee good speed. I
hope that it manages to get some government engagement but, at the
moment, the suspicion is that this element of Leveson has been put on
the back burner or kicked into the long grass, whatever expression that
you care to use, because politicians in the Government and perhaps the
political class more widely than the Government are concerned that we
must not upset the owners of the media, in particular the print media,
as well as cross-media
ownership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000256">Unless
we grasp this nettle, Governments from here on will be equally hesitant
to take a line that will be rubbished by major media moguls. It is
right that in all countries there are big owners of newspapers and
television stations and so forth and that politicians always have to
recognise that and deal with them. In this country, there is a
particular structure with the domination of Murdoch. I agree with my
noble friend Lord Lipsey that Murdoch has brought some benefits to this
country. I do not think that his journalists are more evil than anybody
else, but they are uniquely powerful, and democracy cannot allow
uniquely powerful organisations to continue to dominate our news media.
I therefore hope that the Minister can tell us today rather more than
he told us when he replied to the noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, recently,
when he said that the Government were still thinking about it. I hope
that they will do something, preferably before the Summer
Recess.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-22?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_22_PT_1/207FC8DB18F5279EB093A5C7A18C5358FD2EF3A1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 22 May 2013">Wednesday,

their contributions. 
<?notus-xml column=109?>There has been a reasonable degree of unanimity
around what we have been discussing, which is all to the good and plays

introducing his speech, the noble Lord, Lord Sharkey, gave us a good
and quick tour d’horizon of how we got to where we are, which
echoed a lot of what I have thought about the issue. He has also picked
up an important point that there a lacuna in the public’s
understanding and awareness of why media plurality is so important and
how we need to deal with it. I was also struck by the point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Inglewood, and his frustration at being isolated and
not having sufficient guidance about where the Government stood on
this. He likened it to the play, “Waiting for Godot”. I
think that it is more like “The Maltese Falcon”. I smell
a McGuffin in the air; I am not sure what it is, but that is
the point of McGuffins—we do not know what they are. They
certainly take your eye off where the action is and leave you grasping
for how events turn out. I suspect that we are in that sort of mode
where there is something happening but, rather like Rosencrantz and
Guildenstern —to change my metaphor again—it is all
happening just a bit offstage and we are not part of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:41:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000259">I
have three important things to say—well, they are important to
me and I hope that they are to those who are listening. First, if one
reads the whole of Leveson, which I have, it is a very rich resource
for those interested in this area, and not all of it is ever quoted or
brought out. The section on plurality, as my noble friend Lord Whitty
said, it is not as long or extensive as some of the other stuff, but it
is very important. Leveson analyses it out in a way that I have never
seen before, but it is worth reflecting on why we care so much about
plurality. It is not because plurality is not important but because it
is only a surrogate for what I think is at the heart of the debate,
which is trying to ensure that the media are indeed of central
importance for a healthy and well informed democracy. Therefore,
control of the media should not be concentrated in too few hands. That
is a slightly different way from how many people, particularly media
commentators, have done it. We have tended to rush to a view and have
brought up measurement schemes and other things around what we can find
out about plurality as an issue in itself. In fact, it is only a
surrogate for what we are trying to get at, which is about a different
discourse and a different culture around the engagement of those people
with our
democracy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000260">In
a sense, the Communications Act 2003, for which my party was
responsible, has very good measures on plurality. It says that there
are two needs in any assessment of this: a sufficient plurality of
views in newspapers in each market for newspapers; and, changing
slightly, a need for sufficient plurality of persons with control of
the media enterprises serving every audience in the UK. We can see why
it is important but we must bear in mind that it is only a
surrogate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:43:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-22T15:43:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we have tended to use as the measuring medium news and current affairs
when considering plurality. Others have mentioned this before but
increasingly, particularly in a multimedia- and internet-based society,
we have to think of many more 
<?notus-xml column=110?>things. YouTube is not news and current affairs but
that is where most people now gather information and ideas. If we are
looking at news and current affairs only in a very traditional sense,
we may be led

third point is on the purpose of this debate, and I hope that the focus
of the Minister when he responds will be on what Leveson actually
recommended. Nobody has referred to that. We have existing regulation
in place, much of which Leveson regards as being satisfactory. There
are only a few areas where he thinks that there should be change. It is
about trying to bridge the gap between where the noble Lord, Lord
Inglewood, is and wants to be, where my noble friend Lord Whitty would
like to be by the Summer Recess, and where the Minister probably
is—I hope that he is running fast to catch up. The gap is not
that big. We are not asking for a huge amount.</hs_para>

about democracy: we must be clear about what we are looking at. Let us
keep that under review because in a changing world and a changing
environment, it is not necessarily sufficient to concentrate only on
news and current affairs. Secondly and obviously, we must now begin to
measure and to include online publications in any market assessment for
consideration of plurality. Much more work should be done on the theory
of how media priority should be measured. That point has been touched
on several times in the debate. It is not easy and can be very
complicated. I do not think it is as simple as the noble Lord, Lord
Sharkey, was trying to suggest. There has to be more to it, as I have
tried to say in my argument.</hs_para>

is an important point. He thinks that the levels must be reduced for
the media. The Government should consider whether periodic plurality
reviews should take place. We agree with that and I think some are
already happening. The final points that Leveson makes are about who
takes the final decision. We did not touch on that but I think it is
important because it was raised—in spades—in terms of the
BSkyB issues. The Secretary of State should remain responsible for
public interest decisions.</hs_parafo>

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Sharkey for this short debate on how the Government plan to take
forward the issues of media ownership and plurality in the light of
Lord Justice Leveson’s report. This clearly is an important
issue, and plurality is vital for a healthy and well informed
democracy. It is equally clear that we must get this right, and I have
listened very carefully to the many comments made by your Lordships
today.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052252000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000268">In
September 2011, this Government publicly commissioned Ofcom to provide
advice on the issue of media plurality, which was then considered by
Lord 
<?notus-xml column=111?>Justice Leveson. I think the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara,
put some sharp focus on the fact that it may not have been the largest
part of the report, but that does not mean to say that it is not a very
important part of it, as other noble Lords have
indicated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000269">As
was acknowledged by Lord Justice Leveson, the broad constraints of the
work that the inquiry had to undertake meant that there was not
sufficient time to look at these matters in detail. As a result, Lord
Justice Leveson’s recommendations in this area
were,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052252000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000316">“at
the level of desirable outcomes and broad policy framework, rather than
the technical means of achieving those outcomes”.</hs_quotefo>

recognises that plurality is a complex issue: it is concerned with what
is available in terms of the number of different media voices but also
with what information people consume. As was identified by Lord Justice
Leveson, a number of questions flow from this. The first relates to
scope—for example, how far plurality rules apply to online as
well as to more traditional news platforms. A second question relates
to measurement—the number and range of metrics that provide an
indication of the level of plurality and, indeed, sufficient plurality.
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, that there is
a complexity about these matters; it is not a quick fix. A third
question relates to remedies—the range of available remedies,
whether structural or behavioural. A fourth question relates to
triggers for action—what might trigger a review of plurality or
action, such as the imposition of a remedy. I also agree with the point
raised by the noble Lord about whether periodic plurality reviews or an
extension to the public interest are most likely to provide a timely
warning of and response to plurality concerns that develop as a result
of organic growth.</hs_parafo>

committed to seek views on these issues and on how to take forward Lord
Justice Leveson’s recommendations. I am very conscious of the
strictures of the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, and my noble friend Lord
Inglewood on these matters, but I can assure noble Lords that this will
be a thorough and well thought-out piece of work, and the process will
begin this summer. It will build on Ofcom’s advice and Lord
Justice Leveson’s recommendations in this area. I also
emphasise, conscious of what my noble friend Lord Inglewood has said,
that the work of your Lordships’ Communications Committee will
provide another valuable source of evidence and analysis. I believe,
having discussed this with colleagues, that this is the reason for the
manner in which the response was couched, not because there was any
lack of courtesy or understanding, and that this work will be immensely
valuable to the
considerations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000271" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000271">My
noble friend Lord Sharkey raised the idea of a revenue cap, as indeed
did other noble Lords. At times, the Opposition have raised this as
well and have made similar recommendations. As the Ofcom report
highlights, this may well present difficulties. The dynamic nature of
the UK’s communications sector means that at this stage it will
be hard to find a generally accepted consensus on a definition of the
UK’s cross-media market, or have the same view of its revenue
and of the revenue accorded to firms operating with it. There is more
work to do in that area.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=112?><hs_para UID="13052252000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000272">One aspect raised by a
number of noble Lords, including my noble friend Lord
Stoneham—the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, used the
words “in a changing world” that I was particularly
struck by—is that we have seen such changes to the face of the
media over just the past decade. There is the online sector and we will
see all sorts of other innovations that we have not thought of yet.
That is why I think that Lord Justice Leveson concluded that these
should be part of any market assessment of plurality. Within 10 years,
Google News and Facebook have become two of the three most used online
sources for news after the BBC. I have, of course, noted what my noble
friend Lord Sharkey said, but we need to address the influence of the
providers of news generally. Nevertheless, consumers are benefiting
from these new services, so it is important that in any new plurality
regime such innovation continues to be
supported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000273" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000273">I
understand that the Opposition have proposed a cap on the UK’s
national newspaper circulation. I am as yet unclear whether this would
be defined by print run or by readership, but as the whole media market
is changing, that may not actually address the issue in the most
skilful way. In a world in which people get their news from multiple
sources and use a range of different platforms to access news content,
the extent to which newspaper circulation correlates to influence may
potentially become less
clear.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052252000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000274">I was
also very interested in what the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, had to say on
ownership, about some of the experiences from the Indian media, and the
six points he made. The point is that the trend of change introduces
other new challenges. While exposure to a great range of new sources is
undoubtedly positive, an increasing array of information also heightens
the possibility that people will use internet search engines to modify
selectively their own news intake. Indeed, search engines support this
by prioritising news content based on a user’s previous
searches. This is why Ofcom highlighted that the availability,
consumption and impact of news media were relevant measures of
plurality. The report made clear that an inflexible prohibition on
market share was not currently advisable. It stated
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13052252000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000317">“setting
absolute limits leaves no room to take account of the broader context,
and this creates a risk that it is not possible to address issues of
commercial sustainability and innovation in an appropriate
manner”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13052252000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000294">Lord
Justice Leveson similarly concluded that no compelling evidence was put
forward to support arguments for any fixed cap on media market
share.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13052252000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000275">It
is for those reasons that I used the words “quick fix”.
Colleagues may not appreciate them, but I think that a quick fix is not
sensible and we need to proceed with care. That is why Lord Justice
Leveson recommended that work should be undertaken with the industry on
a measurement framework for plurality in order to achieve as great a
measure of consensus as possible on the theory of how it should be
measured. In many communities, the issue will be the extent to which
there is a regional source of news alongside the BBC. Some expressed
concern about the growing predominance of our national news market by
foreign news media. We need to think very carefully as to the extent to
which any new plurality regime might in practice give 
<?notus-xml column=113?>the foreign news media a competitive advantage. These issues all warrant
a level of detailed consideration that was not possible in the context
of Lord Justice Leveson’s inquiry.</hs_para>

must not forget the strength of the UK’s news sector. We have
world-leading journalism and a wide range of trusted providers and
editorial voices. I think the observations of the noble Lord, Lord
Lipsey, on European interests will strike home but, to be honest, the
Government are not likely to expect or permit Brussels to take on what
is a UK responsibility. However tempting it may be and however strongly
people feel, we have a responsibility to make sound decisions in the
best interests of the country as a whole. This necessarily entails due
process and engagement with those concerned to minimise the risks of
unintended consequences—for example, around innovation and
growth.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052252000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522-gc0002.htm#13052252000277">I

significantly in 2012, reflecting weaker demand in Italy and EU markets
more widely. This fall followed on the back of strong growth in the

year-on-year increase of over £1billion, overtaking Spain as the
UK’s 7th largest market for
goods.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052254000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130522w0001.htm#13052254000159">The
