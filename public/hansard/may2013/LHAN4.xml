then divided between the local authority and the bailiffs is a matter

bailiffs. The consultation, which has now finished, will result in a

are under no illusion about how they should behave when they have to
take on a debt. As the noble Lord says, they should be courteous and
caring, and that will be in the guidelines, which are 
<?notus-xml column=262?>being produced as we speak and are almost ready. They will give clear

is entitled to come to arrangements with bailiffs on fees and whatever
charges are made. The guidance will make clear what local authorities
can do, but I agree with the noble Lord that anything that looks like a
cosy arrangement between the bailiffs employed and local authorities is
thoroughly
undesirable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Campbell-Savours" PimsId="2453" UID="13051441000362" xid="1640" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000362">Lord

authority’s responsibility is to retrieve the debt in any way it
can. I think the noble Lord is referring back to the Question about
what arrangements are made with the debtors who are going to collect
those debts, financially. I have said pretty clearly that there will be
very clear guidance on what they can and cannot do, and that cosy
business arrangements are thoroughly
unsatisfactory.</hs_para>

monitoring the charging scheme in Wales and data from the first year
will not be available until the summer. I understand that unintended
consequences in the Republic of Ireland included an increase in sales
of bin liners because consumers no longer used free carrier bags to
line their bins. The production of bin liners has a bigger
environmental impact than single-use carrier bags. In addition,
following the introduction of the charge in Wales there was an increase
in sales of bags for life. As the aim of a charge is to reduce use, it
could result in a worse environmental outcome if they are used only
once or twice, because they need to be used at least four times to have
a lower carbon footprint than single-use carrier bags. We need to
consider all the impacts in the round, and we will consider very
carefully instituting a

on how to tackle it. Under the last Government, we found that enormous

The noble Lord can look at the figures himself. We spend 3.6% of GDP on
children and families; we are the second highest in the UNICEF
measures, and we get precious little bang for our buck. We end up well
down the table in performance for how children do. We need to work out

near the top. One thing that is so special about Finland is the
emphasis that it puts on early years education, which seems to have a

Pensions Bill to apply the principles of modernisation to state
pensions, providing a system fit for the 21st century. The Bill,
introduced last week, contains provisions to set up the single-tier
state pension—a simple flat-rate state pension for future
pensioners that is set above the basic level of means-tested support.
This will provide the clarity that is needed to help people to plan and
save for their retirement. We will create a state pension system that
reflects the lives and contributions of today’s working-age
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000076">Indeed,
those who have historically done poorly in the current
system—for example, people with caring responsibilities or those
with broken work histories—will benefit. In the first 10 years,
more than 700,000 women should receive, on average, £9 a week
more in state pension through the single-tier
valuation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000077">As
life expectancy continues to increase, we are taking action to ensure
that the state pension system remains sustainable over the long term.
The Pensions Bill will bring forward the increase in state pension age
to 67 by eight years, so that it gradually increases from 66 to 67
between 2026 and 2028. The Bill contains provision for a regular review
of the state pension age, so that this issue is considered every
Parliament. This will ensure that the state pension age remains
sustainable and fair between the generations.</hs_para>

contains a number of measures to strengthen private pensions. We
estimate that the introduction of automatic enrolment into workplace
pension schemes will result in between 6 million and 9
million people either saving for the first time or saving more into
workplace pensions. However, without further reform, automatic
enrolment will create more dormant pension pots as people move jobs.
Therefore, we are legislating to introduce a system of automatic
transfers of small pension pots. This will help consolidate pension
savings into an individual’s current employer’s scheme,
making it easier for people to keep track of their pensions saving,
plan for retirement and secure a better retirement income. Finally, the
Pensions Bill will make provision for the introduction of the
bereavement support payment. This will simplify the 
<?notus-xml column=274?>current system by moving to a single benefit, with support focused on
the period immediately following bereavement.</hs_para>

of support, the Government recognise that today’s care and
support system often fails to live up to the expectations of those who
rely on it. Many have good experiences, but the system can often be
confusing, disempowering and not flexible enough to fit around
individuals’ lives. The Care Bill takes forward our commitments
to reform social care. This will make a reality of our vision for a
modern system which promotes people’s well-being. Critically,
the Bill will reform care and support funding by creating a cap on care
costs, giving people peace of mind by protecting them from catastrophic
costs. In providing a new right to deferred payment of care costs, it

also contribute to economic growth by encouraging the water sector to
become more efficient, creating employment for new entrants to the
industry and driving innovation. All business customers will be able to
switch their water supplier so that they can achieve the best service

water from and to each other. New businesses will find it easier to
enter the water market to provide new sources of water or sewerage
treatment services, known as “upstream” services.
Developers will also find it easier to connect new developments to the
water mains and sewerage systems. We believe that this Bill is also the
best vehicle for taking measures to address the availability and
affordability of flood insurance.</hs_para>

hold a UK Gambling Commission licence. Under the new regime, all remote
gambling operators will be subject to the robust and consistent

to our adoption, family justice and special educational needs systems.
It will support improved educational attainment for looked-after
children and strengthen the role of the Children’s Commissioner
so that children have a strong and independent advocate for their
rights. It introduces a new system of shared leave for new mothers and
fathers and contains measures to encourage growth in the childcare
sector. I am grateful to noble Lords on the Joint Committee on Human

the Energy Bill will also be carried into the 2013-14 Session. This
Bill will generate the biggest change to the electricity market since

so many formidable challenges, last Wednesday’s Queen’s
Speech was an opportunity for the Government to outline a positive
agenda for jobs and growth, and to help hard-pressed families cope with
the drastic fall in living standards, but positive change it was not.
Instead, we were treated to a desperately disappointing and dispiriting
programme from a Government who are out of touch, out of ideas, and out
of support from a significant number of their own MPs. Nowhere is that
more evident than in the subjects we are covering today: in welfare,
where the welfare bill continues to rise, the universal benefits scheme
is in trouble, and the Work Programme simply is not getting the
long-term unemployed into work; in energy, where the dithering and
discord between the Treasury and the Department for Energy and Climate
Change is putting our energy supply at risk and investment in renewable
and nuclear energy in jeopardy; in the environment, where the Prime
Minister’s claim to lead the greenest Government ever lies in
tatters; in agriculture, where the water Bill is effectively only half
a Bill that fails to deal with public affordability; in culture, media 
<?notus-xml column=277?>and sport, where we have no communications Bill and our wonderful
Olympic legacy has been squandered as schools sport provision has been
woefully undermined by Mr Gove; and in education, with no plans for
vocational education and the Government’s lamentable plan to
weaken early years childcare ratios in total
chaos<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T15:27:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Government’s stewardship so much in evidence in terms of failure
than in the field of health and social care. The Government’s
backtracking on public health is but one example. The noble Earl who is
to wind up our debate later will know that the scale of health
inequalities in the UK is formidable. He also knows that smoking is one
of the most important contributors to ill health and early death. That
is why there was such a warm welcome when reports emanated from
Whitehall in the spring promising legislation to enforce plain
packaging for cigarettes. Why was there no mention of the Bill in the
Queen’s Speech, and why no Bill to set a minimum price for
alcohol? Does the noble Earl agree with his colleague, Dr Sarah
Wollaston MP, who has said that a U-turn on plain packaging would send
a message that public health has been completely abandoned by the

ask the noble Earl about the establishment of Health Education England,
which is set out in the Care Bill. I note Schedule 5 to the Bill
regarding the make-up of its board and would ask him whether he will
ensure that there is a balance of non-executives in terms of gender and
diversity. I ask him that because I was astounded to learn that all of
the non-executives on the advisory board of Public Health England are
men, including the chairman. I am equally astounded that my noble
friend Lady Massey of Darwen, having gone through all due process, was
vetoed by Ministers from joining the board. Why was that

health implications of the Government’s immigration measures.
They have made much of their proposals to ensure that only NHS patients
who properly qualify for the NHS should get free treatment. No one
would quarrel with that as a proposition, but it is clear that the
Government do not have a clue how to implement their proposals, apart
from forcing GPs into the role of immigration officers. The existing
guidance produced by the Government on the charging of overseas
patients is 90 pages long. It is one of the most incomprehensible
pieces of draftsmanship that I have ever seen.</hs_para>

Nuffield Trust showed in 2011 that immigrants are far less likely to

support the intention to make it a criminal offence for NHS and social
care organisations to provide false or misleading information about
their performance. But why is the duty of candour restricted to
hospitals and other service providers? Why should commissioning bodies
such as clinical commissioning groups and NHS England not have a
similar duty apply to them? Mr Robert Francis called today for more
honesty from the NHS. However, that means all 
<?notus-xml column=278?>of the NHS. I also echo some questions asked by Mr Francis.
Why are the Government not providing for the ability to prosecute
individual staff in the case of serious patient neglect? Why are the
Government refusing to merge CQC and Monitor into a single
organisation? What response does the noble Earl have to Mr Francis, who

Government claim that the Care Bill, which is probably one of the most
important Bills that this House will debate in the next few weeks, will
reform the way long-term care is paid for to ensure that the elderly do
not have to sell their homes to meet their care bills. The Bill builds
on many of the recommendations of the Law Commission’s review of
adult social care legislation initiated by the previous Government and
on the proposals in Labour’s White Paper before the last
election. The Bill may well be a step towards a better system but the
key question I put to the noble Earl is this: where is the funding to
implement it? On its own, the Bill will not go anywhere near far enough
in tackling the crisis that is now engulfing health and social care,
openly acknowledged by the Secretary of State. We have hospitals full
to bursting, discharge is becoming ever more difficult, and handovers
to social services are slower and subject to more disputes. Social care
and the voluntary sector are struggling to fulfil demands placed on
them. On the front line, thousands of nursing posts have been lost and
many services are under pressure. In social care, the recent report of
the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services laid bare the
scale and severity of the financial squeeze on councils: £2.7
billion stripped from adult social care services since 2010, equivalent
to 20% of their care budgets, even as demand for those services
continues to
rise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T15:32:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000098">Ministers
have today been forced to announce new measures to get the NHS and
social care working together in integrated teams. However, the whole
reform programme of enforced marketisation has actually encouraged the
opposite—the fragmentation of services. At national level there
is utter confusion as to who is in charge. We have even had NHS England
arguing with the Secretary of State over the release of money to help
hard-pressed accident and emergency
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T15:33:00"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Secretary of State has finally grasped that the A&amp;E crisis is a
crisis of the whole system but NHS England persists in its foolish
approach of blaming everyone but itself. How else to explain the
bullying of clinical commissioning groups to fine those very same
hard-pressed A&amp;E and ambulance services? The Secretary of State
itches to intervene, but his powers are limited because his predecessor
and the noble Earl were adamant that they wanted to hand powers over to
a quango, NHS England. No wonder Chris Hopson, chief executive of the
Foundation Trust Network, described the Government’s response to
the A&amp;E problems as an

Care Bill may well be a step towards a better system but new rights to
services and support risk being meaningless as council budgets are cut
to the bone and people are faced with spiralling charges. Many
searching questions remain to be asked about the Government’s
proposals. Can the noble Earl confirm that Andrew Dilnot warned that
anything above a 
<?notus-xml column=279?>£50,000 cap on care costs would not provide enough protection to
people with low incomes and wealth? Can he explain the rationale of
persisting with a £72,000 cap? Has the noble Earl seen a paper

hoped that the capping of care costs would lead to appropriate private
insurance packages coming on to the market. Can the noble Earl tell us
what discussions he has had with the ABI to stimulate such a market?

hotel costs that a care home will charge, and that people in

to access the current system? It says that unless the Government set

taken to put it before a joint scrutiny committee. I had the privilege

the individual’s well-being at the heart of decision-making and
gives carers new legal rights to services. It places duties on councils

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Freud
indicated that one of the subjects for debate this afternoon is energy.
Her Majesty’s Speech said that the Government will continue with
legislation to update energy infrastructure. That is a short
description of what will be a pretty long Bill when we receive it from
the other place. I will come to that in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000122">Before
I refer to the Energy Bill, I want to say how much I admired the speech
made on Thursday by my noble friend Lord Fowler. It was superb and I
agreed with every word of it. It was of course about the implementation
of the Leveson report. Like my noble friend, I hope that the Government
will stand firm with their royal charter on press regulation, which was
agreed at the end of the previous Session by the leaders of the three
main parties represented in Parliament. At the moment we are witnessing
some newspaper groups seeking to substitute their own, much weaker
charter. That is no less than a very blatant attempt by those
newspapers and their proprietors to keep their status in society as
over-mighty subjects. Previous Governments have had to deal with
over-mighty subjects. They had to face the Whig aristocracy in the
18th century, the Tory mill and factory owners in the 19th
century and the trade unions in the 20th century. The Leveson report
exposed the press as the over-mighty subjects of the 21st century,
believing, like their predecessors, that they were above the law and
outwith the surveillance of Parliament. That can be acceptable to no
democratic Government. Some newspapers may dislike intensely the
prospect of tougher regulation but the way that they are fighting their
case is not a pretty sight. I condemn them and hope that the Government
will stand firm on
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000123">Turning
to energy, I want to raise three issues. First, I express dismay at the
long delay in the negotiations between EDF and the Government on the
terms of the proposed contract for difference and strike price. This
was supposed to have been announced before Christmas and here we are,
half way through May, and as yet nothing. This is the first test of the
Government’s proposals for electricity market reform. It is
being watched very carefully by not only the participants in the
industry but a number of other countries that are interested in the
model that the Government put forward. A failure to agree would be a
severe blow to investor confidence and create a real risk of
undermining the central objectives of the Energy Bill. It would also
strike a serious blow to the Government’s desire to stimulate
growth in the economy and create more jobs through a major
infrastructure project. I cannot stress too highly the need for an
agreement to be reached and announced very soon, the consequences of
which would be wholly
beneficial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000124">Secondly,
I was dismayed, as many noble Lords were, when in January Cumbria
County Council refused to allow the negotiations with local authorities
to host a geological disposal facility for nuclear waste to proceed to
the next stage. The two district councils, Copeland and Allerdale,
agreed to do that but the county council—far away in
Carlisle—refused and the Secretary of State, my right honourable
friend Ed Davey, said that that ended the negotiations.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=283?><hs_para UID="13051441000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000125">Yesterday, DECC
announced a new open consultation and has called for evidence on the
whole siting process. I welcome that, because what it was doing before
has clearly gone seriously wrong. In my view, the main reason for the
failure of the negotiations in Cumbria was that nobody—not DECC,
not Defra, not the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency, not the Sellafield
authorities—seemed to have any duty to counteract the wave of
malicious anti-nuclear propaganda that swamped the county in the three
months before the decision to withdraw was made. I cannot believe that
that is the right way to approach such major infrastructure problems.
There needs to be a system of instant rebuttal for every erroneous
statement made. Otherwise, the people who come to make the decisions
are left with only half the information that they need. It is very sad
that it was no one’s job to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T15:50:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000126">My
third point is that on 18 February, the regulator, Ofgem, sent a very
long letter to all the parties interested in the electricity
market—the system operators, the transmission system owners, the
generators, the suppliers, the traders and representatives of
customers—proposing a new process to review what it described as
future trading arrangements, or FTAs. At the end of the letter, it
posed three questions: do you agree that Ofgem should launch a project
to create a high-level design for the future electricity trading
arrangements; what key issues should be examined as part of the work
stream in that arrangement; and what form should the process
take?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000127">I see
that opening up the prospect of a much more effective competition
regime in an industry that has become a bit sclerotic and, in some
respects, monopolistic in its habits. I am told that the indications
are that the big six generators and distributors, who totally dominate
the market, oppose that proposal. They fear that it will lead to
tougher competition for generating capacity and access to the consumer
markets. The new players, whom the Government are anxious to attract
into the industry—I have met some of them—are likely to
support it, as it could lead to opening up markets to them that have
hitherto been the almost exclusive preserve of the big

question to the Government is simple: they have a stated aim of
increasing competition in the electricity generation and distribution
market. If the big six are opposing a new structure and the new players
are supporting it, where do the Government stand? What is the DECC
attitude to that? I have heard nothing about that. I cannot reasonably
expect answers from my noble friend Lord Howe at the end of the debate,
but I hope that what I have said might be studied. I am grateful to see
my noble friend Lady Verma on the Front Bench. I hope that it may be

is for me also rather extraordinary as a composer to be following in
the footsteps of musicians such as Lord Menuhin of Stoke
D’Abernon and my godfather, Lord Britten of Aldeburgh, whose
centenary the world of music is currently celebrating. As a young
chorister at Westminster Cathedral, I sang in the first performance of
the Britten “Missa Brevis” and accompanied my father,
Lennox, to rehearsals of his violin concerto with Menuhin. I know that
both Benjamin Britten and Yehudi Menuhin would passionately endorse the
sentiments I am about to embrace. The gracious Speech touched on
culture, education and aspiration; speaking about music and the arts is
indeed a theme I would like to
explore.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000131">First,
let me take your Lordships to the Welsh Marches, that beautiful, wild
but lyrical countryside so loved by Kilvert and Housman that forms the
border between England and Wales and where, for the past 35 years, I
have naturally and gradually build up a small farm near the town of
Knighton. I have seen this community severely challenged in recent
years by job losses and the difficulties that farmers have faced, not
least in the recent snow. Yet despite these tribulations, there is
always a smile on local faces. There certainly was a smile when, many
years ago, we bought our first sheep at auction. The late and much
lamented Nora Ephron, writer of “Sleepless in Seattle”
and “When Harry Met Sally”, who was staying with us at
the time, got so excited by the bidding that she waved happily across
the ring to my wife, who waved back. This was much to the delight of
the auctioneer, who treated these exuberant celebrations as a portent
of an early Christmas and as further bids. Our first sheep were
therefore the most expensive we have ever bought.</hs_para>

concerns in this part of the world concentrate on maintaining the
important tourism that so feeds an area rich in wonderful walking. The
spine of Offa’s Dyke runs through the town. In many ways,
communities like this present a microcosm of the conundrums with which
your Lordships and the Government have to wrestle. For instance,
because of the stunning landscape and the tourism it attracts there is
considerable concern over the prospect of many marching pylons and huge
wind turbines bespotting the horizon. The balance between the need for
renewable energy and the preservation of a landscape of great cultural
significance is as problematic as the balance between the
Government’s desire to see more localism and their overruling of
local opinion in matters of
planning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000133">Just
over the hill from Knighton lies the town of Presteigne, which,
astonishingly, boasts a successful annual festival of largely
contemporary music. This organisation operates on the breadline, and
sometimes below it, yet the need—the hunger—for cultural
nourishment could not be more manifest, especially at times like this.
In great art, as, for many, in religion, we find comfort and solace but
also the means to see ourselves and inside ourselves more clearly. On
my travels around the world, I got to know this refrain well:
“We envy you your National Health Service and 
<?notus-xml column=285?>the BBC”—for whom, by the way, I have broadcast for some
40 years. But now a third cause of envy is cited: the thrilling
cultural experiences that this country

the Culture Secretary told us that we must celebrate the money-spinning
success of our cultural organisations. I agree with her that for too
long we have failed to spell out just what a good investment the arts
are. For much less than 0.1% of government expenditure the arts return
0.4% of GDP, according to recent statistics from the Centre for
Economics and Business Research. That is a £7 return for every
£1 invested. If the Chancellor, or indeed us lesser
mortals, the ordinary savers, could reap this kind of return in all our
dealings, we would be rushing to invest. The creative economy employs
2.5 million people and growth in this sector runs at four times the
national
average.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000135">While
this fiscal approach might be encouraging, there is another
unquantifiable but even more important return on investment in the arts
and arts education: the social dividend that leads to a more civilised
and cohesive society. Aspiration cannot be realised without education,
and education can be effective only if supported by opportunity.

someone to play the violin without a violin. Some years ago, I helped
to organise what we call an amnesty on instruments. The idea was that
parents and friends would search their cupboards not for unwanted
knives and weapons but for unwanted or unused musical instruments and
hand them into their local school. As a result, I had a letter from a
small girl aged about eight who said that now she had her violin she no
longer got into a rage because she could talk through and to her

Lordships may have seen the Birmingham Royal Ballet’s Ballet
Hoo! project on television three or four years ago in which
disadvantaged children and teenagers in Birmingham took part in a

somewhat contemptuous of the notion of ballet, these kids, many in
minor trouble with the police, found themselves in awe of the
athleticism and fitness of the dancers and responded obsessively and
proudly to the rigours of a disciplined rehearsal timetable. You could
see that they really meant it when they described it as a life-changing
experience. I know that this is probably an impossible vision, but I

problem with confining oneself to the financial rewards of cultural
investment is that we tend to focus on the big players, great though
they are. The National Theatre, Tate Modern, the Royal Opera 
<?notus-xml column=286?>House, for example, are precisely the institutions that can bolster
their state support with philanthropic gifts, but the area I am worried
about is the seedbed for those institutions: regional and small-scale
theatre, dance and music organisations, where young talent can be
fostered before it takes to the main stage, and the colleges that train
the orchestras and soloists, the dancers, actors, composers and artists
of tomorrow. This is also the place, as Sir Nicholas Hytner has pointed
out, where experiment and risk take place. When a highly acclaimed
chamber group such as the Nash Ensemble is unable to find money for
commissioning new music, we must acknowledge that there is a vacuum in
the system, especially for
composers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000139">So
while there is much to celebrate, there is also much to do. Indeed,
speaking as a composer, I would say that one of the most important
aspects of creativity is self-criticism, careful and honest analysis,
so that one constantly seeks to improve. In relation to the work of
Parliament, that is surely the great role of this House, a role I have
been privileged and impressed to observe. Now that I have concluded my

Griffiths of Burry Port:</Member></B> My Lords, I suspect that we all
knew that it would be an honour and a privilege to hear the noble Lord,
Lord Berkeley of Knighton, but I would like to say that, at least in my
case, it has also been a pleasure. The creative arts will indeed find a
noble spokesperson for their cause and the voice of culture will be
heard in a focused way because of his presence among us. His
achievements in the world of music are truly prodigious: orchestral and
chamber music; music for woodwind and strings; music for guitar and
keyboard; and music for oratorio, ballet and film. You name it, and he
seems to have done it. We salute him for his achievements, but we
delight ourselves in the wisdom of those who bring him into our company
so that we may benefit from them.</hs_para>

am reading and reviewing at the moment a book about the poet RS Thomas.
During the time he lived at Manafon, which is not far from Knighton, he
wrote his first collection of poetry. The key poem in the volume is
called, <I>Out of the Hills</I>. Since the noble Lord said that hill
farming was one of his preoccupations, perhaps the same hills produced
music in his case and poetry in the case of Thomas. I cannot forbear to

sometimes at the expense of choice. Not all schools want to become
academies. Why should they not choose not to become academies if in
their view that is in their best interests? I am the chairperson of the
Central Foundation schools of London. Neither of them is an academy and

school has been started where one is not needed. Islington has an
over-provision of places at sixth-form level for its pupils, yet here
we have a free school—to meet what demand? The school has also
filched the head of the sixth-form consortium in Islington to be the

a century ago, Lloyd George’s coalition Government of 1918 had
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:12:52"></hs_TimeCode> foresight to
legislate for the establishment of nursery schools. Fast forward to the
present, and this Government are making one of the biggest measures
ever introduced to help parents with childcare costs, providing almost
£1 billion in extra support for families. Today, we are about to
witness this coalition Government bring about significant changes in
early-years education, as outlined in the consultative document,
<I>More Great Childcare</I>. These policies will make significant
improvements to enhance the quality of childcare and early-years

personally have never been comfortable with the term
“childminder”. Childcare is not about minding children,
it is about providing qualified people to deliver opportunities for
young people to explore, play and learn. In medieval times, when
agricultural workers went out to work in the fields, they were provided
with a basket in which to place the baby and a peg from which to hang
it. Childcare is not a peg on which to mind a child: rather, it is an
opportunity to provide education while parents and guardians are at
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:19:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000154">In
this way, the question of ratios should be discussed and considered in
a rational manner, with decisions being made on an educational basis. I
have learnt that so far the majority of the responses to the
consultation from individuals and the main professional organisations
say how important it is educationally to preserve the status quo in
terms of existing ratio structures. In my view, just as class sizes
improve learning, child ratios in early years and childcare improve the
quality of that provision. I am not interested in league tables which
show what other countries do; I am more interested in what is best for
our children. Improving quality education does not come from increasing
ratios. In a pre-school or nursery setting, you only have to have one
child with special needs or special learning difficulties for the
staffing ratios to become very

to mainstream schooling, the public consultation on the draft national
curriculum has been completed and we await the outcome of that process.
For me, any national curriculum must ensure first and foremost that
children and young people are numerate and literate. Yes, children must
learn to spell correctly from an early age and, yes, grammar is
important. In mathematics, children must know their number bonds and
their times tables—yes, even up to the 12 times table. A love of
language and literature has to be nurtured. Guess what? Surprise,
surprise, a recent study on children’s reading found that early
readers are always a level higher in their overall schooling.</hs_para>

get the best from all pupils: we need to be pupil-driven, not
target-driven. The issue with our national curriculum is that everyone
wants it slimmed down, but, of course, every subject interest group
then wants to fill it up again. We have trumpeted the fact that our

the quality of the teacher. Maybe the time is right to look at a royal

part-time workers, those with caring responsibilities and, above all,
women. Think about it. To get a useful occupational pension, you start
contributing young. You and your employer contribute enough throughout
your working life. You stay in full-time work for 40 years, you gain
from tax relief, you can manage investment and disinvestment strategies
and DC schemes, and you do not need to touch your pension savings
because you can access other savings. Not one of those propositions
fits most women or, indeed, many low-paid men. You could not devise a
worse fit for women if you

woman’s earnings are interrupted by childcare from her late 20s
and elder care from her 50s. Work is part-time, low-paid and
unpensioned. There is little or no gain from tax relief and little or
no ability to manage DC investment. There are little or no other
savings, so if she faces divorce, debt or disability, she cannot access
her own pension savings; she can access only the moneylender, at higher
cost. None of it works for her. That is because pensions were built by
men for men to smooth the income from work into retirement. Yet for
most women, their working life needs more smoothing than the move into
older age. Therefore, they will always need a decent state pension,

the previous Government significantly reduced pensioner poverty.

it safe to save. Every penny the woman hairdresser or the shop

will say a word or so about universal pensioner benefits. Do not touch
bus passes, which address the issue of pensioner isolation. Do not
means test because a third of pensioners do not claim means-tested
benefits, and the whole point of the new single state pension is to get
rid of means-testing. You could tax, but, particularly with winter fuel
benefits, which are expensive, you would get in very little—I
calculate that it would be about £100 million. Instead, given
the new state pension in 2016, we could postpone winter fuel payments
alongside TV licences for that generation and for future new pensioners
until they reach 75. Age is quite a good proxy for need—older
pensioners are poorer pensioners, such as elderly widows whose husbands
have died and whose occupational pensions have died with
them—and I calculate that within about five years we would save
about £1 billion a year and upwards. It is only a thought, but
it would be simple, universal, targeted, fair and
affordable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:26:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000172">However,
if you really wanted to save on the pensions bill while increasing
fairness, you would seek to tackle tax relief. It costs nearly
£40 billion a year, of which two-thirds goes to the wealthiest.
It is a shadow welfare state costing almost as much as the basic state
pension itself. Given tax relief and national insurance, which should
be levied on those of us who work beyond state pension age; given that
we have an upper earnings limit at all, which is not defensible at all,
which makes national insurance regressive and whose abolition would
bring in £11 billion; given equity release—more than
£1 trillion is locked away in housing equity and only between
£0.5 billion and £1 billion is released every year; we

one final point. We need to think differently about life after 65.
Increased life expectancy is not, for the most part, increased healthy
life expectancy. The extra years are largely years of poor health. Most
of us can expect three stages of older age: a decade or so of healthy
life, and the number of healthy years is not really increasing by much,
except for the better off; a decade of some limiting disability, such
as a lack of mobility, the inability to reach or difficulty in hearing,
but with care needs sufficiently modest that, along with telecare, they
can normally be met at home; and between two and five years of frail
dependency, including dementia, during which substantial personal care
is needed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13051441000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000174">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:28:37"></hs_TimeCode>
is the second stage—a limiting disability—that in my
view, from all the research that I have studied, is lengthening with
increased longevity. Funding and supporting that stage is not actually
expensive, especially given that half the growth in the number of older
people is the result of increased longevity and half is from a bulge in
the number of older people coming through from the baby boom. When that
is played through in the next 50 years or so, we will have just about
the best worker to pensioner ratio in
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:29:01"></hs_TimeCode>. 
<?notus-xml column=293?>When we hear all those siren calls to raise the state pension age in
line with increased longevity, we should
pause<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:29:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

difference in life expectancy between the poorest and richest ward in
my city is 11 years. The gap in healthy life expectancy between those
two wards is 15 years and widening. Eight in 10
better-off men but only three in 10 poorer-off men will survive to 80.
Therefore, in all fairness, the state pension age should
rise only with any rise in the years of healthy life expectancy, not
with any overall increase in longevity, which is mostly
disability-accompanied, otherwise the years of healthy retirement for
half the population—the poorer part—as a proportion of
their adult life will actually shrink: a profoundly unfair outcome for
profoundly unfair lives. We can all do better than

with cancer is most aware of. While they need healthcare, they also
need social care but are not themselves aware of which care they need.

Wheeler:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to speak on the Care
Bill, which, as my noble friend Lord Hunt has stressed, is recognised
as an important step towards providing a consolidated legislative
framework for our social care system based on the excellent report from
the Law Commission, which we established to streamline and unify social
care law. The Bill implements 66 of the commission’s 77
recommendations, refocusing care and support on more patient-centred
services that are better suited to people’s lives and needs,
with well-being as the guiding principle. We strongly support this; it
takes forward our work on patient choice and control, builds on the
progress we made in key areas such as prevention, personalisation of
services, carer recognition and support in our landmark National Carers
Strategy. It also addresses many of the “unfinished
business” issues that we proposed in our 2009 national care
service White Paper.</hs_para>

I commend the pre-legislative scrutiny work of the Joint Committee. The
Bill, as seen in the stakeholder evidence to the committee, enjoys
considerable support among patients, carer organisations, staff,
service users and providers, with, of course, the key proviso that
major improvements are needed to address what the committee itself
identified as the “gaps” and “risks of unintended
consequences”, and the wider issues relating to both the NHS and
social care. For all the widespread support, however, the gentle

volumes. It is a message that we on these Benches, along with care and
support organisations across the statutory, private and voluntary
sectors, have been trying to hammer home since the draft Bill was
introduced. It is not just about the “new costs” impact
of the Bill itself that were cited by the committee, such as those
resulting from the huge increase in the number of care assessments
under the new capped system; the Government also need to recognise the
scale and urgency of the current care crisis and that their proposed
Dilnot solutions need to extend to self-funders, the millions of people
with limited means and those who are unable to pay for adequate care
and support.</hs_parafo>

their homes to pay for care, will not cap the costs that elderly people
pay for residential care, and will not mean that pensioners get their
care for free if they have income or assets worth up to
£123,000.
From<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T16:46:38"></hs_TimeCode> the outset,
we have underlined our concerns that unless the new legal framework is
introduced in the context of also addressing the current and future
social care funding problems, it runs the danger of raising
expectations and demand that cannot be met, and will be ineffective and
inoperable. This view is underlined by leading stakeholders, including
Age UK and the Care and Support Alliance. Council care budgets are
being cut to the bone, with the latest figures from ADASS identifying a
further £800 million squeeze on social care budgets over the
next year. I know that the noble Earl insists, despite all the
evidence, that local authorities have sufficient funds to meet the
current demand, but this is just not
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000201">London

integrating services, implementing alternative delivery models and
making major changes to care delivery and procurement. Even with
maximum savings and before the introduction of any form of Dilnot
implementation, the Government would still need to increase
London’s adult social care budget by potentially £1.1
billion to meet increased demand. Labour supports the principle of
capping care costs, but we stress that a bigger and bolder response is
needed by the Government to meet the challenges of our ageing
population. Whole-person care is our vision for a 21st century health
and care system that brings together physical health, mental 
<?notus-xml column=298?>health and social care in a single service to meet all a person’s

looking at how health and social care services’ budgets can be
brought together so that integrated services do not mean just a series
of area or service-specific initiatives and pilots, but a way of
working for a whole service. We have a major task ahead of us to

should note that the need to ensure their well-being is particularly
underlined in the report of the Royal College of General Practitioners,

risk of depression and should be regularly screened for this to ensure
that their health needs are not neglected. We see a similar picture in
the recent survey by the Stroke Association, <I>Feeling

emotional impact of stroke on both survivors and their carers. The Bill
is an important step forward in the development of carers’
rights, their recognition and the support they need, which we strongly
support. In the coming weeks, it will be important to keep in mind just
what demands we already make on carers. Some 7 million people currently

is a delightful railway in Hampshire called the Watercress Line, which
offers trips for tourists and steam enthusiasts. The line enabled
watercress, freshly plucked from the beds in Alresford, to be
transported to the morning markets of London. It is known for its
challenging climb over the “Hampshire Alps”, which
required much of the drover, stoker and engine. Sadly, the line no
longer carries watercress and stops at Alton, long before London.
Hampshire might now be thought of as a place for tourists to ride on
steam engines that no longer connect with today’s modern world,
yet the county that used to put iron in the diet and tang in the palate
of Londoners still contributes to both the heritage and commercial life
of the nation. Today, the equivalent of the Watercress Line is the
A31-M3 corridor from Bournemouth to Basingstoke and then on into
London, connecting along the way with Southampton and Winchester. From
the sea to the city, the diocese of Winchester envelopes this corridor
with farmland, scattered villages and small market towns. The city of
Winchester claims to be the birthplace of the English nation. It is
where Alfred put iron in the soul of the Anglo-Saxons, by building a
new society based on Christian values and good administration. I
believe that this vision of a society based on Christian values and
good administration is not just heritage but has present currency. My
predecessor as Bishop of Winchester, Michael Scott-Joynt, was well
known for his values-based advocacy across a range of issues. He
remains much the same in retirement, although his activities have been
restricted by a nasty stroke, from which he is making a steady
recovery. I pass on his thanks for your prayers and best wishes. I know
that he counted it a great privilege to participate in the work of this
House, as, indeed, do
I.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051444000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051444000003">Prior to my
coming to the diocese, I served as the general secretary of the Church
Mission Society for 12 years. CMS is one of those Anglican
mission societies that not only shared the gospel and planted the
church around the world, but also laid the foundations for what we now
call international development. Many schools, colleges, hospitals and
agricultural and industrial training centres were established over its
200-year history. As I have visited these institutions across the
world, in over 25 countries, I have been amazed by the vitality of the
Christian faith and its contribution to the common good. Another former
general secretary of CMS, John Taylor, also became the Bishop of
Winchester. Like him, I come with hope and values generated by a truly
global faith. Religion is a factor that we all have to take into
account, even if we do not participate in religious communities
ourselves. Values and spirituality really matter.</hs_para>

pluralist society needs more than public rhetoric or agreed social
processes if we are, as the noble Lord, Lord Sacks, says, to
“build a home together”. It is in this endeavour that our
values become clear. We need to articulate those values if we are to
recover from an economic crisis that has challenged the basis of our

thrift of austerity needs to be matched by a determined compassion. The
Treloar School and College near Alton, for children and students with
disabilities, is like home, where many find a new social purpose. But
it is also an eye-opener to the very difficult decisions that will be
made up and down the country about the cost of caring. One way to
articulate this is in terms of a social covenant in which we recognise
each other’s humanity and our interdependence. A social covenant
suggests that co-operation as well as competition is important for
economic resilience. Our educational institutions need to prepare
students for both co-operation and competition if we are to build
societies that have social
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051444000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051444000008">Lastly,

food security and the long-term challenge of global warming. Food banks
are as much a necessity in Hampshire as elsewhere, and the growing need

first point to make is that our predicament was entirely predictable.
It has long been apparent that much of our electricity-generating
capacity would have to be renewed this decade. It has also been
apparent that this would be constrained by international agreements on
greenhouse emissions. Furthermore, it was clear that North Sea gas
would peak around the turn of the century, after which we would be
increasingly dependent on imports. There were no surprises. I have a
pile of reports, published or commissioned by DECC and others, that
must be over half a metre high. The trouble is that action arising from
these reports has been half-hearted, late or non-existent. Something
like the present Energy Bill should have been introduced in the
previous Parliament and the negotiations that are under way at present
for the replacement of nuclear power stations should have begun at
least two years ago.</hs_para>

hard to avoid the conclusion that successive Governments have simply
not taken energy policy seriously and that many decisions have been
ill-considered, or made ad hoc—in some cases as knee-jerk
responses to pressure groups, and in others on the basis of prejudice
for or against particular energy sources. In so far as it was policy to
promote renewable energy, we had a support regime that in effect could
support only wind and did nothing for waves, currents or
tides—some of the UK’s most important energy assets.
Another key element of successive Governments’ policy was carbon
capture and storage. This was the subject of a disastrously failed
competition and is years behind where it should
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000223">Although
energy market reform has been trailed for years, there is still
virtually no investment in new generating plant because investors do
not know under what market arrangements they will trade. Energy markets
and energy transmission, fossil fuel reserves and electricity
generation technologies are extremely complex. Under-informed decisions
have legacies that are generations long. In this most complex and
technical area, there have been more than 20 changes of Energy Minister
in the past 15 years. I estimate that only a handful of those had
either the time in post or the background to make a serious
contribution to policy. It seems that when some tried to, they were
overruled, moved or sacked. It is physically impossible for energy
infrastructure to change rapidly and decisions being made today will
take years to implement and will influence our energy supply for
decades. Continuity and a long view are essential.</hs_para>

hard to avoid the conclusion that at Cabinet level, in so far as any
thought was given to energy, there was a Micawberesque hope that
somehow something would turn up—but something has not turned up.
It appears that the only certain outcome is, at best, unnecessarily
high energy prices. Ministers and senior officials have seriously
lacked experience and in particular a realistic understanding of
timescales: how long it takes to negotiate agreements, obtain planning
consents, or design and build a power station. There was also a lack of
understanding of markets and experience to judge how investment could
be attracted on reasonable terms. It is against this background that we
are embarked on a fundamental reform of our energy market and we are
doing it in a rush.</hs_para>

existing arrangements have demonstrably failed. The present situation
might have been avoided if we had had some kind of high level,
non-political, expert advisory group overseeing all aspects of energy
policy with the status and authority to hold the Government to account

energy strategy committee should be established by Parliament. It would
comprise people with experience of different aspects of the energy
industry, finance and energy policy. They would serve for relatively
long terms on a board that could be chaired by a Minister. Acting
within high level policy guidance from Government, the role of the
committee would be to propose a long-term energy strategy and to advise
the relevant departments on the timescales and practicalities of
achieving it. Because of the fundamental and long-term nature of energy
investment, the energy strategy committee should report to Parliament
and the minutes of its meetings should be published.</hs_para>

be no forum in which those closely related topics are considered
together. If established by amendment of the current Energy Bill, it
could provide considerable help with the implementation of electricity
market reform, many details of which remain to be settled. It is to be
hoped that the long-term national strategic importance of energy would
attract cross-party support for such a committee. Its influence would
stem from the standing of its members and the requirement to report
annually to Parliament. Clearly, it would still be possible for
Governments to ignore the advice of the committee, but it would not be

are increasingly concerned about where their food comes from and how it
arrives on their plates. They often feel disconnected from its origins,
and scandals surrounding horsemeat, mad cow disease, bovine TB, foot
and mouth disease—I could go on—and animal welfare cause
a lot of concern. Demand still increases for the introduction of a new
food labelling system, and some research shows clearly that the

are continually reminded that the economic crisis continues and that

remarkable change in farm structure and
technology.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000233" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000233">So
what now? Our starting point follows such a difficult year that it
seems the nation will need this year to import millions of tonnes of
wheat. We are also now importing £1 billion of dairy products,
and three dairy farmers a week are still leaving the dairy industry. It
should be other way around. Globally, it is estimated that by 2020 the
world will need 70% more food to be produced, but to increase
production we need investment. I welcome the Government’s Autumn
Statement on the increase in the annual investment allowance. It would
help if we had reinvestment in the building allowance too, which would
greatly enable farmers’ further investment. Buildings for stock
housing particularly depreciate, with a limited economic lifespan
similar to that of plant and
machinery.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000234" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0001.htm#13051441000234">However,
the Government and Defra have respected the Conservative manifesto
promises in respect of several issues. The pilot TB wildlife control
measures are about to commence. We still slaughtered, this past year,
38,000 cattle in this country with TB. We have seen the abolition of
the Agricultural Wages Board and the introduction of the groceries code
adjudicator to see fair play in a competitive market. The review of the
Environment Agency and Natural England is taking place. The Macdonald
red tape review, dealing with some of the gold-plating of European
legislation, is also taking place, albeit far too slowly.</hs_para>

infrastructure is another area where farmers are well placed to capture
renewable energy flows while maintaining their traditional role as food
producers. They can contribute to domestic supply, supporting rural
diversification and jobs creation, and help with sound environmental
management and the use of waste products. Biofuels offer huge potential
for combating climate change and increasing fuel security. In growth
and development, all this calls for agriculture, and the horticultural
industry in particular, to employ 50,000 to 60,000 new
entrants over the next decade, closing the skills gap for a modern and
progressive industry that looks to the future and places an onus on the
continuous acquisition and improvement of skills.</hs_para>

not often understood or appreciated that the food and farming business
employs some 445,000 people. Many more than that are in the background,
involved in research. As a farmer, I have received a lot of requests
over many years from people saying, “My third child is not quite
as bright as the first two. Can 
<?notus-xml column=305?>you find them a job on your farm?”. My reply has always been:
“I employ only young people who have at least four
A-levels”. Defra, which serves the AgriSkills Forum, has to make
the forum the first point of call on all skills issues. We are
fortunate to have the finest agricultural colleges and training
facilities to encourage new entrants into farming. The right reverend
Prelate mentioned those earlier and one in particular. They serve not
just farming but rural interests generally. Many charitable trusts and
foundations are now also seeking young recruits. The passion is there;
the universities and colleges are full of young people who want to work
in the countryside.</hs_para>

ahead, I see other issues looming right before us. An important issue
is how the Government are going to implement the proposals for CAP
reform. It is of course essential to get a fair deal across
borders, but because of the voluntary modulation being proposed and a
poor historical allocation in the United Kingdom from the budget,
English farm payments are already well below our principal
competitors’, so there is a move towards more greening issues.
One can understand that, from an environmental point of view, greening
may be seen as a preservation tactic to justify a larger European Union
CAP budget rather than helping farming to become more competitive or to
respond to the growth that is needed.</hs_para>

the first time, the European Parliament has joint responsibility for
co-decision. When our Prime Minister has declared his determination to
renegotiate on issues that are of a concern to our country, calls for
bringing forward a referendum on our future in Europe are, to me and to
many of us, irresponsible. We need a more market-orientated European
Union, fewer regulations, less red tape and the freedom to get on with
the job that we know best how to do. If the Prime Minister does not
succeed in his efforts, so be it, but we should hold fast until we
know. One thing he should have on the agenda for decision is the seat
of the Parliament, which is something I have argued for over many
years. It costs the European taxpayer £200 million to
transport people and goods around three places, and it is estimated
that it causes 20,000 tonnes of CO<Sub>2</Sub> gas. That is food for

I want to speak about the issues affecting the creative and cultural
industries and the tourism industry, which will need to be tackled by
the DCMS, the Treasury and the Business Department if they are to
fulfil their potential in growing our economy. The recent CEBR report
for the Arts Council, mentioned in the lyrical maiden speech of the
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, on the economic impact of the arts and
culture, strongly emphasised the link between the two sectors, with 42%
of all tourism expenditure involving cultural engagement. In the case
of both sectors, it is crucial to build on the Olympic legacy. Is it
not a real tribute that Channel 4 won the BAFTA television award for
sport and live events for its coverage of last year’s Paralympic
Games<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T17:31:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051441000252">As
another aside on the Olympic legacy, rather less positive, there is
now, after a long delay, a supplier recognition scheme in place,
whereby, in general, suppliers are allowed to promote their work for
the Olympics. Yet there are still areas, nine months after the event,
not covered by the scheme. Many companies selling products such as
lighting and audio-visual equipment are not able to publicise their
involvement with London 2012. The value of the Olympic legacy for these
businesses is being completely lost, and this is
disgraceful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051441000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051441000253">Many
of us have been impressed by the post-Olympics GREAT promotional

sector for visitors. We are beginning to see real strategic
co-operation between UKTI, VisitBritain, the Arts Council and the
British Council, which is extremely welcome, but we need to do more to
co-operate in squeezing out every bit of resource. The Australian
tourism marketing budget in China, for example, is £13 million,
while ours is a mere £1 million. It is extraordinary to consider
that the impact of these two sectors—tourism and hospitality and
the creative industries—sponsored by the DCMS, taken together
and calculated by Oxford Economics and Nesta, amounts to some 20% of
our GDP, delivers more than 5 million jobs and offers the strongest

this context, I want to mention the recent speech by my right
honourable friend the Culture Secretary at the British Museum. I did
not take it as a demonstration of some kind of Gradgrind utilitarian

reduction. With perfect timing, we have had the CEBR report
commissioned by the Arts Council on the contribution of the arts and
culture, which makes it clear that, quite apart from their intrinsic
value, they are very good value for money. Public funding of the arts
can, in particular, help to diminish the economic risk of developing
new productions, which can then go onto global success. Take the

connections between the arts and creative industries. However, at the
end of the day the same old message is being delivered, as it was in
the Hargreaves report, that copyright is an impediment to innovation
and growth. Indeed, the Nesta report claims that term extension to
copyright has weakened the ability of UK business to innovate; it
equates copyright with regulation. This kind of attitude is spilling
over into dealings with the EU. During a recent trip to Brussels,
members of the All-Party Parliamentary Intellectual Property Group were
greatly concerned by the apparent stance of the UK Government in
appearing to support those in the Commission, notably DG Connect, which
wishes to weaken copyright protection by the introduction of yet
further exceptions beyond those contained in the current directive on
copyright in the information society, such as over user-generated
content. This is extraordinary, given the importance to our economy of
the creative industries. It was a delight, therefore, to see the recent

promised for carers in the future. However, I hope that this Bill will 
<?notus-xml column=311?>be strengthened following Second Reading. My Act is one of only three
Acts for carers ever to be introduced in the UK. All three were the

for the coming Care Bill, although I welcome any move in the direction
of assisting carers, I also endorse the fears which my noble friend

being available if the Government’s record to date on giving our

Bispham, near Blackpool, some three weeks ago. I was ably assisted by
Paul Maynard, Conservative MP for Blackpool North. It was so heartening
to see so many youngsters—some 100 or more—dressed in
their football attire, wishing that the speeches would end so that they
could expend their energies in a constructive and sensible way, putting
aside their video and computer games and the like. The facility that
was opened contained superb dressing rooms, showers and canteen

facilities but the job is so colossal that its funding can reach only a
very small percentage of the tens of thousands of pitches across the

top of that research, I would also like to highlight the findings of
Nuffield Health’s new report, <I>12 </I><I>M</I><I>inutes

accrue to the National Health Service, to the Government and to
individuals when the population increases its levels of physical
activity. The research highlights that the average person does well
below the recommended level of exercise, exercising on only four days
per month. However, if the average person did just 12
minutes more physical activity per day then they would reach the target
level of 150 minutes of moderate exercise per week. The report goes on
to spell out the health benefits for individuals of doing these
exercises. Those benefits include a 6% lower risk of developing mental
health problems; 6% lower cholesterol levels; a 4% lower
risk of high blood pressure; a 7% lower likelihood of being obese; and
cutting the risk of developing lifestyle-related diseases such as type
2 diabetes and CVD. Nuffield Health argues that if the obese were to
get active, it could immediately save the National Health Service
£360 million as well as avoid £6.3 billion in
further NHS costs, in welfare payments and in loss of

some of these problems. Perhaps, in the end, innovation will be the

DWP were merged with the Department of Health—a bit like the old
DHSS but with the pension element hived off to employment. We look
across the board at all sorts of ideas. Obviously, the DCLG would have
to be involved because of local authority care-funding
responsibilities. I believe that the current cross-departmental
arrangements for the oversight of care funding and provision are one of
the main reasons for the lack of joined-up thinking that we see all the
time. It seems impossible to bridge these divides, so why not move some
of them together and see if that works better? It is only by people

the setting-up of a royal charter and the Leveson proposals. I agree
with the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, earlier and his
criticism of how long the process has taken and the opposition of the
press to any form of change. This was reflected in an excellent speech
by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on the first day of the debate on the
Queen’s Speech. Both noble Lords expressed the view that the
media were not prepared to co-operate in the way they believed the
media should. There has now been such a long

a privy counsellor, I confess that I think that the role of the royal
charter and of privy counsellors is at the heart of what we have to
discuss today. There seems to be a general belief that somehow the
Privy Council and the royal charter should not be involved in political
controversy: that whatever they recommend to the Crown, the Crown will
accept. However, that will not be the proposal now as we have two royal
charters. Decisions have to be taken, and they have to be taken by the
Privy

am not sure how this practice will work. I do not suppose that I will
be one of the selected few sent to discuss the whole business of press
regulation with the Queen. I presume the Cabinet will appoint the
people who will sit on the Privy Council. That happened under the
previous Administration; it is the normal process. However, it raises
the very interesting point about whether they have a political view in
making a decision on the different royal charters before
us—another issue that I shall

very much increased by the virulent opposition, referred to in earlier
speeches, of the press. They do not accept that others can have a
different view. They use the power of the media to attack anyone who
holds a different view from them. That is totally unacceptable, quite
apart from the 
<?notus-xml column=315?>other activities for which over 100 journalists have been arrested, the
top press management being accused of conspiracy and all sorts of
crimes and illegal acts. Let the courts decide how they will deal with
that, but this does not sound to me like a press that has been reformed
by their experience. They somehow do not believe that there needs to be
any change. Indeed, the press’s royal charter is exactly what
they want: to remain as they are. What they object to, quite clearly,
is any statutory

am a bit curious about that. Since I have been in this House—and
it has only been a short time—I have seen the press coming here
asking for statutory privileges to protect them from damages and
against legal aid. They require the law for that, and we have gone
along with them, as much as we might have disagreed. They are therefore
not necessarily against statutory frameworks in principle. Indeed, it
is curious to note that they co-operated in Ireland where they own
papers and where there is government control in a way: a Minister who
decides who is on the regulatory body for press freedom. The press have
signed up for that. How can they believe that it is all right in
Ireland but not over here? They are the same papers, with the editors
taking the decisions. All this business about them not accepting a
statutory framework is

strengthens the press’s position because they want their damages
reduced. They do not like having to pay a lot of money for offences
that have been committed. We have made it better for them. We have made
legal aid better for them, so that people cannot easily get legal aid
to seek justice in the courts. All these things we have done for our
media. They are not against a statutory framework; they do not like the
idea of a statutory framework which they think would disadvantage them.
They want to be able to judge what is in the public interest and what
is right. Indeed, they even challenge the judges when they make a
judgment on human rights. They say that it is the job of the editors to
make decisions about public interest. I am bound to say that the record
does not show that they are very fair about that.</hs_para>

actually brought in a statutory framework, so for all the talk about
there not being a statutory framework, we can say that we have one

am no fan of royal charters. Frankly, you cannot, as a
democrat—I say that sitting in this place, but let me leave that

bypasses Parliament. However, another change that we have now made,
which I welcome, is that if there is to be any change to a future royal
charter, the agreement of two-thirds of this House and the other place
is needed. That means that more 
<?notus-xml column=316?>political accountability has now been put on the royal charters. It is
not privy counsellors getting together, having a little chat, passing a
note to the Queen and then saying, “That’s the

that there are two different concepts, two different royal charters,
someone has to make a decision. Does anyone believe that that will not
be politically controversial? There is the charter produced by the
press, which is clearly different, certainly as regards a statutory
framework, from the other one produced by this Parliament.
This Parliament has decided overwhelmingly that it wants a statutory
underpinning. It does not like to say that it is statutory because that
is like forcing something on the press. However, if you leave the
language aside, we have indeed established a statutory

when the council meets, it will consider which charter it wants to

that whoever the privy counsellors are they will include members of the
Government. Even the Secretary of State for Culture must be involved in
that process. Is that Secretary of State likely to vote for the press
charter? I hope not, but if that happened that would be defying what
Parliament had agreed, would it not? Why would the council judge the
press one first? Because the press nipped in quickly and got that
position. Now the council has to make a decision. That will be
political, whatever we say about it. Even if you ignore the press
charter, will the press believe that you have been fair? Will
Parliament’s charter be accepted? Even if the Queen had to
decide on these matters, and one does not want to put her in that
position, would she then say, “I do not support the

conclusion, my concern is the actions of the press themselves. They are
still showing their bitter opposition. Remember that their proposal
does not come from a majority. Not all the papers have agreed to it.
Only the very people who have committed all the offences have got
together and do not want to be stopped. They want to keep things in
their present form. What are they doing? They are already threatening
that if their charter is not accepted, they will continue to oppose the
other charter. That would be politically controversial. They also
propose to take the matter to a judicial inquiry. They are, as I

Billingham:</Member></B> My Lords, last year at this time we waited
with great anticipation the start of the London Olympic and Paralympic
Games. There was so much promise and the Games exceeded the
nation’s wildest dreams. They were a triumph. Now, some 8 months
after the Games, the gracious Speech has absolutely no mention of sport
and how the pledge to create a new generation of sports men and women
is to be achieved. It is a huge lost opportunity for the Government to
build on past achievements and echo the nation’s call for a
better sporting Britain. It demands fairer sport for everyone,
irrespective of ability and of every background. And I mean everyone,
not just the favoured few of the 6% who attend independent schools but
the 94% of our children who are in state
schools<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T18:25:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051454000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051454000002">The
discrepancy between state and independent schools in sport is
absolutely disgraceful. No wonder the majority of medal winners at the
Olympics were privately educated people. In all fairness, the two most
distinguished Olympians on the coalition Benches in this House have
been outstanding critics of the Government’s failure to put
grassroots sport into primary schools. If the noble Lords, Lord Coe and
Lord Moynihan, cannot persuade the Secretary of State for Education,
Michael Gove, to change course, it is clear that proper change will not

what prospect is there of the promised sporting legacy? I have looked
back over the past two years to see whether there are any glimpses of
hope but, sadly, there are none. It has been a story of destruction and
failure to build on the improvements built by the previous Government.
We were genuinely making ground, as opposed to this Government which
are losing ground. The facts are stark. The number of people aged 16
and over active in sport has gone down for the first time since we won
the bid in 2005, if we can remember that time. Michael Gove has
singlehandedly wrecked state school sport, demolishing school sport
partnerships which proved so successful in bringing qualified staff
into schools as well as acting as a bridge between schools and clubs
and community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T18:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Government removed the crucial protection of ring-fenced funding
for physical education in state schools, only partially reinstating it

new formula for school sport was announced. Competitive sport was to be
the panacea. Where on earth have these people been? For some it might
be good and acceptable but for others it is the ultimate turnoff: 45%

said that sport was too 
<?notus-xml column=323?>competitive for them and that they preferred individual disciplines,
which perhaps I may say provided vigorous exercise such as dance,
gymnastics and

ability to play sport has been reduced. Formerly, the minimum
requirement for playing-field space was set according to the number of
pupils in the school. Now the requirement is for schools to provide
“adequate sport space”, whatever that might be deemed to

new sporting nation, they are ignoring, as others have said today, all
the health benefits that sport can provide, especially at the
grassroots level. Good practice when learnt young can carry on
throughout life and, as has already been said, obesity continues
unchallenged in our schools. More savage cuts to sport came through the
decision to end swimming for the under-16s and for the over-60s. At the
same time, the Government cut crucial funding to national sporting
bodies such as Sport England and UK Sport, which have had a 33% and 28%

times of social hardship and economic uncertainty there are two common
political reactions. The first is retrenchment, a harkening back to a
previous golden age when things were much more certain. Quite often it
involves the scapegoating of minorities and different people. It is a
populist strategy but very divisive. The second reaction, which is much
more difficult, is to maintain an inclusive world view and to use it to
build social cohesion and find new solutions to problems. It is much
more difficult but it is what responsible politicians should

to the Care Bill, I listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord

near to building a consensus around what we think should be the future
architecture for social care in this country. We now have a Bill that
addresses problems that have been outstanding and addressed in every
debate on the Queen’s Speech in which I have taken part in this
place since 1999. I agree with him that the questions of eligibility
and resources are critical. We will never have enough resources to
address all the needs that there are but we can, by using this Bill,
move a long way towards removing a number of the structural problems
that have bedevilled the integration of health and social care for all
our lifetimes. It is important that we do that in future to provide
services of an acceptable quality and to cut down on some of the
inefficiencies, which we know are costly. We must have a social care
system that can integrate more easily with health and housing. I hope
that the noble Lord and the Opposition will stay with the process of
seeing the Care Bill through—at least until the point when we
debate eligibility, which I understand is due to be in late June. I

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, there is much to welcome in
the Queen’s Speech. I particularly look forward to the advent of
the Children and Families Bill. I welcome the attention that the
Government have been paying to adoption and I hope that we may be able
to encourage them to offer still more support to adoptive families and
provide further support for young people leaving care as the Bill makes
its journey through your Lordships’ House towards the statute
book. I share with the noble Baroness, Lady Jolly, her concern that
there is no legislation or regulation for the minimum pricing of
alcohol or for blank packaging on cigarettes. I am concerned in
particular that many of the children who are taken into care come from
backgrounds where alcohol misuse was a contributing factor to family
dysfunction. It would be helpful if alcohol was less available to young
people so that they would be less likely to start the bad habits which
persist when they start their
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051459000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051459000002">I do
not wish to tire the patience of your Lordships so I will concentrate
on one issue that is of deep concern to some in this House, and which
was mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, in his
remarks. My time will be spent considering the Government’s
proposal to introduce the opportunity for early years providers and
childminders to increase the ratio of children to carers where the
carers can demonstrate improved qualifications. I begin by applauding
the Government’s attention to this important policy area. I am
particularly pleased that they have chosen to maintain important
requirements with regard to the supervision of early years staff and
that they 
<?notus-xml column=327?>have welcomed the report of the Nutbrown review, with its call for
higher qualifications for early years staff. The Government have stated
that their first priority is better quality childcare; the Education
Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Nash, repeated that last week in this
House. The Government have also been seeking to make this better
quality childcare more affordable for
parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051459000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051459000003">I
hope that I may also pay tribute to the last Government’s
attention to childcare. They introduced the first Childcare Act,
placing a duty on local authorities to provide a sufficiency of
childcare. They invested significantly in developing the workforce,
introducing career development pathways and early years professional
status. International assessment of the UK’s progress has been
very favourable, and there is an encouraging sense of political
consensus and commitment to getting this policy right. One of our main
aims is to improve outcomes for children. High quality early years care
has been clearly demonstrated by the EPPE research project to improve
children’s outcomes. Indeed, I have heard the noble Baroness,
Lady Walmsley, speak about this many times. I was very struck by a
presentation I attended three years ago by Professor Melhuish of the
University of London. The research he produced found that children with
a good early years experience would tend to continue to do well in
their education at the age of 11 whether they attended a good or an
indifferent primary school. Good early experience is a protective
factor against poor later educational experience.</hs_para>

Iain Duncan Smith MP and the honourable Graham Allen MP have both
highlighted that it is the early years when we can break the cycle of
disadvantage and put children on a better path because, at that point,
their brains are highly malleable. They and the noble Earl, Lord Howe,
have referred in the past to the importance of new findings in
neurobiology where brain scans can show us how the infant brain is
sculpted by the loving relationships around him. At the same time, we
have been warned about the impact of prolonged exposure to poor quality
early years care by Professor Jay Belsky. He presents the other side of
the coin: the harm caused by poor quality care, harm which increases
the younger a child is exposed to it and the greater time over which
the child is exposed.</hs_para>

raise my concerns about the Government’s proposals, and I
preface them with some comments on current practice in baby rooms. It
is essential that babies feel that their carers are attuned to them,
that they feel their carers are keeping them in mind, and that they
know their wants will be met. Regulations recognise this and each baby
is required to have one or two carers as their key person in the
nursery. However, there are challenges to doing this even as things
stand. Carers may be working shifts, as may the parents themselves.
There may be a high staff turnover. The job is also extremely demanding
and the workforce is mostly made up of very young and inexperienced
women. In this context, I am very troubled by the Government’s
proposal to allow early years providers the choice to increase the
number of babies cared for by each carer from three to one to four to
one. The Government seek to reassure us by saying that better
qualifications will be a prerequisite for 
<?notus-xml column=328?>increased ratios. It is a matter of regret that the Government chose
only to consult on what the qualifications requirement might be rather
than if indeed the ratios should be changed. It seems clear to me that
the important prerequisite for good-enough baby care is the number of
staff. As my mother used to say to the four of us when we were
children, she was not an octopus. Staff have only so many arms and
eyes, and the overwhelming academic consensus is that, with babies, one
needs first a sufficiency of carers. Here I shall quote a literature
review from the Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand
entitled, <I>Quality early childhood education for under two year-olds:
What should it look like?</I>. It states that,</hs_para>

strongest and most consistent predictor of observed positive caregiving
in group-based early childhood settings was the adult:child ratio ...
caregivers provided more sensitive, frequent and positive care when
they were responsible for fewer children ... the optimum ratio for

stated as 1:3”.</hs_quotefo>

reassure us further by looking to France, Germany and Scandinavia. I
agree that we should look at best practice from our neighbours but we
should, I suggest, do so critically and avoid picking up some of their
worst habits. France, for instance, has ratios for babies of five to
one. However, according to “The Predicament of Childcare Policy

also uncertain that a change in ratios will produce savings for
parents. In a recent editorial, <I>Nursery World</I> drew attention to

will not be harmful if it is balanced with a raising of qualifications?

three aspects of the Queen’s Speech, and start by focusing on
energy. I have noticed, having taken part in a vast number of debates
on Queen’s Speeches over the years, a depressing aspect of this
one. Scientists have recently pointed out that we might well have
passed 400 parts per million of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, but
this seems to have been completely neglected in many of the speeches
about energy. Carbon was a very important issue on all sides of the
House, especially for the introduction of the Climate Change Act 2008,

absolutely dumbfounded that politicians fail to understand that we will
not have enough power generation to meet our needs in peak demand in a

and 2017, 80% said 2015. That is not so good if you live in Reading or
Oldham, as those are the places on the grid that are about to drop off
first. Blackouts will not hit universally but they will be quite
widespread. We have a major issue, the very simple reason being that

gas or renewable

was asked recently why we have not been building power stations. The
answer is very simple: for nuclear power stations, which the noble
Lord, Lord Jenkin, has been pushing for, we are talking about a 50-year
planning cycle. You have to get the money, plan it, build it and then
decommission it after its run cycle. That could be longer than 50
years. That has to be put to a Parliament that now has a maximum period
of five years. The politicians then have to explain their decision to
the press, who are running on a 24-hour news cycle, and to an
electorate who are worrying about last month’s bills, not where

and on the distribution grid. To put it in context, a recent report
talked about £100 billion being needed. The figures came out
anywhere between £100 billion and £800 billion
to renew the whole grid, depending on whether you take down all the
power cable lines, but they are many years old and we are going to have
to eventually. The average figure that the experts came to was about
£360 billion. If we were to do that over the next
10 years, to get the grid up to where we believe it should
be would mean £36 billion a year, which is

report on the fact that we have problems and that energy prices are
going to go up has nothing to do with environmental costs. Indeed, one
of the great myths going around at the moment is that Europe is
responsible for us shutting down our power stations. Yes, the emissions
objectives are going to bring that forward but the trouble is that most
of the power stations are 30 to 40 years old. They are steam-driven
power stations with thousands of miles of steam pipes. They have a
run-time cycle: after 30 or 40 years you do not have a power station,
you have what one engineer described to me as a colander. They are just
not efficient enough to run and will have to be scrapped. We are
looking at losing about a fifth of our power-generating capacity. This
is a problem because we might then have to move. None of the
generators, after the experience they have had, will actually build a
coal-fired power station, so we will have to go to
gas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T18:57:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000007">We
should be careful about another myth, which is that we can get rid of
gas from the system. Eight out of 10 homes are on gas and I cannot see
many people wanting to change their boiler. The big problem is that we
are now going to generate the majority of our power through gas-fired
power stations. A gas-fired power station loses about 70% of the fuel
up the chimney, just to get you the electricity. We talk about
decarbonising the grid by going for electricity when we are actually
losing most of the energy in the generation at that point. We should
not go down the road of saying there is a silver

there are not really many silver bullets in energy generation. We are
going to have to build nuclear power stations. I know there are some in
this Chamber who will be surprised to see me promoting nuclear after
the many years I spent fighting it. When I was energy spokesman for the
Liberal Democrats I was asked whether I would take part in some debates
on nuclear because they had to have somebody who was going to be
against it. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, remembers those debates. My
problem with nuclear is that it is not going to provide cheap
electricity and is not going to come on until the 2030s
anyway—it is not a short-term solution. We have major problems
with our energy infrastructure, and politicians have to realise that it
is going to be a lottery. Whoever is in power when the first blackouts

problem that is linked to that. We have problems with power generation,
but we also have a massive problem with the water industry. The water

sorry, but I find the idea of competition in water incredible. The
noble Lord, Lord Freud, said that we are going to sell water and that
you will be able to pick your water up from anywhere. Yes, I can go to
Newcastle, to Kielder Water or Catcleugh reservoir—I have a
private water supply as a damned great pipe runs through my land,
although I cannot actually get any of the water out of it—get a

be the consumers who pay for this. Yet we have a regulator
that fired all its sustainability officers and employed more economists
to talk about the cost now. It makes no sense. In
the White Paper the Government said that they were minded to consider
making sustainability a primary rather than secondary objective for

Parliament announce earlier this month a campaign to support what it
called preparation for life. It is after all made up of people
experiencing education. It said that the focus of the proposed change
in education is mainly within academic subjects—the curriculum
again—at the expense of other skills essential for life. The
Youth Parliament asserts that young people need to know about
communities, politics, finance, sex and relationships, and cultural
diversity and that it is not enough to expect parents to provide this
knowledge; it must be taught in schools. I agree with
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000038">These
skills need not be curriculum subjects in their own right, but they
must be offered in school policies and the school ethos: in assemblies,
in relationships within and outside the school and across subjects in
the school. Such skills must be incorporated into certain subjects.
They may also be offered by specialists—not necessarily
teachers—in the school, as sessions in 
<?notus-xml column=336?>the timetable. They may include issues such as volunteering, local and
national politics, how the police and other services work, and so on.
Information must of course be appropriate to the age of the child and
must not be one-off. Just one assembly on drugs is certainly not
enough, for example. The different phases of growing up demand
different content and approaches. It is interesting that the soft
skills, as they are called, are also appreciated by the CBI and
employers, who want their workface to be able to act in teams and be
good communicators—a long way away from a rigid
curriculum.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000039">A

said at the beginning that I would make a plea for a government

young people—for example, health and education; it might include
guarantees of the availability of sport and leisure, including the
arts; it might flag up the rights and responsibilities of young people
as citizens; and it might encourage engagement in the political
process. I maintain that young people are special and that too often
they are demonised when we all know of wonderful, kind, positive young
people. They should be given a prominent voice in decisions about their
own welfare. They clearly can and want to be involved. Perhaps the
Government can take a lead in engaging young people in developing such
a strategy. Perhaps then education and involvement in the institutions

Stoneham of Droxford:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak about those
aspects of the gracious Speech that support people saving for
retirement and the important ongoing reform of state pension provision.
Obviously, the focus of the coalition is to get the British economy
back on an even keel, but we should not forget the important social
reforms that it has undertaken, and those in the pension field are, in
my view,
outstanding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000043">Most
of the pension objectives set out in the coalition agreement have been
implemented: the triple lock for state pension enhancements; the review
of the sustainability of public service pensions, which has largely
been agreed; the raising of the state pension retirement age and the
phasing out of the default retirement age; and the launch of
auto-enrolment. Most of these policies were derived from the
implementation of the pensions commission’s recommendations,
initiated by the previous Government. The gracious Speech brings
forward further reforms: a new single-tier state pension to simplify
and create a fairer system designed to encourage more retirement
saving; the increase of the pension age to 67 in 2026-28 and
the formalisation of a permanent system for reviewing the retirement
age in future; the reform of bereavement benefits; and the automatic
transfer of smaller pension
pots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000044">These
are important reforms and they have benefited from the continuity and
determination of our work and pensions ministerial team: Iain Duncan
Smith, my noble friend Lord Freud and Steve Webb. It must be
significant that they have been together for three years. They have
apparently resisted efforts to break them up and are now getting into
their stride, concentrating not just on getting legislation through but
tackling the central importance of delivery on pensions and welfare
generally in the second half of the coalition Government. I have been
reading Jack Straw’s autobiography; I always like to understand
how admirers of Liberal Democrats work and think. One of the examples
he gives of not-so-good government is that the previous Government, in
one nine-year period, had nine Secretaries of State for Work and
Pensions. The coalition has learnt that lesson in the interests of
better government, just as the Liberal Democrats have learnt the
importance of discipline in
coalition.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000045">I
agreed with every word that the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, said on
the single-tier state pension and social care. Fixing the single-tier
state pension at the level for means-tested benefits will greatly
simplify pension provision and end a system whereby 46% of pensioners
currently rely on means-tested benefits while 33% of those entitled to
claim do not do so. It also recognises the huge problem we have with
pension saving and the incentives to save. In 2011, 30% of 35 to 64
year-olds made no pension provision. Activists in pension schemes fell
from 12 million in 1967 to 8.2 million in 2011. It is
therefore essential that the new single-tier pension will complement
the auto-enrolment reform that is being phased
in.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000046">There will

was less in agreement with the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, on her view

33% of children born in 2012 are expected to live to 100. By all
predictions, at least 95,000 of those reaching 65 this year will
celebrate their 100th birthday in 2048. Longevity and active living are
increasing. I agree with the noble Baroness that, in making decisions
on raising the state pension age, we should consider the quality of
retirement as well as its length, and also the social inequalities that
arise in retirement. We need a formal process to arrive at consensus
about what is the right and appropriate state pension age. I believe
that that is what the Government are seeking to

important that pension reform must lead us to encourage the easy

paramount need to maintain consumer confidence in investors and saving

Drake:</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to follow the noble Lord,
Lord Stoneham, and to comment on the Government’s commitment to
people who save for retirement and to create a single-tier pension.
People save for their retirement through the compulsory national
insurance system, through auto-enrolment into workplace pensions and
through an active decision voluntarily to save more than is delivered
by auto-enrolment. Achieving a sustainable and fair pension system that
delivers desirable outcomes for people requires a holistic approach
across both the state and the private pension
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000051">The
Government’s single-tier pension reforms are evolutionary, in
that they continue at a faster rate than reforms commenced by the
previous Labour Government in 2010. They will certainly deliver a
higher state pension sooner for many women and carers and those on
lower incomes. That is surely to be
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T19:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000052">The
state pension will always form a greater part of the retirement income
of carers, who, as a consequence of their caring responsibilities, will
spend longer periods out of the labour market or participate for fewer
hours. It is regrettable, therefore, that the Government 
<?notus-xml column=339?>continue to exclude an ever-growing number of part-time working women
from the benefits of auto-enrolment into a private pension.</hs_para>

are very long-term, and it is important that there is a consensus
across the political spectrum about the long-term intention for pension
policy. Otherwise, we will simply revert to the mistakes of the past,
when successive Governments over decades took incremental decisions
which contributed to an increasing dependency on means-tested benefits
and to the huge decline in private pension savings, which can be seen
from the early 1980s.</hs_para>

single-tier pension will mean winners and losers, as changes normally
do. It will be important when we consider the Bill fully to understand
those trade-offs and whether, for the losers, the loss is fair and
proportionate. The introduction of the single-tier pension is intended
to strengthen the firm foundation for private pension savings and
reduce reliance on means-tested benefits. Both are desirable, but a
single-tier pension does not of itself achieve those intentions, as was
acknowledged by the Government in their report, <I>The Single Tier
Pension: </I><I>A</I><I> Simple </I><I>Foundation for Savings</I>,
which states that the starting level and uprating for the single-tier
pension will have significant implications for what can be asserted
about gainers and losers. The state pension must hold its value against
earnings over the long term if ordinary people are to have a realistic
prospect of achieving a reasonable replacement income in
retirement.</hs_para>

socioeconomic differences in morbidity and mortality. Those are matters
of considerable significance when setting public policy. As

to private pensions, there are some most welcome actions proposed by
the Government, such as banning consultancy charges for auto-enrolment
schemes, tackling charges generally and the abolition of short service
refunds. With auto-enrolment, pension policy cannot rely on caveat
emptor. Auto-enrolment is predicated on the behavioural insight that,
for many people, improved information will not overcome the inertia
that prevents their actively choosing to save for a pension.
Furthermore, the pension chosen for auto-enrolment is a decision made
by the employer, not the worker. A consequence of using inertia to
raise pension saving levels—that is to say, not relying on
people actively to choose to save—is that ordinary savers will
have even less power and influence over the operation of that market.
Therefore, it is welcome to see the Government indicating a greater
willingness to set minimum
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000057">There
are many regulators in the private pension space—the FCA, the
OFT, the TPR and the DWP—and the Government may not want to
change the organisational architecture, but the need for enhanced 
<?notus-xml column=340?>co-operation between them is essential. The FSA’s proposals to
allow employers to negotiate consultancy charges with their advisers
and for those to be deducted from their employees’ pension costs
were clearly not in savers’ interests and did not sit well with
the messages coming from the pensions regulator. In workplace pensions
offered by insurance companies, there remain significant governance
challenges. No single regulator or government department has
responsibility for ensuring that contract-based schemes provide value
for money and a high standard of governance. Too much reliance on
disclosure of information will not produce those. The majority of
savers will struggle to process and act on the information provided,
and the overwhelming majority will not make active decisions but end up
in the default

defined benefit pension provision in the private sector is, for the
most part, in managed decline. The new duty on the pensions regulator
to minimise any adverse impact on the sustainable growth of an employer
raises concerns. The setting of prudent discount rates, for example,
remains a key battleground—I make no apology for using that
phrase—between trustees and employers. Trustees have to give
proper consideration when setting deficit recovery plans. There is real
tension between the very long-term funding requirements of a defined
benefit pension scheme, the importance of the employer covenant being
good for the funding of that scheme for decades to come, and the
five-year horizon that many companies work to when making corporate
decisions. The cases of Nortel and Lehman Brothers, going through the

gracious Speech looks forward to further development of the
Government’s policy on education. During the past year, major
changes have been made to education policy and much more emphasis has
rightly been placed on the basic skills of reading, writing and
numeracy. Perhaps more importantly, a new and much more prescriptive
national curriculum has now been introduced and will effectively be
mandatory in all maintained schools. However, for all other subjects
and for all extra-curricular activities in a school, it will be up to
the school, its head and the governing body to decide the
school’s priorities.</hs_para>

who I greatly admire, is rightly searching for greater rigour in
teaching the basic skills of reading, writing and numeracy. This makes
absolute sense. I can also see that there is a case for a new and
compulsory national curriculum but I fear that the Government’s
proposals for it may give rise to some unintended and undesirable
consequences. My first concern is that there is a real danger that in
some schools the compulsory and more demanding new curriculum may crowd
out other facets of education. My second is about the possible effect
of a more demanding curriculum on the self-esteem and self-confidence
of less academically talented children.</hs_para>

each school’s resources are finite in terms of both finance and
well qualified staff. Each maintained school has the same per capita
payment for every pupil on its roll, plus a further payment for every
child from a disadvantaged background. This additional payment has, I
am happy to say, recently been raised from £400 to £600 a
year. However, there is a real danger that schools will decide that
they have no option but to spend what it takes to deliver the new
national curriculum—and then, if there is not much left, that is
just too bad. I am particularly concerned that this may happen in
schools with a high proportion of children from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Inevitably, some of those children—perhaps
many—will take far longer to learn the new compulsory national
curriculum than children from more supportive families. I very much
doubt whether the £600 bonus per child for disadvantaged
children will be anything like enough to cover the extra cost of
bringing children from a disadvantaged background up to speed on the
proposed new academic curriculum, let alone leaving much over for all
the other important subjects about which the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey, spoke: drama, sport, the PSHE curriculum, citizenship and
personal and social
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000064">My
second concern relates to self-confidence. One of the most important
roles of schooling, particularly in a society where so many families
are dysfunctional, is to build each child’s sense of self-worth.
In a report three years ago, Ofsted looked at two groups of schools
that it had rated “outstanding” in spite of being located
in very disadvantaged communities. Importantly, Ofsted, which was
looking for what was common to all those schools, found that among them
a brilliant headmaster was important, as were dedicated staff, but what
particularly interested me was that in each of those schools, every
child believed that they could succeed. Self-confidence is an essential
building block for a child’s success, in school and in life. I
fear that the national curriculum may be a disaster for some children,

Touhig:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to confine my remarks to social
care support, particularly for people with autism. A commission on
autism and ageing on which I served, and which was chaired by the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross, was told that most people with autism in
this country are adults and that most are undiagnosed. Autism was
identified in the 1940s and the first generation to be diagnosed is
therefore 
<?notus-xml column=342?>now moving into old age. As a consequence, very little is known about
the impact of autism on ageing, and vice versa, but we know that autism
is not rare. It is estimated that 1% of the population have an autism
spectrum disorder, while some 70% of those diagnosed are not receiving
the help that they need from social
services.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000066">Far
too many adults with autism are still waiting for the everyday support
that they need, so the purpose of the commission of the noble Baroness,
Lady Greengross, is to build on the work of the National Autistic
Society and advise on the policy changes required to ensure that people
with autism can access the right support as they get older and that
they have equal access to older people’s services. Here, I
should declare an interest as a vice-president of the National Autistic
Society.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000067">The
society’s research shows that local authorities often do not
identify adults with autism living in their area and do not plan and
commission services to meet their needs. As a result, many fall into
the gap between mental health services and learning disability
services. Too often, people with autism find that they do not fit into
existing structures. I am reminded that, in my 20 years as a
councillor, too often when I took up a case on behalf of a constituent
I would be told by an official, “Sorry, councillor, he/she falls
through the net”. But who created the net? Well, we
did—councillors, parliamentarians and the Government. We created
the net that so many people fall
through.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000068">This
year, however, there are two major opportunities to begin to change
this. First, the Government are reviewing the adult autism strategy.
This is a chance to assess progress on implementing the strategy so far
and to identify and remove barriers preventing the much needed
transformation of services to support adults with autism. Secondly, in
the Queen’s Speech we have the Care Bill, which promises a
fairer system for adults with disabilities. It is a good start, but it,
too, can be improved. This Care Bill is important, as it relates to
social care laws for adults and will provide the framework for adult
care and support services in the future. I hope that the Bill will
ensure that the duties covered by the statutory guidance in the Autism
Act continue to apply to local authorities and the National Health
Service.</hs_para>

longer be a service of last resort. Under the current system, too many
people become eligible for support only when their needs become acute
and they require intensive, high-level care and crisis management.
Research by the National Autistic Society shows that only 10% of people
with autism receive social skills training, yet 55% would like to
receive it; that only 10% of people with autism receive employment
support, but 53% would like to receive it; and that just 17% of people
with autism have access to a social group, yet 42% would like to. Many
adults with autism would benefit greatly from low-level services such
as befriending or social skills training, which would help them to
avoid isolation and allow them to participate in society. A lack of
access to these services can have a devastating impact. A third of
adults with autism who responded to a 
<?notus-xml column=343?>National Autistic Society survey said that they had developed serious
mental health problems as a result of lack of
support.</hs_para>

adults with autism are not eligible for support under the current
system, leaving their needs unmet. The National Autistic Society, as a
local service provider, knows that community care assessments can vary
depending on where you live and on who assesses you. I therefore
welcome the Government’s proposal to introduce national minimum
eligibility criteria so that people will be assessed on the same set of
criteria across the country. However, in order for the new system to be
fair for people with autism, the Government must ensure that social and
communication needs are given equal weight to physical needs in the
eligibility assessment. The new eligibility threshold must be
equivalent to moderate needs under the current system. This is
essential if the Government are to succeed in their stated aim to
prevent or delay care needs developing and to support people when they
need care. Better we do that than intervene only at crisis
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000072">The
National Autistic Society, Scope, Mencap, Leonard Cheshire Disability
and Sense have produced a joint report, supported by economic modelling
by Deloitte, which shows the cost savings that can be made by investing
in support for people with moderate needs. Many people with autism can
make a valuable contribution to the workplace, but they must be
supported to do so. This can mean full-time or part-time employment,
supported employment, internships or work experience. At present, far
too many people with autism are missing out on the opportunity to
fulfil their ambition and potential, while society is missing out on
their talents. Just 15% of people with autism are in full-time
employment. Furthermore, 26% of graduates with autism are unemployed,
which is by far the highest rate of any disability group. As many as
79% of people with autism on unemployment benefits say that they want
to work but need support to retain full-time
employment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000073">We
cannot change these things overnight, but the figures that I have given

ways in which people with autism can enter and remain in employment. I
hope that the Government will be open to working with noble Lords on

also hope that the Government are open to helping to make it a better

Colwyn:</Member></B> My Lords, among the many briefs that I received
before and after the gracious Speech, there is one from the BMA
indicating its initial response to a number of proposals in the
Queen’s Speech that impact on health and healthcare. While
welcoming the Care Bill, which has been promised for some time, I am
not sure whether the House would have tolerated any more healthcare
legislation. However, I am aware of the recent statements in the
popular press claiming that soaring charges have caused a fifth of
people to give up going to their dentist, that as many as 500,000
patients have been wrongly told they must pay privately for treatment,
and that the surge in the sales of dental kits in pharmacies is risking
200,000 DIY dentists harming themselves. I do not recognise these
problems, but they must be addressed. I hope that your Lordships will
allow some brief comments about the current general dental services,
which provide free treatment for all children and nearly one-third of
adult patients and have enabled 1.25 million more people to see an NHS
dentist than in May
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000076">Having
worked as a dental surgeon for more than 40 years, and declaring that
interest, I welcome the progress that the Government have made in
piloting a new NHS dental contract in line with the undertaking that
was given in the coalition agreement. September 2011 saw the beginning
of piloting of a new contract, based on registration, capitation and
quality, with a focus on the quality of clinical outcomes and on
promoting a preventive approach to oral health. Seventy practices were
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000077">Building
on this work, the Government recently embarked on a further stage of
piloting, involving a larger number of dental practices. There are now
98 practices taking part, testing how the different elements
of a proposed contract can work together most effectively to deliver
the Department of Health’s goals of improved access to dental
services and improved oral health. So far, the feedback from staff and
patients taking part in the pilots has been largely positive, and I
hope that it will not be too much longer before the department is in a
position to begin discussions with the profession on the details of the
new contact. I commend the Government for taking the time to get these
reforms
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000078">These
reforms have transformed the commissioning of dental services. Although
dentists have been largely supportive of the shift to central
commissioning by NHS England, there are concerns that the transition to
the new structures has not gone as smoothly as it might. Dentists do
not know who to engage with in the 27 NHS England area teams and the
teams have yet to develop a consistent approach for working with local
dental committees, which are a valuable source 
<?notus-xml column=345?>of up-to-date local information. Additionally, there is concern that
local professional networks are not being allocated the funding
necessary to enable them to provide the detailed clinical advice that
NHS England’s dental commissioners will require from them. There
are also worries that currently Public Health England has an
insufficient number of consultants in dental public health to deliver
on the aims set out in the public health outcomes framework. All of
these teething troubles will need to be addressed if the Government
want the NHS reforms to deliver real improvements to the
population’s oral
health.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000079">At
the end of last month, it was announced that NHS England is setting up
a task group to look at how to improve dental services and outcomes for
hard-to-reach groups. This is a very welcome initiative. The British
Dental Association recently published a report on the future of
salaried primary dental care services, the part of the NHS that
provides dental care to special care patients who present challenges
that can prevent them being treated in general practice. This report
highlighted a series of issues, including a lack of funding, inadequate
provision of facilities and a predicted increase in demand for this
service, which will need to be overcome if the needs of these patients
are to continue to be met. I hope that this is one of the issues that
NHS England will be able to address as a matter of urgency, perhaps
through the new task
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000080">Recent
changes to decontamination requirements have also been welcomed by

shelf life of wrapped instruments, will continue to ensure
patient safety while making more reasonable demands of dental

the guidance will take place by the end of 2014, and I hope
that the Minister will soon be in a position to say when this review is
going to

would like to draw the Minister’s attention to the ongoing issue
of the annual shortage of foundation training places for UK dental

resolve, but it cannot be right that this year 185 applicants, many of
whom will have studied in UK dental schools at a cost to the public
purse in the region of £155,000 each, will have to endure months
of anxiety that their career in dentistry is over before it has even
started on account of there being insufficient foundation training
places available. Without this training, it will not be possible for
any of these students to take up jobs providing NHS dentistry after
they graduate. I know that the Minister will do all he can for each of
these students, and I expect that places will be found for many of them
in the coming months. I hope that it will also be possible to find a
long-term solution to this issue, so that future dental students will
be spared deep uncertainty at a time when all of their attention should

Carr’s letter chimes with much of our old policy. He first asked
a question that deserves to be asked: how many patients today realise
that their main nursing care is given by people with little or no
training whatever? For HCAs he goes on to propose the solution of a
year’s training and practice under the supervision of clinical
teachers. He proposes that, if satisfactory, this should lead to a
licence to practise, which should be overseen by the Nursing and

the Department of Health to suggest that the RCN or anyone else who

the risk of “learning with Nellie”. They are right to ask
whether the idea will work at all and whether it will lead to a better
nurse than would be the case if the Francis recommendations were taken
up instead. Above all, nursing organisations need to be consulted and

Miller of Chilthorne Domer:</Member></B> My Lords, I entered your
Lordships’ House in 1998, and at the first gracious Speech
debate that I attended one word was never uttered—and it was
probably not uttered until about 2000. Now it is one of the most
commonly used words in political conversations, and one which we ask
for if it is missing from legislation. That is the word
“sustainable”. Indeed, my noble friend Lord Redesdale
referred to it in relation to the water Bill. It can be used carelessly
to mean anything from “nice” to
“environmental”, or to cloak things in greenwash. But in
its true sense it is a vital word to help us to frame legislation. We
will certainly need to debate exactly what its definition should be
now. With most of the Bills in this Session—certainly the water
Bill, the Energy Bill and the legislation on HS2—we will need to
consider whether the definition that we explored and put into
legislation under the previous Government is still fit for purpose.
Luckily, help is at hand to update and redefine the concept, because
the Chartered Institution of Water and Environmental Management has
just issued a report, <I>Reframing Sustainable Development</I><I>.</I>
That new report should be required reading for all of us before we
embark on a debate about what sustainability means with regard to many
of the Bills in the gracious
Speech.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000097">When
the concept of sustainability first came to be widely debated in this
Chamber during the passage of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act, we
talked about it as having three elements. We likened it to a
three-legged stool, with social, economic and environmental legs. That
was a useful start in the thinking. This Government have made good
progress in developing that thinking and deepening the understanding of
the interplay between environmental, social and economic factors. For
example, they have established the Natural Capital Committee and
national ecosystems assessments. But we need to recognise that
environmental limits are the ultimate constraint to social and economic
development. Much of today’s debate has concentrated on those
elements. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, who is not in his
place, made quite a play of ridiculing the environmental aspects, or,
as he called them, the “green” aspects. But even he must
realise that the planet has finite limits. Indeed, his speech reminded
me of the words of Benjamin Disraeli, who said that it is easier to be
critical than to be correct. I am sorry that the noble Lord is not in
his place, but I shall engage him in conversation about that
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000098">The

going to be very useful as the Government examine the various intensive
livestock proposals. If they examine them under a proper definition of
sustainable, they will be looking at the whole carbon cycle—and
that is just for a start. The intensive livestock proposals are very
complex, particularly when you look at the whole carbon cycle. They
also involve things such as the disease risks, land use questions,
animal welfare issues, and even the nutritional quality of the product.
We need to begin government guidance on these issues by thinking about
whether our definition of sustainable is fit for
purpose.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13051461000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0002.htm#13051461000099">That
is also so with government procurement, and procurement in your
Lordships’ Chamber. Many of us in this Chamber have a mobile
phone, a computer or a laptop, myself included. We see from the recent
report from the Gaia Foundation and Friends of the Earth, <I>Short
Circuit</I>, the roll call of the metals and minerals needed to make
these gadgets. Many of them are rare minerals, and thousands of
hectares of land, forest, pasture and mountain are stripped bare in the
search for them. Our gadgets are literally costing the earth. But we
need only to demand that they be recycled efficiently, and we can
transpose the directives about end-of-life use to see to that, and make
sure that they are manufactured in a way that allows this. Then at
least there would be something like a 70% reduction in the mining
effort to procure the minerals. That is an example of the new way of
thinking that we need to adopt on these issues. It is not just all

makes a huge contribution to this country which goes far beyond the
obvious benefits of the health and well-being of those participating in

equivalent to the impact of London 2012 on the country, so we can see
the effect it has on GVA. The Manchester brand is recognised throughout
the world, largely due to Manchester United. The FA Cup Final has an
audience of more than 600 million worldwide. Wigan’s

main reason given for the idea of changing the ratios is to make
childcare more affordable for parents. However, we are told that
settings will be able to raise the ratios only if they have
highly-qualified staff. While I strongly support the aim of increasing
the qualifications of staff working in the early years, I cannot see
how this would bring the costs down. More highly-qualified staff will
want to be more highly paid, thus cancelling out any savings that might
have been made by the nursery by taking on more children per adult. It
is only right that staff who work to get higher qualifications should
expect to be paid more. Otherwise, why would they bother? The sector is
not highly paid, so there must be some incentives to train.</hs_para>

different needs. Sir Michael Wilshaw, the head of Ofsted, has also been

particularly good investment, beneficial to the individual and to the
economy, and the Government should embrace it. The evidence for this is
“sky high”, to quote a Scottish Minister when proposing
more Scottish Government investment in the field. Will my noble friend
the Minister look kindly on the evidence when the Children and Families
Bill comes to your Lordships’

Turnberg:</Member></B> My Lords, the Care Bill represents an important
recognition by Government of the need to tackle one of the major
problems facing society: how we cope with the growing number of elderly
dependent people. The fact is that we are all living longer, and
although we are also remaining healthy and active for
longer—here I must disagree slightly with my noble friend Lady
Hollis; we are extending healthy life for longer, at least for
women—we are leaving behind a long tail of unfortunate elderly
people who are increasingly disabled with multiple chronic illnesses,
many living in poverty, lonely and neglected. It is this growing group
that is too frequently admitted to hospital as an emergency when they
are tipped over by an acute exacerbation. They stay in hospital for far
too long when they would be much safer and certainly better off at
home. This is the picture that is painted so clearly in a recent Age
Concern publication.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13051461000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000148">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T20:52:39"></hs_TimeCode>
Bill goes some way to providing help for pensioners themselves in the
cap it will put on how much they have to pay for their long-term care.
We can argue about how high or low the cap should be, but it is
important to recognise that an extra financial burden will be placed on
local authorities. Once an individual’s cap is reached it will
be up to the local authority to pick up the bill for their care. Yet
the local authorities are already under severe constraints and are
complaining bitterly about being unable to fund even basic levels of
care. The projected shortfalls in the face of increasing demand over
the next few years are positively frightening, and I shall return to
funding issues in a
moment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000149">The
Bill also takes up the challenge of the Francis report and proposes a
number of measures to try to reduce the scandal of abuse and neglect.
However, in focusing on systems for the detection of bad practice and
more punishment of those who offend, the Bill seems to be missing the
need to prevent bad practice in the first place. I believe that it
would be much more effective in preventing bad behaviour to have
someone on the ground at ward level who has responsibility and
sufficient clout to ensure that high standards of care are maintained.
As I have said in previous debates, that person has to be the sister or
charge nurse in charge—really in charge—in a career grade
post, not rushing off up the nursing career ladder in a year or so.
Here I would echo very much what the noble Lord, Lord MacKenzie of
Culkein, said.
She<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T20:49:58"></hs_TimeCode> or he should
be rewarded and given a salary similar to that of a consultant, in
recognition of the level of responsibility 
<?notus-xml column=360?>that she or he carries. These preventive measures are likely to be more
effective than simply looking for abuse once it has
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T20:54:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000150">One
really big problem is how to prevent elderly patients being admitted in
the first place, where we have been failing miserably. The Bill talks
of the responsibility of local authorities to promote well-being and to
prevent the need for care and support but it cannot say how they might
do this or where they might find the money. There are many constructive
things we could do now, without waiting for government action. It is
worth examining what makes so many patients end up in accident and
emergency departments. Many turn up with “dizzy
do’s” and falls, and yet we could prevent most of those.
Poor lighting at home and the absence of handrails or chair-lifts could
all be discovered by regular home visits and corrected in a timely way,
which may prevent many a fall. We can reduce the incidence of
fractures, particularly hip fractures, which have such a big impact on
the need for admission, by reducing the prevalence of osteoporosis
through screening for it, treatment with calcium and vitamin D, and
regular exercise, all at trivial cost compared with hospital admission.
Then there are the “blackouts” that are so common.
Screening the vulnerable elderly for predisposing causes—cardiac
rhythm disorders such as atrial fibrillation, transient ischaemic
attacks, epilepsy—and checking for hypertension and diabetes
could prevent even more admissions. Far too often, it seems that
patients with a diagnosis of dementia turn up in casualty. It is
surprising but true that this may be the first time that a diagnosis of
dementia is made, despite it being hardly likely that their dementia
has suddenly appeared
overnight.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000151">All
these rather obvious, and you might think straightforward, measures
should be taken in primary care with the help of social services.
Unfortunately, the regular screening of the vulnerable members of a
practice is far from routine. I hope that the noble Earl, who is not
here at the moment, will say in summing up whether it is possible to
press those in primary care to include such screening. Focusing social
and mental health services around GPs will bear dividends, but we need
to take more action at that level than we have managed so far. It is
particularly needed in poor inner cities, where it is least likely to
be available. I was, incidentally, encouraged to hear that the
Secretary of State was asking for ideas along those lines. There they
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000152">That
still leaves us with what to do about patients lingering too long in
hospital when they should be at home. Here again we have lots of ideas
about what to do but seem quite unable to put them into practice in
more than a few places, patchily, around the country. Why do all
hospitals not appoint an officer whose sole responsibility is to plan
for a patient’s discharge from the moment they enter the
hospital? Better co-ordination between hospital and social services now
occurs in a number of well rehearsed places but we have failed in
trying to scale this up. The idea of pooled budgets between the NHS and
local authorities is a good one, since it promotes better integration
of functions, even though pooling two rather inadequate sources of
funds will not provide much of the extra money that is
needed.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=361?><hs_para UID="13051461000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000153">All these measures can
help, but the overriding problem will remain one of trying to provide
more care in the community with too little money. Some believe that we
should close NHS hospitals and beds to provide the money. Although
there may be good service and quality reasons to focus expertise in
fewer places—I am all in favour of that—it is a vain and
somewhat naive hope that simply closing beds will save much money. To
be clear, I am talking here of the 30% of beds occupied by elderly
patients who should be at home. Close those, and Bob’s your
uncle. However, hospital costs are not simply dependent on bed numbers.
They lie much more in the high level of acute care, which is so
labour-intensive. It is the high-cost medical and nursing care that
severely ill patients need for their investigation and treatment that
consumes so much resource. Those services are now so stretched but are
hardly used at all for long-stay patients sitting in beds waiting to go
home. Closing those beds will save very little, since the hospitals
will still be stretched by their acute, high-intensity work. Certainly,
discharging patients home quickly is a worthwhile endeavour for the
patients but I do not believe that we should be looking for much in the
way of savings
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000154">So
where is the money to come from? In his excellent report, the noble
Lord, Lord Filkin, pointed quite rightly to the need for the whole
Government to respond. We need a combined effort across the whole of
government, including housing, transport and work and pensions, and the
Treasury and the Cabinet need to consider their overall priorities.
Ultimately it is the priority that government as a whole gives to care
of the elderly compared with the many other pressures it is under that
will count.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13051461000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000210">9

Bridgeman:</Member></B> My Lords, in the short time available to me, I
propose to speak about the role of general practitioners, who are
regarded widely as the jewel in the crown of the National Health
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000156">Your
Lordships will be aware that throughout 2012 there were tortuous
negotiations with the Department of Health about the GP contract.
Agreement was reached at the start of 2013. I intend to touch on one
aspect of this agreement today: doctors’ out-of-hours service.
Of course, there is no question of GPs going back to the situation
before 2003, when doctors in general practice were effectively on call
on a 24/7 basis. Since then, a number of arrangements have evolved for
dealing with out-of-hours work; some are run by the former primary care
trusts, some by co-operatives of GPs and some by independent
contractors. With any of these structures there must inevitably be a
degree of patient dissatisfaction—perhaps I should say
unease—since the patient will not be seen by a member of a GP
practice familiar to him or her. This must be accepted and the
challenge is to make these out-of-hours services as efficient and
patient-friendly as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000157">I am
advised that some of the doctors engaged in out-of-hours work will have
had no experience of the particular skills it demands during the 10
years that the current out-of-hours regime has been in place. While
out-of-hours doctors have to have the minimum 
<?notus-xml column=362?>qualifications to be a GP, and it is not a speciality as generally
understood, nevertheless particular skills are required in assessing
acutely unwell people; by the very nature of this work, there will be
limited or no documentary back-up. Undoubtedly there are many able
practitioners engaged in this work, where they may find the flexibility
of out-of-hours work attractive and they may not want the
responsibilities of a GP partnership—or indeed simply for the
extra money. Nevertheless, it is a widely held view in the profession
that there are many doctors in out-of-hours work who would have
difficulty getting mainstream GP jobs.</hs_para>

media interest in this subject, including a particularly critical
article in the <I>Daily Mail</I> yesterday, which that newspaper has
followed up today. Now that responsibility for out-of-hours work has
been passed back to GPs, does the Minister envisage an expansion in
terms of numbers in the out-of-hours work service? Is he able to
confirm that provision has been made for the costs of training?
Fundamentally, what degree of monitoring does he envisage for the
contractors and the qualifications of their personnel, bearing in mind
media reports that cite instances of specialised nurses taking the
place of doctors due to shortages of the
latter?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000159">I have
the privilege of speaking after the noble Lord, Lord MacKenzie of
Culkein, who has unrivalled knowledge of the nursing profession. I will
address one particular aspect that affects nurses. Attention has been
drawn previously in your Lordships’ House to the matter of
language testing of nurses from the EU who have the right under the
freedom of movement directive to practise in the UK. Significantly,
there are different procedures for doctors and nurses. The GMC may
register doctors from the EU. It can assure itself inter alia of the
candidate’s English skills and only then issue a fitness to
practise certificate; in other words, it is a perfectly workable and
effective
arrangement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051461000160" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000160">The
nurses’ regulating body, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, is
constituted under different legislation from the GMC and, crucially,
does not at present have the freedom to monitor the competence in
English of EU nurses before releasing them into nursing in Great
Britain. I know from previous dialogues with the Minister that his
department is aware of and sympathetic to concerns about the problem
and so, in its more measured pace, is the Commission. However, the
latest proposal for discussion coming out of Brussels seems to suggest
that registration and fitness to practise should continue to come
simultaneously. The effect of this is fundamental. It means that, once
an EU nurse is registered, the Nursing and Midwifery Council still has
no control over that nurse’s fitness to practise. The
Government’s position on testing for English language competency
appears to be set out in a Commons Written Answer of 25 October 2010 in
which my honourable friend Anne Milton
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13051461000185" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#13051461000185">“Post

appreciate that, as the directive now stands, that is the only course

current proposal from the commission does nothing to alter the position
and it is certainly of concern to the NMC. I would welcome an assurance
from the Minister that his department will continue to press Brussels
for an English language proficiency regime for nurses from the EU to be
effectively the same as for doctors, so that there is a period during
which the NMC can assess the English language skills of a registered
nurse from the EU before issuing the appropriate authorisation to

constantly reminded that we carry a high maintenance cost in respect of
health, pensions and of course welfare support. We struggle with our
technology and are sometimes described as non-productive consumers.
Mostly ignored are the positive contributions made to society by the
elderly. They are carers of a husband or wife, and sometimes of
grandchildren and other relatives and friends; they are the providers
of support for neighbours less able than themselves; they are minders
of children whose parents are being told that they must go out to work.
Very many give financial support to children and grandchildren who
could not otherwise stay on at school, go to university, buy a house or
pay a deposit on a rented property. They are the silent army, making up
an estimated 30% of all volunteers for a wide range of organisations

increasingly they are denigrated by politicians and the news media. The
retirement pension to which they have contributed during their working

payment that many of us in any case hand over to charity. For many, the
loss of the travel pass would mean isolation. They would be unable to
visit families and friends, get to the shops or the post office, or
travel to their voluntary activities, particularly in rural areas. Bus

every debate on issues affecting the elderly starts with the precursor

fact that we are all living longer while on the other hand that it is
not affordable. For those with retirement in sight, there is mass
confusion. We have had the Turner and Dilnot reports, and the report of

the curtains drawn who do not look for work. If they do, they become
the enemies of the young, who fear that the jobs of tomorrow are being

be expected to sell part of the equity of their homes to pay for their

Kirkwood of Kirkhope:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a real pleasure to
follow the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Handsworth. I share his analysis
in his powerful speech. I certainly subscribe to his view that we have
yet to bottom out the full extent of the necessary changes to public
policy to deal with the significant impact of longevity, not just in
the areas to which he alluded in his excellent speech but more widely
across government. In my brief remarks this evening, I also follow him
on the need to look after low-income households, whether they are
elderly or of working
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:17:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000002">I
have enjoyed this debate. I have listened with care. I was interested
in the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady Armstrong of Hill Top, with
which I largely agreed. The noble Baronesses, Lady Drake and Lady
Hollis, both made powerful speeches about the legislation in the
Queen’s Speech with which I will be most directly involved
relating to pensions and carer
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000003">The
context of this Queen’s speech, the political atmosphere in
which we are considering these measures, is different from anything
that I have seen in my political experience, and I have been around for
a long while—I am not as young as I look, but that is not to
mention how I feel. There is a lack of understanding of the pressures
that the bottom 15% of households in our income distribution are
feeling. They are severely distressed in a way that is likely to be
with us for some time: longer than many of us would wish. We need to do
something about that. I was recently reading some figures that
demonstrated that graphically. Comparing household income
internationally, the ONS discovered that the UK has dropped from fifth
place in 2005 to 12th place in 2011, so it is under stress in a way
that will affect all dimensions of public policy, in the Queen’s
Speech and elsewhere. Welfare reform was addressed in the Welfare
Reform Act 2012, but it will still cast its shadow over the coming year
and beyond.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000004">The
noble Baroness, Lady Armstrong, made a point with which I particularly
agreed. There is a different tone in the public mood about social
protection. I have never experienced it to be quite so negative and we
cannot ignore it. Again, I was looking at some figures on this, which
show that 20 years ago 15% of the public thought that people lived in
need because of laziness or lack of willpower; now, it is 23%. We have
to be aware of that. Now, it is difficult to pass legislation to deal
with such things, but it would be quite wrong not to take care to
appreciate that the circumstances in which we are introducing this
legislation are substantially different.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305152000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000005">I want to say a word
about housing, particularly new low-income housing. I know there are
other colleagues in here who have much better experience of housing
associations and I am looking forward to hearing what the noble Lord,
Lord Best, says. However, I have come to the conclusion that the most
important thing 
<?notus-xml column=366?>in the welfare domain is trying to deal long-term with housing benefit.
Reflecting on and reading some of the background, I have also concluded
that the only way sensibly to do that in the long term is to develop
housing policy, particularly the construction of new low-income
housing. We need to encourage the Government to adopt a
cross-departmental strategy to deal with this. It should also be
cross-country because we need to be conscious of the fact that other
constituent nations of the United Kingdom are dealing with these
issues—and in some cases dealing with them quite differently. We
need to make sure that co-ordination is
maintained.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305152000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000006">We also need to do that
with a much closer association and a more trusting relationship with
local authorities because they can, and must, play a more constructive
role in trying to address some of the problems. We are simply not
building enough new affordable housing. I think that the National
Housing Federation and others have identified the gap as being
something in the region of 240,000 units each year, so the conflict
between the demand and the supply is really quite
substantial.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305152000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000007">I
am not saying that the Government are not taking steps, because I know
that they are. Indeed, the noble Lord, Lord Best, with help from some
of his friends, managed to get the noble Lord, Lord Freud, to undertake
a review of some consequences of the Welfare Reform Bill that related
to housing benefit changes and the like. We might get access to some of
these details and statistics in the not-too-distant future, and I look
forward to looking at them carefully and discussing them. This is
perhaps more a matter for the comprehensive spending review which we
will see in July because then we will see the spending profile that the
Government have in mind, although that might take us only into the
first year of the new Parliament. My real concern is that if we leave
the adoption of a more coherent, cross-departmental framework in this
very important area, it will be 2016 before we get started. That will
be unforgivable and we will be wasting a lot of time that we do not
have.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305152000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000008">There
are some obvious benefits in adopting a comprehensive new strategy for
new build for low-cost housing. There is an economic case and an
employment mobility case. It increases disposable income for low-income
families if they have lower rent costs. More than anything else, it has
a political dimension as well because ever lengthening waiting lists
for housing are a major cause of concern. It is one of the reasons why
the electorate is in such an unhappy situation, to put it at its
mildest. If we could demonstrate some progress in reducing waiting
lists, even though it cannot be done immediately, that would be
beneficial.</hs_para>

things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:24:08"></hs_TimeCode> that we
really need to do. They need to be done in a joined-up way and to
embrace future levels of capital investment and rent levels as well as
housing benefit costs, but we have to do this in a way that looks as if
we are addressing the problem seriously. The evidence is that we are
not doing that.</hs_para>

surprising statement that I came across the other day which
demonstrates that currently for every pound the Government spend on
housing, 95p goes on housing benefit and 5p goes on new build. 
<?notus-xml column=367?>That is completely the wrong way round, and we have to use the next year
to do as much as we can to redress that balance and make that change a
positive reality in the not-too-distant

Noon:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to be speaking as part of
the debate on the gracious Speech. In the time available, I shall
comment on the education proposals that were mentioned, but first I
must declare an interest as chancellor of the University of East
London. I was very fortunate to take up this position in January this
year, and I am very proud to be associated with such a diverse
university in the heart of East London. In fact, it is one of the most
diverse universities in the country with over 28,000 students from more
than 120 countries world wide, so I am particularly interested in the
likely impact of new measures in the Government’s planned
legislation affecting
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000012">I
agree with the Government that we need to see more young people having
access to quality higher education programmes, but at the same time we
should be doing more to encourage students from overseas to take up
places here in the UK. It is good for them, and it is good for us. It
enables us to build stronger bridges with different countries and
spread understanding about the opportunities and strengths of the UK
economy. As our economy continues to struggle, this could not be more
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000013">Earlier
this year, my noble friends Lord Patel of Bradford and Lord Parekh and
I were asked to be part of the business delegation that accompanied the
Prime Minister to India. It was the largest trade delegation ever to
accompany a Prime Minister on an overseas visit. The visit clearly
demonstrated the importance of India to the future prosperity of the
UK. Despite us being the only three delegates from the Opposition, all
the Ministers and officials treated us with the utmost courtesy and
respect and our views were sought out and listened to.</hs_para>

raised while I was in India was the importance of enabling more Indian
students to come to study in the UK. That is something we should
welcome, and it is especially important for a university such as the
University of East London. We can learn a great deal from the rich
diversity in our universities, especially in the business
world.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305152000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000015">This is
an area that I am passionate about, and I know that there are many
challenges that students face to succeed in this area, especially those
from ethnic minority backgrounds. Therefore, when I was given an
opportunity last year to help establish a centre at the University of
East London to provide opportunities and support for students from
various ethnic backgrounds to enter into and sustain careers in the
business sector, I relished the opportunity. A grant was made available
by the Noon Foundation that has enabled the establishment of the Noon
Centre for Equality and Diversity in Business within the Royal Docks
Business School, and I am pleased to say that last week I had the
pleasure of spending a whole day meeting and speaking to some of the
brightest and most committed business students I have ever met who have
benefitted from the work of the centre.</hs_para>

are doing well with the support provided, the challenges are immense
and include access to higher education and high-quality courses that
ensure future employment. I welcome the Government’s commitment
to increasing access to a good university education. I also hope that
we will see more practical measures to ensure greater diversity among
those students who gain a good degree. As a businessman, I welcome the
emphasis on skills and on access to training and apprenticeships. My
company, Noon Products, employs more than 2,000 members of staff at my
manufacturing plant in west London, where our national dish, chicken
tikka masala, is produced in the thousands every day. I know at first
hand how important it is to have young people starting work for the
first time who are skilled and have the right aptitude for
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000017">One of
the ways in which we can support this is by encouraging effective
apprenticeships, but the challenge to achieve this is great. Last year
nearly 750,000 19 to 24 year-olds were not in education, employment or
training. The so-called NEETs are the young people we need to target.
The numbers missing out on education and opportunities are far too
high. If I have understood correctly, the apprenticeship provisions in
the deregulation Bill are intended to address this. We are told that
there will be greater flexibility in delivery and increasing employer
involvement in the design and assessment of apprenticeships. This is to
be welcomed, and as an employer I would very much like to be part of
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000018">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:31:13"></hs_TimeCode>
Government are currently consulting on apprenticeships. The review
report is entitled, <I>The Future of Apprenticeships in England: Next
Steps from the Richard Review</I>. As I understand it, the stated
intention of the review is to ensure apprenticeships are rigorous,
responsive and able to meet the changing needs of our economy. I very
much hope that the review will help us to achieve this and I look
forward to reading the final results when it is published in the
autumn.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000019">However,
employers are employing people now, and all those young people in need
of opportunities do not have time to wait. We need to do significantly
better to promote and improve their life chances through
apprenticeships and access to higher education. This is key to securing
a lasting and robust economic recovery, and we need to act now. Our
future lies with the young. Our future prosperity must be firmly rooted
in theirs, so I very much hope that we will see practical and effective
measures in the Bill that can be taken now. I shall watch with great

Best:</Member></B> My Lords, my contribution to this debate considers
the issue of housing in the context of health, welfare and several
other aspects of the gracious Speech. My theme, to quote a Canadian
saying, is that housing is the home of all issues. I declare my
interest as president of the Local Government Association, chair of the
Hanover Housing Association, chair of the council of the Property
Ombudsman and, since I will touch on related matters in the context of
the forthcoming Care Bill, a member of the advisory board of the Equity
Release

requirement, which is of equal concern to all the main political
parties, is to secure the building of far more homes to reduce the
acute housing shortages that are the underlying cause of homelessness,
overcrowding, high rents and low standards of accommodation. However,
the benefits of a boost to housebuilding go much wider. It is the
construction industry that can act as the engine of growth, as it
always has done in previous recessions. Within that industry it is
housebuilding that delivers the biggest bang in terms of jobs, not
least in maintaining, modernising and upgrading the energy efficiency
of existing homes. I hope that the Government can strengthen the
connection between youth unemployment, now at 20% and carrying the
terrible danger of a lifetime of worthlessness if skills are not
acquired, and the opportunities for training and jobs presented by
investment in new
homes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:34:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000022">We
have all admired the contribution of migrant building workers,
particularly from Poland, but there is much to be said for investment
in apprenticeships and training in the building industry for our
own young people. To capitalise on this chance of tackling
two huge social issues simultaneously, youth unemployment and acute
housing shortages, the Chartered Institute of Building and the
Construction Industry Training Board, with the Youth Build Trust, have
asked Nick Raynsford MP in the other place and me jointly to chair an
inquiry by parliamentarians on this theme. I feel sure that the
Government will want to support this
initiative<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:34:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000023">On
other occasions I have commended the determination of the Minister for
Planning to overcome barriers to much-needed housebuilding, including
the obstacle of the seemingly universal local opposition to virtually
any development. Recently, the Government have come forward with bold
plans for help-to-buy mortgage guarantees and equity loans. There is
always the danger that stimulating demand, rather than directly
boosting supply, will simply push up prices. But as part of the mix,
these financial measures could give the housebuilders confidence to get
more homes built and on to the market. However, the private sector
housebuilders will construct only around half the number of new homes
needed to match the number of new households formed each year. We also
need subsidised housing for those who cannot afford to purchase or to
pay full market rents. Housing associations could double their output
with the requisite funding through the Homes and Communities Agency and
the Greater London Authority. This investment really should be a high
priority for the Government’s forthcoming spending review. Now
is the time to harness the lending capacity of councils, which used to
match the output of the private sector and build half the
country’s new housing, by removing the unnecessary cap on their
prudential borrowing for housing purposes, as the LGA is advocating.
This would enable local authorities to finance the building of some
60,000 extra homes, mostly on land that they already own, without the
need for
subsidy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000024">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>
will argue that one area of housing on which there should have been an
announcement in the Queen’s Speech is the regulation of the
private rented sector. However, I was delighted that the efforts of
your Lordships in support of the noble Baroness, Lady 
<?notus-xml column=370?>Hayter, led the Government to bring forward an amendment to the
Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Bill that will give the consumer
greater protection by requiring all lettings and managing agents, who
look after about 60% of the private rented sector, to be part of an
independent ombudsman dispute resolution
scheme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000025">Sadly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:37:16"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Government did not listen to your Lordships on another housing
issue on which they suffered successive defeats in this
House—the issue of welfare reform, which has targeted support
with housing costs for those on the lowest incomes. The caps, ceilings
and limits on housing benefit and local housing allowances, which are
more likely to deter private landlords from letting to poor people than
to persuade landlords to reduce rents to help them, have been
accompanied by the levy on housing association and council tenants
deemed to have a spare room. I have been much criticised for naming
this the bedroom tax, but I suspect that Ministers now regret
introducing this controversial measure. This levy penalises those in
work as well as those who must find the money from their other benefits
by cutting back on basic essentials. It is not too late for the
Government to moderate its impact through a major increase in the
totally inadequate level of discretionary housing payments, which local
authorities need to deploy in the many cases of hardship, and where
tenants cannot be offered a suitable smaller
property<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:38:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000026">It
should be noted that the housing associations whose tenants are hit by
the welfare reform cuts are anticipating major problems of rent
arrears. This not only means they must cut back on spending on new
housing investment just when the Government need them to do more, but
they will be less able to undertake the brilliant community work that
so many of them have been doing to provide for those with special
needs, to tackle anti-social behaviour—again, something that the
gracious Speech makes clear is a government priority—or to
support young people into training and
jobs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000027">Finally,
I want to note the immensely important link between housing and the
Government’s plans for funding social care, which we will be
debating when the Care Bill reaches us. The Government’s
proposals, in seeking to assist those who encounter high social care
costs, are welcome, but the help provided for those in residential care
may not go as far as many have hoped. A large proportion of the fees
will be excluded because they cover the board and lodging or hotel
costs, while the care costs will be met only at low levels, probably
well below the average in each
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:39:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
By my calculations, in a typical case the individual would probably not
be assisted until they had spent some £144,000. If their fees
reached £300,000, they could expect only some £50,000 in
support.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305152000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000028">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:40:01"></hs_TimeCode>
is where housing issues come in. If an older person’s own home
is manageable, warm, accessible, affordable and safe and secure,
independent living can remain a sensible option for their lifetime,
with care delivered to the home when needed. They can return home from
hospital, perhaps after a short stay in a residential setting, and the
emotional traumas and heavy cost of moving permanently into
institutional 
<?notus-xml column=371?>care can be avoided. If their housing is right, the Dilnot
inquiry’s key recommendation for limiting care costs can work
well and vital savings can be made to the NHS and social care budgets.
This argues for priority within the hoped for boost to housebuilding to
go to developing really high-quality older people’s housing.
This has the enormous added benefit of freeing up for the next
generation some of the 4.2 million houses occupied by
pensioners that have more than two spare
bedrooms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T21:41:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000029">The
interrelationship between housing and care also argues for more and
better opportunities for safe and sensible equity release schemes.
These can enable home owners to recycle some of the wealth tied up in
their home to do the improvements that will cut their fuel bills, make
the adaptations such as replacing a bath with a walk-in shower, and
generally ensure that it is not their home that forces them into
residential care. Giving priority to the nation’s housing can
not only change the lives of young and old but can support the
Government’s wider ambitions for reviving the economy, tackling
youth unemployment, reducing social care and health costs and so much
more. I hope that the Government are

others I have decided to keep my powder dry today and focus only on why
the Bill is needed, not on its

Lordships will know that there is nearly universal agreement that the
social care system is not fit for purpose. It was set up originally for
a country where men died shortly after they retired at the age of 65
and women died before they were 70. The new statistics showing that,
for example, 11 million people who are alive today will live to be 100
are cause for celebration, as is the fact that people are living not
only longer but with greater degrees of disability. However, this also
means that we are spending inadequate amounts on care and support, both
publicly and privately. Social care funding has totally failed to keep
pace with demographic change. Since 2004, spending on the NHS rose by
£25 billion, but spending on social care rose by just £43
million—or 0.1% in real
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305153000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305153000003">We all
know what local authorities have done to cope with rising demand and
static resources—they have increased charges for social care and
rapidly raised the eligibility criteria. The percentage of councils
providing support to those with moderate needs decreased from 50% in
2005 to 18% in 2011 as the eligibility criteria have been raised to
cover only those with substantial or critical needs. This has been
compounded by local authority spending reductions, with social services
directors reporting £1 billion-worth of cuts to services in
2011-12 and warning of even greater cuts to
come.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305153000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305153000004">Public
provision in this area is largely seen as providing poor services for
poor people, and the media all too often give us distressing examples
of that. However, anyone who works in this field must also acknowledge
that good care is provided to individuals within the 
<?notus-xml column=372?>system because of the dedication and skill of thousands of workers.
There are pockets of great service to be admired and we should always
remember that. In general, however, the system is perceived to be
starved of cash; failing to meet the volume of need; and
unfair—a lottery, especially for people with middle
incomes—for the simple reason that if you die neatly without
needing to use care services you pay nothing while if you happen to
have an illness or condition such as Alzheimer’s, you may need
expensive services for many years, costing thousands, perhaps hundreds
of thousands, of pounds. The system is also regarded as extremely
confusing and difficult to find your way
around.</hs_para>

problems will only get worse if nothing is done. Within 20 years, the
number of over-85s will double and the number of people living with
lifetime disabilities will grow too. Relatively fewer people will be
working and paying taxes to help pay for support. However, apart from
the practicalities of money and how it is to be paid for, there are
other changes in society that affect what we can expect from social
care. People want greater choice and control than is offered by our
current system and expectations about the standards of care are rising.
It still comes as a shock to the average user of care that there is so
little integration and such poor communication across health and social
care systems—still less, as we have heard today, across housing
and transport—regardless of the fact that people’s care
needs do not come in discrete packages but are stretched across the
whole of an elderly person’s life including their housing, their
families and their
income.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305153000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305153000006">What
happens when people’s needs for social care are not met? We all
know what happens—they turn to the NHS. This results in
increased demand for unplanned and emergency services and delays in
hospital discharge. Your Lordships will have seen and heard all the

conflicting views about both the cause and what should be done about
it. These extra pressures of course come at a time when the NHS is

extremely gloomy about the problems in social care. However, we may
have some opportunities now, principally in the Bill in the
Queen’s Speech, to deal with some of them. The Government are to
be praised for bringing forward a Bill which is intended to address
some of the problems that I have set out by looking at the Dilnot
commission and the Law Commission’s proposals and, perhaps very
importantly, by defining the purpose of social care and how it is
delivered.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305153000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305153000008">The
enactment of the care and support Bill will not just consolidate and
streamline into a single statute 60 years of piecemeal
law-making; it will place on a statutory footing for the first time
both the principle and the practice of self-directed personal care
based on individual assessment. Particularly pleasing to me is that the
well-being principle is also to be applied to the individual’s
carers. However, it cannot be denied that, taken together with the
introduction of a capped system of funding and a national eligibility
threshold, the Bill represents a significant implementation challenge
for everyone with a stake in the care and support
system.</hs_para>

your Lordships’ House I had the privilege of serving on the
Joint Committee which gave pre-legislative scrutiny to the care Bill.
We called many witnesses and received huge amounts of written evidence.
Two themes were paramount. The first was the need for more
integration, and the announcements today about integration between
health and social care are very welcome indeed. The second
was the need for more resources. Everybody was concerned about the
inadequacy of the resources. I am sure that we will spend
many happy hours debating that as the care Bill proceeds.</hs_para>

course of our discussions we will be able to give attention to some of
the ideas that were set out in the report <I>Ready for Ageing?</I>,

by my noble friend Lord Filkin. It states very plainly that the welfare
state was predicated on full employment and a brief period of
retirement. Now, however, centenarians are common and a third of life
may be spent in retirement, and yet pensions and social care continue
to be organised on 1950s models. The report calls for, and states that
there is a desperate need for, a national strategy that includes a
radical reconfiguration of health and social care. The budgetary split
between them is no longer sustainable. They must be commissioned and
funded jointly so that resources can be better
used.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305153000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305153000011">All of

that we have ever had for a new vision for social care—indeed,
for a different settlement for the older people whom we will all
become. We certainly need a different vision and, by the way, more
recognition of the contribution made by older people themselves. Let us
not forget that 60% of childcare is provided by grandparents. Let us
think also of the huge numbers of older volunteers. These are important

of these problems are of course part and parcel of the economic
hardship that we have been experiencing, which my noble friend Lord
Kirkwood of Kirkhope mentioned. Pressure on family incomes of the sort
that he described often means that people have to give up their pets
when they cannot afford to feed them or pay for veterinary care. We
have a duty to do something about this growing crisis. The treatment of
animals is a barometer for the health of our society, and if we want to
live in a decent and tolerant society we should be doing all that we
can to promote and enhance the welfare of all animals, particularly
domestic pets who give so unconditionally of their love to many of

problems and promoting general well-being, not least in alleviating

just on attacks on people and assistance dogs. In most weeks, there is
a report in the press of at least one fatal attack on a cat by a
dangerous dog, and that should not be tolerated. This Bill should be
extended to allow us the chance to deal with this dreadful problem. In
addition, we should use it as an opportunity to review the penalties
for cruelty to animals under the Animal Welfare Act 2006. Those who

the breeding and sale of pets. It stems from a time when people bought
pets from the window of a pet shop, but today pets are bought online.
This outdated legislation does not deal with the abuse of animals that
comes from the repeat breeding of pets for sale on the internet.

establishing their five basic needs. Yet that Act has not fulfilled its
ambitions because regulations under Section 13 to repeal outdated
legislation have not yet materialised. I hope that my noble friend will

I must tell your Lordships that since I have been studying these issues
in recent months—they have been a welcome break from the rigours
of the Leveson inquiry—it has struck me that the care of our
animals, which is crucial, as I said at the outset, to the development
of a civilised, liberal and caring society, encompasses a huge number
of issues and hence a number of government departments. Some lie with
Defra, where my noble friend Lord De Mauley is a 
<?notus-xml column=376?>tower of strength, but the Home Office has important responsibilities
too. There are also issues relating to care that fall under the
Department of Health, and of course there is education, which lies with
the Department for Education. There are also spending issues; after
all, the issue of irresponsible dog ownership alone costs the taxpayer
nearly £80 million per year. If ever there was a case for
joined-up government, it is this, so would it not be a good idea to
establish a post for an animal welfare champion to draw all these
threads together, championing the cause of vulnerable animals, saving
the taxpayer money, ensuring that our children are educated in the care
of pets in a way that would be of real benefit to their all-round
education, and at the same time helping the elderly and the lonely?
That would be a win-win for our

and other things, I can understand why that might be thought to be the
case. At the same time, in my experience, it is crucial that we do not
overlook the importance of high-quality nurse managers. Matrons and

would call an holistic approach to patient care, again, the drum-beats
at the moment are about patients left on trolleys and nurses not caring
properly. However, the patient experience is about a lot more than a
nurse and a doctor. It is about something much more fundamental and
basic. If the first call to a general practitioner’s surgery is
badly answered by an inattentive receptionist, it is the first step
towards a bad patient experience. In the National Health Service, it is
possible to have several bad patient experiences before you ever meet a
clinician. It is very important that people who work in all
professions—nursing, non-nursing and supporting
professions—understand that the patient experience begins with
them.</hs_para>

the GP who does not have time to listen properly to a patient, and the
consultant who is too busy to explain exactly what the issues are and
what might be done to help a patient’s situation. These skills
are not taught in medical school or nursing school. I ask: are they
taught or are they picked up? It is expected that these skills will be
picked up and learnt on the journey from being a clinical practitioner
to a manager and a leader. My opinion is that often those skills are
not learnt and that they are badly lacking in a lot of health service
experiences. We need to do something about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T22:03:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305152000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305152000060">The
skills required are those of listening, empathy and understanding.
Sometimes they would be called soft skills, but they are crucial in the
health service. Patients feel vulnerable, worried and anxious about
what will happen to them, so it is very important that everyone who
works in the health service understands that the patient experience
begins with them and that they are responsible in just the same way as
doctors and nurses. If it not too much trouble, I would not mind a note
from the Minister about how that wider holistic approach to patient
care, not just by clinical practitioners, doctors and nurses, is seen.
I ask everyone in the health service to be aware of the importance of
the patient
experience.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_14_PT_1/F802D001BC6AD6A988C8700FD74D6D1A35C4BB0B" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 May 2013">Tuesday,

spark off children’s interest in writing and literature and lead
them to discover other writers, historical and contemporary. As well,

works, life and times. The trust has been awarded Arts Council funding
to support Shakespeare Week for just two years, 2014 and 2015. I truly
believe that this initiative should go beyond that time. It
will ignite young children’s appetite for art and culture and
develop confidence which will indirectly have an effect on their
ability to learn across the curriculum in the classroom and beyond,
giving them a lasting legacy. So I ask my noble friend whether the

Patel of Bradford:</Member></B> My Lords, how does one follow such a
passionate, energetic and fabulous speech at this late hour? I am
afraid that mine is going to sound a bit like “Macbeth”,
but I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise a somewhat neglected
issue in the Queen’s Speech. I am talking about mental health,
which does not feature prominently in the Government’s planned
legislation and on which there are some critical issues that I want to
raise.</hs_para>

pleased to hear that
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T22:12:47"></hs_TimeCode> shall start
off on a positive note. I have to say that the coalition Government,
when they first came to power, actually made a good start in trying to
address inequalities in the area of mental health. In particular, the
Government should be commended on their mental health strategy, No
Health Without Mental Health, and the ambition it represented to see
mental health provision achieve “parity of esteem” with
physical health. I was also very pleased when on 28 February this year,
the Mental Health (Discrimination) Bill became law. This Act removed
the last significant forms of discrimination in law and was a big step
towards breaking down the prejudice and stigma surrounding people with
mental health problems.</hs_para>

these positive developments, the problems are not getting any better.
My noble friend Lord Layard, in his report last year with the London
School of Economics, set out some of the starkest evidence I have seen
that the problems are actually getting worse. For example, those with
severe mental illness are more likely to be the victims of violent
crime, have poor physical health, and a life expectancy up to 25 years
shorter than that of the general population; in fact, mental illness
now accounts for nearly half of all ill health suffered by people under
the age of 65, and it is more disabling than most chronic physical
disease. Yet only a quarter of those involved are in any form of
treatment. The hidden costs of this to the economy in terms of lost
employment and productivity are immense, at an estimated
£105 billion, which is more than the entire NHS
budget.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305155000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000018">Despite this, only 13%
of NHS funds are devoted to the treatment of mental health
issues—and I have to question the efficacy and the
appropriateness of some of the ways in which that money is being spent.
For example, we know from the Health and Social Care Information Centre
that prescriptions for anti-depressants are rising. In fact, the NHS in
England spent more than £270 million on anti-depressants in
2011—a massive 23% increase on 2010. The NHS spent almost
£1 million a week more on these drugs than the year before,
resulting in a startling 46.7 million prescriptions a year.
Can the Minister explain how this is happening against a background of
a national programme to increase access to psychological therapies,
which the evidence supports as being far more effective? While we are
on the subject, how is increasing access to psychological therapies
making a difference for people from black and minority ethnic
backgrounds? I fear that even after decades of lobbying Governments of
all persuasions to address the disproportionately poor outcomes of
people from black and minority ethnic communities in mental health
services in Britain, there continues to be little progress with adults
and young people. There are some notable successes, such as Open Mind
in Leicester, but on the whole the situation is extremely
poor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000019">We know
from the Count Me In census, which for the first time collected
statistics on ethnic minorities in mental health services, that there
are stark differences in access, experience and outcomes for minority
ethnic groups in terms of mental health. In fact, some groups of young
black men are up to 18 times more likely to be admitted to a mental
health ward than their white 
<?notus-xml column=381?>counterparts. There are also significantly disproportionate numbers for
black and minority ethnic
women.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000020">These
are extremely worrying figures but they are not the only ones. The
coalition Government’s own No Health Without Mental Health
strategy shows that 20% of children and young people are believed to
have a mental health problem. That is a fifth of all children, but we
do not know how many of those young people are from a black and
minority ethnic background. Given what we know about the breakdown of
disorders for black and minority ethnic adults, surely it is
unacceptable that these data are not available for minority ethnic
children and young people. Can the Minister urgently look into this
area and rectify what is obviously a glaring omission? In fact, I would
welcome a commitment to gathering these data so that we can get a full
picture and be better equipped to start doing something about these
gross inequalities. This is vital because I fear that, without proper
attention to these issues, the services for black and minority ethnic
adults and young people will only get worse, especially against the
background of the current upheaval caused by the NHS
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000021">The
impact of this disruption within the NHS can also be seen by the fact
that Section 117 services, which are for the most vulnerable mental
health service users, are under threat again in the Care Bill. I was
very dismayed to see that the Government have chosen to return to this
issue, given that we have already dealt with it under the Health and
Social Care Act. As noble Lords will recall from previous debates,
Section 117 of the Mental Health Act concerns the provision of
aftercare services for people leaving treatment after a period of
detention in hospital. The Government finally accepted our amendments
to the Health and Social Care Bill that these vital services should be
preserved, and yet here we are again facing significant changes to the
definition of aftercare that will in effect remove these services from
many people. Clause 68(5) of the Care Bill introduces for the first
time a statutory definition of “after-care services”,
which I and others believe is too restrictive and could generate
complex legal disputes over whether a service should be provided under
Section 117. I fail to see the Government’s rationale for this
and will be seeking answers from the Minister about the impact of these
changes during the passage of the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000022">Care of
the vulnerable should surely be at the forefront of our efforts. I
would have thought that after everything that happened at Winterbourne
View we should be much more focused on preventing harms. What have we
done since the scandal of Winterbourne View? For example, at the time,
the case refocused the spotlight on the appropriateness of restraint
and physical intervention as an approach to managing challenging
behaviour. The review into the failings recommended that the Government
should consider banning the use of certain forms of restraint on
patients with learning disabilities. Can the Minister update us on the
Government’s progress in meeting this
recommendation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000023">However,
this issue does not concern only those with learning disabilities. It
would be fair to say that the approach to restraint has been confusing
and shambolic within the mental health sector as a whole. Many
providers do not carry out risk assessment of 
<?notus-xml column=382?>techniques. If we are to develop appropriate regulations and consistent
training for staff, work urgently needs to be done, by appropriate
medical experts, on the likelihood and probability of physical and
psychological harm with regard to each restraint technique in each
position. Restraint is a physical intervention and should be seen as
such; therefore, like all other physical interventions, it should be
based on evidence of efficacy, safety and acceptability. Is it not time
that this issue is reviewed by NICE and clear recommendations made,
based on evidence? Finally, the Care Quality Commission should review
its actions and ensure that a robust inspection process is in place
that covers not only the process of restraint in care homes but the
training that staff
receive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000024">In
conclusion, I am calling on the Government to take this opportunity to
do more to address the inequalities in mental health for black and
minority ethnic communities, adults and young people alike; to hold to
their commitment to protect aftercare services, as defined by Section
117 of the Mental Health Act; and to bring forward actions to ensure
appropriate use of restraint and physical intervention across mental
health and learning disability services. I would like to see a clear
commitment by the Government to take action within this parliamentary
Session to tackle these issues. Without such action, we could be
heading towards a crisis point and once again placing some of the most
vulnerable people in our communities at real
risk.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_14_PT_1/AB1D90460797518FAA078694A96F8E6966763835" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 May 2013">Tuesday,

draw about the rather insubstantial policy offerings that we are
debating here today? First, a number of the proposals make extra
demands on local services that are not matched by additional local
support. Local government is already struggling with a 33% cut in
central government funding, and the projections are worse. For example,
my noble friends Lord Hunt and Lady Wheeler, and others, have made
challenging analyses of the Care Bill and raised some vital questions.
Underpinning these issues, the Local Government Association estimates
that there has already been a cut of £1.89 billion in social
care funding, and more cuts in services are planned. It is a cruel
deceit to suggest that social care provision can be modernised and
integrated when the funding is not in place to make this a
reality.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305155000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305155000029">We
support the principle set out in the Bill of capping care costs and
giving family carers more support, although we share Andrew
Dilnot’s concern that the cap is being set too high. There is
concern that the Bill does not address the daily struggle of those

on welfare reform, the Government appear determined to push on with the

unemployed, as well as of low-paid working families who are seeing
their incomes cut. We have heard today how this is distorting public
attitudes towards these groups. Meanwhile,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-14T22:25:33"></hs_TimeCode> Government

entitlement, for every adult who was out of work for more than two

the Government are neglecting the country’s children by failing
to invest in their economic, social and physical well-being. The recent
report of the Institute for Fiscal Studies has concluded that, by 
<?notus-xml column=384?>2015, the number of children living in absolute poverty will rise by
900,000 to 3 million and that, by the end of the decade, 3.4 million
children—about one in four—will find themselves in
relative poverty. This reverses all the progress made by the previous
Government in tackling child poverty and is a real indictment of the
callousness of this Government. Instead of reaching the target for
rates of child poverty that are no higher than 5%, they will oversee an
increase to levels of 27%. Is tackling child poverty still a priority

further example of the Government’s disregard for the welfare of
young children is the ill conceived plan to increase child/staff ratios
for nurseries, an issue that has been raised by several noble Lords. We
said at the outset that such an increase would threaten the quality of

is now echoed among professionals in the

grateful that, rather belatedly, the Deputy Prime Minister is beginning

Government’s disregard for the physical health and well-being of
children is all too well illustrated by their policy on school sports.
Under the previous Government’s school sport partnerships, the
proportion of children taking part in weekly sport increased from one
in four to more than 90%. As we have heard today from my noble friend
Lady Billingham, the Government’s decision to unravel this
provision, followed by a partial U-turn, has left a fragmented and
underfunded service with no funding guarantees. That this should happen
in the aftermath of our stunning Olympic success is a real tragedy.
School and community sport need long-term funding commitments and an
integrated programme if we are ever to repeat our global sporting
success. Perhaps the Minister could enlighten us as to what plans the
Government now have for how that might be

way in which Michael Gove has let down this country’s young
people is his failure to grasp the importance of the arts and
creativity in education. His tenure has been marked by grand
announcements and policy shifts followed by rethinks and retreat. Not
surprisingly, as described by my noble friend Lord Puttnam, Mr Gove has
had a demoralising effect on the whole teaching profession. The example
of the proposed EBacc was a case in point, with no status given to art,
music and drama in the original proposals. The new curriculum proposals
represent only a partial reprieve and the whole redesign of the
curriculum has been marked by secrecy and intrigue when it should have
been an open and transparent national debate about appropriate learning
for the next generation of young people. Incidentally, confidence in
the Government’s proposals is not helped by Michael
Gove’s admission that research he recently quoted about
children’s knowledge came from Premier Inn and UKTV Gold

cultural legacy of the next generation is being squandered in so many
ways, not just through the failings of education. The Secretary of
State at DCMS has belatedly and ineffectively caught up with the
economic contribution of the arts but fails to address the wider
contribution, which is about our identity, ability to express
ourselves, and health and well-being as a nation. This point was
eloquently made by a number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord,
Lord Berkeley, whose impressive maiden speech we have all applauded and
whose godfather’s centenary I celebrated only last week. The
Arts Council has been struggling with the burden of 30% cuts, with more
to come, and local authority arts funding is being cut, sometimes to

noble Lords raised concerns about the delay in implementing Leveson and
the process of resolving the two competing royal charters. I share
these concerns. Similarly, there has been a gaping silence where the
communications Bill might be. We have been promised and promised again
a White or Green Paper, but deadlines come and go and nothing has

what kind of legacy do the Government offer young people on the

for those of us who care about these issues. Meanwhile, as
CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions reach record levels, Tory MEPs have just
sabotaged attempts to reform the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and the
Chancellor is continuing to veto the introduction of a decarbonisation
target in the Energy Bill. Can the Minister explain why, against this

conclusion, there have been many more thoughtful contributions today
and I am sorry that I have not been able to reference them all. I am
sure that the Minister will prove more skilled than I am at that. As I
said at the outset, we have the makings in this debate of an
alternative Queen’s Speech that could prove to be radical and
exciting. I have certainly learnt a great deal and taken copious notes.
I hope that, in the aftermath of the next election, we on this side of
the House will be able to produce a Queen’s Speech that rather
more successfully addresses the challenges of the nation that we have

noble Lords have highlighted, the Care Bill is essential to achieve a
modern, clear and fair legal framework for care and support. There are
issues which we shall doubtless debate in Committee. The noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, questioned why the cap on care costs in the Bill was set at
£72,000. Of course, that is the equivalent of £60,000 in
2010-11 prices, when the Dilnot commission reported. Simply, the cap is
set at that level to strike a balance between protecting social care
users and public affordability. The same principle will apply to
national minimum eligibility criteria, which were raised by several

conclude with remarks on two Bills carried over from the previous
Session. The Children and Families Bill will transform the system for
children and young people with special educational needs, reduce delay
in the adoption system and reform childcare to ensure the system
focuses on providing safe, high-quality care and early education for
children. A number of noble Lords, including my noble friends Lady
Barker, Lady Jolly and Lord McCall and the noble Baroness, Lady Massey,
raised issues which demonstrate their real expertise in this area. The
noble Earl, Lord Listowel, my noble friends Lord Storey and Lady
Walmsley and other noble Lords raised the important issue of childcare.
We strongly agree that we need to do more to encourage high-quality,
better paid professionals in the sector. Our proposals will help to
attract more talented people into the profession by making it easier
for providers to pay better wages. I hope I can offer some reassurance.
The Government’s proposed new ratios bring us into line with
practice in countries such as France and the Netherlands, both of which
operate with less restrictive ratios combined with better qualified and
better paid professionals. We want to give providers in this country
these same freedoms to improve the quality of staff. The new ratios
will be available only to those providers who employ highly qualified
staff. We have consulted on the qualification thresholds and are
considering the responses. We will be publishing the
response
soon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305156000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305156000020">As the
noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, so rightly said, nothing has more impact on
children’s achievement than the quality of teaching they
receive. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for
Education is raising the bar for new teachers, supporting existing
teachers to improve and creating teaching schools which model and share
outstanding practice. In response to the noble Lord, Lord Griffiths, I
must stress that our ambitions and these critical improvements are for
all children and all schools. The steady stream of applications to set
up new free schools demonstrates the continuing demand from parents for
a greater choice of schools within their communities. The success of
the academies programme is something for which the Government do not
apologise. We make no apology for our investment in a programme which
is proven to 
<?notus-xml column=390?>drive up standards and make long-term school improvements. We want as
many as possible to take advantage of the significant benefits that
academy status
brings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305156000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305156000021">The
noble Baroness, Lady Billingham, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, spoke
of the importance of the Olympic legacy in schools. We entirely agree
that we must harness the sporting spirit of 2012 for all our young

£150 million per year and reintroducing competitive sport into
the heart of the curriculum. By doing that, we can achieve an Olympic
legacy in our schools of which we can be
proud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305156000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305156000022">A number
of noble Lords spoke about the review of the national curriculum. The
noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, are
concerned that the breadth of education is important. The right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Winchester raised the importance of
religious education in schools, my noble friend Lady Miller asked about
the teaching of nutrition and my noble friend Lady Benjamin highlighted
the importance of Shakespeare. The aim of the curriculum review is to
enable a focus on the essential subject knowledge that all young people
should acquire to be educated citizens while freeing up teachers to use
their professional judgment about what to teach beyond that core and
how to teach in a way that will inspire and challenge their
pupils.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305156000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130514-0003.htm#1305156000023">Finally,
