of the debate on the Queen’s Speech that relates to economic
matters, particularly jobs and business. We will be talking primarily
about Bills dealing with national insurance reductions for companies,
consumer protection, and the protection of intellectual property,
particularly design, as well as some of the carry-over Bills that will
have significant implications in relation to banking, workplace change
and reform, and shared parental leave and flexible working, which still
have to be legislated for. We will also discuss some of the important
social measures that have major economic implications, particularly the
reforms of pensions and social care, about which my colleague the
Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will speak. Of course, these
are social changes, but they will have major economic consequences,
notably incentivising saving and thereby contributing to long-term
economic growth.</hs_Para>

start with the basic economic context in which we operate. When we are
writing the economic history of the past two decades, the story will be
one of a spectacular boom and a spectacular bust—15 years of
remarkable continued economic growth followed by the worst crash since
after the first world war, the two things being intimately connected.
The first requirement in approaching this subject is a certain degree
of humility. We are in unprecedented conditions, and it is important to
acknowledge that there is no simple or easy answer to many of the
difficult issues that we have to grapple with. Risks are associated
with fiscal consolidation that is too fast and risks are associated
with fiscal consolidation that is too slow. There are genuine debates
about the best mix of monetary and fiscal policy. There are also
serious debates on how we deal with the banks in such a way that they
rediscover their appetite for risk but do not do so in a way that
destabilises the banking system as before. I hope that everybody in
this debate, particularly the Opposition, will approach these very
tricky issues recognising the very difficult context in which we
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T09:37:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051032000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0001.htm#13051032000017">Let
me address a few of the questions that the Leader of the Opposition
asked in his response to the Queen’s Speech. He asked about
jobs, the link between jobs and wages, the very emotive but important
issue of migration, and the banking system, which is at the heart of
the problems we are dealing with. I will start with jobs.</hs_Para>

in our history, but none the less worryingly high. It is useful,
however, to make some apt comparisons. In the United States, which has
recovered from the crisis much better than any other western country,
except possibly Australia, the unemployment rate is slightly less, at
about 7.6%. In France, which has had the benefit, if such it is, of a
socialist Government, the unemployment rate is 10.6%. In Sweden, which
is an interesting case—it is not in any sense shackled by the
eurozone and it has had probably the most enlightened welfare and
labour market policies of any European country—unemployment is
significantly higher than in the UK, at about

this Government—perhaps even in the rather partisan atmosphere

whether the hon. Gentleman is familiar with the economic literature,

Britain experienced we should have lost about 50% of our
GDP. We have done well to avert that. We face a difficult set of 
<?notus-xml column=261?>circumstances. It is a remarkable success story that in an economy that
is still recovering from such a long economic heart attack, we are
generating significant private sector employment growth. That is
positive. Alongside that, we have seen the growth of about 250,000 new

have focused on two policy areas to deal with the problem of youth
unemployment. I am most closely involved in the growth of
apprenticeships and my colleague, the Secretary of State for Work and
Pensions, will talk about the other. We have all embraced
apprenticeships, including, rather belatedly, the Opposition. There is
a recognition among employers and young people that it is an excellent
model for training. Under this Government, the number of apprenticeship
starts has increased by 86%. There were 160,000 last year. There has
been a 42% growth in the number of young people starting
apprenticeships. We are making reforms that will improve the system
further, notably the employer ownership system, under which
apprenticeship training will be channelled through employers so that
there is the demand for real jobs. We are also introducing a staged
approach through traineeships, so that young people have a route into
proper

difficult area is that what has kept unemployment down in the UK is the
fact that real wages have not risen. Indeed, they have fallen. That was
the main focus of attack from the Leader of the Opposition. We need to
understand and explain what has happened. The British economy was hit
massively by the financial crisis. We are a significantly poorer
country than we were before that time, although we are now recovering.

wages in real

lifting low earners out of tax, which increases their disposal income

that people on the minimum wage are paying half the income tax that
they paid before we embarked on that reform. We have also taken 2.7
million out of income tax altogether. Secondly, and this is my direct
responsibility, we have ignored the advice from some quarters to
abandon the minimum wage or to dilute it. I have followed the advice of

important to refer to them. I was provoked into feeling that we should
debate the issue in this context because a couple of days ago I was on
the radio on the “Jeremy Vine” programme. I was following
a female voice that was ranting on about millions of 
<?notus-xml column=264?>illegal immigrants and the negligence of the Government in letting them
all in and not deporting enough people. I thought at the time that it
was some fringe party that regarded Mr Nigel Farage as a sort of soggy,
left-wing liberal, but I then realised it was the Labour shadow Home
Secretary, and I tried to understand where she was coming from. It says
quite a lot about the Labour party’s current values that it
feels it necessary to apologise for letting in foreigners, but is still
reluctant to apologise for wrecking the economy.</hs_Para>

do you know?”, and she said, “Well, I see them in the

you know they are illegal?” She looked at me and said,
“Mr Cable, why are you being so difficult? You know exactly what
I mean”, and pointed up the road to the Hounslow mosque.
Unfortunately, beneath a lot of the arguments about numbers, that is

order to clear the decks for an honest discussion of this problem, we
must confront the reality that some of the facts, or factoids, used in
this context are deeply unhelpful. All parties and commentators use the
concept of net immigration as a way of measuring what is happening on
that front, but at the heart of that concept lies a logical absurdity.
One reason net immigration rises is because fewer British people
emigrate—one would have thought it rather a good thing that
people feel comfortable living in this country and want to stay here.
Net immigration declines if more British people emigrate, which one
would have thought is rather a bad thing. We often operate, therefore,
with a concept that gives us misleading and unhelpful
conclusions.</hs_Para>

the biggest item in immigration—this relates to the previous

immigrants; that is not why they come here. A few stay
on—indeed, I probably contributed to immigration statistics 50
years ago when I married someone who was then a student at the
university of York. For the most part, however, people come to the UK
to study and then go home. They are not immigrants, but by way of a
quirk—not in our statistics, but those of the United

other ways, but education is one of our most successful export
industries. The Government have tried to curb abuses that were taking

immigration, and those have been closed. Once we have established the

essential point is that there are positives, and we need to stress them
in the current atmosphere. However, we also need to provide
reassurance, which is what the Government are seeking to do in two main
ways. First, when people come to this country, we should acknowledge a
distinction between the rights to work and to claim benefits, which is
at the heart of people’s sense of citizenship and belonging. My
colleague the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions will explain how
we want to ensure that British citizens and not people from overseas
receive benefits. The sense of abuse in that sector fuels much of the
current
anxiety.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051032000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0001.htm#13051032000065">The
second source of concern is the belief that the laws and restrictions
we have should be enforced. There are measures in the Immigration Bill
to try to ensure that the private sector, particularly the property
sector, plays its role in enforcing them. Those restrictions will have
to be subject to a proper regulatory impact assessment and, under the
one in, two out principle, they will have to demonstrate that they do
not impose red tape on small business. Provided that happens, I hope
the combination of actions that have been taken in respect of the
benefits system and enforcing the law will be  
<?notus-xml column=267?>sufficient to reassure the public, or those people who are willing to be

insurance. Does he agree that we should look at the facts rather than

large part of the Leader of the Opposition’s speech was devoted
to the continuing problems in banking and the financial sector, and
many of the current problems with the economy relate to the aftermath
of the banking crisis. We have got to a situation in which
banks—partly under pressure from regulators, and partly as a
result of learning from their mistakes—have moved to a position

the position we are dealing with is genuinely difficult. In the light
of banks’ previous misfortunes, they are operating what I call a
pawnbroker model of banking, under which people need collateral,
whether a gold watch or property, to secure a business loan. That is
massively inhibiting for, for example, a creative industry that does
not have such collateral, or an export company that is trying to trade
on the basis of orders, or simply for a good company with a good
business idea and a good business plan that is unable to get into

Government are trying to deal with the problem in a series of practical
steps. We clearly need to do more, but it is worth summarising some of
the steps we are taking. We have a sophisticated system of developing
supply chain finance—the advanced manufacturing supply chain

private sector to support trade finance outside the banking system. We
have a £1 billion fund that now supports non-bank finance, which
is proliferating rapidly. We have crowd-sourced funding, invoice
finance 
<?notus-xml column=268?>and non-conventional forms of lending. The Financial Services Authority

the most important step, and one that underpins the others, is the work
we are doing with the business bank. We have £1 billion of
start-up capital. The first £300 million is being marketed to
support new banks and long-term patient capital, which can be raised in
the City, and to support equity through angel networks. A crucial test

nationalised, and is now part of Santander; Birmingham Midshires bank

part of the Virgin group; Woolwich is now part of Barclays; Halifax is

beyond 2.6 million, we were in a double-dip recession, and the

to pay for the cost of their failed economic plan. The Secretary of
State’s answer to that state of affairs was to bring forward an
enterprise Bill that started with some sensible measures, but ended up
becoming a Christmas tree of a Bill. It contained measures to water
down the statutory remit of the Equality and Human Rights Commission,
to trample over people’s rights at work, to overturn health and
safety protections that have existed for more than 100 years, and to
abolish—this came rather late in the Bill’s
progress—the Agricultural Wages Board that protects agricultural
workers. That was all done in the name of growth, without a scintilla

UK economy has grown by just 1.1% compared to the 6% forecast made by
the Office for Budget Responsibility, and 3% growth 
<?notus-xml column=271?>in Germany and 4.3% growth in the US during the same period.
Unemployment is stuck around the 2.5 million mark. A large
number of those in work are working part time when they want full-time
work, and people have faced an average pay cut of £1,700. Let us
not forget that that was all being done in the name of reducing
borrowing. We now have a situation where the Government are borrowing
£245 billion more than they planned—the equivalent of the
health and education budgets combined, and then some.</hs_Para>

Private Secretary that his boss is borrowing £245 billion more

growing again that would incur extra borrowing is the VAT cut, which
would cost £12 billion in the short term. We advocate
a VAT cut because it is the fastest way to give an injection to an
economy that, frankly, has flatlined over the past three years. We have
seen it work previously. During the economic downturn when we were in
office, we introduced a VAT cut that we know—Institute for
Fiscal Studies numbers have provided supporting evidence—helped
to boost growth in the economy. That is what we need now. Of course,
boosting growth would increase corporation tax receipts and income tax

risks with the funding for lending scheme. The problem is that it has
reduced the cost of borrowing for existing business borrowers without
increasing access to finance for those other successful, profitable
businesses. The other problem—this is why we advocate setting up
a regional banking network, to which I shall turn in a minute—is
that the scheme sees as its delivery mechanism the very high street
banks that have been the problem. In fact, the transmission mechanism
for many of the schemes that the Government have introduced since they
came to office has been the high street banks, which have been the

continue to discuss industrial strategy in more detail before touching

its champion—he argued for his own Department to be abolished at

we will scrutinise the Bills in the Queen’s Speech closely to
ensure that they support those key sectors. Another such sector is our
creative industries, which were disappointed not to see a

that so much of what we have seen coming from his Department or the

regret. Listening to the Secretary of State lecture us on that, I
should say to him that mea culpa in that respect is due across the

with the education and skills that our businesses need if they are to

heard the Secretary of State, like other Ministers, boasting about
creating more than 
<?notus-xml column=277?>1 million apprenticeships, but the number of 16 to
18-year-olds starting an apprenticeship in the first half of this

on that and also protect the quality of apprenticeships, which is

apprenticeships.</hs_Para>

this Government will not proceed with that simple measure. Ministers

six-month programme of training and work experience to aid young people

included a consumer rights Bill in the Queen’s Speech. We are
told that it consolidates consumer rights legislation in one place,
bringing together eight pieces of legislation and covering goods,
services, digital content and unfair contract terms. I agree that
consumers need more clarity on their rights, but from what we have seen
so far, the Government’s proposals appear to fall short of the

want to speak about the issue of jobs, which  is important to
my constituents in Tamworth. Notwithstanding the rather gloomy words of
the shadow Secretary of State, and the collapse last December of a
company called Drive Assist, we in Tamworth have been heartened by a
downward trajectory in joblessness. I think that that will be enhanced
and encouraged by the measures announced in the Gracious Speech,
particularly the proposal to offer an employment allowance towards
national insurance, which I am pleased to note that the shadow
Secretary of State seems to support. It means that small businesses up
and down the country, from Redruth to Redcar—including,
importantly, businesses in Tamworth, Fazeley and the district of
Lichfield—will be exempt from national insurance, which will
enable them to grow and employ more people. I think that the measure
will also help us to rebalance our economy, moving back from the
over-reliance on the financial services sector and the public sector
that was so beloved of the right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and
Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown) towards a more sustainable, broad-based private
sector—a sector that contracted by some 730,000 places under the

given that for years there was no proper investment in our energy

symptomatic of a desire on both sides of the House to build a robust

new jobs in our country. Providers such as Cuadrilla say that they want
more than an end to the moratorium, which has in fact now ended, and a
new licensing round, which is to take place. They also want the
Government to support their reasonable planning applications. That will
mean we do not have so much wrangling about planning, so that
exploratory drilling can be done to find out whether we have beneath
our feet 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas—perhaps there is
more—which will be enough to cater for our needs for a century.
That would help reduce our exposure to the volatility in international

of Her Majesty’s Household, however, in years past it was part
of my duty to the House not to be here for Her Majesty’s speech.
It is therefore not unusual for me to be absent when Her Majesty turns
up. I should tell the House that my experience of being held hostage in
Buckingham palace—on behalf of Members, and in order to protect
the safety of the sovereign—was slightly unnerving. When I
discussed that with the head of the armed forces at the time, Sir Mike
Jackson, and expressed the anxiety I had felt about the experience, he
said to me, “Jim, you shouldn’t have worried.” I
said, “Shouldn’t I have, Mike?” He said,
“No, no; if anything 
<?notus-xml column=284?>had happened to Her Majesty, we would have made it quick—we would
have just shot you.” That was not the most reassuring message I
have had from Her Majesty’s armed forces, but I am sure he was

London’s housing economy. Curiously, the event was held at the
Savoy, somewhat in contrast to the topic under discussion. Professor
Travers said the private rented sector is in need of “pretty
significant regulation”. I have dealt with casework in Poplar
and Limehouse about landlords who have withheld deposits, rented
accommodation that has been far below standards and tenants who have
been caught in financial difficulty due to hidden fees. That is one

It would force energy companies to put all over-75s on their cheapest
tariff, helping those who benefited to save up to £200 a year.
It would introduce a new legal right for passengers to get the cheapest
ticket for their journey and introduce strict caps on fare rises on

have some fantastic NGOs in the UK, including War on Want, Oxfam,

additional £12 billion to the overall borrowing we have

plan we have in place. Our spending plans have resulted in spending
reductions across Departments, every single one of which have been
opposed by the Opposition. I am slightly confused about their current
line. Do they agree with the cuts and just want to borrow an additional
£12 billion to cut VAT, or are they saying that they do not

that it is a plan to stimulate the economy now. The ridiculous argument

has nothing with their choices and decisions. It is important to remind

shall structure my remarks around the national insurance contributions
Bill and what more we can do to support business, but first I shall
mention two issues that are of great importance to my constituents.
Along with the economy, one of the issues that we struggle with is what
we should do about immigration, and how we should handle that quite
sensitive issue. We have to get the balance right. Undoubtedly, as a
nation we have benefited from immigration. We are a global trading
nation; we have sat at the heart of world economic development for very
many years, and people come to this country to add to our economic
vibrancy. But I share with my constituents a concern about how we
handle that fairly—how we achieve a balance. Some of the
announcements made in the Gracious Speech will be very welcome. It
strikes a sensible balance between my constituents’ rights and
those of migrants or immigrants who then commit a criminal offence. It
seems to strike people that the pendulum often swings too far in
support of the perpetrator rather than the victim.</hs_Para>

that tolerance has a right to remain here. I am therefore very pleased

Bill will demonstrate to my constituents that we are tackling a serious
problem. They really do not understand how people who break the law

antisocial behaviour. When I came into office in 2010, I pledged to my
constituents that I would look at tackling antisocial behaviour with
them. In my constituency I organised an antisocial behaviour
conference, which was attended by a Minister and at which we brought
together councillors, the council and local residents to talk about
their experience of antisocial behaviour. It is the scourge of many of
our estates and town centres, and the description often belies its
seriousness. It can make people’s lives a living hell. I am very

to demonise young people, who often get put in the frame for being
responsible for most antisocial behaviour. Just because they are young

committing antisocial behaviour; we should remind people of that.
However, when such gatherings turn into antisocial behaviour we need to
tackle it, and fast; and we need to give councils or the police the
necessary power to do so. The most difficult issue that I am presented
with at my surgery is that of neighbours creating problems for each
other. I hope the Bill will make it easier to tackle antisocial
behaviour caused by
neighbours.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0001.htm#13051035000022">Thirdly,

much of the private sector into one area—banking, on which we

significant growth in private sector businesses over the past three
years—up 250,000. In south Essex, where I represent Basildon and
Thurrock, the number of new businesses is up nearly 9% on last
year—three times the regional average. There is a lot going on
down in my patch. We are doing well in terms of job creation. DP

will be honest: small businesses are struggling out there. It is tough.
Rising costs, changing trends, changes on the high street, the rise of
the internet, and ever-changing technology mean that small and
medium-sized enterprises face ever-increasing challenges, yet they
persevere in trying to make ends meet. I make a plea to the Government
on their behalf: please keep listening to them; keep your ears open,
and please, please remember that many small businesses act as a social
service to their employees. They recognise that their employees are one
of their greatest assets and do all they can to nurture and support
them. They do not abuse them; they recognise that their future
prosperity lies with their employees. I hope that, as a result of the
changes announced for the national insurance contributions Bill, those
small businesses will be encouraged to take on even more employees in
the coming
months.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0001.htm#13051035000025">There
is still a significant challenge out there. If small businesses, the
lifeblood of our economy, are to prosper they need access to easy,
cheap finance. The Government have moved a significant distance. They
have brought forward many initiatives to address the issue, but there
is still a significant problem. Many of the initiatives address issues
of access—some are those of cost—but  I do not
think that any yet address both. Banks are 
<?notus-xml column=290?>taking too risk averse an approach to lending and we must intervene to
change that. Too many banks find ways of demonstrating lending while
supporting those who do not necessarily need it. While we can show that
lending is up, I am not convinced that it is getting to the right
destination.</hs_Para>

encourage the Government to consider using their borrowing
powers—the trumpeted 2%, depending on the length of the
bond—to borrow and lend directly to businesses. The announcement
of the business bank is very welcome, but I fear that with an arrival
date of late 2014 and only £1 billion available, it may be too
little, too late. I am 100% behind the Government’s debt and
deficit reduction plans and 100% behind the approach that they are
taking, but we must put all our energy into finding ways to make access
to finance easier, whether through lending at the rate at which we
borrow or even subsidising it and lending at 0%. Lending a business
£100,000 at 0% over a couple of years would cost a sum similar
to the employment support allowance of £2,000 and it may well
deliver significant economic growth and job creation. This is not
unheard of. The Government already operate similar schemes. The
Insolvency Service operates a scheme that supports businesses when they
need to make difficult decisions to keep them in business. I would like
the Government to explore how they might make access to finance

I was elected to the House, I was a full-time trade union official and
legal officer for the GMB. I dealt daily with people who were suffering
from the effects of exposure to asbestos. It is heartbreaking to speak
not only to the individuals who know there is death sentence hanging
over them, but to the families that they leave behind. Some of the
victims are older, but many are young. It is a terrible disease. Some
people can be exposed to quite high levels of asbestos and not have

response to the issue is a shame and a scar. If it had affected
middle-class communities in leafy Surrey, for example, it would be a

the Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen Metcalfe)
spoke eloquently about tackling antisocial behaviour in his

the detail; my concern is that we have had many Bills to deal with
antisocial behaviour, since way back when Tony Blair was Prime
Minister. My feeling is that we probably need a cultural change in our
society rather than more legislation. There 
<?notus-xml column=303?>seems to be something fundamentally wrong with people’s beliefs
about their responsibilities and activities in public and the way they
impact on others, from simple things such as spitting in the street to
putting their feet on bus seats. These are all problems that contribute
to antisocial behaviour and a general sense of unease in society among
those whom we live alongside.</hs_Para>

final issue I am keen to address is immigration. This is a debate about
jobs and business—the economy encompasses both jobs and

which we have heard today from

while I was working in my office yesterday, I heard an histrionic

identity of those living in their properties is a good one. I cannot

migrant countries and about the problems they have caused. I have a lot

several people living in garages told me that they could not afford to
go home. On a recent ward visit to Watford Way in Hendon, one of my
constituents and I went to an old commercial garage in which scores of
people were living rough. These were people who beg locally and they
were visibly east European. I spoke to some of them who claimed that
they did not have the money to get back home. Funds are available,
however, and I should like them to make use of them, because their
current lifestyle is unacceptable. That is the face of Labour’s

allowed to work, but those restrictions will soon end, and they will
have three months in which to demonstrate that they can support
themselves. If they cannot do that, the Border Agency will summon them
for an interview and ask them what they are doing. If they refuse to
turn up, there is nothing that the agency can do. It should be an
arrestable offence not to turn up, but it is not, and they can be
picked up again in future sweeps. Moreover, they can leave the country
and come back again, in which event their three-months time frame will
start all over again. The Immigration Bill should address some of those
points, and I hope that the Government have heard my

unemployment in my constituency is currently 14.3% as against a
national average of 7.2%. That is totally unacceptable. It is double
the national average and will be blighting the lives of those young
people, possible irrevocably. Why is it always the north-east that
suffers when there is a Tory in the Prime Minister’s office? Do
not our kids deserve as fair a chance as the kids in the shire
counties? Are they always going to be at the bottom of the list of
priorities for Tory and for Lib Dem Ministers, perhaps because their
parents vote for Labour in droves? One nation Labour will not behave in
such a way when we are in office. We will govern for the whole of the

constituents have been looking for signs that this Government are on
their side, rather than on the side of the super-rich, and for signs
that they are going to tackle the big issues which have such a big
impact on the quality of life of so many people—lack of
affordable housing, rising fuel bills, poor economic performance, zero
growth and a weak jobs market. They will have been sorely disappointed
as there were no measures to tackle any of them, and there was nothing
to arrest the increase in child poverty. Earlier this week, the
Institute for Fiscal Studies projected that there would be more than 1
million extra children in poverty, wiping out the progress made by the
last Labour Government, and surely saddling the country with huge costs
over the lifetime of those children in lost opportunities and increased
health and earnings

were some important items of legislation in the Queen’s Speech,
of course, but in the main my constituents got a list of vague ideas
designed by Lynton Crosby to try to woo right-wing voters back into the
Conservative fold—I include some Government Back Benchers in
that group. There was very little positivity for the future, very
little vision for a fairer and more modern Britain and very little to
put food on the tables in Washington and Sunderland West.</hs_Para>

all that, I am hopeful about one Bill. The consumer rights Bill
announced in Her Majesty’s Gracious Speech has, of course, been
long anticipated; indeed, time is running out for it to be introduced.
As Members will be aware, the European directive on which it is based
needs to be implemented by December, so the Government will no doubt be
in a rush to make significant progress on the Bill before the House
rises for the
summer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000152">During
that rush, I hope to make my case for the Bill to include measures to
reform the secondary ticketing market to ensure that fans get a fair
deal. I was very encouraged to hear the shadow Secretary of State for
Business, Innovation and Skills, my hon. Friend the Member for
Streatham (Mr Umunna), confirm in response to my intervention during
his opening remarks that, if the Bill introduced by the Government
contains no such measures, he will seek to make amendments to ensure
that the wild west that the secondary ticketing market has become is
reined in and
regulated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000153">Members,
and certainly Ministers from the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport, will remember that I introduced a private Member’s Bill
in the first Session of this Parliament that attempted to start this
process. It would have established a scheme whereby those who are
putting on a ticketed event—whether that is a gig, a west end
show or even an art exhibition—could, if they wanted, protect
those tickets from being resold by unauthorised individuals or
companies for a mark-up of more than 10%. People would still be able to
resell their tickets if they could no longer attend an event, but not
for a huge profit.</hs_Para>

have noticed that I said, “even an art exhibition”. There
is actually a roaring trade for such tickets. The Da Vinci exhibition
at the National Gallery hit the headlines last summer because tickets
were being snapped up by touts, much to the annoyance of the National
Gallery, which felt absolutely powerless to do anything to prevent it.
Anyone who wants to see the exhibition on David Bowie that is on at the
Victoria and 
<?notus-xml column=309?>Albert museum will find themselves having to fork out at least
£60 for a weekend ticket, which is more than four times the face
value.</hs_Para>

I thought that my Bill was a sensible way to empower artists and
event-holders to protect their fans from the rampant profiteering that
we see on a regular basis. I believe that even more now. However, I
also believe that the market needs to be much more transparent, as
consumers should know who they are buying from and the provenance of
the ticket. That is how any market should work.</hs_Para>

number of reasons why I am more convinced than ever that we need
action. Since my Bill was talked out by the usual suspects on the
Government Benches, we have had an excellent exposé by the
“Dispatches” programme of how websites such as viagogo
and Seatwave, through which the vast majority of secondary tickets are
now sold, operate. Surprisingly enough, that differed greatly from the
image that they used to portray of themselves of being fan-to-fan
exchanges. They used to have that description on their websites, but
since they have been exposed they have taken that down. We saw tickets
being sold as if by fans when those companies were receiving
allocations of tickets directly from promoters, or using banks of
phones and batteries of credit cards registered to multiple addresses.
We also saw how those companies court what we call “power
sellers”—professional touts who manage to secure huge
inventories of tickets to events by highly dubious means such as
botnets, which Chris Stewart of Ticket Hut was recently found by the
<I>Daily Mirror</I> to be using to secure vast swathes of One Direction
tickets. I am sure that there are a number of One Direction fans in the
Chamber today.</hs_Para>

more concerned about the murkiness of this industry is that football
tickets are now being sold through those websites, with clubs
exploiting their right to authorise resale by saying that the likes of
viagogo and StubHub can do that, even though it is actually random
season ticket holders who are doing so. The resale of football tickets
through other channels is understandably banned, due to safety
concerns, and many people might think that the resale of football
tickets is illegal, because there is supposed to be legislation. The
purpose of the ban is to ensure that hooligans cannot get their hands
on any tickets, and that fans of each team are
segregated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000158"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Pound" PimsId="218" UID="13051035000513" xid="478" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000513">Stephen
Pound:</Member></B> Every word I hear from my hon. Friend makes me all
the more furious that her excellent Bill was talked out. Is she aware,
as many of us are in the House, that Sir Alex Ferguson’s last
match in charge of a certain team from up north is already attracting
ticket prices of £3,000? Surely, under those circumstances,
action must be
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000159"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mrs Hodgson" PimsId="4742" UID="13051035000514" xid="842" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000514">Mrs
Hodgson:</Member></B> I agree. There is obviously the unfairness, but
there is also the fact that there was supposed to be legislation to
protect football audiences from unscrupulous fans. Nothing stops any of
those fans who might be able to get hold of that amount of money going
along and ruining an amazing occasion such as the last match that Sir
Alex will be in charge of. I certainly do not have any confidence in
the websites that are now authorised by the clubs to sell tickets,
because their ultimate aim is to 
<?notus-xml column=310?>make profits and I do not think that they are best placed to uphold
the principles with regard to hooligans and
segregation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000160"><Member ContinuationText="Lyn Brown" PimsId="4752" UID="13051035000515" xid="905" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000515"><B>Lyn

legislation to protect the Olympic tickets. It was a proviso of the
International Olympic Committee that the country that hosted the
Olympics must protect the tickets, and it worked very well. Although
the tickets were really hard to get hold of, the allocation was made
fairly and they did not go to the highest bidder. Later I shall mention
Operation Podium, the Met unit set up to police that
legislation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000162">Despite
the clear evidence in the “Dispatches” programme, and in
a number of Penman and Sommerlad columns in the <I>Daily Mirror</I>
since then, the sports Minister, the Minister of State, Department for
Culture, Media and Sport, the right hon. Member for Faversham and Mid
Kent (Hugh Robertson), has remained steadfast in his opposition to such
a move. So I am now looking to the Secretary of State for Business,
Innovation and Skills to look more favourably upon such measures in his
forthcoming consumer rights Bill. The sports Minister has, however,
always been at pains when we have debated this issue to say that his
mind could be changed. Indeed, in a Westminster Hall debate on
secondary ticketing secured by the hon. Member for Hove (Mike
Weatherley), who also campaigns on the issue and who supported my

in my own opinion, the moment that the security services or the police

now the police have that evidence. Operation Podium, which Members may
be aware was the Metropolitan police’s dedicated response to the
serious and organised crime affecting the economy of the London Olympic

Crime: Problem Profile”, published in February to coincide with
the unit’s abolition, set out the extent to which fans are being
“ripped off” through dodgy practices. It also laid bare
the involvement of organised criminal networks, which will always be
involved where there are large sums of money to be made in a
semi-legitimate way. As for large sums, the Met estimates that the
“industry”, if we may call it that, is worth 
£1 billion a year—a not insubstantial sum of

the Chancellor sitting on the Front Bench looking like a little boy
lost, with no idea what to do about a flatlining economy, the loss of
our triple A status or the level of borrowing, and no idea how to
balance the books. So he delivered a Budget that did none of that,
sitting on his hands, hoping that things would just
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000177">After

much evidence do the Government need that their policies are failing?
The International Monetary Fund says that growth in the UK is slower
than in 23 of the 33 advanced economies it monitors. Olivier Blanchard,
its chief economist, warned the Chancellor that he is “playing
with fire” by refusing to change course. However, there was
nothing in the speech to address the IMF’s call to boost growth
and rethink the speed of the deficit reduction. Starting to build HS2
in a few years, welcome though that is in Bolton West, will do nothing
to build the economy now.</hs_Para>

the same day that the Queen delivered that terribly thin speech, the
Institute for Fiscal Studies said that 1 million more children will
descend into poverty as a direct result of benefit policies. Simply
saying that people should work hard and blaming the poor for the
situation they find themselves in is an insult. The Joseph Rowntree

working households, 6.4 million people lack the paid work they want and
1.4 million part-time workers want full-time work, the highest figure

created. Despite the Secretary of State’s denial, according to
the Office for Budget Responsibility unpaid work experience and work

who are out of work and the 1 million young people who do

people are desperate for work and there is a substantial churn of
people in poverty or out of work. Although 18% of people are on a low
income at any one time, one in three of us experience at least one
period on a low income in a four-year period, and 11% of people are on

programmes to meet the demand is a real problem and a real challenge.
If young and other unemployed people were given the opportunity to get
a foot on the employment ladder, we could reduce not only the level of

appalling indictment of his performance in his role and shows his
failure to get people into work. I find it deeply disappointing,

interventions earlier, but they provided very little room for optimism.
We need to look at how people’s everyday lives are affected by
these issues. As I was saying, in my constituency, graduates, school
leavers and those who have left further education just want an
opportunity. They want this Government to answer their needs, but that
is what is failing. Whatever our political leanings and whichever
parties we happen to be in, the critical thing is to get people into
work so that they can make their contributions. The fact that that is
not happening is the Government’s failure, and they need to take
responsibility for it and think again about their policies, which are
not working
adequately<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000259" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000259">Let
me deal in more detail with graduate unemployment. In a constituency
such as mine, numerous family members are coming out of university,
often having been the first in their families to have gained degrees,
but they are often struggling to get into work. Despite some major
economic opportunities around the City and Canary Wharf, there is a
mismatch between people’s potential, their skills and the
opportunities to get into those institutions. I believe the Government
could do more to support graduates and those leaving further education
by making it easier for them to make the transition into those
institutions that are traditionally not easy to enter—financial
organisations, the creative industries and many other sectors in our
city. The cost of graduates being out of work and claiming benefits
when they could be making a contribution and lifting their families out
of poverty is an example of the missed opportunities. Taking action to
deal with that could provide an easy win.</hs_Para>

to get a large number of graduates back into work, as they get very
little help when they leave university to make that transition.
Graduate unemployment among those from working-class or ethnic minority
backgrounds is disproportionately higher than it is for other groups,
but it is a real struggle for all graduates. I ask the Secretary of

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000261" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000261">I

that that Bill was not supported, and I was present in the Chamber
during some of the debates on it. Although the Prime Minister has said
publicly that he is determined to stick to the 0.7% target, the fact
that he promised legislation and has now reneged on that sends out a
signal that he is not absolutely committed to it. I have heard many
calls from his Back Benches saying it is wrong to have that 0.7% target
and that the money should, for example, be moved over to the Ministry
of Defence and be spent on defence instead. Given those ripples of
discontent emanating from the Conservative Back Benches, the Prime
Minister should have nailed his colours to the mast and made it very
clear that the Government were not for turning on that

before Prorogation, the Government published a draft Bill on wild
animals in circuses, but that, too, was not specifically mentioned in
the Queen’s Speech. Animals in circuses might sound like a
trivial issue compared with big topics such as jobs and employment and
getting economic growth going again. However, this omission sends out a
signal about the Government’s lack of will or nerve to introduce
legislation. My view is that we could deal in just a day or two with
legislation to outlaw wild animals in circuses. Almost 95% of the
public back a ban, and when the House debated a motion on this on 23
June 2011, the Government made concessions to a Conservative
Back-Bencher who was pushing the issue, and said, “Yes,
we’ll bring legislation forward.” That was almost two
years ago, and now we have a half-hearted measure saying, in effect,
“We’re going to bring forward draft legislation because
this is such a complicated issue.” There are only 20 animals
left in circuses in this country, but apparently this is so complex it
has to be put out in the form of draft legislation and then examined by
Committee, and the Government will not be able to 
<?notus-xml column=327?>bring in a ban until the end of 2015. That seems absolutely laughable
given that there has already been a two-year delay. Basically, we

Bills that I was pleased to see in the Queen’s Speech was the
Mesothelioma Bill, although I share the concerns of my hon. Friend the
Member for North Durham (Mr Jones) that it is not comprehensive enough
and does not deal with all the details. When I was a junior
lawyer—I think that it was 25 years ago, which is quite a scary
thought—I acted on one of the very first mesothelioma cases. It
took us six years to get resolution. One problem was that the deceased
man in question—we were acting on behalf of his widow—had
worked for some very small companies. He was a central heating engineer
and it was absolutely impossible to trace those companies, because they
were almost one-man bands and were no longer in business. However, for
a period he worked for Vauxhall Motors. The breakthrough moment came.
We could not find any living witnesses who could prove that the
deceased man in question had worked with asbestos at that time. Then I
happened to talk to my grandfather and it turned out that my
grandfather had worked with him and knew him quite well, so we came up
with a witness almost by chance.</hs_Para>

it was a struggle to get that case through. At the end of the process,
the man’s widow received a settlement of about £80,000,
which in the late 1980s was a considerable sum. However, she said,
“If I had known the pain and hassle that I’d have to go
through, and the endless meetings with solicitors, I really would not
have done it.” We want to ensure that other widows and other
people who are suffering from mesothelioma do not have to go through
that process.</hs_Para>

“What’s your experience of the service we’ve

zero for “dismal”. Every time I tried to text zero, the

There is never a button with a message saying, “If you want to
tell us to get lost, press this” or whatever. I am not saying
that it should be compulsory for companies to have a “We want
nothing more to do with you” button on their automated phone

any intention of decarbonising our power sector by 2030. I also

was an opportunity for the Government to bring forward in this
Queen’ Speech measures that would tackle the issue. I was very
disappointed yesterday when phase 3 of the Courtauld agreement, a
Government-led commitment to reducing food and packaging waste, was
announced. There is a target for retailers and manufacturers to work to
reduce household food waste by just 5% by 2015, and to reduce their own
waste—the waste that they create in the supply chain—by
just 3%. Given rising food prices, and as people become better educated
about the things that they buy, it is estimated that we will meet such
targets anyway. So the target is meaningless. The Government had a real
chance to push forward with measures to prevent food waste. Between 30%
and 50% of edible and healthy food is wasted in this country, and half
that waste is generated by the food industry. In Westminster Hall
recently we heard the Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food
and Rural Affairs, the hon. Member for Newbury (Richard Benyon),
telling people how they could reduce food waste and stop throwing away
food that was in their fridges. He told them not to keep bread in the
fridge and offered other helpful little tips, but we need to tackle
what the food industry is doing. It is the industry that should drive
the level of change that is needed. If the industry will not do so and
if the Courtauld commitment does not contain the targets that will make
the industry act, there should be a mandatory obligation on large
retailers and manufacturers to take steps to 
<?notus-xml column=330?>reduce their food and packaging waste. The Government could have
introduced that in the Queen’s Speech but they did

pleasure to wind up this debate on the Gracious Speech, but on a topic

at the fact that there have been twice as many speakers from the
Opposition Benches as we have heard from the Government Benches. Often,
as we have looked at the Government Benches in the course of the

appear to be very few people on the Government Benches who are prepared

the Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna), the shadow Business Secretary,
concluded. After three wasted years, we have this year had a wasted
Queen’s Speech. The task on Wednesday was simple—to give
us a legislative programme as big as the challenges that face our
country. What we got instead was practically nothing. It seems that
this Government are incapable of proposing any ideas that they can
agree on. They are a weak Government who are out of ideas, and that is
why the public want them out of office. They have chosen to fight the
biggest economic battle confronting this country for decades by arming
themselves only with
pea-shooters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:02:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000292">We

brilliantly by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:02:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Streatham. We have an economy that is flatlining. We
have growth of just 1.8%. That is a third of the level of growth seen
in the United States. Living standards are falling. The wages of our
constituents have fallen by £1,700 a year since the election.
Our constituents are getting poorer. GDP per capita has fallen by
£1,500 since the election. Unemployment is rising and
is 90,000 higher than at the election. The consequence of
all this is a catastrophe for the public finances. Borrowing is now
£245 billion more than forecast. Worst of all, perhaps, is what
is happening to the fundamentals of our
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000293">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Tamworth (Christopher Pincher) expressed some
confidence that the economy is beginning to rebalance. If only.
Consumer demand is flat. Business investment is stalled. We had great
hopes that economic growth would come from some kind of rebalancing
towards exports. As the Business Secretary said in his lengthy but
rather good essay in the <I>New Statesman</I> not long ago, there is
not necessarily a problem with global demand. The problem is that we in
these islands are not tapping into that
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:04:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

about 20% and exports grew by a third. If our economy is to grow at the

grow exports by 45% over and above the level we saw in 2009, but we are

challenge is not simply that global demand conditions are
weak—the Business Secretary said as much in his <I>New
Statesman</I> essay—but that our exporters are losing market
share. The Prime Minister is fond of telling us that we are in a global
race, but the problem is that we have stalled on the starting grid. He
is instead locking us into a race to the bottom, with a policy that
will deliver nothing better than low growth, low skills and a low-wage
future.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000298" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000298">Those
are the challenges that the Queen’s Speech should have
addressed—the investment crisis on the one hand and the jobs
crisis on the other—but there were big holes where the Bills on
promoting investment and growing jobs should have been. Let us start
with the investment crisis. The Breedon review showed some time ago
that SMEs in our country confront banks that are deleveraging on a
scale unseen anywhere else in Europe. The country’s investment
rate is now under 15%. It is flatlining and well below the levels seen
elsewhere in Europe. Business investment is £11 billion lower
than it was during the peak before the crash, and there is falling
investment in the venture capital industry, which is £80 million
down on the last set of
figures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000299" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000299">Meanwhile<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:09:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
in corporate bank accounts cash is piling up. It is what the incoming
Governor of the Bank of England, Mark Carney, has criticised in Canada
as the phenomenon of “dead money”. Dead money is piling
up in bank accounts in this country because the business community does
not have confidence in the Government’s economic plans, yet all
we got in the Queen’s Speech was a carry-over Bill on bank
reform. As the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:07:40"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for South Basildon and East Thurrock (Stephen Metcalfe)
said, that will probably not unlock the kind of business and banking
investment we need. The Chair of the Treasury Committee has criticised
the Bill because he found the Government’s arguments
insubstantial. We did not get answers to Britain’s investment
crisis in the Queen’s Speech, which is why it is such a wasted
opportunity.</hs_Para>

wasted opportunity on jobs is perhaps more serious. Unemployment today
is 90,000 higher than it was at the general election. There is simply
not enough 
<?notus-xml column=332?>work to go around. Once upon a time we were promised a welfare
revolution, and no doubt it was well intentioned, but the Work
programme is not delivering for those who need jobs or those on
employment and support allowance. I look forward to some reassurance
from the Secretary of State when he responds. Universal credit, again,
was a good idea, but if its virtues are confined to 300 citizens in
Tameside, I am afraid that it will not revolutionise the back-to-work
business here in Britain.</hs_Para>

worst of all, the Secretary of State stands before us today as a man
who has failed the test he set himself in Easterhouse. Unemployment on
three quarters of our worst estates is going up, not coming down, and
long-term unemployment is going up on two thirds of those estates.

been a little more generous about the fact that this Government are the
first to make such a commitment— stay static, get to 0.7% of
GDP, and implement it. It would be more helpful to say, “Yes,
this is the right thing to do.” We can by all means debate
whether we need to lock that commitment into legislation, but the
reality is that we have locked it in because the Government have made
it clear that we will not depart from it. We can debate the realities
of the legislation, but we are spending more as a proportion of our
gross domestic product than any other Government have previously done,
and that has shown a lead to the rest of the world.</hs_Para>

brings me to a series of points about labour market stats. Let me run
through a few of the realities, even though sometimes it does not help
the Opposition. Since the last election, the number of people with a
job is up by well over 750,000. There are 1.25 million more private
sector jobs since the election, meaning that over the past year, six
private sector jobs have been created for every job lost in the public
sector. The number of people of

Duncan Smith:</Member></B> I want to get through this point because I
think it is important. The number of working-age people without a job
is down—I stress that—by 350,000 since the 2010 election,
driven by falling inactivity. Inactivity is now at its lowest level for
two decades; the Labour party left us with a high rate of inactivity,
and we have lowered it. There are now fewer people and fewer young
people on jobseeker’s allowance than when Labour was in office.
The number of claimants aged 18 has fallen for the 10th consecutive
month. In April, we had the lowest number of new jobseeker’s
claims for four years, alongside falling redundancies. Let me deal with
Opposition Members’ suggestion that those people are moving not
into real work, but into part-time work. 
<?notus-xml column=337?>That is not true. In fact, full-time employment is up more than 500,000
since 2010—it is up 64,000 on the last quarter
alone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000339" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000339">My
final point on that is that Opposition Members need to lift their heads
up occasionally and look elsewhere. My right hon. Friend the Secretary
of State for Business, Innovation and Skills compared our situation
with that of France, which has 11% unemployment. That comparison bears
out very well what the Government are doing. The UK’s overall
employment rate is growing at almost double that of the US, and faster
than the rate in any other G7 country. That is because the Government
have taken the tough decisions to ensure that we have the flexibilities
and that people can get back to work. The private sector is now
creating jobs, whereas under the previous Government, it was shedding
jobs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0002.htm#13051035000340">Let
me remind Labour Members that, for all their crocodile tears, long-term
unemployment nearly doubled in two years under the previous

people into sustained work. That is unlike what happened under the

resemblance to his latest programme, gave paid employment to new deal
failures who had been out of work for two years. It was never rolled
out nationally because it was discredited, even within the Labour
party, as not giving value for money. For those nearest to the labour

1919, war veteran Jack Cohen began to sell groceries on a small market
stall in the east end. By 1929, he opened his first store in North
London, and by 1979 his chain of stores had expanded so much that sales
topped more than £1 billion. That success has continued. It now
has more than 3,100 stores in the UK, with successful operations across
Europe and Asia. It made a pre-tax profit last year of £3.5
billion. Mr Cohen’s market stall has gone on to spawn the global
supermarket chain we all know as Tesco. Despite its size, however,
Tesco always argues that it is a responsible employer. Its mission

have seen that demonstrated in my own constituency of Harlow, where
Tesco employs 750 staff in its stores alone, and often makes valuable
contributions to the local community. Only recently, it generously
donated equipment to four schools in Harlow. Indeed, I regularly shop
at Tesco myself, and I have to say that the staff are second to none. I
have absolutely no grievance with Tesco workers; this is about
decisions made by senior people in relation to the workers in Harlow

came as a shock to the whole of Harlow when Tesco announced that it
would be closing its depot, affecting approximately 800 workers. This
has been exacerbated by how Tesco has treated its staff, in
particularly in three areas: the notice staff were given, the reduced
pay and conditions offered to those able to transfer to an alternative
site, and its treatment of disabled
workers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000357">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:33:19"></hs_TimeCode>
the new Dagenham site was announced, staff in Harlow were assured that
the extra distribution site was in addition to the depot in Harlow, to
allow further expansion into London, rather than a replacement. The
hon. Member for Dagenham and Rainham (Jon Cruddas)
also<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:33:28"></hs_TimeCode> thought
that that was the case. Representatives from USDAW were continually
reassured, at director level, by Tesco that the Harlow depot would stay
open, and those assurances were passed on to workers. That continued to
be the case just a week before they announced that the Harlow site
would be closed. Naturally, workers feel aggrieved that Tesco was not
upfront about its intentions, and they feel that it was making plans to
close the site behind the scenes. Harlow workers are particularly upset
that their hard work has made the Harlow depot one of the
best performing sites in the country. Tesco has chosen to reward that
hard work by closing the site and making them redundant.</hs_Para>

receive great service by “motivated staff”.

warehouse staff, while the Dagenham rate of pay is £8.72, which
is kept low due to the use of agency workers. That is unfair for both
agency staff and permanent Tesco workers. Employees have told me that
when Livingston staff transferred to a new depot, Tesco allowed them to
retain their pay. I simply ask Tesco to allow its Harlow staff to do
the same.</hs_Para>

have been shocked at Tesco’s treatment of its disabled workers.
Let us take John Waters, for example. John is 60 years old and suffers
from epilepsy and arthritis. He has worked hard for Tesco over the last
24 years. Tesco has rightly made adjustments at the Harlow depot to
allow him to complete a day’s work. However, if John  is
to transfer to Dagenham, he will not be allowed  to take those
adjustments with him. Or let us take Richard Waite, who has 17
years’ service with Tesco. He unfortunately suffers from
tuberous sclerosis. In Harlow, Tesco has recognised the difficulties he
faces by lowering his performance target on its performance

one disabled employee I have spoken to—who does not want to give

been threatened by Tesco and told not to continue his grievance with me
about taking his adjustments with him to Dagenham. In a recent meeting,
he was told by a Tesco manager that if he continued talking to his MP
about his case, he would be made redundant, instead of being allowed to
transfer to Dagenham. That is unacceptable. It is absolutely outrageous
that my constituent should come to talk to me about the problems that
staff face and then be threatened by Tesco managers that if he talks to
his MP, he might be made redundant. That is not the way that a company

reassure them. I ask Tesco to honour its role as a responsible employer

is also a problem with agency workers. In the Harlow depot there are
two types of agency workers. Some are contractors who deal with things
such as catering. The other agency workers are based in the warehouse
in Tesco, doing the same jobs as permanent workers. Tesco says it
cannot allow either type of agency worker to transfer to another Tesco
site. However, there is an issue about the agency workers who work in
the warehouse doing the same work as permanent Tesco employees. There
are around 140 such workers, many from eastern Europe, who also work
extremely long hours, despite being paid less for doing exactly the
same work as permanent Tesco colleagues, many of whom are long-standing
Harlow residents. Tesco manages to do that by employing the Swedish
derogation of the agency workers regulations. This allows an agency to
employ staff on a minimum contract, which means that they continue to
be paid between assignments, but also that they waive their rights to
equal pay. It is also worth noting the impact that this has on the
local economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:44:16"></hs_TimeCode>.
In today’s difficult economic climate, is it right that an
employer such as Tesco should replace its full-time staff, often with
workers from overseas, and use the Swedish derogation to get around
offering them equal pay? I believe that Tesco is wrong to do that, as
it leads to discrimination against giving jobs to local
people.</hs_Para>

call on the Government today to look into the Swedish derogation and

Tesco to live by its philosophy of treating people how we like to be
treated by minimising the number of staff it makes redundant, by
allowing workers to transfer on the same pay and conditions as they
receive in Harlow, and by allowing disabled workers to take with them
any pre-existing adjustments they already receive. That would be a good
decision for Tesco, allowing the company to keep motivated and
dedicated staff, and good news for their staff and their families who
are currently under immense pressure. The people of Harlow have
respected Tesco; all I am asking is that Tesco treat the people of
Harlow with the same respect. It has deeply damaged our community and

how he brought together the local community—the trade unions and
the council as well as the business. He raises an important issue about
a big international corporate, which in my role as Business Secretary I
support in many of its overseas operations. Tesco is a big operation,
making £300 million in profit, as the hon. Gentleman described.

I found most appalling in what the hon. Gentleman said were the threats

debate will be read by people higher up the company, who will then
better understand what has been happening in Harlow. I hope that he
will understand that, for the most part, this is an individual

me take the hon. Gentleman’s points in turn. The loss of 800
jobs has, of course, been a big shock to his community. That is a lot
of jobs, and difficult issues related to redundancy are involved. Those
issues are not unique to this case, but it is a big closure, and I
understand why he is concerned about
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000385" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000385">UK
retail is a very competitive business. All retailers are constantly
innovating, which, ultimately, is good for consumers. The current
climate has required UK retailers to think again about the services
that they offer, which frequently leads them to re-engineer their
businesses and combine all the various retail channels so that they
offer the consumer a seamless, integrated, flexible experience. As we
have seen in the case of several of the leading retailers, that may
involve the upgrading and relocation of distribution centres. I think
that the hon. Gentleman indicated that there were other examples as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000386" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000386">It
does not always follow that there are staff redundancies. In many
instances, employers are able to offer workers alternative jobs or the
opportunity to relocate. The hon. Gentleman mentioned correspondence
from which it appears that Tesco tried to relocate some jobs, although
not in a way that he found very satisfactory. For some, however,
redundancies may end up being the only option. Employers will have, or
should have, made reasonable efforts to find and offer suitable
alternative employment. In such cases, employees have a wide range of
rights, including the right to be consulted about redundancies and the
right to a minimum notice period, and ultimately they are protected
under law against unfair dismissal.</hs_Para>

clearly desirable for employers to give their workers as much notice as
possible of changes that might affect their employment, that cannot
always be done. However—I am sure that the hon. Gentleman is
aware of this, as he is clearly in close contact with
USDAW—employers are under a statutory obligation to provide
minimum periods of notice and to consult employees before they can be
made redundant. I understand that a formal consultation is taking place
in line with the statutory obligations, following which Tesco intends
to serve notice on affected staff.</hs_Para>

me to the issue of the terms on which the contracts could be
renegotiated, and the issue of pay. It is always open to either party
to seek renegotiation of the terms of an employment contract, and there
will be a variety of reasons for that to be done. I think it was
acknowledged in the Queen’s Speech debate that has just taken
place that in many cases workers have accepted lower pay as the price
of keeping jobs. That is often what we mean by the rather bland word
“flexibility”. The hon. Gentleman clearly feels that it
has been unfair in this case, but it has frequently been a necessary
part of adjustment to local labour market
conditions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000389" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000389">We

implementing its existing company pay protection

employer may not change the terms of any employment without the
employee’s agreement. In most cases, responsible employers are
already implementing good practice and complying with the law, but as
the hon. Gentleman will know, the Government have developed a range of

early conciliation and mediation to be sought. As a last resort, an

hon. Gentleman raised a series of issues relating to inequalities of
treatment. I noted what he said about the apparent favouritism given to
management as opposed to less senior staff, and in particular, his
point about agency workers who use the “pay between

derogation. The issues are complex because different categories are
involved, but I shall try to deal with them in broad terms.</hs_Para>

Gentleman mentioned, workers in this category do not qualify for equal
pay under the agency workers regulations. Instead they become permanent
employees of a temping agency. Importantly, they are entitled to be
paid between assignments at the rate of at least 50% of the pay they
have received, usually in the prior 12 weeks of work.
Pay<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:54:52"></hs_TimeCode> between
assignment contracts gives agency workers more certainty about their
pay when an assignment ends. Just like other types of contract, such as
part-time or fixed-term, they will not be suitable for all people. What
is important is that individuals and businesses have a choice about the
type of contracts available to them so we maximise the opportunities
for individuals to find work suitable for their particular situation.
He has, however, raised in trenchant terms the failure of this
particular model, and we will look at the implications of
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:55:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000393" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000393">Turning
to the issue of the disabled, the hon. Gentleman gave some moving and
worrying accounts of the way in which individuals had been dealt with
at the Harlow plant, and the reference to the threats was particularly
troubling. Let me address the broad issue of disabled workers, however.
Provisions to address disability discrimination are set out in the
Equality Act 2010. Among other things, the Act aims to prevent
discrimination against disabled people in employment, and in this
particular case certain legal aspects will need to be pursued. One of
the ways the Act aims to prevent discrimination is by requiring
employers to make reasonable adjustments where a disabled person is put
at a substantial 
<?notus-xml column=346?>disadvantage in comparison with non-disabled persons. The Act seeks to
achieve a balance between the rights of disabled people and the
interests of employers, and employers are therefore only required to
make adjustments that are reasonable. Factors such as the cost and
practicability of making an adjustment have to be taken into account. I
trust that Tesco has taken the necessary steps to assist disabled
employees to progress and remain within its organisation. Ultimately,
it would be for an employment tribunal to decide whether an adjustment
would be
reasonable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:56:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000394" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000394">The
Act also requires employers to ensure that any redundancy criteria and
procedures do not indirectly discriminate against disabled employees.
They must consider whether any procedures they adopt which apply to all
employees might have a particularly adverse effect on disabled
employees in general, and would place a disabled employee at a
particular disadvantage. Again, I am sure Tesco has taken the necessary
precautions, but an individual can, of course, seek the support of ACAS
in resolving a matter or seek redress through a
tribunal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-10T14:57:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13051035000395" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/debtext/130510-0003.htm#13051035000395">My

local partner organisation and Harlow council, the response service has

affordable housing. £60 million is being allocated to
20 partnerships which suffer from significant clusters of empty homes
which have good market prospects but require an intensive approach to
return them to a liveable standard. This will produce a further 3,600

meters are becoming available to more and more people—removing
estimated bills and giving customers better information to manage their
energy consumption and choose the right tariffs for them. The coalition
are committed to making smart meters available to everyone as soon as
possible. We support moves by some suppliers to offer smart meters as
early as possible and we have already taken steps to support this.
Today we are announcing further policies designed to give energy
suppliers confidence to move

have decided that from the end of this year, when a customer switches
from a supplier who has provided them with a compliant smart meter, the
new supplier cannot replace that smart meter with a dumb meter and must
either rent the previous supplier’s meter or install their own
new smart meter. This will give greater confidence to early movers over
their investments. We are also proposing for consultation that, when a
customer with a compliant smart meter switches supplier, the new
supplier must continue to provide remote meter readings. This would
make sure that customers continue to receive 
<?notus-xml column=16?>one of the important benefits of smart metering: more accurate bills.
These and related proposals are set out in today’s Government
response to the consultation on the foundation smart market. Industry
has told us that they expect to roll out in excess of 2 million
compliant smart meters to customers over the next two years of the
foundation stage of the smart metering roll-out and today’s
proposals will give them even greater investment confidence to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051033000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/wmstext/130510m0001.htm#13051033000034">In
December 2012, the Government committed to review the programme plan
and timetable during the first half of 2013, taking into account
learning from energy suppliers from their early smart meter deployments

infrastructure (the “DCC services”) necessary to support
smart metering on a nationwide

part of the procurement process, DECC has therefore tested with bidders
for DCC communication and data service provider contracts, and with the
energy industry, the time needed for the design, build and test phases
of their programmes. The consistent message was that more time was
needed if the mass roll-out was to get off to the best possible start
and ensure a quality experience for consumers. We therefore now expect
suppliers to be ready to start their full scale roll-out by autumn
2015, supported by the DCC
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13051033000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130510/wmstext/130510m0001.htm#13051033000036">Completing
the national roll-out will be an enormous logistical and technical
challenge for the industry, involving visits to around 30 million homes
and small businesses and installing over 50 million meters. To this
end, and reflecting the extended period to build and test the systems
required by industry, the Government have decided to move the
completion date for the mass roll-out from end 2019 to end
2020—although I expect the vast majority of smart meters to be
in place against the original 2019 deadline. Getting this right for
consumers is the Government’s priority and this package of

a successful
