was disappointing. Many people feel that this is by far the worst of
the welfare changes that the Government have made. There is mounting
evidence not only of financial hardship but of families and individuals
coming under severe emotional pressure. A particularly sad case was
reported just last week in which there was a tragic outcome. It seems
that the warnings of many noble Lords in our earlier debates on this
subject have been borne out. I urge the Minister to reconsider this tax

designed, first, to save money. We are looking to save £500
million a year here, which is within the context of the overall saving
of £2 billion that we are trying to make over two years. The
bulk of the burden has been on the private rented sector, on the LHA
basis, and that has gone through reasonably safely. We are monitoring
this particular change. All these changes have to be looked at very
carefully and we need to keep a very close eye on this one, and we are
keeping a very close eye on it. The change is designed to make sure
that people can respond by trading down, pulling in lodgers or looking
for work. People can make a behavioural response here, and clearly we
are looking for that response.</hs_para>

explained, there are a large number of exemptions which are made
through local authority discretion. The Government have, however,
insisted on a certain number of exemptions, and one of the most welcome
is the recent exemption given to a disabled child who was unable to
share a bedroom. Will the Minister extend that commitment to include a

substantial exercise by many local authorities and housing associations
around the country to try to juggle people’s requirements. The
figures on social-sector housing provision in England show that 31% of
the housing has one bedroom, 34% has two bedrooms and the remaining 35%
has three or more bedrooms. So there is provision. It is a question of
getting people moved into the right accommodation. Let us not forget
that 250,000 people are in overcrowded circumstances and 1.8 million
people are on the waiting list for social

a family consisting of a disabled couple who have two children and live
in a house that has one double bedroom and two single bedrooms. They
cannot move because there is no stock in rural Norfolk for them to move
to. They cannot work because of their disability and caring
responsibilities. They cannot afford the bills. They are applying for
discretionary housing payments but that will run out by about
September. At that point they will run into severe arrears. Would the

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, the idea of providing discretionary
housing payments is twofold. The first is to allow for the costs of
making a change and a transition; and the other, in some cases, is to
maintain the family in an appropriate home indefinitely. One of the
most obvious examples of the latter is specially adapted homes where it
does not make sense to move. So there should be a strategy of support
for that couple regardless of whether it is in the short term or the

class, poverty in India still exists on a horrendous scale. It is worse
than all the African countries put together, with 500 million people
living on less than $2 a day. One of the great advantages of DfID aid,
as the Minister knows, is that it was focused on the poorest of the
poor. Can she spell out—or, at least ask DfID to spell in more
detail and set down on paper—what particular practical
arrangements are being made for the continuation of these projects. On
a government visit to these projects last year, of which I was a

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the London Ambulance Service has advised
that the article in the <I>Sunday Times</I> was slightly misleading, in
that the two members of staff who attended that particular patient were
student paramedics in their third and final year of training and so
were sufficiently qualified to work unsupervised. It is inaccurate to
call them “unqualified”. The issue in this case was that,
despite their qualifications and experience, the crew did not act in
accordance with their training or the procedures that were laid down.
That has been acknowledged by the London Ambulance Service, which has
said that it believes that the failings are not reflective of the
hundreds of ambulance staff who provide a high level of patient care to
Londoners every
day.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000051"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Harris of Haringey" PimsId="853" UID="13051539000269" xid="1743" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000269">Lord
Harris of Haringey:</Member></B> My Lords, the Minister has suggested
that, on the issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of
Parkes, it is really down to the management of ambulance trusts to make
all those decisions. There is widespread concern around the country
about the delays in ambulances reaching emergency cases. For example, I
am told that the police now find that they are the first responders and

<?notus-xml column=401?>end up having to take people to hospital. Is this a problem with the
management of ambulance trusts or is it about the level of resources
being made available by commissioners for emergency services and

services?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13051539000270" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000270">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> The noble Lord is quite right that certain areas of
the country have seen unacceptable delays in ambulance response
times—I am aware of two trusts in that regard. However, this is
not an issue around a lack of trained paramedics. Projections by the
Centre for Workforce Intelligence show that there is a secure supply of
paramedics until 2016. The College of Paramedics has stated that
training posts on courses are always filled and, currently, 900
ambulance technicians are training to become paramedics. We are
seeing an increase in paramedic numbers, which is
encouraging.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Masham of Ilton" PimsId="1733" UID="13051539000271" xid="1341" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000271">Baroness

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the issue here is that they were not
unqualified, as I tried to convey. All ambulance trusts in the UK allow
student paramedics to work unsupervised, but only after they have had
nine months’ operational experience and have passed both a
written exam and a clinical practice observation by a qualified
assessor. In this case, the London Ambulance Service accepts that,
despite their qualifications and experience, the crew did not act in
accordance with their
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000057"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jolly" PimsId="5895" UID="13051539000275" xid="2109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000275">Baroness

Howe:</Member></B> I think that my noble friend is referring to first
responders, who should be integrated into the clinical governance
structure of all ambulance trusts. The outcomes will be assessed for
all calls regardless of who attended the calls in the first instance. A
first responder is just that—further ambulance staff would
always be sent to a call. In rural areas, these staff can often get
there first and provide immediate help, so the use of those people is a
matter for local decision.</hs_para>

case, the ambulance trust—to ensure that it has a body of
suitably trained and experienced staff. That depends on regular
monitoring and ensuring that training is kept up to date. Equally, it
is up to commissioners to ensure that the service that they are
receiving is delivered by suitably experienced and qualified people.

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I refer noble Lords to my
health interests in the register. To follow on from the noble
Earl’s final comment, is this not an example of staff such as
nurses being trained to be practitioners in the health service but
finding that they have not been given enough practical training when
they come to treat people on the front line? The noble Earl will know
that Health Education England is being established as a
non-departmental public body in the Care Bill. Can we ensure that that
body has much more control over the curriculum of those being trained

Howe:</Member></B> The noble Lord makes a series of very important
points about training. The answer to his final question is that, yes,
Health Education England will certainly be looking at the degree of
training required to fulfil specific professional tasks across the
piece in the health service, including the ambulance service. However,
I do not think that this case reflects a lack of appropriate training
on the part of the individuals involved. They were appropriately
trained; they were just incompetent. That is the

been due to open today’s debate, has been unexpectedly called
away from Parliament on an urgent family matter. I am honoured
therefore, as government spokesperson for the Department for
International Development, to be taking her place. This debate will, I
know, range very widely, and there is enormous expertise in this House.
I look forward to all contributions and to the response at the close of
the debate from my noble friend Lord
Astor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000065">Representing
my noble friend Lady Warsi, I wish to spell out our foreign policy
priorities. In the next 12 months we will continue to build
Britain’s global reach and influence in line with our core
priorities—to safeguard our national security, to promote our
prosperity and to support British nationals overseas. I want to set out
this agenda in four areas, which I will take in turn. These are: first,
responding to the immediate foreign policy issues that we face;
secondly, our work to promote Britain’s values across the world;
thirdly, our efforts to support economic growth; and, fourthly, the
steps that the Foreign Office is taking as an institution to ensure
that we are fully equipped to take forward this important
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000066">The most
immediate crisis facing us is the humanitarian disaster unfolding in
Syria, an issue that has much occupied your Lordships. Over 80,000
people have been killed, and over 6.8 million people are in dire need
of humanitarian assistance. Evidence of torture, summary executions and
the systematic use of rape is widespread. We must achieve a political
solution to bring a fast but sustainable end to the conflict. We are
therefore pleased that Russia has agreed to encourage the regime to the
table. This could represent a step forward. We need now to ensure that
it delivers tangible progress towards a transition. However, there is
still work to do. That is why we think it is even more important that
we amend the EU arms embargo to incentivise the opposition to come to
the table and increase the pressure on the Syrian regime. We have
always said that an amendment to the embargo is designed to create the
conditions for a negotiated
solution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000067">The
United Kingdom is playing an important role on Syria, supporting the
moderate opposition with £12.1 million of assistance last year,
and now contributing £170 million to the humanitarian response.
DfID is front and centre in this response, and I am proud of that. We
will redouble our efforts to end the violence and achieve a political
transition, and will continue to support the UN’s investigation
into the use of chemical
weapons.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000068">Elsewhere
in the region we are maintaining our support for political and economic
reform in the wake of the Arab spring. While many of the countries
affected are facing challenges, progress has been made. We have seen
the first ever democratic presidential election in Egypt, a new and
democratic Government in Tunisia, and a new and more open constitution
in
Morocco.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000069">Through
the Arab Partnership we have committed £110 million from 2011-15
to promote political and economic reform, and we are working through
the Deauville Partnership to promote open economies 
<?notus-xml column=405?>and inclusive growth. At the height of the Arab spring, the UK played a
crucial role in supporting the Libyan people in their struggle for
freedom. Effecting long-term change after four decades of dictatorship
takes time and there remain significant challenges, but we must not
lose sight of the progress made over the past two years. The United
Kingdom remains committed to supporting Libya’s transition to a
democratic, stable and prosperous country through the provision of
advice and capacity building on security, justice and economic
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000070">However,
lasting peace in the Middle East will be achieved only if a solution is
found to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I am sure that noble Lords
will underline that point in this debate. This is a critical year for
the peace process. There is a need to return to credible negotiations,
but it will require bold political leadership and both parties to build
trust. President Obama and Secretary of State Kerry have shown a strong
commitment to pushing the peace process forward, and we will do all we
can to support US
efforts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000071">The
Government also remain focused on Afghanistan. We seek an Afghanistan
that can maintain its own security and that is not a safe haven for
international terrorists. This requires us to help to increase the
capability of the Afghan national security forces, to make progress
towards a sustainable political settlement, and to build a viable
Afghan state with a strengthened economy. The ANSF now leads 80% of all
security operations and are on track to assume full responsibility for
security by the end of 2014. This will help us to reduce the UK
military presence by nearly half this year.</hs_para>

international donors, the UK will provide long-term support through a
£70 million commitment to sustain the Afghan national security
forces after 2014, and a £178 million per year commitment until
2017 to support governance and development. This is crucial. We are
not, as some have sought to argue, seeking to cut and run. I know from
my work in DfID how committed we are on this front, especially to
ensuring that the gains that women have made are not lost.</hs_para>

courage and professionalism of our troops. Four hundred and forty-four
British service personnel have lost their lives in Afghanistan since
2001, and we will never forget the sacrifice that they and their
families have
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000074">Of
course, it is not just from Afghanistan that threats to the UK’s
security have emanated. The In Amenas attack in Algeria, the attack in
Boston and the rising trend in kidnapping for ransom among terrorist
groups in north-west Africa highlight the continued threat that we face
from terrorism. To counter this effectively, we need to combine
creative work from our intelligence agencies and police with
intelligent diplomacy. It is crucial that we work with international
partners to address the conditions in which terrorism thrives. We will
use our G8 presidency to ensure that this issue remains at the very top
of the international
agenda.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000075">That
brings me to the action to halt the military advance in January of
al-Qaeda-linked extremists in Mali. UK logistical assistance and
intelligence sharing 
<?notus-xml column=406?>supported a swift French and African military operation that radically
diminished the threat in northern Mali. We continue to encourage
Mali’s transitional authorities to pursue an inclusive
reconciliation process that supports long-term
stability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000076">Nuclear
proliferation remains a further threat to our security. In Iran, we are
determined to prevent the regime developing a nuclear weapon. In the
past year, we have intensified our efforts, as part of the E3+3, to
find a diplomatic solution, but Iran’s position still falls far
short of what is needed to achieve a breakthrough. We will continue to
apply pressure in pursuit of a peaceful, negotiated solution.</hs_para>

Korea remains a concern, not least following its satellite launch in
December and nuclear test in February. We have worked hard to secure
two UN Security Council resolutions in response and the strengthening
of EU sanctions. We are making it clear to the regime that North
Korea’s long-term interests will be promoted only by
constructive engagement with the international

responses to these issues have been guided strongly by our values.
There is no time in this speech to go into detail on the huge amount
that we do globally to support and defend human rights and
democracy, but I want to highlight some specific
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000079">The
first area is freedom of religion or belief. The past year has seen
more religiously motivated attacks and more cases of abuse,
imprisonment and discrimination throughout the world. We need to
strengthen the global political will to address the underlying causes
of this problem. We will be building on this work in the coming year,
which will also see us run for election to the UN Human Rights Council
in November. We believe we have the experience and commitment to make a
strong contribution to the council’s
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000080">Secondly,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:50:06"></hs_TimeCode>we have sought
to rally international action on the prevention of sexual violence in
conflict. My right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary has shown
real leadership on this issue, which is central to conflict
prevention and peacebuilding worldwide. We have created a team of
experts to help build the capacity of bodies responsible for
investigating and prosecuting sexual violence; agreed an historic
declaration on preventing sexual violence in conflict at last
month’s G8 Foreign Ministers’ meeting; and secured
commitments from the G8, including support for the development of an
international protocol and £23 million in additional funding for
this issue. These actions have started to build an international
coalition to end impunity for rape and sexual violence as a tactic of
war. We will continue the momentum by putting this issue on the agenda
of the UN Security Council next month and the UN General Assembly later
in the year. We also hope the Foreign Ministers’ declaration
will be welcomed by the leaders at the G8 summit in
June<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:51:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000081">As
noble Lords will probably know, DfID is supporting work on this on the
ground in Syria and Jordan. My right honourable friend the Secretary of
State for International Development has made women and girls a
top priority of DfID’s work. I commend my honourable friend
Lynne Featherstone, who, within DfID, is taking forward a campaign to
tackle female genital mutilation, seeking its end within a generation. 
<?notus-xml column=407?>DfID, of course, looks to support the most vulnerable in the world and,
for DfID, women and girls are therefore centre

third area is that we have helped to bring to a successful conclusion a
seven-year, UK-led campaign for a UN international arms trade treaty. I
pay tribute to my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary
of State Alistair Burt for his work on this. The treaty, adopted on 2
April, will hopefully make the world a safer place by saving lives,
aiding development and stopping arms reaching the world’s most
vulnerable regions. We will sign the treaty as soon as possible and aim
to ratify later this year. We will encourage as many countries as
possible to do the same. I pay tribute to the many people in the House
of Lords who have played their part in bringing this
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000083">The
fourth area is our leadership in supporting peace and stability in
Somalia. Two years ago al-Shabaab controlled large parts of the
country, piracy was growing and the threat from terrorism was acute.
Today, a co-ordinated international effort has seen African and Somali
troops drive al-Shabaab out of its strongholds, the creation of a new
legitimate Government and a diminishing threat from piracy. The second
London conference held last week was an important further step on the
path to a peaceful and stable Somalia. The UK will remain actively
engaged in this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000084">The
fifth area is the UK’s work in Burma, where we continue to shape
the reform process. The past two years have seen the release of
political prisoners, credible by-elections, initial ceasefire
agreements and steps towards increasing humanitarian access to conflict
areas. However, Burma needs to bring all ethnic groups into the
process. We will continue our important work with Burma, including on
inter-faith issues, and we are reviewing how we might assist with
police
reform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000085">Sixthly,
we supported the agreement of a Commonwealth charter, which has for the
first time given the organisation a single statement defining its core
values. We debated this in the closing stages of the last Session.
Given the importance we attach to the Commonwealth, my right honourable
friends the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary will attend this
year’s Heads of Government Meeting in Sri Lanka. It is important
that we are involved in the meeting and promote issues that matter to
us. However, we continue to have concerns about human rights in Sri
Lanka and will use every opportunity to encourage
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000086">Seventhly,
we are continuing with our work to support the British Overseas
Territories. Good governance forms an important part of our work with
the territories, together with ensuring their security and encouraging
their economic development. We will continue to protect the Falkland

year, the United Kingdom honoured our promise to spend 0.7% of gross
national income on development. As my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State for International Development has made clear, we are
the first G8 country to do so. This is critical because tackling
poverty in the world’s poorest places helps us tackle the root
causes of global problems that matter to Britain, from disease and
drugs to migration and

economic growth and prosperity remains a particular focus of our work.
My right honourable friend the Prime Minister wants to use our G8

Trade and Investment Partnership. We are a trading nation. We do not
just want to trade with Europe, we want to have a say over the rules
that govern that trade. This is exactly what our EU membership gives
us. Membership of the EU is in the UK’s national interest. My
right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made it very clear that
he wants Britain in the EU, shaping the debate on the things that
really matter, such as reducing burdens on business, pushing trade
deals with fast-growing economies and preventing a nuclear-armed Iran.

United Kingdom policy has left us becalmed, or worse. The crisis makes
the formulation of foreign policy all the more difficult—an

East is unpredictable and the outcomes of the Arab spring are still far

diplomacy and a willingness to use force in the cause of peace,
anchored to a resolution where no ethnic or other group was completely
denied a living space, a credible state and economic institutions. It
was a sort of cantonisation, I know, but it none the less persuaded
people that they were not being driven out of their homes permanently

outcome, but, with the exception of criminals such as Mladic, it has

overview of the developments in defence, foreign and commonwealth
affairs and international development. I will concentrate my remarks on
the latter. Within that framework, the UK has, through DfID and the
FCO, maintained a reputation over the past decade and more as a world
leader in international development. To our great credit, our
development programme has been maintained in spite of our straitened
economic circumstances. Our overseas development aid is expected to
rise to some £11.7 billion this year as we meet the target of
investing 0.7% of gross national income—a target agreed by the
G8 and others to help global efforts to meet the millennium development
goals or MDGs.</hs_para>

growing concern that the UK has yet to enshrine this target in law as a
permanent feature of our international development commitment. The MDGs
were set to be achieved by 2015 but that is clearly not going to
happen. It is clear that few if any developing countries will achieve
all the goals. This must not be painted as failure. In reality,
probably in every case, developing countries have made significant
progress towards meeting some if not all of the goals, progress that
arguably would not have been made without the MDG initiative. The

results of a survey carried out among more than 600 MPs at the
Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly meeting in Quito. That revealed that
MPs overwhelmingly backed democratic governance as a stand-alone
objective for the UN post-2015 sustainable development goals—the

of the most pressing issues, particularly on the African continent, is
the predicted shortfall in the production of enough food to meet the
needs of a burgeoning population. According to the Montpellier Panel at
Imperial College, more than 200 million people, 23% of Africa’s
population, are classified as hungry and 40% of children under five in
sub-Saharan Africa are stunted due to malnutrition. Sub-Saharan Africa
has a current population of about 875 million, which is expected almost
to double by 2050 to close to 2 billion. The Montpellier Panel believes
that a new paradigm to tackle food insecurity is urgently needed,
through a programme of sustainable intensification. That, it says, will

policy to be reviewed? It seems counterintuitive that while sub-Saharan

more and more land is being switched from food production to growing

principal concern is that the funding required to match the force
levels for 2020 is not assured. Indeed, it seems from the trends in
defence budget squeezes of the past couple of years that there is no
longer any realistic expectation that Future Force 2020 is financially
achievable. Added to that are the delays in future equipment delivery
with carriers and F-35, for example, the latter now possibly further
affected by the sequestration issues in the United States. There is
still no provision for the maritime air capability lost when Nimrod
mark 4 was abandoned. Combat air was almost halved in 2010, when the
Harrier force and some other front-line squadrons were disbanded. The
mooted projections of yet more force reductions in combat air
further weaken a vital capability mounted with impressive speed and
professionalism in the Libyan campaign two years ago, or in the ongoing
work of the Tornado force in Afghanistan. The paucity of naval surface
ships has created well rehearsed difficulties in meeting global
commitments. Army regular force levels are to shrink by 20%. The
prospect of relying ever more on the reserves has yet to be achieved or
put to the test.</hs_para>

seriously diminishes the putative scale and endurance of any future
expeditionary commitment, but senior Ministers seem to be in denial
about this. They still sound minded to strut their military stuff on
the world stage. They rightly sing the praises of today’s Armed
Forces but mass, too, counts in conflict. Do the Government realise
that today they carry more of a sharp twig than the big stick of
yesteryear? Moreover, as numbers are scaled down the resilience of the
remaining forces is compromised. A favourable air situation and our
operational and tactical skills, which have generally outmatched the
opposition’s, have been providential but some future operation
might not enjoy the benefits of such air and tactical supremacy, and
low own-side losses.</hs_para>

the unexpecteds that could also involve serious numerical
loss—losses that could be the equivalent of a 20% or 30% cut of
the total strength available or even more, not a more manageable 5% or
10% attrition. Unexpected major risks might be: a serious loss of key
passengers in an air transport accident; a major hangar fire with maybe
six, a dozen or more airframes, engines and other critical kit lost in
the bonfire; or even an extreme weather event which, as the Minister
will know, can cause major damage to aircraft caught by it. I have not
dreamt these risks up. They have happened. Is it not foolhardy to
presume that they will never happen again? Is the Minister satisfied
that enough allowance is being made for unlikely but catastrophic
loss—for the unexpecteds of life—other than in combat
operations?</hs_para>

many of your Lordships, I am deeply concerned about the situation in
Syria. I welcome the recent visit of the Prime Minister to President
Obama, but I particularly wish to acknowledge the initiative of US
Secretary of State Kerry in his dialogue with the Russians and the
proposal to convene an international conference on Syria before the end
of the month. Last year, I met the Russian ambassador to gain first
hand the Russian perspective on the conflict. I welcome the initiative
that looks to be in the process of being taken. That meeting last year
followed one with Alistair Burt, who expressed the hope that a tipping
point had been reached in Syria. Regrettably, no such tipping point was
reached, and the evidence of that is clear in the growing sectarian
nature of the conflict. A particularly disturbing piece of evidence
lies in the recent kidnapping of two metropolitan bishops from Aleppo
and the absence of any ransom demands for their
release.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000138">While
some evidence exists that the various parties are realising that a
negotiated transition is better than a fight to the death, does the
Minister agree that in the absence of a political solution, the
international community needs to contain the crisis by limiting the
flow of arms to Syria and by strengthening the capacity of neighbouring
countries to provide for the welfare of refugees? I raise this question
because I regret the ongoing intention to seek an amendment to EU
sanctions in relation to arms for Syria because if the Americans and
Russians are successful in convening a peace conference, is such a
strategy over arms provision the wisest thing we could be doing? The
recent intervention in Libya offers evidence that the provision of arms
without due attention being paid to the potential decommissioning
thereof ought to leave us with some anxiety. Providing arms in this
increasingly fragmented conflict makes any strategy for decommissioning
arms, post conflict, very difficult.</hs_para>

much as we hope and pray that a peace plan emerges from the diplomatic
process, history suggests that such plans have durability only if the
plan is owned locally and championed internationally. Rather than
seeking the lifting of sanctions on the supply of arms, could Her
Majesty’s Government consider how their role might contribute to
being a custodian of any settlement? That would include taking steps to
ensure that the Syrian National Council plays a constructive role at
the peace conference, offering support to any regional or international
peacekeeping force and facilitating, ensuring access and co-ordinating
the humanitarian response. This would be an entirely appropriate action
for our Government to be engaged in. While it is widely accepted that
President Assad has no future in Syria, the wider question is whether
his departure should be seen as an outcome of a diplomatic process,
rather than the precondition of beginning one.</hs_para>

Howell of Guildford:</Member></B> My Lords, I will concentrate on two
points. There has been a lot of talk about what was missing from the
Queen’s Speech, mostly focusing on aspects of the European
debate. However, my concern is with another word that was missing: it
is “Commonwealth”. It was mentioned briefly by the
Minister when she spoke but it did not appear in the Queen’s
Speech, which is a great pity. Last year, we managed to get it in, but
I notice that it is not there this year. The Queen is a worldwide
figure, respected, with vast influence across the whole planet. She
makes a speech before all the high commissioners, covering a vast area
of 53 nations and encompassing a third of the human race.</hs_para>

3.7%. It is the gateway to all the new markets, all the areas in which
this country must succeed to survive. I am not saying that it is an
alternative to the European Union, but the fact is that the EU is
flat-lining and struggling with its unending problems over the euro,
which will go on for many years; we need that to be repaired, of
course. However, the truth is that all our success, all the statistics
and a growing volume of evidence show that all the growth in the next
17 to 20 years will be in Asia, Latin America and, particularly, in
Africa. These are the areas that the Commonwealth spreads across and to

Commonwealth is growing at 3.7%, which is good by European standards.
The Commonwealth countries are not just the old countries in
difficulties. It is a vast range of the fastest-growing high-tech

Australia, Canada and so on. These are leading nations with, in many
cases, a higher income per head than us. On top of those is the new
range of Commonwealth countries coming into the prosperity league
either side of Africa, as they find through the shale gas revolution
that they have fantastic raw energy resources and prospects. They are
increasingly setting up their own sovereign wealth funds, from which we
in this country will be borrowing. Rather than helping them, we will be
borrowing from the sovereign wealth funds of the Commonwealth in order
to finance our dilapidated infrastructure. Therefore, to leave the
Commonwealth out of the story is a big mistake, and the word should

naivety of some of my colleagues—some quite senior
people—and the oversimplifications they make when they speak
about the European Union as though it were a sort of canoe you could
pop in and out of. My noble and good friend Lord Heseltine tells us

concern of the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, about outside isolation is
quite wrong. In fact, if we were out of the European Union, we would
still not be in an independent state, but in an interdependent state.
We are totally interdependent and bound up closely with the concerns of
almost every other country in the globe, because this is a network
world with super, instant, continuous connectivity. That is what
changes the whole nature of international relations. There is no
question of being independent. Even the rogue states find that they
have to bow to international pressures. We would be bound by a thousand

contra, if we stay in—and that that is the route I prefer,
contrary to my noble friend—it is not true that we would be
irrelevant and powerless, because the European Union is itself in total
flux. It is undergoing a complete re-examination of its philosophy of
integration, and the eurozone is the place where the divisions lie.
People talk about Europe divided as though it were divided between the
eurozone core and the countries that are somehow left out, including
Britain. That is not where the division lies. The division goes
straight through the middle of the eurozone. That is the slice through
the middle of the apple. Half of the eurozone is made up of countries
with one kind of approach, and half of countries with another, and they
will continue to be in trouble and to have difficulties for years to
come. They have not even succeeded in getting as far as a
bankers’ union. Italy has one idea on that, and Spain, Greece,
Portugal, Cyprus, and the other small countries all have other views.

will have to take on 
<?notus-xml column=422?>more responsibility for its own security. The US has consistently
supported us in the European, African and near-eastern area. Are we
really not going to support them in the Far East and Pacific if the

to the

our nation? At the time of the Falklands war, when the Royal Navy saved
the Government’s bacon, we had about 60 destroyers and frigates.
The difference in capability of our new ships does not make up for the
huge lack of numbers; one ship cannot be in two places at once. We have
cut to the bone and, in naval parlance, our nation is standing into

Ashdown of Norton-sub-Hamdon:</Member></B> My Lords, in listening to my
noble friend’s speech at the Dispatch Box, I was struck by a
lacuna. I hope that she might take this opportunity to clarify the
position of the Afghan interpreters. We are in severe danger
of committing an act both unwise and discreditable, if not
shameful. I cannot understand why my Government have not before
now clarified the position of these men, who have placed their lives at
the service of our country and stood shoulder to shoulder with our
troops in some of their most difficult hours. Without them,
those troops could not have acted at all.</hs_para>

from our troops in this sense: our troops can be sure that their
families are home, secure and safe, in Britain, whereas they cannot. 
<?notus-xml column=423?>Their families live, day in and day out, threatened by mortal threat
from the Taliban in Afghan society. Our troops come home every six or
nine months, whereas they do not. They have served us, day in and day
out, month in and month out, year in and year out, yet the Government
are havering as to whether they should have the same rights that
interpreters had in Iraq. We are not asking much; we are not asking
anything new, or for something that the Government have not done
before. The precedent is already
established.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000165">There
are some 400 Afghan interpreters—that is all. So what is holding
this up? What is the Government’s position? I am told that the
Ministry of Defence is perfectly content to make sure that those same
conditions are offered to these brave men—they are all men, of
course—who have done such service to our nation and to our
troops on the ground. I am told—and it surprised me, because
this is where I thought the problem might be coming from—that
the Home Office is perfectly content. I am told that it is coming from
Downing Street. I do not know whether that is
true.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000166">The
Prime Minister has certainly said—and I understand where he is
coming from—that he wants these men to stay in Afghanistan,
because they have something to contribute there. I understand that. I
remember very well in Bosnia the damage done by the internal brain
drain, when salaries paid to those working for the international
community so outweighed those paid by the local community that, for
instance, my driver in Afghanistan was getting more than the Prime
Minister. I understand that and I understand that the Government may
wish to put an economic value on those people, if they wanted to stay
and contribute to Afghanistan in peace.</hs_para>

plucking one out of thin air. I imagine that it is nowhere near this,
but let us say that it is £50,000 for such people to stay in
Afghanistan. That is fine—I am glad that the Government are
prepared to monetise the value of their continuing in Afghanistan.
However, the choice must be theirs to take. It is theirs to decide
whether they want to balance their own life and face the risk, under
mortal, declared and deliberate threat from the Taliban, against the
sum of £50,000. Let us double that. I wonder how many of your
Lordships would accept £100,000 to leave yourselves at such
mortal risk, and leave your family there as well. If the Government
wish to come forward and place a sum of money that expresses the value
of their staying in Afghanistan, I am entirely for that, provided that
the choice is left to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000168">It is
time that the Government came clean on this and acted in honour. It is
time that we did not continue with this shameful delay in clarifying
the position of these men. We have paid a very high price for our

of dishonour by leaving these people in the

second point is on Syria. I heard what the noble Baroness said and I
welcome what the Prime Minister said. I congratulate him on negotiating
with the Russians the possibility of a peace agreement. It appears that
there is a chance of that happening. That is good. I do not accept that
it will deliver very much; having a 
<?notus-xml column=424?>peace agreement is not the same as delivering a
peace, but it is good that we should try to obtain such an agreement.
What worries me is the implied threat that lies behind that. I heard it
explicitly in Paris, it is also being said in Whitehall and it is
certainly being discussed in Washington that we should lift the arms
embargo. I have to say that that would be an act of the
grossest folly.</hs_para>

why that is the case. What is the reasoning for this argument? Do the
rebels need more arms? No, they do not. Some 3,500 tonnes of arms have
been delivered, funded by rich Saudi businessmen and Qatar and
facilitated by the CIA. By the way, that 3,500 tonne figure is not
questioned by American official sources. Arms have also come from
Croatia. We are talking not about tanks in that 3,500 tonne figure but
about small arms. There is no shortage of weapons at all. By the way, I
know where they are coming from: they are coming from Tito’s
underground arms manufactories in Bosnia. I have no doubt that that
arms trade is also funding their deeply corrupt forces. As I say, there
is no shortage of arms. Indeed, the Government admit that there is no
shortage of arms. They say, “We will supply arms in
order to influence the moderate forces”. However, it is a
fundamental fallacy that you influence people by supplying them with
arms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000171">However,
the real danger that I worry about is that we have misread the
situation. Some in Britain believe that this is somehow Bosnia
revisited. No, it is not; almost nothing about the present situation in
Syria is comparable with that of Bosnia. It is deeply more complicated.
By the way, those of us who knew something of Bosnia during the Bosnian
war never recommended that we should lift the arms embargo.</hs_para>

the law of unintended consequences will come into play again. We
believe that we are fighting a rather simplistic battle between a
brutal dictator and innocent citizens. Actually, I have to tell noble
Lords that behind this a different battle is being fought. It is not a
battle for Syria; it is a battle in which Syria is only one front line.
What we are now seeing being prepared is funded by Saudi Arabian
businessmen—I have to believe with the agreement of the Saudi
Arabian Government—and the Qataris: namely, to capture the Sunni
Umar and to radicalise it as a preparation for a wider war against the
Shi’ites. That is what this is about. Some seek to produce that
outcome. The war being fought in Syria is the same as that being fought
in Mali, Libya, Egypt and elsewhere. The Salafists and Wahhabists do
not love each other very much but they are working with the same aim of
capturing the Sunni Umar as a precursor to a wider war. I do not know
whether they will succeed, but that is their intent. I think that that
would be
catastrophic.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000173">It
is important that we understand the Russian position on this. It is not
just about supporting their last supporter in the Middle
East—Assad—but about the fact that they know that the
same thing is happening in their Muslim republics, such as Dagestan. We
need to understand that there are forces in the Arab world for whom the
war is no longer a war against the great Satan; it is the preparation
of a war against the great refusant of the Shi’ites. What is at
stake here is a wider regional war. Mao Tse-Tung used to say that the
First 
<?notus-xml column=425?>and Second World Wars were the European civil wars.
Perhaps they were. Perhaps that is a better way of looking at it. It is
possible to have a regional war with global consequences. It would be
disastrous if we were inadvertently to stoke that up and enable it,
with weapons being passed out of the control of those whom we would
like to have them into the control of those whom we would not. It would
be disastrous if the wider consequence was not that of alleviating the
situation in Syria but that of building towards a much wider conflict
in which we are instrumentalised on the side of the Sunnis and the
Russians are instrumentalised on the side of the Shia. Let us at least
understand what is at stake in this. I earnestly hope that we can
achieve peace, as innocent people are suffering terribly every day in
Syria, but let us not, by lifting the arms embargo, contribute to an
even more terrifying and widespread
conflict.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/4875B494DAD352D8D1EC7D0DA566A6A9B8075865" __version__="1.14"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 May 2013">Wednesday,

am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, in her
role as “super sub”, for her introduction to the debate,
given that the statement on the Government’s international
position in the gracious Speech is perhaps rather economical with the
truth. There is no reference to the Commonwealth, although the
Commonwealth is on the rise; there is no reference to the European
Union, although it is the foundation of our international relations;
and there is no reference to the serious situation in Syria. The only
reference is the intention to “support countries in

more difficult to decide on which day in the debate to speak because in
reality some elements of international affairs cover not only the
European Union but economic, financial and home affairs. However, that
is a consequence of our membership of the European Union. I wish to
pick out some significant points in relation to EU affairs, notably how
best we should carry through the course on which we have set
ourselves—most recently in the Bloomberg speech by the Prime
Minister and in the considerable amount of referendum speculation that
is now all around us. We have to keep up the competition with the other
House<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:01:28"></hs_TimeCode>. The point
of my intervention is that we need to examine the potential for
agreement with other member states and the extent of existing
flexibility in order to maximise potential improvements. What can be
wrong with seeking potential improvements in the European Union, and
seeking them soon?</hs_para>

begin by congratulating the Government on their detailed examination,
sector by sector, of the balance of competences. We need a solid base
of information and adequate consultation of those directly concerned by
the balance of competences between the EU and the member states. This
exercise is substantial. The latest programme I have seen for the
spring and winter shows that departments are working on nine important
sectors of policy such as environment and transport, and on some of the
most controversial such as asylum and immigration. We need to establish
as efficiently as 
<?notus-xml column=426?>possible what the balance of competences is for
future discussion and possible negotiation within the EU. There has
been some critical comment that other member states are not
participating, but that is hardly surprising because the eurozone
member states have important and immediate economic problems on their
agenda. It does not change my view that the balance of competences
exercise can throw up anomalies and identify unnecessary legislation
that some member states in due course may wish to
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:03:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

improvements, it is important not to exaggerate the impact of the
European Union on all our daily lives, although such exaggeration is
common. Whole areas of policy such as defence, education, housing and
health are only marginally touched by EU action. Further, public
opinion in the UK is often more critical of some EU action
on smaller issues—“meddling”, to use
the word of the anti-EU commentators—and that is fully
understandable because there is scope for some cooling off, both of
purely national secondary legislation and of some EU-derived secondary
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:03:54"></hs_TimeCode>.
Recent yearly statistics provided by the Library showed that 10,662
pages of secondary legislation went through this House, of which 8.5%
was derived from the European Communities Act and 91.5% was our own
legislative mountain. The balance is striking and, of course, some EU
legislation expires on a regular
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051539000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051539000179">I come
now to a second element of flexibility within the EU—enhanced
co-operation between a limited number of member states. On balance, I
think that this is positive, but we need to be very careful to protect
our own position. This is what we should be doing in relation to the
proposed financial transaction tax, on which the EU Select Committee
has urged the Government to consider a legal challenge.</hs_para>

generally, enhanced co-operation between a number of member states
allows those member states to participate but it keeps the initiative
in their own hands.
Enhanced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:06:02"></hs_TimeCode>
co-operation derives from the treaties—the treaty of Amsterdam
and subject to some change subsequently—but it is clearly not a
one-size-fits-all system and is inconsistent with the normal
application of legislation to all member states. It sits alongside
other actions, such as partial opt-outs of the passport-free area and
so on. Since there is frequent criticism in the United Kingdom of EU
one-size-fits-all legislation, I take the view that enhanced
co-operation could sometimes be of potential value for the UK. Of
course, everything depends on the conditions. Those conditions are that
it must be a last resort and must not affect the competences, rights,
obligations and interests of non-participating member states in
particular. However, where it has been, or is likely to be,
applied—for example, on patents—it could be of some
economic value to us. It would enable an inventor to register a patent
once instead of in multiple EU states, and in relation to
pharmaceutical patents, which are of considerable economic importance,
this would be in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:06:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

most of the balance of competences exercise and the potential of
enhanced co-operation. We still have before us the decision to be taken
by the UK Government on the application to the UK of a large raft of EU
law in the area of justice 
<?notus-xml column=427?>and legal affairs, including the European arrest
warrant. If, as I assume, the Government will wish, before the Lisbon
treaty deadline next year, to opt out, it would be very helpful to know
whether they do or do not believe that it would be desirable to seek to
opt in on some individual measures. I think that we need to be clear

in the possible run-up to a referendum on the European Union it is very
important that the British public have the best information rather than

they are for the members themselves, and we should not hide criticism
if it is justified. However, I hope that we will not lapse into
generalised criticism of the finances of Union institutions and their
administration, which has happened. In fact, year after year the Court
of Auditors has given an unqualified clean bill of health to the

West, referred to the seven-year gap in our carrier capability. We face
some serious problems in our currently limited capability. Given that
difficult situation and the challenge referred to by the noble and

the world. If I end on one note it will be to echo the right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Bath and Wells when he said in his contribution
that a determined effort should be made to try to rally moderate
religious forces. The danger otherwise is that the Shia-Sunni conflict,
along with the spread of jihadism and fundamentalism in the dangerous

protect us and 
<?notus-xml column=430?>our families, our country and our national interests, often risking life

is the chief characteristic of the modern world, it is difficult to
escape the conclusion that it is, as the noble Lord, Lord Howell, said
earlier, its networked nature. What also strikes me is that it is the
predominance of this country in global networks that has led to the
United Kingdom becoming known as a great power. It came about
originally through exploration, then through the domination of our
naval networks around the world, and then through the domination of the
financial sector because of the networked nature of international
finance. I want to spend a few moments talking about something that
receives little attention, but I think it should because it is the
central characteristic of today’s networked world, and that is
cyberspace. I do this in the full belief that it is essential not only
for our growth and our pre-eminence, but for our national security and
our defence. I declare my registered interests in the academic and
private sectors in this subject.</hs_para>

environment characterised by its breadth—it is transnational,
across over 192 countries. It is deep, because it diffuses power
downwards, now to nearly 4 billion people who have never been able to
gain information, to influence or to communicate before. It is
ubiquitous and now runs through politics, economics, finance and our
social networks, as well as many other aspects of life. It is truly the
first environment made by men and women. It is not just an amalgam of
technologies anymore or a means of communication, it is an environment
like the land, sea, air and space. That has enormous consequences for
us in terms of our national security. It means that we now have a fifth
domain of warfare potential as well as a source of great opportunity.
That makes us very vulnerable if we are not alert to it, both in
concept and in practice. Of course, cyberspace has been an amazing
gateway of opportunity for billions in the world, but it has also seen
an equal growth in virus and malware development; from the first
malware inserted by floppy disk back in 1981 to the myriad threats we
now see. I will not rehearse them to this House but they are extremely
sophisticated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000021">Suffice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:21:45"></hs_TimeCode>
it to say that three years ago, when I chose to raise the subject in my
maiden speech, the pursuit of the study of cyberspace was regarded as a
rather iconoclastic occupation of mine. We now hear of malware attacks
every day, on big names such as Microsoft, Apple, Lockheed Martin,
ThyssenKrupp and so on. It might astonish your Lordships to know that
it is much more widespread than just those headline names. Last year,
93% of companies in the United Kingdom with more than 250 staff
suffered a cyberattack on their systems. It is not just the
quantity—we now face an increasingly sophisticated array of
persistent attacks, sometimes lasting months or years. They are
targeted, adaptive and dynamic attacks that can change as they hit the
defences that have been installed for them. They can involve compromise
of the supply chain and the storage of
vulnerabilities—reconnaissance, if you like—in order to
probe weaknesses for future use. All this is going on at the moment and
that 
<?notus-xml column=431?>vulnerability will increase as we move to consumer technology in our
workplaces: smartphones and so on, the movement to the cloud, and the
“Internet of Things”, from road charging to pacemakers.
All that will become more and more
vulnerable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000022">Why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:24:28"></hs_TimeCode>
does all this vulnerability from the network world matter to defence
and national security? It is because our critical national
infrastructure is now more vulnerable than ever before. Software
systems and industrial operating systems will protect our water
supplies, supply our energy distribution and generation, land our
planes, run our trains, heat our homes and underpin our
hospitals. They will become the infrastructure on which our lives,
livelihood and morale depends. Why use an expensive platform such as a
nuclear submarine to launch an expensive weapon such as an
intercontinental ballistic missile when we have that platform in all
our pockets and in an iPad in most of our
bags?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000023">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T17:24:28"></hs_TimeCode>
of them now allow the possibility of enormous damage, as can be seen
through the operation of the Stuxnet virus, which, unknown to the
Iranian authorities, was effectively running—or
mis-running—the centrifuges that were meant to produce their
enriched uranium. All that, every passing day, should alert us. I have
just learnt today that there has been another wave of attacks on major
US corporations, specifically aimed at energy supplies. That is the
critical national infrastructure vulnerability that we face. Of course,
there has been some response from the Government, for which I give them
credit: £650 million has been allocated to cyber, admittedly
over three years; there is now a national cybersecurity strategy;
research continues at GCHQ; there is improved assistance to the private
sector and sharing; and the CPNI, which protects our national
infrastructure, has been trying to influence standards. The MoD has
played its part: it has set up the Cyber Security Operations Centre and
enhanced co-operation with
GCHQ.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000024">I
welcome all of this but huge challenges and questions remain,
especially in the working out of concepts, capabilities, understanding
and operations. The idea of active defence is very popular. One
anonymous American general, who must be very glad he remains anonymous,
said that if the US was hit with a cyberattack, “We will stick a
nuke down their smokestack”. That illustrates the absolute
ignorance of the nature of cyber. Attribution is a major problem. It is
difficult to know the culprits. There is no missile heading for you
where you can retrace the route that it has taken. There are legal
prohibitions on accessing computer networks without authorisation.
There is a patchwork of international laws. There are normative, legal
and diplomatic obstacles. There are “what ifs”. What if
you pursued an attacker and encountered behind that attacker a foreign
Government? What if an obscure digital trail leads to an unrelated
system or it has been disguised within a hospital, as some artillery
pieces have been in asymmetric warfare in the past?</hs_para>

need to be thought through. In defence, I am afraid that our experience

Our conventional systems

reach my conclusion, there is one point where I would criticise the
Government. Historically, our intelligence services and police have
depended for counterterrorism and anti-crime activity in defending the
people of this country on the ability to match the technology
of our enemies, particularly in communications. This capability
desperately needs updating. For the third year running, the Government
have equivocated and postponed. Their fear of the Deputy
Prime Minister, Mr Clegg, appears to be greater than their fear of the
consequences of not acting in updating our intelligence-gathering
capacity to include Skype, the internet and texts. God forbid that a
terrorist attack should be launched that would have been prevented if
we had updated it. God help the Government if that should happen
because I know from experience just how dependent we were on that
capacity to save the lives of 2,500 people only six years ago in the

congratulate the Government on what they have done. I hope that they
will go further in a number of areas. Above all, I hope that they will
remember where I started: the pre-eminence of the United Kingdom over
the past few centuries has depended on our dominance of a network
world, whether it was exploration, the naval lanes or the financial
networks of the world. If we do not capture such a pre-eminence and
domination in cyber as a trusted centre of it, I am afraid that we will
continue on a very long road of gradual—and perhaps not so
gradual—decline.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/5C486044CA872B8F4630D479275BF82FDD0B9B09" __version__="1.13"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 May 2013">Wednesday,

Maclennan of Rogart:</Member></B> My Lords, in opening this debate, my
noble friend well set out the objectives of the Government in defence,
foreign policy and overseas aid, but I have to say that the
Queen’s Speech is remarkably deficient in indicating how these
objectives are to be followed. What the noble Lord, Lord Triesman,
described as “minor housekeeping” considerations in
respect of the European Union scarcely reflect the importance of our
integration with the European Union if we are to attain the
goals that my noble friend set out. The time seems ripe to consider a
new approach to the reform of the European Union, to ensure not only
that we speak with a united voice but that we enjoy the support of the
28 member countries—as there will be when Croatia
joins—and their populations in pursuing common objectives. There
are different stages of development in all these European countries,
but our overriding foreign affairs and defence goals are broadly the
same. We are all affected by the threats of international terrorism; we
are all affected by the growth of the world’s
population; we are all affected by climate change; and we are all
affected by extremist religious groups penetrating our
society—that can be dealt with effectively only as a reflection
of international
threats.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000029">I
want to spend just a few moments considering how best to take forward
this process of integration. One of the reasons why we are seeing a
backlash against the European Union, not only in our country but in
countries that have been committed from the
beginning, is that we are not building up a
transnational 
<?notus-xml column=433?>democracy within the European Union; we are instead
aspiring towards executive federalism, and that does not engage the
sympathy or support of the man on the street. Consequently, we have to
address the democratic deficit in the European Union to enable it to be
even more effective than it has been. It has been immensely effective
in pacifying Europe, but it has not been so effective in bringing
pressure to bear on those countries that have abandoned the civil
objectives expressed within the European Union treaties. For example,
nothing effective has been done about the progressive move to the

repeated in this House if my contribution is devoted to the surprising
absence of another issue. Before I come to that, as a vice-chairman of

the omission that most surprised me was the future of our nuclear
deterrent, bearing in mind the alleged imminent publication of the
Government’s Trident alternatives study. It is true that the
noble Baroness, Lady Warsi, when summing up my debate on nuclear
disarmament on 24 January, told the House that the purpose of
that study was to help the Liberal Democrats make the case for
alternatives to the current continuous-at-sea deterrent, but I submit
that far from merely being a matter of internal coalition politics, the
question of whether a weapon system of the potency of Trident
is the minimum credible deterrent that the nation requires to maintain
ought to be discussed and debated in both Houses. That debate needs to
be wide-ranging because of the number of questions about the ability of
a system designed to meet yesterday’s criteria to satisfy those
of today and
tomorrow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000034">The
need for such a debate was confirmed by a recent exchange of letters in
the <I>Times</I> following the statement by the Prime Minister on 3
April that, in his judgment, North Korea’s unveiling of a
long-range ballistic missile, with a nuclear warhead that it claimed
could reach the whole of the United States, affected the whole of
Europe, making it foolish to leave Britain defenceless against a
continuous and growing nuclear threat. The very mention of the alleged
threat from that North Korean missile reminded me of the 45-minute
nonsense over Iraqi weapons of mass
destruction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000035">Immediately,
General Sir Hugh Beach, a former Master-General of the Ordnance, wrote
that no country on earth was less vulnerable to North Korean nuclear
blackmail than the United Kingdom, and that, like it or not, the
Trident missile, in British hands but supplied by America, was unusable
without American support. His arguments were summarily dismissed by the
noble Lord, Lord West of Spithead, on the grounds that the independence
of our continuous-at-sea deterrent was not just technical but absolute,
and that it would be reckless to abandon our ultimate insurance against
threats that cannot be predicted from countries yet to be
identified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000036">That
prompted my noble and gallant friend, Lord Bramall, to write that the
arguments of the noble Lord, Lord West, reminded him of the senior
general who, after World War 1, said that there would always be a place
for the horse on the battlefield, particularly if well-bred. Although
the nuclear deterrent served both sides well in the Cold War, the
reality today is that it does not, and cannot, deter any credible
threats likely to be faced by this or any other European country; nor,
in a highly globalised and interlocking world, could a weapon with the
destructive power of Trident conceivably be used, even in retribution.
For us, he said, nuclear weapons are superfluous and now redundant, and
the sooner a Trident replacement is removed from the Treasury’s
overload, the better.</hs_para>

national defence priority list, and, to be credible, any proposed

to discuss the present state of negotiations on the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty, the Fissile Material Cut-Off
Treaty, or the continually frustrated attempts to establish a weapons

does our proposed replacement of one unusable system, designed to take
out Moscow by another with the same capability, increase or reduce our

ambitions? Secondly, does not the presumption that war was deterred and
peace maintained during the Cold War by uncertainty over whether either
side would use their nuclear weapons suggest that if the same logic was

of course, there is the current economic climate. Here I remind the
House of the two definitions of affordability: can you afford
something, or can you afford to give up what you have to give up in

ruthlessly when considering conventional shortfalls such as those
mentioned by my noble and gallant friend Lord Craig and the noble Lord,

Naseby:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Howell
was so right to raise the question of the Commonwealth, particularly
with the forthcoming conference in Colombo of the heads of state. Sri
Lanka is a proud founder member of the Commonwealth. After nearly 30
years of civil war, it seems absolutely appropriate that the members of
the Commonwealth should go to Colombo and see that country. I certainly
know that His Royal Highness the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of
Cornwall will have an enormously warm welcome from the people of Sri
Lanka.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051543000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000044">I
place on record my thanks to the present Prime Minister of the United
Kingdom for taking the lead in going to Colombo. He is only the second
Prime Minister to do so. The late Mrs Thatcher went in 1984, soon after
what was probably the worst experience of Sri Lanka since independence,
which followed on from the riots in 1983 when six soldiers were killed
in Jaffna. Frankly, the Government of the time there reacted too slowly
to those riots and many Tamils suffered as a result. Mrs Thatcher made
a brave decision to go, and in going she helped that country to move
forward and heal some of those wounds. This meeting comes, in my
judgment, at a good time. Terrorism has been defeated
and our Prime Minister and the other leaders can see for themselves
what has happened in the three years following the war. I think many
good things have happened, but they should go and have a
look for
themselves.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051543000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051543000045">It
is not news that one of the key issues in Sri Lanka is human rights. I
thank the Commonwealth Secretary-General and his staff for taking the
initiative in leading a review of what is happening on the ground.
There are two signals that I take heart from. First, a large number of
Tamils left Sri Lanka through those years of the great difficulty of
the civil war. More recently, more than 1,000 have come back from
Australia of their own free will and, to the best of my knowledge, only
one has had any difficulty. Several hundred have come back from the UK
and substantial numbers from New Zealand. The one country where not too
many have come back from is Canada. My analysis is that that is
basically because a number of Tamils have become MPs in Canada and are
deeply involved in Canadian politics. I hope that Canada will think
again and come to Colombo.</hs_para>

second good point that has happened is that President Rajapaksa is the
first leader since independence to insist that it must be a trilingual
country. There is very real progress in the Civil Service, in
teaching, in the schools and in the road signs of a trilingual
approach, which brings the Tamil community into becoming real members
of Sri Lanka.</hs_para>

have just received a letter from the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of
State Alistair Burt, and I place on record my thanks to him for his
diligence, time and patience and the even-handedness with which he has
juggled the varying points of view that have been presented to him on
Sri Lanka. His letter raised three points that the Foreign Secretary is
going to look at when he goes to Colombo. First, he highlights
free and fair provincial council elections in the north
on 7 September. The portents are quite good. The electoral
register has only just been compiled by Tamil teachers, which is
healthy. I pray that those elections go reasonably smoothly. Secondly,
he highlights the freedom of the press. We all believe that is
important, but we have to reflect a little on Leveson. There is no
Leveson problem, or certainly nothing of the scale of Leveson, in Sri
Lanka. As someone who knows much of south Asia, in my judgment there is
far more freedom of the press in Sri Lanka than in Malaysia or
Singapore.</hs_para>

perhaps one of the key points, the Foreign Secretary says he is going
to go to the north. I hope by that he means Jaffna. It is the place to
go. It is the key part of the Tamil community in the north. I am told
he is going to meet civil society, NGOs and political representatives.
That is a good start, but he must not exclude the military, in
particular the CO at Palali base. Palali defends the northern shores of
Sri Lanka and—I am sorry to say this, but it is
true—within Tamil Nadu, the Indian state adjacent to Sri Lanka,
it appears that the LTTE—the Tamil Tigers—is still
welcome today As your Lordships may know, Tamil Nadu is a key component
of the coalition in India, which perhaps accounts for some of
India’s recent reactions. If it were me, I would also meet the
religious leaders—you cannot divorce religion as it is far more
powerful there than it is here—the government agent, which is
the equivalent of our county councillor, and business leaders because
we want to get that economy going.</hs_para>

that the Foreign Secretary is going to meet NGOs. There are some
wonderful NGOs across the world. I highlight the International Red
Cross as one of the most wonderful. I went out at the time of the
tsunami. Much good work was done by many NGOs, but I am afraid that
there was also much less good work done by some NGOs. Tragically, some
containers came from the UK containing arms for the Tamil Tigers. There
are all sorts of NGOs. Some do great work, some do less great
work.</hs_para>

Lankans’ understanding of what happens elsewhere in the world.
They look with some amazement at the USA leading this rights issue in

violence in countries affected by conflict and the objective set out

have the overall aspiration and some of the specifics right, there is a

is immigration. We will compete and succeed in the world only if we are
open, flexible and welcoming. The Government’s rhetoric on
immigration is damaging Britain’s international standing and our
ability to be entrepreneurial and competitive. The way in which the
visa regime is being applied by the FCO is deeply damaging to
our relationships, particularly in the Commonwealth, about which the
noble Lord, Lord Howell, spoke so eloquently about earlier. The way in
which the visa regime is being used to turn away or delay the entry
into this country of people who have a perfectly legitimate right to be
here and to contribute to our debates, discussions and economic
progress is causing us all sorts of difficulties, and I urge the
Government to address that issue and look again at their rhetoric on
immigration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051546000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0001.htm#13051546000013">The
second area in which the gracious Speech was disappointing was the
absence of legislation to commit to 0.7% of gross national income. This
target is now agreed by all parties—the previous Government and
the current Government—and was implemented by the current
Government. That decision has been welcomed following the recent
Budget. The way to take the 
<?notus-xml column=439?>politics out of it and to take the quantity of aid out of the debate to
start to focus on the quality of overseas development assistance is to
enshrine that in law, take the party politics out of the issue for ever
and ensure that we focus on the way in which we spend the money rather
than on how much we spend. Both coalition parties promised to do so,
and they have let down the country and our allies abroad by backing off
from that commitment.</hs_para>

credibility we have built up on overseas development assistance. I know
what the rules are, and Ministers and officials know what the rules
are. The Government will not be using aid money for security purposes.

Alderdice:</Member></B> My Lords, for the first couple of years of the
coalition Government I was much encouraged and, indeed, enthused, by
the change in the approach to foreign policy. It seemed that a number
of problems had arisen. I listened carefully to the noble Lord, Lord
Triesman—who is not in his place—and was struck by the
fact that he was commending the Government for the improved investment
in and development of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office; that there
was a move away from some of the unfortunate approaches that had been
taken during the George W Bush period; and that there were problems
with the Government’s addressing of the European question. I
found myself agreeing with him, and then thinking, “Wait a
minute. The previous Government eviscerated the Foreign and
Commonwealth Office that is now being repaired”. It was not just
George W Bush during his period as the President, but Blair and Brown
who were also in government. Our many problems with Europe were not
fundamentally addressed during that

Europe demonstrates. However, those of us who are pro-Europeans must
recognise what my noble friend Lord Maclennan said about the inadequacy
of European democracy. Many of us wanted to see the development of a
Europe of the regions. Instead of that, we have not just a Europe of
nation states but a Europe of national Governments, each
playing off against the other. We must understand, too, that this

when it comes to the possibility of the European network being used in

is not yet possible to have a military parade in public, never mind to

Europe. Unless those of us who are pro-Europe are able to convince the
rest of our colleagues in Europe to take seriously what needs to be
done on democratisation, on solving the economic problems, on having a
common foreign and security policy and on being able to invest enough
in defence, our people will not be persuaded that Europe is a viable

Lord, Lord Reid, referred to the fifth space that has now opened. There
is land, sea, air, space and, now, for the first time, one created by
mankind: cyberspace. Much work and investment has gone into it.
However, there are two areas which we have yet to address properly. One
is international law in cyberspace. The noble Lord, Lord Reid,
mentioned the Stuxnet virus. Had there been an equivalent attack by one
country on another in any of the other four spaces, it would have been
a declaration of war. However, within cyberspace, we are unclear on the
rules of international law. Some time soon, we need to be. Otherwise
there will be a tragedy of the kind that the noble Lord referred to:
there will be some kind of attack without real attribution being clear.

psychology of working in cyberspace in war. In the other four spaces,
in the main we understand how people function. However, all of us know
that when people start sending emails to each other, tweeting and
texting, they suddenly behave in a different way: less inhibited, less
thoughtful and less understanding of the consequences of their actions
in many cases. I am yet to see sufficient attention being paid to
research in the psychology of cyberwar and cyberterrorism; I declare an
interest as someone who has given time academically and in business to
this area. I hope that my noble friend will be able to tell me
that additional resource will be devoted to research into understanding
how people function in this fifth space.</hs_para>

Middle East, which is the issue that frightens me the most. During the
last election, people used to say, “I agree with Nick”.
In this case, I agree with Paddy, because I am extremely
frightened by what is happening in the Middle East. Much of what has
been done from outside has created only more trouble. The notion that
we are now starting to supply weapons that are massively surplus to any
possible requirement in the region because we want to engage in some
kind of influence is total foolishness. Again, I come to the network.
We will not solve the Israel-Palestine problem by engaging just those
two players. It will have to be done regionally. The Arab peace
initiative has not had the attention from this 
<?notus-xml column=442?>country, from the United States or from others
externally. It has been retabled, and it needs to be responded to. We
will never resolve the problems with Cyprus, north and south, unless we
understand the need for regional engagement. The more that energy

for co-operation or a basis for new conflicts there.</hs_para>

is no longer only a Syrian problem. I went out to Lebanon a few weeks
ago, just to see how things were going, and I came back very fearful
because that border is already entirely breached. Hezbollah is
attacking back into villages which have its faithful within Syria and
which are under attack from others, and atrocities are being committed
within Lebanon itself. Jordan is being deeply destabilised by the
number of refugees, and now we have attacks in Iraq and Turkey. It is
almost already too late. When Russia sets down its requirements, it is
also saying to the United States, “Stop acting like a cowboy,
prepared to do things without United Nations agreements. This is a line
you should not cross”. For that reason, as well as for many
others, I desperately hope that when we come to debate the
Queen’s Speech next year we will not do so in the context of
some kind of catastrophic conflagration that has developed from the
situation in the Middle East, because we are perilously close to

will briefly remind noble Lords of how this tragic fate overtook the
Chagossians. In 1965 our Government detached the Chagos Archipelago
from Mauritius in order to form a separate British Indian Ocean
Territory, in defiance of four UN resolutions. They reclassified the
inhabitants as contract workers, made the largest, most southerly,
island, Diego Garcia, available to the United States for use as a
military base, and gradually 
<?notus-xml column=443?>removed the Chagossians from all the islands, eventually depositing them
in Mauritius and the Seychelles during 1971 to 1973. Some came to
Britain from
2001.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051546000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051546000035">Now,
fewer than 700 of the original islanders remain. The United States base
on Diego Garcia is 140 miles away from the outer islands, to which some
would like to return. When the Government of the United States were
asked by our Foreign Office publicly to affirm, as was reported in a
WikiLeaks cable from the United States embassy in London, that they
required the whole of the British Indian Ocean Territory for defence
purposes, they did not do so. The State Department has indicated
informally to a member of the Chagos Islands (British Indian Ocean
Territory) All-Party Parliamentary Group, of which I also am a member,
that if asked it will review the security implications of a limited
return. Our Law Lords described official letters that claimed that
there was a defence risk as “fanciful” and “highly
imaginative”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051546000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051546000036">In
2014 the agreement with the United States will come up for renewal. I
suggest that this gives an excellent opportunity for exploring whether
a small number of Chagossian people could return to the outer islands.
It would seem to have no security or defence implications for the base
on Diego Garcia. I am assured that many will not want to return, but
all want their right to do so restored, and some will want only to
visit their homeland and come
away.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051546000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051546000037">Would
this be a burden to the British taxpayer? The Foreign Office set up a
feasibility study in 2001, which claimed that resettlement was not
feasible and anyway was very expensive. The infeasibility argument has
been discredited by one of its own consultants and by others, most
recently in a report by Professor Paul Kench of Auckland University. As
for the cost, it would be idle to pretend that justice would not carry
some. However, the United Kingdom would not have to bear the whole
burden of restoring the tiny infrastructure. The European Union high

that goal to its logical conclusion in Africa, this economic

agricultural transformation is not only an economic agenda of huge
importance but an agenda of women’s rights. More than two-thirds
of all women in Africa are employed in agriculture and they produce
nearly 90% of the food. To empower agriculture is to empower women and,
with the right training, it enables them to provide for the nutritional
needs of their families and earn money to provide education for their
children. It is truly a transformational
agenda.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051546000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051546000048">However,
it would seem that as yet the UK does not get it. President Obama gets
it; his Feed the Future programme and last year’s USA-led New
Alliance show that. Ireland seems to get it; I was in Dublin last month
and heard more than one Cabinet Minister speak up for the
transformational ability of agriculture. From my conversations in
Brussels with Commissioner Piebalgs, I would say that he, too, seems to
get it. However, when did we last hear a DfID Minister or senior
official talk about the transformational importance of agriculture? The
ONE organisation claims that DfID’s agricultural spend is only
2.18% of its overall ODA. At one point it was as high as 18%. Even if
the figure is wrong—I admit that it is hard to trace what is
agricultural and what is not—it is certainly one of the lowest

Prime Minister welcoming the IF campaign, which launches on 8 Junes

year’s G8—it would be a travesty if we were not to talk
about locally grown nutrition—and with the African Union calling
for 2014 to be the year of agriculture, this is surely an ideal moment

return to my starting point, this is not only a seed agenda. I wish it
were that simple, but there is no such silver bullet. It is, as I said,
about women’s rights, including their ability to own land and
borrow money. It is about roads, crop storage and markets and market
chains. Above all it is about knowledge: knowledge not only about how
to plant, fertilise and protect modern seeds and how to enrich and
improve the soil, 
<?notus-xml column=446?>but about the benefits of co-operation and how to buy, sell and promote
entrepreneurial flair throughout the food chain. An agricultural
reformation is not only about growing food; it runs from plough to
plate and includes investment in inputs, machinery, storage,
processing, transport and retailing, to name but a few. This is an
exciting agenda, but above all it is a transformational agenda, and I

Lawson of Blaby:</Member></B> My Lords, there seems to be a growing
interest in the question of whether this country should remain within
the European Union, so if noble Lords will forgive me I will confine my
remarks to that important issue. In that context I start by welcoming
very warmly the Prime Minister’s pledge at the important
Bloomberg speech he gave a little while back to provide the people of
this country with an “in or out” referendum in 2017. I am
also glad that a draft Bill was published today to give effect to this
pledge. I gather, incidentally, that it is likely that an amendment may
be moved in another place today, regretting the absence of any mention
of this in the gracious

would not presume—and neither, I am sure, would any noble
Lord—to give advice to my right honourable and honourable
friends in that place. However, if I may venture a personal opinion,
what is needed is a thorough debate about the momentous political and
economic issues involved. This will not be assisted by unnecessary and
pointless votes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:26:42"></hs_TimeCode>.
The Prime Minister’s position, as I understand it, is that the
EU as presently constituted is not acceptable to the United Kingdom,
and perhaps not acceptable on a wider basis. Therefore he will seek to
renegotiate the terms of our membership to make it acceptable before
holding his promised referendum if he is in a position to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T15:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051546000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051546000053">One
does not serve as a Minister of the Crown for more than a decade, as I
did, without getting to know the realities of the European Union pretty

he seeks. It will certainly not be possible if it is thought that at
the end of the day he will, following in the footsteps of his

had time to read. I will therefore focus on what inevitably is the
central concern in all this, which is the fundamental change in the
European Union following the coming into being of monetary union and
the eurozone, with the United Kingdom rightly outside it. It is no use
living in the past and deluding ourselves; that was a watershed and a
Rubicon. Judged as an economic venture, monetary union is clearly and
predictably a disaster, condemning the eurozone to long-term economic
underperformance, which of course none of us wishes to see, as it
lurches from crisis to crisis—not to mention the political
discord that we see today in Europe as a

course, it is not an economic venture but a political venture, seen as
leading inexorably to the creation of a full-blooded political union

and it is not for us. Nor is there any future for a United Kingdom
outside the political union, increasingly marginalised but still
shackled to it. That, au fond, to use the language of the country in
which I live, is why, unless monetary union is abandoned, we must leave

I am puzzled, not upset, that this view is frequently
characterised<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:30:29"></hs_TimeCode> by
the media as being rightwing. Of course, it used to be the view of the
party opposite, and I have never considered the Labour Party to be a
particularly rightwing outfit. My mind at this time goes back to a
small private dinner party in Chelsea some 50 years ago, where the
guest of honour was the then leader of the Labour Party and leader of
the Opposition, Hugh Gaitskell. It was only a very few weeks before his
sadly premature death. The discussion turned, not surprisingly, to the
then topical question of whether we should join what was then known as
the Common Market. I was in favour, but Hugh Gaitskell was passionately
against it. His argument was that we should not be part of a European
political union, a United States of Europe. At that time, when we had
our argument 50 years ago, I insisted that that was not the issue
before us and that the European Economic Community, to give it its
correct name at that time, was something quite different. That may have
been true then, but the issue today, after the watershed and after the
Rubicon has been crossed, is clearly that identified by Hugh Gaitskell
50 years ago, and I find myself standing now pretty close to where he
stood
then.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/3948B4339AB4DEB9CBB5D84ABE87AC4BDFA0141D" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 May 2013">Wednesday,

have nothing against GOCOs in principle. Indeed, when I was a Defence

contractualise the dockyards, taking it through the Commons. But that

is a whole new order of magnitude—£14 billion of
procurement with, currently, 16,000 civil servants. What the Government

that run on for, and how will it work if the GOCO is established? How
will cancellations of major programmes be dealt with between MoD and
the GOCO, such as the Nimrod disaster or the carrier aircraft
fiasco—initially STOVL, then cats and traps, then back to STOVL?

Cox:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to offer first-hand accounts of
causes of deep concern in three countries I have visited this year. The
first concerns Burma where there are welcome reforms but many problems
remain, including severe violations of human rights affecting ethnic
and religious minorities such as the predominantly Muslim Rohingya, the
Christian Kachin and the Buddhist Shan
peoples<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:40:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:40:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000002">The
Rohingya people have suffered horrifying waves of violence, displacing
at least 130,000, with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of deaths.
Moreover, security forces have often failed to prevent the killing of
civilians and destruction of Muslim homes, shops and other property.
Those forced to flee to camps are living in conditions of appalling
squalor, many dying from disease without medical care. May I ask the
Minister what steps Her Majesty’s Government have taken to press
the Burmese Government to ensure that security forces act swiftly to
protect vulnerable communities, arrest and prosecute 
<?notus-xml column=450?>perpetrators of violence, prevent the spread of anti-Muslim propaganda
and hate speech, and end impunity? May I also ask whether Her
Majesty’s Government have raised with the Burmese Government the
denial of citizenship for the Rohingya people, who, despite living in
Burma for generations, exist as a stateless
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:41:22"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000003">I
turn briefly to the plight of the Kachin people. In June 2011, the
Burmese Army broke a long-standing ceasefire with Kachin state and
fighting continues. I visited Kachin state in February and saw the dire
predicament of at least 100,000 people displaced from their homes by
military offensives and human rights violations by the Burmese Army,
with killing of civilians, arbitrary arrests, torture, rape and
destruction of villages. At least 66 churches have been destroyed in
the past year. May I ask what efforts Her Majesty’s Government
are making to press the Burmese Government to end these military
offensives and engage in a meaningful peace process with the
Kachin and other ethnic
nationalities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:42:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000004">Persistent
violations of ceasefires also continue in Shan state, where the Burmese
army continues to attack Shan people and to commit grave human rights
abuses. May I ask whether Her Majesty’s Government will press
the Burmese Government to ensure unhindered access for humanitarian
assistance to all conflict-affected states, and what humanitarian
assistance Her Majesty’s Government are providing? As the
monsoon season approaches, the current dire humanitarian situation
could become
catastrophic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:42:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000005">The
ethnic national peoples of Burma fear that the warm welcome given by
the international community to the reforms will result in massive
investment, which the Burmese Government will use for more exploitation
of the resource-rich lands of the ethnic national peoples, with further
expropriation and displacement. As one of the Shan leaders said to us
with deep concern, “When the lights went on in Rangoon, all the
world rushed there and no one stopped to see us in the
darkness”. Given the decision to lift EU sanctions on Burma, may
I ask the Minister what measures the EU, including the United Kingdom,
will use to pressure the Burmese Government to stop these human rights
violations, ensure genuine constitutional change, which includes a just
political settlement for the ethnic nationalities, and bring an end to
these decades of war and
oppression<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:43:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000006">I
turn briefly to the new republics of South Sudan and Sudan, having been
twice this year to South Sudan and once to the conflict-afflicted areas
of Southern Kordofan and Blue Nile in Sudan. South Sudan needs massive
assistance to recover from the war inflicted by the former north, in
which 2 million people perished, 4 million were displaced and
virtually all the infrastructure was destroyed. I had the privilege of
being invited to the Independence Day celebrations in June 2011, where
the joy of freedom was tangibly exuberant, alongside the sober
challenges confronting the new nation. As President Salva Kiir said, it
was not a case of rebuilding, as there was nothing left to
rebuild<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:44:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000007">The
Government and the peoples of South Sudan deserve congratulations on
their achievements in the 22 months since independence. Of course,
there are massive problems, including inevitable internal conflicts 
<?notus-xml column=451?>in a post-conflict tribal society, with historic tribal tensions
exacerbated by unemployment, especially of demobilised soldiers, a
generation of children who have not been able to attend school because
of constant aerial bombardment, some of the worst health statistics in
the world, with only 15% of the population receiving immunisation, and
a desperate need for roads in a country which, at independence, had
only a few kilometres of tarmac road. The problems are exacerbated by
the Republic of Sudan’s aggressive policies, including military
offensives into South Sudan and sponsoring South Sudanese insurgents
and criminal groups. There is also the problem of continuing violence
along the border, especially in the disputed Abyei
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000008">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>,
I am delighted to see many signs of progress in South Sudan, including
establishment of institutions of civil society, programmes for
reconciliation between conflict-prone tribal factions and investment by
major international companies. Can the Minister say what specific
initiatives Her Majesty’s Government are taking to promote UK
investment in South Sudan, as it is essential for the development of
this vulnerable new nation trying to develop as a true democracy in a
very challenging part of
Africa<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:45:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000009">Finally,
I turn to the Republic of Sudan, still under the rule of General
al-Bashir, who has been indicted by the International Criminal Court,
together with two of his senior colleagues, one of whom he has imposed
in a ruling position in southern Kordofan. Al-Bashir has declared his
intention to turn the Republic of Sudan into a unified Arabic, Islamic
nation. He is pursuing his racist policy of ethnic cleansing the
African peoples from Blue Nile state and the Nuba Mountains in Southern
Kordofan. Earlier this year, I witnessed constant aerial bombardment of
innocent civilians, forcing half a million to flee their homes and hide
in snake-infested caves, under trees or in river banks. Many have died
of starvation as they cannot grow or harvest crops and a quarter of a
million have had to flee to overcrowded camps in South Sudan. I and
other noble Lords have repeatedly asked what pressure Her
Majesty’s Government have put on the Government of Sudan to
desist from this aerial bombardment of civilians which has caused such
a massive toll of death and injury, and I do so again this
evening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:46:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000010">Her
Majesty’s Government claim that they wish to continue to
“talk” to Khartoum. However, as many of us have
emphasised, Khartoum continues to kill while it talks. There are also
numerous other causes for concern in Sudan, including expulsion of many
NGOs, attacks on Christian churches and schools and serious
infringements of fundamental human rights, including freedom of the
press. These deserve a separate debate. May I ask the Minister what Her
Majesty’s Government are doing to bring an end to this culture
of impunity, which allows, inter alia, mass killings and injury on that
huge scale? May I also ask whether Her Majesty’s Government
might consider assisting indigenous organisations in those
conflict-affected areas, especially in the Nuba Mountains and Blue
Nile, with the provision of life-saving food and medical supplies for
civilians currently dying from starvation and disease? In one village
we visited in Blue Nile, 450 people had died from starvation and those
still alive had had to flee 
<?notus-xml column=452?>into the bush from aerial bombardment targeting their
village<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:47:51"></hs_TimeCode>. The
people of Sudan and South Sudan look to the British Government as
having a special responsibility to help, not only because of our
historic responsibility but our continuing duty as part of the
three-nation group responsible for monitoring and assisting with the
implementation of the comprehensive peace
agreement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T18:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000011">Our
friends in Burma, Sudan and South Sudan passionately hope that we will

close those loopholes that enable multinational corporations to send
their profits offshore. However, that should not extend to military
action, and it would help me greatly if the Minister can commit himself

agreement concluded by the G8 benefits poor countries and enables them
to access information about company ownership and assets held in tax

these 16 to 18 year-olds is not wasted. In the year 2012-13, the Army

entrant soldiers who stay as soldiers for the longest. It is they who
become the best NCOs, and they are a great investment for us. This
House is witness to the many years served here by our Staff
Superintendent, Peter Horsfall. He was a member of the Coldstream

point, on allowing 16 year-olds to enlist. The Government believe that
their policies on under-18s in service are robust and comply with
national and international law. They have taken steps to bestow special
safeguards on young people below the age of 18, under the Optional
Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the
Involvement of Children in Armed Conflict. It continues to
be the rule that they do not go to the front line to fight
until they have reached the age of 18. Of course, a comprehensive
welfare system is in place for all service personnel. I hope that the
Minister—a soldier himself—will continue to support this
Government’s

“against” are against preparing the next generation for
circumstances which are not abstract but real. Those same voices would,
I suspect, leap to praise the youngster—the 16
year-old—who has performed well during a local crisis such as a
flood, a fire or an accident. So often that youngster is a scout or a
guide but is also an Army cadet, a Navy cadet, an Air Force cadet, or a

a point made by Americans and foreigners all around the world. We are

is that UK government agencies could provide objective information

that there were great opportunities to develop products based on the
UK’s success with the Olympic Games and our success in

Foreign Office should do more in monitoring and promoting the use of
the UK delegation to the United Nations, not only to be effective but
to promote UK interests. In fact, some of the UK government agencies
which are part of these delegations do not take it as seriously as they
should. Indeed, a recent chief executive of a UK agency said, “I

Stirrup:</Member></B> My Lords, the gracious Speech last week set out
the Government’s intent to prevent conflict and reduce
terrorism. These are ambitious aims to encapsulate in such a few words,
especially given the kind of international turmoil that we currently
see in so many parts of the world. So how are they to be
achieved?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000054">The
conflict in Syria steals most of the headlines these days, and not
without cause. The consequences for the Syrian people are tragic and
the stresses on the wider region become ever more worrying, but what
can external actors do to help address these issues? The first thing,
perhaps, is to ensure that by their actions they do not make the
situation even worse. We know little for sure about the Syrian
opposition groups. We believe that some of them at least are pursuing
an extremist agenda, and the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown of
Norton-sub-Hamdon, has pointed out some of the other concerns about the
nature of the conflict. The Assad regime is extremely unsavoury and we
would certainly like to see something better in its place, but how
content are we that this is actually achievable?</hs_para>

are not new questions, but there is a natural concern that while we
grapple with them, so far unsuccessfully, more people are dying and the
humanitarian situation is growing steadily worse. I have sympathy with
this concern, but it is important to remember that the issue in Syria
is essentially political in nature and that any attempt to address it
must itself be at root political. Employing military force in the
region without a clear and achievable political objective would be a
leap into the unknown and would certainly risk worsening the situation
rather than improving
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T19:20:58"></hs_TimeCode>. We most
certainly can and should be making every effort to contain the regional
impact of the conflict. We see the consequences in Turkey, in Lebanon
and, most worryingly of all, in Jordan. Sustaining and increasing our
support for the latter country is perhaps one of the most useful things
we can do in this crisis, at least in the immediate future.</hs_para>

President Obama’s second term and a new Secretary of State
present yet another window of opportunity for the Middle East peace
process. The current regional turmoil makes progress on this issue more
rather than less pressing. The experience of many weary years makes us
naturally cautious about expecting too much, if anything at all, from
the latest efforts in this regard. Nevertheless, unrelenting
persistence is one of the most important prerequisites for dealing with
the problem. As has been pointed out already, Israeli settlements are
certainly a major obstacle, but treating them en masse is
likely to make them a showstopper in any negotiations. Some of
these settlements would almost certainly remain on the Israeli side of
the line under any land swap deal, while others are much more
controversial, and it is on these that negotiators should perhaps focus
their efforts.</hs_para>

Palestinians, for their part, will have to acknowledge that there can
be no right of return. This presents all sorts of difficulties, but
there are no easy parts to this puzzle. This is another issue on which
negotiators should perhaps concentrate their efforts to find an
acceptable formula. Most important of all, the 
<?notus-xml column=461?>peace process needs to focus on constituents within
Israel and the West Bank. The leaders are important, but if they cannot
deliver the key elements of their constituencies, they will be unable
to make the concessions necessary for progress. It may be unrealistic
to expect a resolution of the Palestinian issue in the near term, but
just a degree of movement on these key points would go at least some
way to relieving the air of stagnation and pessimism that seems so

great many other challenges for the UK on the international scene, and
numerous potential threats to our interests. Other noble Lords have
covered or will cover some of these, and time precludes me from
touching on more of them today, but they exist and we must guard
against them. If we are to do so, we shall need the appropriate
resources, including adequately manned, equipped and trained Armed
Forces. The Government’s plans for Future Force 2020 set out how
that particular requirement is to be achieved. These plans, while
constrained to a greater degree than I believe wise, are at least
coherent, but when they were conceived during the strategic defence and
security review in 2010, it was made clear that they depended on
real-terms increases in the defence budget—and, I stress, in the
entire budget, not just in the equipment programme—in each of
the years after 2015: that is, beyond the period of the 2010 spending

is the basis on which the Ministry of Defence has conducted its
planning over the past three years, but far from increasing the budget
from 2015-16 the Government seem to be about to reduce it further, and
the prospect for the succeeding years does not look bright. Some will
say that the circumstances have changed and the economy is not where,
in 2010, we all hoped it would be by now and therefore we have to
tighten our belts further. They would say that defence cannot be
protected from this further pressure. That may indeed be the
Government’s judgment, but in announcing the outcome of the 2010

plans for Future Force 2020 depend on the sort of budget increases that
I have outlined.</hs_para>

also be true: that without those rises, the Government’s plans
for the Armed Forces will be unachievable. That appears to be the
current situation. The Ministry of Defence is working to a plan that is
not being funded appropriately and that will therefore fail. I should

much to our operations in their country and who now face such a fraught

scheme similar to the one that allowed endangered Iraqi interpreters to
settle in the UK. I simply cannot understand this. I accept entirely
the desirability of talented Afghans remaining in and contributing to
the development of their country, and I welcome the introduction of
incentives to persuade them to do so, but if they judge that the risk
to themselves and their families outweighs the incentives 
<?notus-xml column=462?>to remain, surely we have a duty to provide them

moral argument for treating these people as a special case is clear,
but there is a practical one, too. As the noble Lord, Lord King of
Bridgwater, noted, we shall certainly need high quality interpreters in
future crises. If we are to persuade people to work for us in such a
capacity and in such circumstances, they will need to have some
confidence in the long-term prospects for themselves and for their
families. We need to be seen as a country that looks after those who
serve it. That, I regret to say, is not how we are seen at the moment.
The case for a change of course is overwhelming. The

days before the gracious Speech, I attended the ninth annual NATO
Conference on Weapons of Mass Destruction, Arms Control, Disarmament
and Non-proliferation in Split at the invitation of NATO and
representing the European Leadership Network. There were over 100
participants in this conference, which has a very extensive agenda.
Some 20 NATO countries were represented, as were four countries from
the Middle East along with Japan, China, India and other nations across
the world.</hs_para>

apply to those discussions so I will not—even if I could in the
short time available to me—share with noble Lords all of what
was said. However, it was an extensive agenda, covering nuclear,
biological, chemical and cyber threats. There was a significant
discussion about the defeated ambition to have a conference on a
weapons of mass destruction-free zone in the Middle East, and all
aspects of proliferation were discussed. Many of the national
delegations present had been at the preparatory committee of the NPT
review in Geneva and had come from there. It was good to see that the
Egyptians were at the conference in Split despite their leaving the NPT
review disappointed that no date was fixed for a rearranged conference
on weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. The House will also
be aware that the fourth P5 meeting to discuss the P5 obligations under
Point 5 of the 64-point plan that came from the NPT review in 2010 and
the

think there will be agreement on all sides of the House that these are
important issues. In almost any hierarchy of threats, these issues
would be high in anybody’s priorities and on the list of issues
being discussed. As I have said before in your Lordships’ House,
when representing a European organisation in that environment, when
both the United States and Russia are represented, and if China is also
in the room, you have to have pretty sharp elbows as a European to get
into the discussion. The scale of their weapons capabilities is such
that Europeans, even when aggregated, appear rather small. It was
slightly disappointing and worrying that there was no Russian voice in
these discussions and at the conference, for the first time to my
knowledge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051555000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000067">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T19:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>
was even more disappointing from my perspective was that there was no
official United Kingdom voice either. At the NATO discussion on weapons
of mass destruction, we appeared to have no point to make. This is not
the only recent example of our country not being represented at
important discussions relating to the threats and challenges that the
world faces. Recently, the Norwegians convened a meeting to discuss the
humanitarian effects of weapons of mass destruction, particularly
nuclear weapons, and we did not turn up. On that occasion, I think, it
was out of solidarity with our P5 partners, none of which turned up to
take part in that discussion, to my disappointment and that of many
other countries of the world, and which I am sure your Lordships will
share. Although it was no surprise to me, I share the disappointment of
the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, that these issues did not deserve one
line in the gracious

will be clear to every noble Lord in this debate in your

range of challenges for priority are very obvious from the nature of
this debate. However, it is also obvious that if Europe is

is that more evident than in defence and security issues. The blunt
truth is that the security policies of the Euro-Atlantic region remain
largely on Cold War autopilot, 20 years or more after the end of the
Cold War. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T19:34:45"></hs_TimeCode>

have nuclear weapons on their soil and 95% of the nuclear weapons that
exist in the world. However, we seem always to want to talk about the
“other”, instead of what is in our own neighbourhood. We
are home to large strategic nuclear forces, many—indeed,
thousands—of which are ready to be launched in minutes.
Thankfully, that does not include the United Kingdom’s forces,
but it does include Russian and American forces. Thousands of tactical
weapons remain in Europe and a decades-old missile defence debate
remains stuck in neutral. New

legacy contributes to tensions and mistrust across the Euro-Atlantic
region and needlessly drives up the risks and costs of national defence
at a time of unprecedented austerity and tight national budgets. We
must ask ourselves why, two decades after the Cold War ended, the
United States, Russia, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom and
other European nations spend hundreds of billions of dollars, roubles,
euros and pounds in response to these tensions while both local and
national leaders face a growing list of fiscal demands and unmet needs.
This is not just about guns versus butter, although that is a very
attractive argument in the current environment. The likelihood of a
major war in Europe may have radically reduced since the end of the
Cold War but this legacy undermines any effort to build a true
Euro-Atlantic partnership to meet the common threats and
challenges of the 21st century, which we can all list and which we all
know will have to be addressed in a collective and multilateral fashion
across the world.

Taverne:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to address the implications of a
referendum in 2017, which I do not think have been properly considered
very often. I very much agreed with the remarks made by my noble friend
Lord Howell when he said that the European Union is, at present, in a
state of flux. It faces entirely new circumstances and completely new
challenges, but that is not an argument in favour of having a 
<?notus-xml column=465?>referendum in 2017. If the eurozone is to survive,
it will need some greater degree of fiscal co-ordination and some
initiative for growth. Both of these mean more Europe and yet there has
never been greater disillusionment with Brussels throughout Europe than
there is at the present time—people want less Europe. How will
that be resolved? We will not know by 2017. How large will the eurozone
be? It may be smaller but it may be larger. What will its relations be

thing that will be needed is a banking union. However, Germany and
France are very far apart at the moment about what sort of banking
union there should be. It is likely to take considerable time and is
not something that is likely to be resolved by 2017. The form of any
banking union will have very serious implications for the
City of London. What sort of Europe is likely to have emerged by 2017?
We do not know. If we are going to have a referendum that is
meaningful, the choice must be clear, but we will not know what sort of
Union we are supposed to vote on—either to leave or to stay
in.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051555000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000075">The noble
Lord, Lord Howell, also said that we should play a leading part in the
kind of changes that Europe needs. I completely agree. The noble Lord,
Lord Williamson, said that there were many opportunities for us to
exploit the need for change that there is in Europe. I entirely agree.
But what will be the effect on our influence in Europe in leading these
changes if we have a fixed referendum that leads to the
possibility—indeed, in many people’s eyes, the
likelihood—of an exit?</hs_para>

look at the polls and the rise of UKIP, this xenophobic, populist
party. They hear the speeches of my noble friend Lord Lawson and other
Tory grandees, and indeed the statements made by some Cabinet
Ministers, and they assume that Britain is likely to exit. What sort of
concessions are they likely to make if they think that we are not going
to be a member in any case? How will they respond to what in effect is
a threat—“If you do not give us what we want, we will
walk away”? Fixing a referendum is not likely to enable us to
achieve the kind of changes that we want and need, because you can
achieve those only if you are inside, if you have a commitment to the
Union, not if you are threatening to leave and exercising what will
appear to some as a form of blackmail—when we need good
will.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13051555000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051555000077">My
third reason is that the only people likely to benefit from a
referendum in 2017 will be the antis, which is not surprising; that is
why they are in favour. Suppose the Conservatives win the next election
and Mr Cameron starts his negotiation for substantial repatriation of
powers backed by the threat of walking away in a referendum, is he
likely to achieve these successes? He is extremely unlikely to do so.
He may get a few cosmetic concessions, a few sops thrown to him, but I
agree with my noble friend Lord Lawson that people will see through
that; there will not be any substantial repatriation of powers. If he
is still Prime Minister—which would then be somewhat

begin by acknowledging the work of our Armed Forces, diplomats,
journalists and aid workers in Afghanistan. There have been many
casualties among Afghan soldiers and civilians as well as our own
soldiers and Marines, but we often forget that our own civilians and
aid workers are also working in a dangerous environment. I declare an

look back at what the aid agencies were saying during the Taliban era
after 1996, when any movement of women from their homes was discouraged
and education was banned in many areas. I was at that time involved in
a clandestine project in Badghis province to support girls’
education in private homes, which was the only way of doing it. At that
time the UN and most of the large aid agencies were wary of getting
involved at all. Women were discouraged even from working for the
United Nations agencies—we forget
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000006">Of
course, the situation has dramatically changed and it seems almost
inconceivable that today’s programmes for women can be reversed.
We are told that after NATO withdraws, aid through agencies such as our
own DfID will continue, but we have to be realistic: less security
means less protection for programmes outside the main cities. Every
degree of un-Islamic prejudice or extreme interpretation of the Sharia
in the madrassahs means less take-up of education and more
opportunities for terrorism. Can the Minister assure me that DfID will
maintain its support for education and that its programmes in rural
areas, including the successful National Solidarity Programme, will
continue to have priority and be given adequate support? Knowing that
protection will be provided by the Afghan army and police, what
arrangements are being made to equip and train Afghan soldiers and men

is not just Afghanistan that will lose international aid but Pakistan,

is certainly time to congratulate Pakistan and its new leader. Although

the democratic process following electoral reform and a recent
strengthening of the judiciary. I am pleased to say that we have been
part of that. DfID, alongside its focus on girls’ education,

Foreign investment in Pakistan is draining away and donors are getting
tougher. Even our own International Development Committee in its latest

for more effective aid through the aid programme and through IMF

to exchanges that I have had with the Ministry of Defence, a White
Paper on precisely how we are going to recruit 30,000 reserves is due

notice period has to be given to employers, particularly small
employers, about when a reservist is likely to be called up. That has
been one of the biggest problems that the Territorial Army has faced
during the past 20 or 30 years. We also need to increase employer
awareness of the requirements. This is particularly important for small
firms. If you employ only five or six people, it is extremely important
that you know how long the notice period will be before someone is
called up, how long they will be away and when they will be back. There
must be an opportunity for young men and women who join the reserves as
officers to command. During the past 10 or 20 years when we have sent
troops to Afghanistan and other theatres of conflict, we have sent
regular soldiers and reservist soldiers but not the young officers who
need to get experience in command. We need to deploy units of the

potential of developing nations represents lost customers, trade and
ultimately growth for the UK and global economy. Investing in effective
development means investing in new markets for UK companies abroad. As
UK aid is

developing countries with opportunities to enter international markets,

well-targeted aid can provide better life chances and opportunities to
young people who would otherwise face a future with little or no

Nicholson of Winterbourne:</Member></B> My Lords, following three
decades of conflict and international sanctions, Iraq’s economy
is set to become one of the fastest growing in the world over the next
10 years. Its GDP growth for 2013 is forecast for around 14%, largely
fuelled by a rapidly developing hydrocarbons sector that already
generates around $8 billion a month in oil revenues. On the back of
this sizeable wealth stream, Iraq’s import demand is projected
to increase by 150% by 2020, with major opportunities in sectors
including power generation, infrastructure, healthcare, education,
financial and professional services, telecoms, security and defence, IT
and beyond. Inevitably, rapid population growth is also anticipated,
from maybe 30 million today to maybe 70 million or beyond.
These are large numbers for government and the private sector to
satisfy demand for
investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000030">Where
is Britain in this? British companies are especially well placed to
capitalise on investment opportunities in Iraq given the significant
historical and cultural ties that exist between us, as well as the
UK’s solid reputation for quality and transparent business
practices. UK exports to Iraq totalled £782 million
in 2011 and exports of goods increased 40% in 2012 to just over
£1 billion. Although commendable, this is minuscule compared
with Turkish trade with Iraq, which climbed to $8.3 billion in 2011
from $2.8 billion in 2007 according to Turkish government statistics.
Almost 600 Turkish construction companies are working in Iraq according
to the Turkish Foreign Economic Relations Board. Iran’s trade
with Iraq is worth more than $10 billion according to the Iran-Iraq
Chamber of Commerce—that is 10 times as much as
Britain’s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000031">Iraq
is rebuilding the country from the ground up but there is continuing
evidence that Britain is losing out to competitors, especially from the
Far East and other European countries. There are many examples: massive
contracts to build huge power stations in Basra have gone already to
Greek and Turkish companies and recent defence expenditure favoured
Russia and the Czech Republic. Iraq is rebuilding her railway system at
a cost of more than $60 billion. The world’s first railway
engine was invented here in Britain and a UK company, Bombardier, makes
high-performance 
<?notus-xml column=472?>trains that are sold all over the world. Yet only this week
the Iraqi Government announced that they were importing 10 trains from
China.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000032">I must
point out that British company BP and Anglo-Dutch company Shell are
between them producing more than 70% of federal Iraq’s total
income from two giant oil and gas fields at Rumaila and Al Majnoon.
Shell has just started a unique $18 billion gas capture programme, the
first in the world, which will enable Iraq to fuel all its power
stations with gas by the end of the decade. That will provide wealth
for the Iraqi economy and jobs for the Iraqi people. It is a fantastic
achievement by one British-owned and one partly British-owned company,
with subcontractors that in many instances are also British. We should
be very proud of their
achievements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000033">Other
sectors in Iraq such as construction and infrastructure are wide open

Britain had only 2% of all investment in Kuwait by foreign

important British politicians, including our Prime Minister, the Mayor
of London and the Lord Mayor of the City of London, have shuttled
through Gulf countries lately, aiming not just to sell British goods,
such as warplanes, but to attract oil money to help fund pressing UK

bilateral trade with Gulf countries is estimated by analysts to be
worth more than $15 billion annually, but that is still a modest sum

pay tribute here to the extraordinary skills and sheer hard work of the

Eames:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to draw attention to the issue of
the United Kingdom’s contribution to international development
and, in doing so, to express serious concern to the Government about
the absence of any detailed reference to it in the gracious Speech. In
so doing, I find myself repeating the concerns already expressed in
this debate by, among others, my noble and right reverend friend the
Bishop of Ripon and Leeds and the noble Lord, Lord Collins of

in 2010, the Government made a strong and welcome commitment to give
priority to international development. This would be achieved, we were
told, by protection for the overseas aid budget by pledging to spend
0.7% of gross national income on overseas aid from 2013 and, most
important of all, by cementing that commitment in legislation. The
welcome that such intentions received from many sources indicated, if
evidence were required, the widespread willingness to support
international aid. That support came from across the political arena,
from voluntary aid societies such as Christian Aid, humanitarian aid
agencies, the churches and many
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T20:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000041">In
this year’s Budget, the United Kingdom finally reached the
target of 0.7%. Is it any wonder that there has been genuine and
widespread disappointment that a Bill to enshrine that target has been
omitted from the Queen’s Speech? Those promises issued in 2010
were one thing. A failure to move ahead on legislation which would have
overwhelming support in this House, in the other place and in the
country, is difficult to
understand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051563000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051563000042">We
are told that there are such economic pressures at
present—pressures which were not fully understood in 2010 and
which have arisen since—that it is dangerous to translate
intentions into law and that 0.7% must remain the aspiration only. In
the light of economic recession, such arguments spring easily to our
mind, yet the temptation to reallocate resources across the board in
times of economic hardship raises serious dangers for such matters as
overseas

legislation which would allow long-term reassurance—a long-term
basis for planning and long-term reassurance for the voluntary
sector—is vital. Such legislation would underscore the
effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s overseas aid. As we
approach the G8 conference in Fermanagh, such legislation would show
the world that the United Kingdom can provide global leadership in
attempts to reduce world poverty and to reduce the desperate plight of
the hungry. Such legislation would demonstrate to the world that
Britain had the courage to back up good intentions even in difficult
economic
situations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T20:16:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

development for the best working years of my life, I can only admire
the admirable simplicity of the approach of the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Eames, to this subject. However, as I will
demonstrate, I do not think that compassion is enough. I also regret
that the noble Lord, Lord Cameron of Dillington, is not in his place. I
worked for an organisation that had equity investments in three seed
companies in Africa. It worked very closely with the largest privately
owned American seed company. It brought clonal tea to Zimbabwe and
Tanzania and bred elite oil palms for the Far East. In fact, it did
everything that the noble Lord suggested should be done now, and I was

development and aid has in fact always been controversial. It has never
been a simple subject. Indeed, if your Lordships were to read the 238

read those 238 pages—you may end up, like me, completely
confused. I say that advisedly. I am not sure, but I think that DfID is
driven by the millennium development goals, yet those are not working.
It is true to say that the countries that will be able to achieve the
millennium development goals would have achieved them anyway and that
those that cannot achieve them would never have done so anyway. There
are countries going in and out of the green, amber and red definitions
of the millennium goals, which certainly need to be thoroughly revised

own House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee wrote a very good report

the evidence given to that committee about the effectiveness of aid.

used to be great debate in this House about development and aid. Lord
Balogh and Lord Bauer used to go head to head. Lord Balogh was an
adviser on official development assistance, while Lord Bauer would say
that economic growth and development were what was needed and that aid
interrupted the progress towards economic growth and the elimination or
amelioration of poverty. We now have consensus, which the noble Lord,
Lord Collins referred to, so we cease to debate the matter as we are
all agreed. All that does, if I may say so, is open the door to Mr
Nigel Farage—not a very welcome development—because, as

wrong. On that proposition, I agree with him, even if his attitude to

thinking about economic development and international development.
There are four strands to it. First, there is economic growth, which
leads one on to poverty. I think everybody agrees—the Secretary
of State has said it—that economic growth is the most important
means of reducing poverty. The House of Lords committee said that
economic growth is essential if poverty is to be reduced, which is of
course absolutely right. Secondly, the millennium development goals
talk about the eradication of poverty but then refer to the eradication
of extreme poverty. However, the Joseph Rowntree Foundation says that
we have poverty in the United Kingdom. Thirdly, we have corruption.
Nothing should be done if it leads to corruption and we must do
everything to avoid it, but we have corruption here. We have not lost
it; there is still some about. Fourthly, there is disaster relief,
which I would like to leave out, but of course if Cockermouth gets
flooded we give its people relief.</hs_para>

now in the United Kingdom. I have heard economic growth mentioned
several times tonight in connection with the eurozone and Europe. We
have not eliminated poverty and we never will. We have corruption. The
Charity Commission is looking 
<?notus-xml column=476?>at the moment at a charity that appears to
have behaved very badly. Is anybody suggesting that we
should get rid of the serious fraud squad? We do disaster relief, too,
so when thinking about international development we should stop
thinking about achieving things and about targets or exits and endings.
It is not that at all but a continuous process, which has gone on here
and in the whole of the developed world and will go on everywhere else.
When it goes on successfully, of course we will build much more
interesting relationships of the kind my noble friend Lady Nicholson
mentioned with Iraq, because that is all part of how you come out of
problems of one sort or another and create positive relationships. We
can make sense of the debate about international development only when
we realise that none of the four strands which I have mentioned go
away. They all persist.</hs_para>

declare an interest. I used to work for a thing that was called the
Commonwealth Development Corporation. It was a classic development
finance institution. We used to look for economic opportunities,
carrying our own technology and management capability with us. We were
prepared to lead and to be in consortia. We took risks and
went where other people—the pure private
sector—were not quite prepared to go. We did things that were
quite risky and exciting and on the whole very successful. However, the
previous Administration wanted rid of it. They thought that there was
no place for such a gap-filling development finance institution, so
they tried to sell it to the private sector. They modelled it on that
private sector and left it in limbo.</hs_para>

tell us, if not now then later, when we have a Statement on
CDC. I hope that we might get a trailer tonight because we still need a
classically designed development finance institution that is not aid

Bizarrely, the European Union is not mentioned, yet it is likely to
dominate the debate, at least until the general election as the civil

The country is fascinating as it has made great strides to a two party
democratic system. President Ma, who was elected for a second term last
year as KMT president, has taken the pragmatic and sensible view that
it is better to improve relations with the mainland, which had fallen
into a parlous state, through increasing trade links and travel between
Taiwan and the mainland. Noble Lords may not know that 1 million out of
a population of 23 million work on the mainland. Since 2008, the number
of weekly flights between Taiwan and the mainland has increased from
zero to 616. There have been 18 cross-strait agreements with the
mainland. As a result, the Taiwanese economy showed excellent growth
overall during his first term although, like many other countries, it

stated, the Government are in general pursuing the correct policies
with regard to Hong Kong and Taiwan. I wish I could say the same about
our relationship with Cyprus. I declare an interest as a member of the
all-party Northern Cyprus group. The current dispute between Turkish
and Greek Cypriots is now more than 40 years old. Over those 40 years,
there have been many serious attempts by people of good will from both
sides of the island and from outside organisations to bring about a
resolution. All those attempts failed and all had one very significant
fact in common: as noble Lords might expect, they all used the
political machinery of the island as the primary, if not the sole, 
<?notus-xml column=484?>mechanism for negotiation. Perhaps repeated failure of essentially the
same process, albeit with different actors, should come as no surprise.
However, at some stage, those involved have to address the obvious
question of whether it really makes sense to do the same thing over and
over again and expect something different to happen. The two
communities seem to be resigned to the status quo. Research conducted
last July shows that over 70% of both communities now feel that they
should assert their own rights, even if it means that members of the
other community would be adversely affected. The same survey revealed
that only 14% of Turkish Cypriots and 39% of Greek Cypriots would
prefer a feasible solution now to an optimal solution sometime in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000048">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:02:34"></hs_TimeCode>
is all regrettable but does it really matter? The two sides are de
facto separate states. I believe that it is very important to the
people of Cyprus, the people of the eastern Mediterranean and to
Britain. The eastern Mediterranean is now more troubled and unstable
than at any time in the past decade. We have a civil war in Syria,
enormous tension between Iran and Israel and unresolved situations in
Libya and Egypt. Now, in addition, there are the problems raised by the
huge gas finds in Cypriot territorial waters. Exactly who that gas
belongs to and in what quantities, how to develop the fields and how to
transport the gas are all questions which, if unresolved, are highly
likely to add severely to the political tensions. They may also stop
the gas fields being developed at all in the foreseeable
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000049">Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:03:32"></hs_TimeCode>

Cyprus in the debate on the humble Address last year, I was, on the
whole, fairly pessimistic about the prospects for reunification, as was
the UN’s representative Alexander Downer and most of those
involved in the process of negotiation at the time. I pointed out a
year ago, as the noble Lord, Lord Northbrook, has done today, that
there was a fundamental reason for being pessimistic—namely,
that the negotiations over reunification had been going on for around
40 years, using the same methods, often with the same people and always
with the same result:
failure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000053">I
argued then that some new event, stimulus or approach was needed if any
progress were to be made. In the past 12 months there has been no
shortage of new events. Most obviously, the economic situation in the
south has worsened very dramatically; the region itself has become more
and more unstable as the conflict in Syria continues and as the danger
of Turkey being drawn into the conflict increases; and Turkey itself
has grown in economic strength, regional influence and overall
importance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000054">Furthermore,
the existence of huge gas reserves in Cypriot territorial waters now
presents itself as a possible way out of the economic difficulties
being experienced on both sides of the island. There are the cautious
beginnings of a feeling among those involved in the effort to reunify
that there may just be, for the first time in many years, a real
opportunity to make progress. I would not go so far as to say that
there is yet optimism, but the pervading pessimism may have abated a
little.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000055">There
are some encouraging signs. The election of President Anastasiades, who
voted for the Annan plan, is surely encouraging. The realisation that
the gas finds may help all Cyprus economically is encouraging. The work
being done in this area by the FCO with the two diaspora communities
will, I am sure, prove to be helpful if it is developed and continued.
In addition, Alexander Downer, the UN’s representative, is back
and active on the island—not entirely to everyone’s 
<?notus-xml column=486?>complete satisfaction, of course. Five days ago, the

acknowledge of course that the reunification process cannot currently
be right at the top of President Anastasiades’s agenda, and I
know that the fact that negotiations have not yet recommenced is a
source of real frustration to Turkey and to Turkish Cypriots.
Turkey’s Foreign Minister was quoted in <I>Today’s
Zaman</I> two weeks ago as saying that the Turkish Cypriot
side’s call to restart talks should be urgently addressed. By
contrast, the Greek Cypriot Foreign Minister has recently said
that negotiations should wait until October. I think that both points
of view are entirely understandable. October is, after all, only four
months away, which is not a long time in the context of 40

that President Anastasiades has explicitly restated the high priority
that he assigns to the reunification process. The fact is that both
sides of the island badly need the gas finds to be exploited, or at
least to be recognised as commercially exploitable. The economic
difficulties of the south are well known and highly visible, but the
north is an economic dependency of Turkey and it needs investment on a
large scale if it is to escape poverty, fulfil its citizens’
aspirations and realise its potential. Gas would go a long way to
helping this. It is estimated that $3 billion a year could accrue to
Cyprus from gas, and this would be on top of the estimated
3% per annum growth in GDP predicted as a consequence of

overcome are immense. Where the pipeline should come ashore, how supply
is to be guaranteed free of interference and how the proceeds are to be

really very bleak indeed and I think that this realisation may have got

discussions and critiques of the reunification process, inevitably a

report on this today, that there will be 10 new objectives, which are
all believable, necessary, realisable, we hope, and intellectually
defensible. They are obvious issues such as ending extreme poverty,
ending hunger, ensuring the provision of safe and sustainable water,
school development, empowering girls and women and so on. There is
nothing that we would
dispute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:17:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000068">However,
the <I>Guardian</I> reports that the Prime Minister is busy disputing
with the President of Liberia, one of the poorest countries in the
world which probably will not achieve any one of the major millennium
development goals, whether there should be a provision in the new
sustainable development goals on removing income inequality. I find
that odd. No. 10 says, according to the <I>Guardian</I>, that the Prime
Minister wants to keep the focus on measurable concrete actions that
are going to help to alleviate poverty and keep the focus on being
something that people could judge whether we are delivering. If one
thing is abundantly apparent in the new optimism in Africa it is that
income disparity is becoming an ugly reality. There are booming numbers
of new billionaires and multi-millionaires in Africa’s new
wealthy cities who are becoming gated and divided from the poor that
they once lived alongside. Those poor remain without water,
electricity, social supplies, good hospitalisation, healthcare and
adequate work. It is an absolute necessity to close the gap in that
income disparity and I am somewhat despaired, if not shocked, at David
Cameron’s approach. I hope the Minister will consider taking
this aspect back to No 10. It is rather odd to dispute with the
president of one of the poorest, most conflict-ridden zones in the
world a fundamental principle point on removing income
disparity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:18:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000069">Perhaps
I may move on to a second area in the few minutes left to me—I
declare a specific interest as a director of KPMG
International—which is the work that my firm does on behalf of
DfID in leading and supporting the work of the Independent Commission
on Aid Impact. When the previous Secretary of State, Andrew Mitchell,
took up office in 2010, he had established by 2011 the Independent
Commission on Aid Impact, which reports to the Select Committee in
another place. In the course of the exactly two years that ICAI has
been in existence, it has published 21 reports of great
significance. In fact, at this moment an ICAI commissioner, Mark
Foster, formerly head of Accenture, and a group of assessors are in
Jordan and the Lebanon looking at the refugee crisis for a report for
DfID.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0002.htm#13051565000070">Some of
ICAI’s reports have looked at DfID’s approach to
anti-corruption, oversight of EU aid to low-income countries, electoral
support through the UNDP, engagement with the World Bank, climate
change, impacts in Bangladesh, the health sector in Zimbabwe, education
programmes in Nigeria and so on. In total, ICAI has made 85
independent recommendations to DfID, of which the department has
accepted 70 in full, 11 in part and has rejected only four. In other
words, the case is proven that there is a need for an
independent body that looks hard at £11.8 billion of public
expenditure and comes to a sensible, independent adjudication on value
for money and takes an adequate approach to ensure that the
public get a sound investment. Indeed, ICAI has
just 
<?notus-xml column=489?>published its latest report on the work of UNICEF,
in which I am delighted to declare an interest as a vice-president and

interesting to discover that ICAI is being reviewed by the Cabinet
Office, which it has asked DfID to undertake, so the very body to which
the recommendations of ICAI are meant to go is assessing whether it
would like the commission to continue. That seems to me to be a
significant potential conflict of interest. It is obvious that if ICAI
can make 85 independent recommendations which had not previously been
seen and have 70 of them accepted, there is a real and genuine need to
maintain the independence of the independent commission and strengthen
its role, not just for the remaining two years of its life, but

want to declare another interest as a member of Trade Out of Poverty, a
group chaired by Peter Lilley from another place. As we all know, there
is continuing pressure on trade negotiations to be completed by the end
of this year. Should trade opportunity be better liberalised as markets
would require, it would release new energy into the market system,
boosting the potential of poor communities, particularly agricultural
communities, by an estimated further trillion dollars of income that
would go to the poorest people. Solving trade issues will be up to the
big decision-makers and the G8 must play its part. The group firmly
believes that it is necessary to open up rich country markets
unconditionally to the poorest countries of all, and that it is time to
end the ridiculous subsidies, such as $2 per cow per day in the EU
and $3 billion spent in the US to subsidise cotton and then
dump it, which undermines the jobs of 25,000 cotton growers in the poor
world, particularly in Africa. It is time to stop protecting our own
agricultural base through subsidy and let the rest of the world have
access to markets and thus generate jobs. It is time to let trade be
what delivers the economic future necessary for the world’s
poorest.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/9571C50B06EBD06B042C15B3EE8D9A6BFBB6D439" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 May 2013">Wednesday,

leaving the European Union. In areas further east there is a strong
desire to join the Union. Perhaps that desire has something to do with

years I have paid three visits to the western Balkans, first to
Bosnia-Herzegovina, moving on to Republika Srpska and Banja Luka
further north. The second visit was made at the end of last year to
Serbia and Kosovo, and we also visited the Serb-dominated area north of
the Ibar river. Finally, just a few weeks ago we went to Macedonia. All
these countries share very strong aspirations to join the European
Union and, to a lesser extent, NATO as well. All are very anxious to
open negotiations as soon as possible. The response of the European
Union has, correctly of course, been to say to all of them that they
still have a great deal to do to qualify for membership. Indeed, there
is a vast amount that needs to be done before they can

fact is that, in so many of these countries, they find it extremely
hard to live together in harmony. There is a degree of malevolence
which is scarcely below the surface and, too frequently, pops up above
the surface. In Bosnia, development is bedevilled by the existence of
Republika Srpska in the north and its connections with Serbia and
Belgrade. Kosovo, too, is a country divided, with a Serbian enclave to
the north and suffering from a lack of recognition. Macedonia is a
country in limbo, facing non-recognition by Greece and other states,
with added confusion and doubt raised by the recent remarks of the
Albanian leadership about aspirations for a Greater

they would be nothing but trouble until they can put their house in
order. We must insist that they learn to live amicably with each other
before European Union membership is a reality for them. I know of
course that recent steps and meetings between them have made an
important start to this essential progress and I certainly would
welcome real progress when it can be made. Cathy
Ashton—the noble Baroness, Lady Ashton—of course has,
within the past few weeks, quite rightly prided herself that the recent
so-called agreement between Serbia and Kosovo could lead to a
breakthrough and to the beginning of negotiations for EU membership for
them. However, to be honest, the agreement that she negotiated and
worked on is only paper-thin. Serbia still refuses to recognise Kosovo

to Bosnia, again we hear of progress in the past few days in the talks
between Belgrade and Sarajevo. However, the truth is that there is no
love lost between the two, in spite of the Dayton agreement. Perhaps I
am being cynical, but I cannot help wondering whether these recent,
rather cosmetic, so-called agreements and understandings are, in
reality, examples of what I would describe as them going through the
motions in order to get accession negotiations for European membership
started while, at the same time, not really intending to put their
differences behind
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051565000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#13051565000078">Frankly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:20:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:29:16"></hs_TimeCode>,
the European Union and its entire membership holds the whip hand here
and can use that power to offer the carrot of European Union
membership. We must make it clear—and stick to it—that
unless the west Balkan states learn to drop their antagonisms, and are
seen genuinely to do so, we really do not have a place for them
in either the European Union or NATO. It is essential that the
Government and the Foreign Office insist on the European
Union—the Commission or whoever it is that does the
negotiating—using very strong negotiating positions in insisting
that we can welcome these countries into the European Union and NATO
only if their relationship with their neighbours and their own citizens
is one of peacefulness and tolerance.</hs_para>

a large decision should have the proper processes, which must include a

that going to be possible before the Government move to a decision in
principle to go out to the OEJU process for inviting bidders, or decide

has been quite a public debate, although there has not been much in

but I think the Minister would readily agree that he was not in a
position to give answers of any substance to the questions that were
asked. The <I>Financial Times</I> has followed this very closely. As
recently as last week, on 7 May, it reported that officials in the US
Department of Defense were expressing concerns about how a GOCO scheme
could affect our close and special relationship with the United States
on defence. So it is an important matter and I would welcome whatever
information the Minister can give in his

are two other issues I would like to touch on that were not covered in

particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Ashdown: the interpreters

accepted that principle when we reached arrangements for the
interpreters in Iraq and we cannot walk away from the duty of care that
we have to the interpreters in Afghanistan. The Prime Minister has not
given a definitive answer on this. He says that the Government are
looking at it. He said a short while ago that money would be available
but in the majority of cases money is not necessarily the issue; it is
their future safety and that of their families. I would welcome an
answer from the Minister on

third area I would like to cover has not been covered at all in this
debate. I have just mentioned our moral duty to the interpreters in
Afghanistan. We have an overall moral duty to our Armed Forces. Indeed,
in this debate, rightly, due respect and credit have been given to the
service they give this country day in and day out, many of them paying
with their lives. As a country, we have a contract with our Armed
Forces, the Armed Forces covenant. It covers a number of areas. One
relates to members of our Armed Forces not being allowed to join a
trade union or federation to represent them, the argument being that
their officers in the rank system represent them. The previous
Government, under some duress—they did not want to do
it—set up a Service Complaints Commissioner. She took office in
2008 and since then has published 
<?notus-xml column=492?>an annual report. Her report stated quite clearly,
and backed it up with facts, that the number of complaints was
increasing. That may be a good thing—it may be that, because
people know that the service is there, they are making
complaints—but I would have thought that the fact that 48% more
cases were dealt with last year than in the previous year, with 46% of
complaints still not resolved at unit level, is something to be
concerned about.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T21:39:20"></hs_TimeCode> Select
Committee on Defence in another place is also concerned.</hs_para>

commissioner has said, “I’m not really as effective as I
could and should be in meeting the responsibility to the Armed
Forces”. The Armed Forces should have an ombudsman, who would
step in almost as a last resort. The concern within the services is,
understandably, the rank system—the belief that the officer rank
system is what maintains discipline and looks after service personnel.
I only wish that that were the case; all too often, that falls down.
The Navy has certainly improved its complaints system by saying,
“What is reasonable? Let’s not just stick to the rules.
Let us sometimes put those on one side and deal with the
complaint”. Its list of complaints has gone down. That is not
true of the Army, where the number has gone up. There is certainly
great resistance within the services to the idea of an ombudsman. I
gather that the service chiefs said that they did not understand what
an ombudsman did, but they were sure that they did not want one. I
think that many of us could picture them saying

this year, the Select Committee on Defence in another place published a
report which said that it, too, felt that there needed to be an
ombudsman. Like the Service Complaints Commissioner, it did not define
what the remit should be; it was something that needed to be discussed
between the MoD—taking into account the concerns about
rank—and the Service Complaints Commissioner. Although the
deadline has passed, the Government have not yet responded to that
report but have in any statements that they have made said that they

believe that this is an integral part of the Armed Forces covenant. The
Armed Forces are entitled to it; we have a responsibility to them. Many
of them are leaving the services without their complaint having been
dealt with. This may appear a small matter—if the decision was
the right one, it would be—but we have a complaints system which
is not meeting the needs of our service personnel. If that is part of
the Armed Forces covenant—and it is—we are falling down

to the importance of ensuring security, good governance and
development. There was no reference to the important role that our
Government continue to play in the economic, social and political
developments in Africa. In her opening speech, the noble Baroness spoke
about the successful elections in Egypt and Tunisia, as well as the
positive developments in Somalia—all very encouraging. She did
not speak about the recent election in Kenya, which thankfully was
peaceful and where President Kenyatta has given a commitment to the

my short allotted time, I shall touch briefly on three challenges
facing southern Africa: the forthcoming general election in Zimbabwe,
which is likely to be in 
<?notus-xml column=495?>September; the millennium development goals, more
specifically food insecurity and the need for more support
infrastructure, particularly by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation; and, finally, an issue close to my heart, as I wear the

referendum on the constitution in Zimbabwe should be the first step
towards democratic reforms leading to the general election scheduled
for September. So far, so good. Although over the past five years there
has been considerable economic progress in the country, with the
so-called unity Government of the MDC and ZANU-PF, the army, the police
and the dreaded CIO are all still controlled by President Robert
Mugabe’s ZANU-PF, which raises the threat that the forthcoming

ensure that the elections are free and fair, transparent, non-violent
and sustainable, it is essential that international observers are
allowed to monitor the general election. Unfortunately, not much
progress has been achieved in getting that consent from ZANU-PF. That
is certainly a cause of concern. Can the Minister assure us that we
will put pressure on SADC as the guarantor of democracy in Zimbabwe to
ensure that that essential check and balance is put in place? The
dividends of a free and fair election in Zimbabwe would be a huge boost
not just to the country but to the entire region. It would lead to the
lifting of the remaining economic sanctions and, I hope, pave the way
to Zimbabwe rejoining the
Commonwealth.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305164000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305164000005">The

have made major progress towards achieving them, while my noble friend
Lord Hastings referred to the wealth divide in Africa. While there has
been steady economic growth with improvements in poverty reduction,
universal primary education, gender parity and healthcare on the
continent, the lack of efficient farming, inadequate storage and, in

lack of adequate infrastructure in Africa has been identified as one of
the major impediments to development and economic growth. Increasing
the power supply is a key driver of sustainable growth. Most

Commonwealth Development Corporation, which is controlled by DfID, has
played a major role in investing in African infrastructure but could,
in my opinion, play a much bigger role in stemming the rise of
China’s influence across the continent, in which it has already

important role in the economic transformation of sub-Saharan Africa, by

According to an official recent CITES report, up to 11.7% of
Africa’s elephants were illegally killed in 2011, which equates
to almost 25,000 elephants in a single year, to supply ivory to the
illegal markets in China and the Far East.

see him. He asked, “Would you be kind enough to agree to reply

cannot be denied that both points are true, but where does that leave
Britain? Personally, I take the same stance as the right honourable
William Hague, that since we can and should recognise India’s
position as a growing superpower, there must be a shift from simply
providing aid to fostering skills and training. This is true of many
other countries around the world. It will ensure sustainable
development for the future of developing countries, as opposed to

also important to note that the term “development” is not
restricted to economic prosperity. India is an example of a country
seemingly rich with its booming economy, but desperately poor given its
dismal living standards. When we look at a country’s
development, we need to look not only at its economy but also its
health standards, literacy rates, social progress and promotion of
fundamental human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305164000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305164000024">Living
standards are often far worse for women, and in India the issues faced
by widows can make their lives barely worth living. This is
particularly important, since although women make up just over 50% of
the world’s population, they account for 70% of the
world’s poor. Through a transition from giving financial aid to
delivering skills and training, we can try to address this
gap<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T22:03:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I declare
an interest as the founder of the Loomba Foundation, and I have seen
this gap myself through my foundation’s most recent
sewing-machine project in my home state of Punjab and in Andhra
Pradesh. At present, we are in the process of empowering 10,000 widows
in India by providing each with a sewing machine and skilled training
to make garments. This offers them much more than a lifelong skill. It
gives a widow the opportunity to generate her own income. It gives her
back her dignity, independence and the real chance of a
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305164000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305164000025">These
effects are not limited to a widow as an individual, but extend to her
children who no longer need to sacrifice their education, and to her
family who no longer need to live from hand to mouth. She has, in
essence, lifted herself and her family out of poverty—and that
is one less family to add to the 
<?notus-xml column=499?>statistics. The principle goes back to the age-old
saying: teach a man to fish and he will never go hungry. The same can
be said in the case of development and a woman’s place in its
process. Educate and empower a woman and you save a family,
eliminate poverty and develop a
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305164000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305164000026">My

at its economic situation we can get a better understanding of the
vital role that women play in development. Bangladesh was once
dismissed as having no hope of a future, but today it is hailed as a
model of development. In the past decade, Bangladesh has slashed its
poverty by half, ensured that 90% of its girl children are enrolled in
school, moderated population growth, limited child mortality, increased
life expectancy and ensured overall social progress for all. This
success has, in large part, been due to the empowerment of women, not
only through education and family planning but also through microcredit
schemes aimed at giving out tiny loans to the destitute, thanks to
Muhammad
Yunus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305164000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305164000027">What has

tragedy of at least one of the Iraq campaigns lies not so much in its

this war in Syria is a war of religious sects within the larger frame

because both the Sunnis and the Shia are not united. The Sunnis are
divided into those who take their cue from the House of Saud and from
some of the Emirates, and the Wahhabis; the others, such as al-Qaeda

Egyptian Government, with their links to Hamas, nor restive forces on
the West Bank reluctant to drop sweeping preconditions make compromise
easy. However, there is a more realistic outlook in the Gulf emirates

essential work being done by our courageous servicemen and servicewomen
around the world in protecting us at home from the global terrorist
threat. I join in paying tribute to their service and what they are
doing for us. But there is another global war—the war against
poverty. Many British NGOs and people who work for them are putting
themselves in harm’s way in very difficult countries and
situations to provide healthcare, sanitation and education to the
world’s poorest—organisations such as Save the Children,
Christian Aid, Oxfam, CAFOD and the British Red Cross. We can be

to the most recent global terrorism index, there were 4,564 terrorist
incidents resulting in 7,473 deaths in the past year. Most
of those incidents have been clustered in Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan

which 11 million children die each year from preventable diseases. In
the six hours so far of this debate, more children have died from
preventable diseases around the world than have died in the entire

not surprising, given that I regard this Government’s commitment

most significant political decision, and one of the most courageous
political decisions that I have ever witnessed. To raise 
<?notus-xml column=502?>it to that level, to increase over the past year, at
a time of acute economic hardship, the budget for overseas aid by
almost £3 billion, is something that required real leadership.
It would have been the easiest thing in the world to capitulate on that

money was spent elsewhere. But David Cameron has shown immense
leadership and<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T22:19:15"></hs_TimeCode>

to the Pearson commission in 1969. It has come up through the OECD, it
was raised at the UN Security Council and at the Gleneagles summit and
still has not been honoured. However, today, it is being honoured.
There ought to be an annual debate about the world’s poor. We
ought to see that as a conscious moral choice and an obligation. I
would not want to see a piece of legislation take that away and be
almost like a direct debit. I would like it to be seen as a constant

conclusion, there is a wonderful campaign at present called the
“If” campaign. Sometimes charities and NGOs can compete
with each other for resources and projects. However, they have all come
together around the simple concept that there is enough food for
everyone and yet 2.3 million children die each year because of
malnutrition. The Prime Minister, who organised a hunger summit during
the Olympic Games on 12 August last year, made a pledge to reach
25 million children under the age of five by the time of the
Rio Olympics in
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T22:24:16"></hs_TimeCode>. There will
be a follow-up hunger summit on 8 June in advance of the G8 summit. It
is critical that the Prime Minister uses all his considerable
diplomatic skills to encourage other members of the G8 to step up to

economically but nowhere near as tough as they are for the bottom

after-dinner speech and seek to entertain your Lordships for a few
minutes. However, I am very happy to note that the noble Lord, Lord

your Lordships’ indulgence I would like to say a few words by
way of preface to my main remarks on the way in which we conduct these
debates on the gracious Speech. I have always found the structure 
<?notus-xml column=503?>bizarre. Why can we not segment each daily debate and group the speakers
so that those who wish to address one topic can follow each other,
permitting the Minister or Whip speaking for the appropriate department
to answer speeches focusing on that topic before we go on to the next
topic, which in turn would be answered by the Minister or Whip
answering for the relevant department, and so on? I pity the poor
Ministers who have to wind up at the end of an eight-hour debate which
has covered issues in the remit of as many as five different
departments. Capable as they are, it is an unreasonable burden. It is
cruel and unusual punishment. I believe that a sequenced, segmented
debate would bring greater coherence and maybe even greater interaction
among speakers addressing the same topic. In my humble view, both Front
and Back Benches would benefit. I should say that I am not expecting
the Minister to react to this because it is a matter for the House, not
the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T22:24:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305164000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305164000044">I
now come to the substance of my brief remarks. I need hardly
remind the House that the word “Europe” is nowhere to be
found in the gracious Speech. The Prime Minister’s staff seem to
have obeyed the instruction to eschew the “E” word with
even more zeal than did the staff of “Fawlty Towers” when
instructed not to mention the war, but it has not done the Government
any good. Within hours they were embroiled, yet again, in their own

conspicuously absent from, the list of measures that the Government

otherwise this year’s four-day debate would be remembered as the
one in which never had so much been said by so many about so little.
Therefore, I, like others who have spoken before me, will dare to use
the “E” word, but in relation only to the question of a
referendum. I do this within the framework of today’s debate
because the shape of our future relations with not only Europe but the
wider world will be determined by the outcome of any

me at the outset lay my cards on the table. My right honourable friend
the Leader of the Opposition is absolutely right when he says that
Labour will not commit to an in/out referendum by a set date, and he is
equally right not to rule out a referendum when the time is judged to
be ripe. Therefore, when Tory spokespersons and some of the media tell
us that Labour has once again made clear that it will never trust the
British people to have their say and opposes a referendum, they have,
to put it charitably, either misread what the Leader of the Opposition
said in his address to the annual conference of Progress last Saturday,

looking for an early exit are in reality saying, “It’s
broke, it can’t be fixed, and we want nothing more to do with

defeatists. Others, such as the Prime Minister, say,
“Let’s negotiate a few concessions from our fellow member
states and then see if the British people will buy them”. As the

concessions are bound to be inconsequential. At least I can agree with

to the satisfaction of all its members. It is to this that we should be
now turning our minds and applying our best efforts. It is a daunting
challenge but, together with our European partners, we can meet it.
There are plenty of interesting ideas being discussed here as to how we
might best fashion a more flexible two-speed or two-tier European
Union, more accountable to national parliaments and people, in which
those inside the eurozone and those outside it respect each
others’ rights and preferences and work together to each
others’ advantage. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart,

Government should engage fully with other EU Governments to develop
these ideas and not simply go whining to them for concessions that
irritate them and do little, if anything, for us. For those who accept
this approach, it follows logically that you call a referendum when you
are able to show the people what a reformed Union looks like. Will we
know by 2017? If we do, we could go ahead with a referendum, but it
could well take longer than that. Why, therefore, commit to a
referendum with an irrevocable deadline, and so far in advance? It

people, “Let us see what we can do to make the Union work for

political courage, and I am convinced that my right honourable friend
Ed Miliband has that courage. Political courage has not been much in
evidence of late in the European corridors of power. I recall what the
Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jean-Claude Juncker, said five years ago
as the great financial crisis unfolded. He said, “We know what
needs to be done but we don’t know how to get re-elected when
we’ve done it”. Spoken half in jest maybe, but he
correctly identified what lies in the back of the minds of too many
leaders facing tough decisions. We need more leaders with the courage
of the German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who in 2003 set out his
Agenda 2010 to reform his country’s social system and labour
market to improve economic growth and reduce unemployment. It was
deeply unpopular in his 
<?notus-xml column=505?>own Social Democratic Party and many thousands of
members left the party, but he persevered even though he knew it would
cost him the next election, and indeed it did. However, the reforms
went through, the eventual effects were what he had hoped for and

wish to say a few words about Syria and the tragedy that is being
played out there. More than 80,000 have already been killed and there
will be many more to come. It is only right that we want to help and,
as my noble friend Lady Northover indicated earlier, we are doing so.
Yet, there is always the law of unintended consequences that dogs our
every step in the Middle East. Syria is not a country or a crisis in
isolation. It comes with the context of so much that has
gone before. Let us take Iraq, for instance. It is almost
exactly 10 years since we invaded, and yet all those years
and all those lives later, Iraq is a country still beset by religious
and ethnic division and consumed by corruption. We invaded the country
genuinely committed to supporting democracy, human rights and western
values. We left that country with the images of Abu Ghraib and
Guantanamo Bay burnt into our reputation, and into the imaginations of
a generation of young Arabs. Those tiny, irritating, unintended

Britain a safer place? Unless we can say that that is clearly the case,

want to put this into a little more context before I get to Syria by
talking about Libya. We overthrew Gaddafi, a man who we had once armed,
just as we had once armed Saddam Hussein, and even Osama bin Laden when
he was fighting the Soviets. The law of unintended consequences had a
field day with that one. It is still too early to measure the success
in Libya. There is still widespread violence and lawlessness, and
despite all the support we have given to the new Libyan
Government, we seem to be no closer to discovering the truth behind the
Lockerbie bombing or bringing to justice the killer of PC Yvonne
Fletcher. It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T22:42:49"></hs_TimeCode> is
not just truth or justice that have disappeared into the sands, so has
Gaddafi’s enormous arsenal of weapons. Some 20,000
surface-to-air missiles, artillery pieces, mortar rounds and much more
have flown away and found new homes. Those weapons are now turning up
in new hotspots in north Africa and the Middle East—Algeria,
Niger, Mali, Somalia and, of course, Gaza, although that is scarcely a
new hotspot. These are more unintended

have turned up in Syria as well, contributing to the bloodbath and the
inhumanity. As a result, it is being argued with increasing passion in
some quarters that we must do something, go further, arm the good guys.
I understand the deep humanitarian concern that lies behind such
suggestions. The Minister herself as good as said something earlier
today about amending the EU arms embargo and facilitating a negotiated
solution, but putting more weapons into that area might also facilitate
an even greater catastrophe. The war in Syria, as we have heard from
many speakers in the debate, is not simply a civil war, it is part of a
war of sectarianism that is burning across so much of the Middle East.

understanding, let alone exploiting. It is being argued in some
quarters, possibly even implied in what the Minister said in her
remarks earlier, that because Assad’s arsenal is huge, we must
give the rebels more and thus level up the playing field—or
level up the killing field. It is suggested, for instance, that we
supply items such as body armour, which does not kill. No, it does not,

serious about improving procurement. I trust that no noble Lord in this

procurement is concerned, but that does not mean that we can leap
straight into any particularly new model without careful scrutiny of

Royal United Services Institute has rejected the GOCO idea as
“undemocratic” and said it would put the power in the
hands of defence contractors, on the basis that the MoD is not good at
negotiating contracts with the private sector. The main question is
whether the MoD should negotiate contracts with the private sector to
negotiate on its behalf. I do not agree with the rejection of the
proposals, but I have some questions. How will the contractors’
fees or commission be calculated? Would it be possible to keep some
procurement in-house if the purchases were non-contentious, such as
buying off the shelf? Why pay commission if it is so easy to purchase?
Can the Minister make clear that the contractor will not itself be a
defence contractor in any way? What safeguards will there be to avert
conflicts of interest? How would a contractor be picked? Sadly, in this
global world, many firms have connections which would make that
conflict of interest quite difficult to
avoid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305166000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305166000004">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-15T22:49:27"></hs_TimeCode>

this is true, a light-hearted observation at this time of night might
be: how many members of MoD staff does it take to change a light-bulb?
Sixteen thousand is a lot of people. My noble friend Lord Lee asked if
this meant that we could not put our house in order. I am afraid that
we do seem to be unable to put our house in order. If we were able to
reduce this 16,000 down to, say, 1,000 to deal with the intelligent

Government’s support for the ICC system and for the co-operation
extended to the ICC in its investigations and prosecutions. The UK was

Rome statute represents a leap forward in international criminal
justice in a number of respects. First, the court has severe
punishments for those who are convicted, but it does not have the death
penalty. That sends a message around the world about the
proportionality of the use of the death penalty in those countries
which retain it. I particularly welcome that, as I chair the All-Party
Parliamentary Group for the Abolition of the Death
Penalty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305166000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305166000017">Secondly,
the court gives victims a right that they never had before to
participate in court proceedings by expressing their views and their
experiences through their own legal representatives. Victims also have
the possibility of reparations. The UK Government’s announcement
of a contribution of a further £0.5 million to the
criminal court’s trust fund for victims, the third such
contribution, is enormously to be
welcomed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305166000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305166000018">Thirdly,
the court has the most advanced gender provisions. The Rome statute is
the first international treaty to identify crimes against women as
crimes against humanity, as war crimes and, in some cases, as genocide.
These provisions are all exemplary. The Government’s initiative
on sexual violence and the G8 declaration on preventing sexual violence
in conflict are a great encouragement to all those trying to respond to
this particularly terrible aspect of war and conflict.</hs_para>

this background of the Government’s long-term support for the
ICC, perhaps I may raise with the Minister just two issues. First,
there is the question of the crime of aggression and the Kampala
amendments. These are the amendments to the statute agreed in Kampala
in 2010 that will enable the court by 2017 to begin a process to
exercise jurisdiction with respect to the crime of aggression.
Some 30 notifications are needed for the amendments to be activated.
The UK played an important role in Kampala in achieving a consensus on
the amendments. What is the Government’s thinking now on
ratifying the Kampala amendments? Are the Government working with other
states’ parties, especially in the European Union and
Commonwealth, to encourage ratification? Are the Government proposing
to incorporate the definition of the crime of aggression in our
domestic
legislation?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305166000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305166000020">Secondly,
there is the very difficult question of the ICC budget. Clearly there
are financial difficulties and the court must seek efficiencies and use
its money wisely, but the Minister must be aware of the great concern
among a large number of those involved about the approach being taken
to the ICC and the imposition of a zero-growth budget. This is
happening at a time when more cases are being undertaken and there is
wide encouragement to take more action against sexual violence. This
approach to the budget could bring the danger that there will only be
enough funds for conducting cases before the court, so that all the
other work essential for justice to be done will be reduced. In
particular there is a fear that work with victims and outreach to
affected communities will be seriously impaired. Are these concerns
being recognised and addressed? I do not expect the Minister to answer
these questions tonight: he has not had very much notice. Perhaps he
will be able to write to me sometime in the near
future.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/901E14E7EA3B58E855A074237C4BF64DB8FF10AD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 15 May 2013">Wednesday,

Rosser:</Member></B> My Lords, as I am sure noble Lords anticipated,
indeed expected, today’s debate has been wide-ranging and has
covered a great many issues, from the Chagos islanders to cybersecurity
and attacks. That was inevitable in a debate covering Foreign Office,
international development and defence matters. However, that is not in
any way a criticism. Particularly in a far from secure and stable
world, defence policy, foreign policy and our international development
goals should be geared towards agreed, co-ordinated
objectives and priorities, with our diplomats and Armed Forces
working in tandem alongside our international aid and development
programmes to deliver them, recognising the role that the use of soft
power can
play.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305169000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305169000002">Whether
that has been the case, or is likely to be the case over the next two
years, is another matter. The 2010 strategic defence and security
review was not related to Foreign Office or international development
goals. It was a straight exercise in rapidly cutting costs at a time
when the economy had been restored to growth over the previous nine
months. The consequences of rushed decisions were highlighted by a
recent National Audit Office report that was scathing about the double
U-turn since 2010—which means we are now back where we started
from—on the Joint Strike Fighters for our future aircraft
carriers. We now learn from 
<?notus-xml column=513?>Lockheed Martin, the programme’s main
contractor, that US Government spending cuts could inflate the overall
cost of the F-35 jet fighter, since a reduction in the number of
aircraft under construction at any time could drive up unit costs. What
is the Government’s assessment of the possible impact of US
Government spending cuts on the cost of the Joint Strike Fighter? Has
provision been made in the budget for an increase in cost or would such
an increase mean that we have to purchase a smaller number of
aircraft?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305169000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-0003.htm#1305169000003">An
indication of just how rushed was the 2010 SDSR came when the
Government told us it could be some months—up to another seven

seems odd that a Government prepared to make decisions on an SDSR in
six months need longer than that to make what is surely a more
straightforward single decision on Afghan interpreters. Perhaps it is a
case of defence policy being determined by the objectives of others,
rather than by co-ordinated Foreign Office, defence and international
development objectives. I hope that the Minister will be able to update
us on the current situation on Afghan interpreters when he replies and,

international aid and development. Several noble Lords have expressed
concern that there was no mention of such legislation in the gracious

further area where policy appears to be shifting is over Europe; a
number of your Lordships have spoken on that matter. The vision of the
larger party in the coalition appears to be that the European Union

plans to try to renegotiate the terms of Britain’s membership
and then hold a referendum in 2017. Large sections of his party want a
referendum on our continuing membership as soon as possible, with a
view to securing a no vote. What is clear is that the larger party in
the coalition will probably spend much of its time between now and the
general election contemplating its own navel over Europe. The statute
in this country as it stands provides for a referendum if there
is a significant transfer of sovereignty from Britain to Brussels. We

contractor will not be a major defence contractor, as potential bidders
will have to satisfy us about how they would deal with conflicts of

attended an informal Competitiveness Council (internal market and

The informal council focused on innovative pathways to jobs and growth
with a particular emphasis on the needs of
SMEs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051535000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-wms0001.htm#13051535000007">Before

plenary then broke into separate working groups. I attended the session
on access to finance, given that we are a leader in Europe on this
issue. In this session, Ministers agreed that the current model is
close to being broken. Governments, therefore, needed to consider how
to get banks lending; how far they can fill the gap in SME funding; and
support/encourage alternative forms of finance such as crowd
sourcing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051535000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-wms0001.htm#13051535000010">The
consensus was that the EU should focus its attentions on completing the

structural funds and how these can be directed to supporting
SMEs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051535000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-wms0001.htm#13051535000011">Concurrent

cities and regions as drivers for economic growth, Ministers noted
that: clusters should build on things that already exist (e.g.
universities and traditional industry); member states should aim for a
bottom-up approach that reflects the needs of particular regions; and
clusters can help SMEs internationalise and the EU should consider
cross-border
clusters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051535000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-wms0001.htm#13051535000013">On

could focus on: promoting entrepreneurship training; sharing best
practice; ways of making SMEs aware of support networks that are
available; Erasmus programmes focusing on key trade partners; FTAs and
special provisions for SMEs; better framework conditions at the EU
level (e.g. single market, reducing regulation); and simplified regimes
for

Commission should continue with its missions for growth as well as
focus on clusters and encouraging larger companies to work with SMEs.
It should also focus on markets that SMEs want to access and where this
is particularly difficult for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051535000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-wms0001.htm#13051535000016">Jane

discussion focused on the recommendations put forward by the High Level
Group on Innovation Policy Management, which had been set up during the
Polish presidency. There was general support from participating
delegations for the overarching recommendation of the group that more
was needed to optimise the functioning of the European innovation
system through improved management and coherence of the range of policy
initiatives. The UK welcomed the report and in particular the reference
to making sure policymakers and regulators understand how to use
science correctly in the development of regulation. We did not,
however, advocate a single, centralised authority with responsibility
for innovation policy across the
EU.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13051535000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130515-wms0001.htm#13051535000018">The lunch
was followed by a plenary in which three keynote speakers addressed the
topic of how to optimise the benefits of research investment for
European jobs, growth and society. Breakout groups then discussed
aspects of this broad theme. The UK took part in the workshop looking
at ensuring the global competitiveness of European industry, including
through the development and deployment of KETS (key enabling
technologies). The discussion was wide-ranging. The UK relayed the
results of research undertaken in the UK which showed that a key driver
for industry to take part in EU programmes was the development of
pan-European networks. A major disincentive included the bureaucracy
associated with the programmes. Other topics discussed included the
importance of providing industry with a workforce with the right
skills.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="5"><?date 2013-05-15?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_15_PT_1/5D78F832D4C8DE159CD4CD5819A4779FCCE15EC4" __version__="1.1"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="15 May 2013">Wednesday
