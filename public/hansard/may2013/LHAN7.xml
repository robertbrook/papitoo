funding will be ring-fenced and must be spent on improving the

efforts across Government which will ensure that all children enjoy

King of Bow:</Member></B> Is the Minister aware that the Prime Minister
has lamented the fact that elite sport is dominated by those with a
private education? This happens because private schools have hockey
masters, rugby masters, cricket masters, and so on, who can spot and
develop talent. Is he further aware that state schools can do that only
if they create the infrastructure by pooling resources essentially to
do the same thing? Incidentally, that is what the school sports
partnerships do. Will the Minister come to Tower Hamlets Youth Sport
Foundation to see how the borough’s schools are pooling
resources so that everyone can continue to keep the Olympic legacy
alive and have the chance to do more sport in

the four free schools we already have opening in Tower Hamlets, several

about independent schools. The Headmasters’ and

incredibly important for disabled children and some very pleasing
figures have been released in Wales today in the aftermath of the Games
which show that participation among disabled people has risen. Has the
Minister given any possible consideration

disabled pupils is to celebrate the success of our Paralympians,
including that of the noble Baroness, who won 11 gold medals, four
silver and one bronze. It is central to our curriculum that all
children enjoy sport at school. We have provided £300,000 to
Sport England for disability sport to encourage wider participation in

would like to see all our children doing sport every day. The
Department of Health has funded the Change4Life sports clubs. We aim to
establish 13,500 clubs in schools by 2015. We also aim to have 6,000
partnerships between schools and local sports clubs by 2017 by

involve clubs at an early stage, as my noble friend suggested. Will the
Minister give me an assurance that in future, if any changes are 
<?notus-xml column=625?>made to the interaction between a club and a school, all those involved

being written off so far or given effective amnesty because papers have
been lost in some cases. I know the Minister will tell us that the

about the specific practical actions that are being taken to deal with
the problem? Does he recognise that the dramatic cut in the number of

Saatchi:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend for that reply.
The point of this Question is that there is no Answer it. Since I
tabled the Question, I have received an estimate from within the
medical profession that last year 15,000 people in Britain were killed
by cancer treatment rather than by cancer. We do not know whether 1% or
100% of patients die as result of the treatment; what we do know is
that cancer drugs do such damage to the immune system that the patient
is helpless to resist fatal infections such as MRSA,  E. coli
or septicaemia. Does my noble friend agree, as I think he has, that the
official statistics for the UK cannot distinguish between cancer death
and treatment for cancer death? Is this not because the ONS, under WHO
guidelines, records only the single underlying cause of death? In other
words, it does not record the sequence of causation, sometimes known as
the sequence of conditions, that led to the death. This is supposed to
be the era of big data. Will my noble friend review the limitations of
cancer mortality statistics in order to assist scientists and doctors
to have the information to move forward innovation towards a cure for
cancer?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305202000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305202000055"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="1305202000152" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305202000152">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I agree that it is important to have more
information on the effect of cancer treatments on mortality. New data
collections which will provide more detail in this area are under way.
The systemic anti-cancer therapy dataset will enable better information
to be collected about deaths after the delivery of chemotherapy, and
the cancer outcomes and services data set will provide information in
respect of death after surgical treatment. However, it is important to
make one point here: it can be hard to identify the precise cause or
sequence of progression of factors resulting in death, particularly for
those with end-stage cancer or who are particularly frail and are
experiencing physical deterioration. I do not think that it can ever be
a precise science.</hs_para>

Campbell-Savours:</Member></B> My Lords, what about the circumstances
where a person awaiting treatment in a congested cancer clinic is
surrounded by patients who are coughing and spluttering? There will be
consequential effects on immunity for those being treated. It may well
be the drop in immunity that kills the patient, not necessarily the
original cancer.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord makes a good point. When
recording the cause of death on a medical certificate of cause of
death, doctors are required to start with the immediate, direct cause
of death and then go back through the sequence of events or conditions
that led to death until they reach the one that started the fatal
sequence. This initiating condition will usually be selected as the
underlying cause of death according to the International Classification
of Diseases coding. However, that does not mean that someone with a
primary cause of death of cancer will not have pneumonia, or whatever
happens to be, recorded somewhere on the death
certificate.</hs_para>

consultation will begin shortly on the Government’s plans to
reform the governance relating to death certification. The proposed
reforms will simplify and strengthen the process for death
certification by appointing local medical examiners to provide
independent medical scrutiny of the cause of death for all deaths not
subject to coronial investigation. The medical examiner will improve
the accuracy of information recorded on medical certificates of cause
of death because the process will include a review of medical records
and consideration of the circumstances leading to
death.</hs_para>

agree that it is important to draw together as much information as we
can about causes of death from across the country. However, I am
advised that the question of whether a cancer-related death can be
attributed to the underlying disease or to the treatment cannot be
answered comprehensively from information collected as part of the
death certification process or the cancer registration process or,
indeed, a combination of both. However, as I hope my previous answer

the completed medical certificate of cause of death is given to the

completed the certificate fully, so it could then be open to the family

Bill aims to transform the support available for offenders given short
prison sentences by introducing a 12-month period of rehabilitation in
the community after release. The first part of this period will involve
release under licence, in the same way as with longer-sentenced
prisoners now. Indeed, the first clause of the Bill extends release on
licence to all offenders given custodial sentences apart from those of
a single day. However, for many offenders, this will not give long for
those providing services to intervene. That is why Clause 2 creates an
additional supervision period, solely for the purpose of
rehabilitation, which will “top up” the licence so that
every offender released from a sentence of less than two years has at
least 12 months of supervision after release.</hs_para>

supervision period, which are set out in Schedule 1, reflect its
explicit purpose of rehabilitation. They can include visits from the
offender’s supervisor, drug testing and appointments in relevant
cases, and participation in activities that the supervisor thinks will
support rehabilitation. Activities may cover a wide range of different
interventions. For example, they could include restorative justice
where appropriate and where both victim and offender consent. I remind
noble Lords of the Government’s strong commitment to increasing
the use of restorative justice. In particular, I take pride in the fact
that the Crime and Courts Act 2013 now puts pre-sentence restorative
justice on a statutory footing for the first time.</hs_para>

which an offender is alleged to have breached a requirement of
supervision. Clause 3 will give them a range of options for dealing
with a breach, including a fine, unpaid work, a curfew or, ultimately,
committal back to custody for up to 14 days. This will give magistrates
a much greater oversight of the delivery of sentences for this group of
offenders. We intend to engage with the Judicial College and the
Sentencing Council on the support and guidelines that this new role
might require. I look forward to hearing the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby,
on these matters, given his experience as a magistrate.</hs_para>

Transforming Rehabilitation reforms. Noble Lords will know that, on 9
May, the Government published their strategy for reforming the services
delivered to offenders in the community. We will create a new public
sector National Probation Service, working to protect the public and
building upon the expertise and professionalism which are already in
place. The National Probation Service will report to the Secretary of
State as part of the National Offender Management Service. This will
give the probation service a stronger role within NOMS and the Ministry
of Justice. The National Probation Service will play a fundamental role
in protecting the public from the most dangerous offenders in our
communities. Probation professionals in the National Probation Service
will continue to work to protect the public from those who pose the
greatest risk of harm and have committed the most serious
offences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305202000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305202000078">Alongside
this, we will open delivery of services for offenders in the community
to a diverse range of new rehabilitation providers, as envisaged in the
Offender Management Act 2007. We expect to see a wide variety of
voluntary and private sector providers, from local community groups to
regional and national organisations. In particular, we want to see a
system which values and utilises the local expert knowledge of the
voluntary and community sector. These providers will work alongside the
National Probation Service and will manage the vast majority of
offenders. We expect that most staff currently performing probation
roles will transfer to the new providers. We will put in place a new
system where the skills and expertise of probation professionals,
coupled with the innovation and versatility of voluntary and private
sector providers, support the rehabilitation of all
offenders.</hs_para>

will allow us to make savings which we will invest in rehabilitation.
It will also allow us to make better use of the money we already spend
on managing offenders. We will create incentives for providers to focus
relentlessly on reforming offenders, giving those delivering services
flexibility to do what works and freedom from bureaucracy, but only
paying them in full for real reductions in reoffending. Our payment
structure will ensure that providers have to work with all offenders,
including the most prolific and hardest to
reach.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305202000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305202000080">Finally,
we will also put in place an unprecedented nationwide
through-the-prison-gate resettlement service. This will mean that one
provider will give most offenders continuous support from custody to
the community. We will support this by ensuring that most offenders are
held in a prison designated to the area to which they will be released
for at least three months before release takes place. I hope that noble
Lords will be as enthusiastic about this last reform as we are. It has
long been recognised that closeness to home is an important factor in
an offender’s resettlement process—and something on which
the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has long campaigned. Our reforms will
draw on the best that organisations across all sectors have to offer,
allowing access to offenders at the start of their time in custody
through to release and beyond.</hs_para>

reforms, parts of this Bill will support individuals working with
offenders—whether they are staff of the National Probation
Service, voluntary and community sector workers and volunteers, or
those working for new rehabilitation providers—to use their
experience of working with offenders to provide innovative services.
Just as the new supervision period provides the maximum discretion, so
we have tried to match that for non-custodial sentences. For community
orders and suspended sentences, Clause 13 will create a new
rehabilitation activity requirement. This combines the existing
supervision and activity requirements and gives those supervising an
offender more discretion to tailor activities to their needs 
during the course of the order. Clauses 14 and 15 make similar reforms
to the programme and attendance centre requirements. These reforms
build on the efforts we have already made to strengthen community
orders, so that sentencers and the public can be confident that they
are a robust sentence which combines punishment with effective
rehabilitation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305202000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305202000082">I
am sure that today we will hear genuine concerns about the pace and
direction of our reforms, but I remind the House that a number of noble
Lords across all Benches have campaigned for many years for greater
support to be given those sentenced to less than a year in custody.
They have argued for better through-the-gate services and for more
effective and better respected community sentences. These are ambitions
which this Government share and this Bill gives a real opportunity for
them to become a reality. The hard fact is that without our wider
reforms we would not be able to afford to extend rehabilitative support
to offenders released from short sentences, but neither could we afford
the status quo, with offenders passing through the system again and
again, with more victims hurt and more communities damaged. It is the
need to tackle that cycle of reoffending, particularly for offenders 
<?notus-xml column=636?>released from the shortest prison sentences, which drives these reforms
and is the central purpose of this Bill. If we can cut deep into the
58% reoffending rate for those sentenced to less than 12 months, it
will change lives—not just for victims but for offenders, whom
it may well help to move away from a life of crime.</hs_para>

thanking the Minister for his very clear exposition of the Bill and the
proposals relating to it, which do not appear in legislative form, and
in welcoming efforts to reduce reoffending and its cost to the public
purse and the life chances of the offenders themselves, and above all
the damage to society at large and to the victims of crime in
particular. That said, changes should be evidence-based, practical and
cost-effective. A rehabilitation revolution is unlikely to be achieved
on the cheap or by an ideological obsession with the market.</hs_para>

successful probation system, which is effectively to be nationalised

Lordships will wish to examine the case for payment by results and the
degree to which all relevant agencies, including local government,
health services and the Department for Work and Pensions—to name

individual offender and of the society to which we all want to see them

with the proposals for offenders serving short-term sentences. The lack
of supervision and support for this group has clearly been a major
contributor to the high rates of reoffending. Welcome though a change
in this position is, it is as well to recall that  a
thought-through policy would address the issues that lead many of these
offenders into trouble in the first place. We are familiar with the
early symptoms  of a significant proportion of those who commit
crime: low literacy and numeracy skills, truancy, early parenthood,
mental health issues and, yes, poverty. However, in addition to
addressing those matters, which involve policies across a range of
government and local authority responsibilities and departments, we
need to look at the justice system itself. As both Nacro and DrugScope
point out in their responses to 
<?notus-xml column=637?>the consultation, greater use of community sentences would avoid
custodial sentences, especially short ones, in the first place while
still allowing the effective support envisaged under the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000006">Experience
of community sentences, however, demonstrates a potential problem with
the Bill’s proposals to provide a sanction of two weeks’
imprisonment for non-compliance with the sanction order. There is a
widespread view that in the existing regime there is an overreliance on
this expensive and ineffective approach. The Criminal Justice Alliance
suggests that recall to custody should be a last resort but sentence
review powers should be available to all magistrates’
courts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000007">The
Bill envisages supervision of all short-sentence offenders. Is this
really necessary? To pick an example at random, should it apply to
someone convicted of a road traffic offence, possibly combined with
perverting the course of justice? There is surely a case for
concentrating resources on those offences and offenders to which they
are most likely to be relevant; otherwise, in a payment by results
system, the low-hanging fruit will be too readily plucked by the
providers, to the cost of the
taxpayer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000008">In
relation to the split between who supervises low and medium-risk

These matters, along with payment by results and the radical changes to
probation, are not part of the Bill. Therefore, in addition to a binary
system of dealing with offenders, we have  a binary legislative
and policy process. This is an unsatisfactory, piecemeal approach, made
worse by a flimsy—and belated—impact
analysis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000009">The

House may wish to consider amendments to the Bill designed to address
some aspects at least of the radical changes to the probation service
which form part of the Government’s agenda but are not, 
as yet, encompassed by the proposed legislation. The need to do so is
highlighted by this issue of risk. The category of medium risk would
appear to include sex offenders and some of those guilty of violent
crime. There must be a concern that such offenders will or may be dealt
with, not by the established probation service on release, but by
providers in the new and untested payment by results scheme. Given the
recent revelations about the soaring number of cautions for what seem
to be potentially serious offences, there is likely to be legitimate
public anxiety about the issue, especially as offenders can and do move
up the risk scale.</hs_para>

payment by results raises huge doubts. The Lord Chancellor has form on
this; he is a high-risk offender as the progenitor of the staggeringly
unsuccessful Work Programme. Why did he cancel the two schemes in
Staffordshire and the West Midlands and Wales, and why has the Ministry
of Justice refused an FOI request to release details of the evaluation
of those pilot schemes? I repeat these questions, which I voiced in the
Queen’s Speech debate and to which I have received no reply.
Such a radical change should, at the very least, be properly piloted
and evaluated before being rolled out. The notion of G4S, Serco and the
like extending their growing takeover of the public services is not one
with much public appeal, even if occasionally dressed up with a modicum
of bid candy in the form of modest third sector involvement. Why will
public providers be excluded from working with the low and medium-risk
offenders? What will constitute a failed result—any offence, or
one of similar or more serious character? If the latter, how is gravity
to be measured and for how long is the period of non-offending to be
measured before payment is made? What discussions have Ministers held
with potential bidders about how the scheme might work? What proportion
of the payment will be related to success, however defined, and when
will it be
paid?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000012">There are
also problems with the centralising thrust of the Government’s
approach. Local justice is already being undermined by the continuing
process of amalgamating magistrates’ benches and court closures,
coupled with increasing reliance on full-time district judges.
Probation trusts, arguably too large already, will disappear as
commissioning will be carried out nationally. How will this help to
promote the necessary joint working so obviously required between the
justice system in its various manifestations and other relevant
agencies? We know that housing and employment are the key drivers in
preventing reoffending. Health issues, particularly in relation to
substance abuse and mental health problems, of course also loom large.
There is a clear need for local authorities, as deliverers of key
services and support, to be engaged alongside clinical commissioning
groups, the NHS Commissioning Board, police commissioners and the DWP
at local level, together with the courts. That will be extremely
difficult given the proposal to establish only 21 areas for the
contract packages. Moreover, with contract areas as large as this, the
opportunity to involve third sector organisations, to which the
Minister referred, which so often bring innovative approaches to
difficult areas of social policy such as those we are discussing, is
likely to be much more difficult. All the promises of involving such
bodies in the Work Programme disappeared as rapidly as the Prime
Minister’s resolution on the question of a European referendum.
What concrete measures will the Government take to ensure that the role
of the third sector, particularly small, local organisations, will be
secured in the commissioning process? Do the Government recognise the

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:30:08"></hs_TimeCode> recently
attended a presentation about veterans’ courts, now established
in every US state. They do not replace the ordinary courts, but in
cases not involving serious or violent crime, for which probation would
not be an option, and after conviction or a guilty plea in the ordinary
court, veterans are offered referral to a veterans’ court,
presided over by a judge—it might the same judge as in the court
of first hearing—where with a veteran mentor they enter a period
of supervision and help to overcome the problems that they both face
and perhaps pose. They return to the court monthly and if they fail to
co-operate, or reoffend, they are returned to the court of first
instance. There is a remarkably high rate of success in reducing
reoffending and it is cost-effective—so much so that in Buffalo,
New York, I understand, out of 300 cases the success rate in avoiding
reoffending was 100%. Given the particular problems of a group of men
and women who have served their country, often in dangerous and
difficult conditions, and the relatively high incidence of mental
health problems and offending with which they become involved after
their service, it would be a fitting complement to the military

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, in welcoming this
Bill, I know the House is all too conscious of the degree to which the
history of our penal policy during the past few decades has been one of
failure. The failure has been a failure of our criminal justice system
and our penal system to turn an acceptable proportion of convicted
offenders away from lives of
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000019">When
offenders are apprehended and convicted, that process, and the contact
with the system that it entails, should afford society an opportunity
not only to punish but to work out what has gone wrong with
offenders’ lives and provide help and support to try to put
things right. Every offender for whom the prison gate has unnecessarily
become a revolving door has blighted his own life, damaged his
victims’ lives, often irreparably, and at least disrupted, but
often wrecked, the lives of his family. Society has been infected with
the harmful effects of crime and the fear of crime, and we have all
borne the extra financial costs: victims, the criminal justice system,
social services, the penal system, insurers and those who pay the
premiums.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000020">As
the Minister pointed out, reoffending rates are appallingly high,
disproportionately so for those released from sentences of less than 12
months, for whom the figure is more than 58%: not far short of half
overall. The very fact that never before have we provided support for
prisoners released from these shorter sentences is a disgrace. It is
very important that this is now being addressed by Clause 2 of this
Bill.</hs_para>

commitment to through-the-gate services for prisoners on release is
very welcome generally. However, it is crucial that, as is proposed,
the link with those who will provide support services for an offender
on his release is firmly established well before release. The goal must
be a planned release. There should be arrangements in place, so far as
can be achieved, for a released prisoner to have a place to go to, an
occupation, whether in employment, education or continued training, and
people to return to. With respect to employment, it is heartening to
note that a number of companies, including Network Rail and National
Grid, are training prisoners within prisons and employing them on
release<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:35:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000022">Those
providing services preparatory to release should, so far as possible,
be the ones providing the support following release. The mentoring
system in Peterborough, mentioned by my noble friend, has been a

after<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:35:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000023">To
enable all this to happen, it is vital that the Government implement
their intention, mentioned  by my noble friend, to ensure that

the increased focus on drug treatment provided for by Clauses 10 and
11. The new arrangements will enable supervisors to help offenders to
tackle drug dependency. Drug appointments and drug-testing requirements

but it goes without saying that the rehabilitation of drug-dependent
prisoners would be massively improved by a successful drive to stamp
out the scourge of drug use in our

Government propose a far-reaching reorganisation of the probation
services, to be implemented under the umbrella of the National
Probation Service. This reorganisation has the worthwhile aims of
increasing the diversity and range of providers, of involving the many
organisations within the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors in
contracted services, which are already doing significant and
ground-breaking work in this area, and of giving service providers
greater autonomy. However, it is important that we bring the probation
service with us in this reorganisation, and it is imperative that the
expertise and the good will of our probation officers are retained
within the newly reorganised
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:37:47"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
important that we do not underestimate the difficulties that we face in
achieving these aims in the context of larger probation trusts and

new proposed structures will inevitably be much more diffuse than the
probation service hitherto with which we and the probation services are
familiar. My noble friend the Minister has been considering whether and
how the professionalism and expertise of probation officers might be
marked and recognised within the context of the new arrangements. I
believe that we should consider how we might achieve this. Something
like a new chartered institute of probation officers might serve the
purpose well, enabling professional qualifications to be fully
recognised and enabling the profession to remain united and subject to
a respected code, with employers having the benefit of a guarantee of
professionalism and quality that would mark out members of such an
institution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:39:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000027">The
proposed arrangements for payment by results have been controversial,
as the noble Lord, Lord Beecham, pointed out. If they work and prove
practical to implement on a national scale, they might at best provide
incentives and rewards for success by cutting reoffending and enabling
more informed choices to be made between services that are proved to be
effective and those that are not. However, there is always a risk that
such arrangements might be seen only as a way of saving resources at a
time when that is, rightly, a national imperative, even where the use
of extra resources might be justified.</hs_para>

cost to the United Kingdom economy of reoffending is estimated by the
National Audit Office at between £9.5 billion and £13
billion. In a speech this morning, my right honourable friend the
Deputy Prime Minister put the figure at £10 billion. These are
staggering figures. While that expenditure cannot be eliminated, of
course, I believe that a more enlightened and determined approach to
rehabilitation can take people out of lives of crime and help them to
lead useful and productive lives in their place.</hs_para>

the general point that I made in the debate on the gracious Speech:
that the changes to be brought about by the Bill and the
Government’s proposals must be properly resourced and that the
potential savings are so substantial as to justify, where necessary, a
departure from the traditional approach of Treasury accounting to
spending proposals, where the outcomes are savings that are of their
nature, and almost by definition, unquantifiable. If they are properly
resourced and if there is good will and determination on all
sides—within the service, within government and, I might say, in
co-operation with local authorities as well—I believe that the
changes in the Bill, in the context of the programme of rehabilitation
involved in the greater use of community sentences on which we have
embarked, might now start turn to turn around the failure of the past
few
decades.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_20_PT_1/986A1CB51D9896FC82D4EF152E2471E435813718" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 May 2013">Monday,

Howe of Idlicote:</Member></B> My Lords, we should all be grateful for
two aspects of the Bill before us: first, that it has come directly to
your Lordships’ House, with the experience and strong expertise
of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in charge of it—albeit with
many material government facts and figures by which to judge it still
remaining to be disclosed—and, secondly, that in the Secretary
of State for Justice’s strategy for reform he has accepted that
short sentences serve little, if any, useful purpose, and cost the
taxpayer huge sums. As he said on 9 May, and we have heard again from
the noble Lord, almost half of all offenders released from our prisons
offend again with a year, and the 58% of those with the most prolific
reoffending rates are those sentenced to prison for less than
12 months.</hs_para>

that <hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:42:53"></hs_TimeCode>change is
essential and that to continue with the status quo is not the right way
to go, as what existed before was valueless for both taxpayers and
victims of crime alike. The Criminal Justice Alliance, among others,
welcomes this focus on short-term prisoners, who currently get no
support on release yet have very high reoffending rates. The concept of
resettlement, which was mentioned, is an attractive idea, with
appointed mentors to help offenders to get back constructively into
their community and find employment or training and, at least as
important, somewhere to live. If it is begun a few months before the
offender is released, it is even more likely to succeed.</hs_para>

said, many questions remain to be answered, the Government’s
plans for dealing with low-level crime make sense, especially the one
calling for rehabilitation to be provided to all 50,000 of
the most prolific reoffenders—those who are sentenced to less
than 12 months in prison. However, the biggest question mark remains
over just how this is to be financed.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305206000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000033">Importantly, too, the
Secretary of State has also acknowledged, as has the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, that although serious offenders must be imprisoned, many come
from chaotic backgrounds, have complex problems and addictions and have
lived much of their life within the care system, and more must be done
to help them get their lives back on track—not, as now, just
releasing them from prison on to the streets with 
<?notus-xml column=643?>that famous £46 in their pockets. I hope that the Minister will
share more of his plans, including the likely financial cost for this
group of offenders, when he responds to the debate. Will the Government
consider commissioning research to see how many generations back
similar offending patterns have existed in the families of this group
of offenders?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305206000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000034">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:45:51"></hs_TimeCode>
are obviously many essential questions about the Bill that I hope will
be answered by the Minister in his reply or during later stages.
However, for me and many others, the most important question of all is
the glaring omission of any specific policies for dealing with women
offenders. That is despite the Government’s acknowledgement in
their <I>Transforming Rehabilitation</I> strategy of the widespread
support among those consulted that services specifically tailored to
women offenders’ needs should be delivered by those chosen as
the commissioned providers. The highly worrying assertion that opening
up the probation service to market forces will strengthen services for
women released from prison, as the Prison Reform Trust says, lacks an
explanation of how this will be achieved via an untested payment by
results scheme. It will probably mean, as the Magistrates’
Association also points out, that only large corporations can take the
financial risk involved, not the small voluntary organisations which
have experience in this area of work already. As I said in my comments
on the humble Address, this continues the destruction of the probation
service which the noble Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, began under the
previous Government with his suggested probation reforms, and continues
to ignore the damage this approach would be doing to our highly
trained, really invaluable probation service and the vital service it
provides for the community, the courts and individual
offenders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000035" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000035">While
on the subject of women offenders and their special needs, do we have
any accurate figures of how many members of a woman’s immediate
family are affected if she is given a prison sentence? We all know that
the vast majority of those looking after these children are
women—mothers rather than fathers—and that therefore a
highly likely result of a prison sentence for a female offender is for
her children to be taken into care, resulting in considerable extra
public cost as well as inevitable long-term emotional damage for the
children concerned. How much better to ensure, as the Prison Reform
Trust points out, that the majority of low-level offences—and
most offences committed by women are just that—are dealt with by
cost-effective, robust community sentence penalties made available to
courts in all areas of England and
Wales.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000036">Noble
Lords will have heard some details of this again from the introduction
of the noble Lord, Lord McNally. Can the Minister tell us what action

unnecessary break-up of families?</hs_para>

the generally welcome news for women offenders—indeed, for us
all—of the creation of a women’s ministerial advisory
board, led by Justice Minister Helen Grant. Returning to the issue of
offending patterns continuing over generations within the same family,
can the Minister also consider 
<?notus-xml column=644?>commissioning research here to see if the breakup of families by a
mother’s unnecessary imprisonment leads to a repeat pattern of
offending over generations? I put this idea forward because such
evidence would help to make the already strong money-saving case even
stronger for a full implementation of Frank Field and Graham
Allen’s early-intervention strategy.</hs_para>

commissioning of services to support those requirements, inevitably
bringing in private companies—as they are now called,

gracious Speech. Again, I declare my interest as a trustee of the
charity Kainos Community.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1305206000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000048">When I looked in more
detail at the outline of the release on licence and the supervision
requirements for offenders serving less than two years, I could not
help but think, “Why have we not done this before? It seems so
obvious”. The Bill will increase public confidence in our
sentencing regime because short, sharp shock sentences will no longer
seem derisory and will no longer be easy, cheap headlines for
newspapers. In fact, as is outlined in the very helpful Explanatory
Notes to the Bill, a six-month sentence will comprise three months in
custody, three months on licence and nine months of supervision. This
is a total of 15 months during which, either by virtue of the original
sentence or for the period of supervision, the offender will be under
the purview of the courts. This is the best blend of getting tough on
crime while also increasing the focus on the rehabilitation of the
offender.</hs_para>

years since I did many breach of community orders in the Crown Court,
it was very rare for the person to be sent back to prison. This led to
many offenders not taking seriously the requirements of their community
penalty. In fact, I always remember seeing the usher call on a case,
only to have to go and wake up the defendant, who was having 40 winks
in the waiting area, such was the gravity he placed on the breach of
his order. Although ultimately it is a matter for judicial discretion,
I hope that the sentence of up to 14 days in prison is utilised.
However, does the Bill mean that that short period of imprisonment for
breach of a supervision order will trigger, in and of itself, a
supervision order? I would be grateful if the Minister could clarify
that point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000050">I
am also very pleased to see clarity in the Bill, rather than in a
statutory instrument, about which functions connected with bringing
court proceedings for review of a community order, a suspended sentence
or the drug rehabilitation requirements are exercisable only by a
public sector provider. With the expansion of the involvement of the
private and voluntary sector providers, such clarity of functions is
essential.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000051">The
most pertinent parts of the consultation, and now of the Bill, are
competition in the delivery of rehabilitation services, ensuring that
the new system is responsive to local needs and paying providers for
their services according to results. The highly imaginative concept of
payment by results is, as I understand it, already part of the
provision of rehabilitation within the prison estate. I would be
grateful to know from the Minister what the practical experience is of
calculating the results that have been achieved. What will be the
position, once the Act is in force, if someone under a supervision
requirement provided by one charity goes back into prison and on to a
project, such as St Giles in Peterborough, then goes back under a
supervision order provided by a different charity and is then reformed?
How is it determined whose result this is—or is it a score draw,
with everyone getting paid by the state for the
outcome?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000052">Furthermore,
how will the new structure of the probation system ensure that it is
responsive to those of local needs? The Ministry of Justice, along with
the Department for Work and Pensions, issues huge contracts. Will
Serco, Atos and G4S be the providers, with SMEs and local charities
unable to get involved? How these principles will work in practice will
depend on this, and some indication from the Minister would be most
welcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000053">Tucked

the Bill that this “competing provision” delivers a
service that is effective in qualitative terms. With the design of the
new probation structure, it will be important that this is done with
certainty from the outset, as I can say as a trustee of a voluntary
organisation that the many reforms and changes to NOMS and 
<?notus-xml column=647?>ROMs were very destabilising. The new service needs to be robust in

we often speak of the low levels of literacy, mental health problems
and drug issues of many prisoners, and of course that is true. However,
when I have gone into Her Majesty’s Prison Stocken in Rutland to
see Kainos work, I have always been struck by how talented a lot of
prisoners are. Of course, there are some whom you would not wish to
bump into in a dark alley. However, when I hear in conversation of
their complicated family backgrounds and of how many people, usually
men, came and went in their childhoods, I cannot keep track. It is like
a family tree where part of it is stuck on temporarily with Velcro and
then torn away. When playing dominoes on one occasion, a prisoner
insisted that he was really good with numbers. My response was,
“Yeah, yeah”, partly because I thought he was blagging
and partly as I have to concentrate very hard on the dominoes because
beating prisoners at pub games is very difficult. However, I had to eat
my words when I discovered that he had got eight years for a first
offence. It turned out that he was the banker for a multimillion pound
drug racket. I then told him about the Prince’s Trust and
starting his own
business.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000055">Although
our role is to review and scrutinise legislation, I wonder whether
practically your Lordships’ House could help with
rehabilitation. In the Robing Room the largest painting is entitled
“Hospitality”, which is something that the House does so
well. Some noble Lords may be aware of a charity called The Clink,
which runs restaurants in certain prisons where prisoners are trained
to work in the hospitality industry. It is most successful, and it
would be an excellent role model if the House employed a graduate from
The Clink. Noble Lords may think that ex-offenders might fail our
stringent security test. My contention is that while the House has
ex-offenders on its Benches, ex-offenders should serve at its tables. I
hope that the Bill succeeds and that short sentences will become part
of reducing crime rather than having their current adverse effect of
just equipping prisoners for further
criminality.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_20_PT_1/E75B25ACDFFBF796687C5AA077FE113DC65FC850" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 May 2013">Monday,

Armstrong of Hill Top:</Member></B><B> </B>I, too, welcome the intent
of this Bill, but I am afraid that the devil may well be in the detail;
that is what we will discover in the days and weeks to come. It would
be rather disingenuous of me not to welcome much of the intent, because
such things were being worked on in the previous Government. Indeed, I
tremble to confess, particularly to my own Front Bench, that I was
probably the first person to discuss payment by results with the
Treasury. I was doing so in relation to children in care and the
relationship between central and local government. We discussed how one
would look at outcomes when the young person was, say, 22 or 23. If
they were in work and in a stable home, should the local authority not
be rewarded for that? On the other hand, if they were in the criminal
justice system, should it not be paying some of the costs of that to
the state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:05:48"></hs_TimeCode>? Even
then, I was interested in a more innovative means of 
<?notus-xml column=648?>ensuring that the most vulnerable in our society were looked after,
because I had to accept that very often in our society the value we
place on a service depends on
money.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:06:11"></hs_TimeCode> That was
what I was concerned about, and the Treasury went on to do a lot more

are one or two things, however, that Ministers have either not been
concerned about or not taken seriously enough. First, if you are going
to enter into this area of activity, you have to have a very good
database and evidence base. Much of what I wanted to do when I was
Minister for Social Exclusion could not be done because our initial
baseline data were insufficient, even on domestic violence. We
therefore set in train a whole series of measures to collect better
data so that we could then see how to measured movement, change and so
on. I am concerned that the Secretary of State does not seem to believe
in evidence base. He says, “Anybody needs to go and look at
Peterborough and see that the social investment bond there
works” and so on. Actually, however, those of us who have been
trying to develop models of social investment bonds in order to invest
in payment-by-results programmes know that there are many things that
you must right and must know about before you can enter. I suggest that
that is why the real excitement created around Peterborough has not
manifested itself in lots of other social investment bonds and lots of
other

which the Government need to take account, and I say this in my role as
chair of the Cyrenians, which is based in Newcastle. I am beginning to
think that there is a sort of a north-east conspiracy here; I hope that
does not say anything about offending in the north-east, but rather
about what good programmes there are in the region to tackle it.
Indeed, the right reverend Prelate used to be on the board of the
Cyrenians and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, also has a role as a
mentor and supporter of my chief executive, so we all have a little
insight into
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:08:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

by both the Ministry of Justice and the DCLG to develop social
investment bonds. We have a real problem in the areas for which they
want us to do that simply because we do not have the numbers going
through. That is particularly true for people sleeping rough because we
do a very hard job making sure there are not dozens of people on the
streets of the north-east sleeping rough. I do not want it to be
otherwise, but that means we cannot then develop the model which gives
us the levels of investment in order to do a PBR programme.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:04:31"></hs_TimeCode>However, that is
also true of other programmes. One of the programmes that I think is
extremely successful, and is absolutely relevant to the Bill, is what
the women themselves call the WoW project—the Women Outside
Walls project. That is an example of what the Ministry of Justice would
call a Corston project established with support from the MoJ to keep
women out of prison. Evaluation of the first two cohorts of women who
took part in the project shows a 45% drop in reoffending rates. I think
that we all welcome that figure and I know that the Ministry of Justice
welcomes it. Small numbers were involved; the two cohorts amounted to
some 53 people, but the project was absolutely the right
thing to keep them out of prison. Some 90% of the women with whom we
were working had experienced 
<?notus-xml column=649?>abuse, rape or domestic violence. Our support did not comprise
merely seeing them once a week to sort out their
needle exchange or address whatever was the practical immediate issue.
We offered very important support of a different nature given the
background of those women. More than 80% of them had a range
of health needs, which included a high prevalence of mental
health issues. Therefore, we had to access not only mainstream health
provision for them but get them involved in group and other situations
which addressed the issues that had led to their
offending<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:12:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000061">The
Minister knows I am a bit concerned that Northumbria probation’s
redesigned programme is a box-ticking exercise. We will not engage with
it on that basis as we know that it will not have the same results as
the work we have undertaken. We are looking to see whether we can
supplement through other means what the probation service is able to
offer given the cutbacks it has undergone. If we can do that and we can
secure other funding, we will continue with the project. The Minister
needs to understand that that is the reality on the

is a case of numbers and length of time. We have a very successful
programme for getting people into work. We have got people back into
work who had been written off. Delegations from the DWP have come to
see how we have done that. The main lesson we try to instil is that you
cannot do this in three months. That is why we have not been able to
take part in the Work Programme and why we continually have to look for
other independent funding, so projects are done on a piecemeal basis
year by year. If you want effective interventions which prevent
reoffending, you cannot do that on a short-term basis. That means you
have to put sufficient investment into the small charities. We are
quite a large charity employing more than  250 people in a
range of work but we cannot do anything on a sustained, long-term basis
without investment in our projects. There is no evidence at all that
the Government will match their ambition with that reality. The

that everybody else will talk about probation but I want to make one
point in that regard. When I was a Member of Parliament, I had a very
good relationship with the probation service. Whenever a difficult
offender was about to be released into the constituency, the probation
service would talk to me. I would work out the relationship of the
schools with the service because it did not know the details in the
small villages and so on. On one occasion, when an ex-probation officer
who had been involved in child pornography was coming out of prison, we
worked with the school and we had a public meeting. That was very
successful. We worked with the parents on ensuring that they helped
their children to understand what was going on in a way that did not
damage them. The fragmentation will make that very difficult, but,

Prime Minister Nick Clegg on victims, the rehabilitation of offenders,

of the advantages of being deputy to my noble friend Lord McNally is
that I can knock on his door to talk about party business. Inevitably,
most of the time we end up talking about criminal justice matters. I am
well aware that he has recognised that the current system of
rehabilitation is just not working. This is just not good enough for
offenders, victims of crime, or the community, which has invested so
much in our criminal justice

welcome in particular the proposal to introduce post-release
supervision for short-term prisoners. These prisoners constitute the
majority of those we send to prison each year, and they have higher
reconviction rates than any other group of prisoners. Although their
crimes, taken individually, are not the most serious, many short-term
prisoners are prolific offenders who are responsible for much of the
high-volume offending that makes life a misery for so many people
living in high-crime areas. It is indefensible that for so many years
we have been prepared to imprison so many more people than other
European countries, only to put them back on the streets with no
supervision and little if any

is, however, a need for caution when we talk about rehabilitation
strategy. Providing post-release supervision for short-term prisoners
creates the risk that it could also lead to the courts imprisoning more
people. I will explain. At present in borderline cases, courts might
decide not to imprison offenders because supervision in the form of a
community sentence is more likely to divert them away from
offending.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000068">Under
the new arrangements, the courts might feel that by imprisoning the
offender, they can get the best of both worlds: both the punitive
impact of imprisonment and supervision of the offender when he or she
is released. This is where we need to be absolutely clear: this would
be a very short-sighted view, as even a short period of custody can
lead to an offender losing accommodation, losing a job and fracturing
family links, all of which make it more likely that he or she will
reoffend. To guard against this risk, perhaps I may ask my noble friend
Lord McNally to examine whether it is possible to provide by law that
no one should be sentenced to custody, except for very serious
offences, if they have not previously been subject to an intensive
community
sentence.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000069">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:18:53"></hs_TimeCode>
greatly welcome the reorganisation of the prison system that will
accompany these legislative changes. This will involve most prisoners
spending at least the last three months of their sentences in a
resettlement prison near their home area, making it easier to build up
links with the local agencies responsible for providing support and
supervision before and after release, and I do not think we should
underestimate the role that

Voluntary does not mean amateur. Many voluntary organisations have
highly professional expertise in the key resettlement areas of
accommodation, education, employment, drug and alcohol treatment,
mentoring, family support and community engagement. All these factors
can make a huge difference to an offender’s chances of avoiding
reoffending. Some voluntary sector organisations have expressed fears
that they could be squeezed out if contracts are given only to large
private sector companies. It is important to make sure that any
organisation given a contract to provide supervision and rehabilitation
services works in partnership with voluntary organisations in
arrangements that give the voluntary sector full cost recovery. This is
vital if we are to make full use of the voluntary sector’s
expertise in the resettlement of offenders.

the multiple and interdependent social outcomes of crime and
reoffending: homelessness, unemployment, ill health and all the other
factors that are responsible for crime and criminality in this country

the Minister will be able to deliver a clear assurance that suitable

will help to reduce the risk that uncertainty about the future will
lead to probation officers leaving for other areas of work so that
their expertise is lost to the field of offender supervision.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:23:41"></hs_TimeCode> also hope that
the contracts with providers will be of sufficient length to ensure the
stability of service provision. As long as providers are providing a
good quality service, it is important that the provision of services is
not subject to constant uncertainty and instability because
organisations have to compete too frequently to keep on providing the
service.</hs_para>

is important to make sure that everyone supervising offenders has the
right kind of training and expertise in a number of key areas. These
include knowledge of the criminal justice system and the operation of
offending behaviour programmes, the protective factors that can prevent
reoffending, the interpersonal skills necessary to supervise offenders
effectively, and ways of monitoring the warning signs that can indicate
that an offender’s risk is rising. Low and medium-risk offenders
may not be the most serious offenders, but they are often difficult,
intractable and prolific. Their risk can rapidly rise if they return to
alcohol or drug abuse, start associating with old criminal associates,
become homeless or unemployed or lose motivation to change their way of
life. Most serious offenders have a previous history of minor
offending. Those supervising them must have the skills and knowledge to
recognise when that risk is increasing and to take appropriate
action.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000075">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:29:31"></hs_TimeCode>

people have served their sentences and have turned their lives around,
it is important that society recognises this and ensures that there are
no unnecessary obstacles in their way. That is why I welcome the

I am keen to see the Government go much further so that genuinely
reformed individuals are able to wipe the slate clean when it comes to
finding employment. For example, the filtering proposals are limited to
one conviction only. This fails to recognise how two identical cases
may end up in court: one as one conviction only and the other as
multiple charges. One sentencing event would seem to be a more sensible
threshold. The one-conviction limit also ignores the reality of petty
offending, particularly when committed by young people, whose offending
is dealt with by way of a small number of minor convictions. The case
of Bob Ashford, former prospective PCC candidate, is a perfect example
of this discrepancy. Nevertheless, along with the forthcoming changes
to the Rehabilitation  of Offenders Act 1974, which I hope the
Government 
<?notus-xml column=653?>will shortly announce will be into force by the end of the year, the

speeches generated by the action that the Government are proposing in
the Bill. Those speeches raise the hope that we may, at last, be able
to do something about reoffending, which has unfortunately been low on

Minister and his department to pay heed to the words of caution that
have also been expressed. Those of my seniority—in age, at any
rate—know that other attempts that have been made in the past
have bitten the dust because what started as very optimistic progress
turned to something very different when it was found that these
proposals would not succeed without resources. They did not succeed
because they did not have the financial backing necessary for change on
the scale that is now proposed by this Bill. They also did not succeed
because the groundwork that is necessary to introduce reforms on this
scale had not been undertaken.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:34:29"></hs_TimeCode> am afraid it
is obvious that, because they are understandably in a hurry, the
preparations that the Government have made for the introduction of this
scale of change are very modest indeed. I urge the Ministry of Justice
to proceed with caution, even though its objectives are excellent and
the possible rewards are
considerable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000081">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:34:36"></hs_TimeCode>
has been pointed out that the numbers involved in the
exercise—of those sentenced to short periods of
imprisonment—are very large indeed. We are talking about more
than 50,000 people, who will be coming before courts up and down the
land. The Bill will create problems, as has already been indicated, as
there will be a temptation in some courts to undermine the objective of
the Bill by seeing the proposals for dealing with reoffending as
justifying short sentences. I am one of the many who have previously
urged courts not to impose short sentences because they are destructive
of the process, as they are extraordinarily difficult for the Prison
Service to manage. The consequence 
<?notus-xml column=654?>of short sentences is the reoffending rate of which we are aware. What
can be achieved by a short sentence in prison can always be better
achieved, in my experience, by a community sentence. Of course, there
comes a stage when courts have to use short sentences. Magistrates up
and down the country will tell you that they need short sentences when
there is no alternative. However, short sentences should be limited to
those cases where there really is no alternative and where the length
of the sentence is as short as
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000082">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:34:29"></hs_TimeCode>
wonder, and ask the department to consider carefully, whether the
blanket approach, of taking a category of short sentences and applying
the process proposed in the Bill to everyone caught within that
blanket, is the right process. Is there to be no judicial involvement
in determining whether the case is one that really needs the expense of
the rehabilitation process involved? There are offenders, who have to
go to prison, for whom the one sentence of imprisonment is likely to
lead to the end of any further problem so far as they are concerned. We
tend, in the Bill, to focus on the cases that fail; but however bad the
statistics are, we have to realise that there is the other
percentage—if it is 58%, 42% do not come back before the courts.
Who will judge whether this case is one that needs to be the subject of
the action that is
taken?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000083">The most
recent attempt to do something similar to these government proposals

the fact that those who need special rehabilitative assistance should
be provided with it promptly. This is an administrative
problem. Unfortunately, the successful community court experiment in
Liverpool has not been repeated to the extent that it should have been
up and down the country. The reason is again a lack of resources. I am
afraid that resources will be at the heart of this reform and I hope
that the Minister’s department will think carefully about the

Healy of Primrose Hill:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish I could
wholeheartedly welcome this Bill as the way forward to reduce
reoffending, encourage people to live purposeful lives and save
taxpayers’ money, but I fear that in the end too little will be
achieved. Instead, despite the best intentions of some in the
Government, the Bill may set people up to fail, lead to
longer sentences 
<?notus-xml column=655?>and put more people in prison. Of course, there is a pressing need to
change the system whereby prisoners who have served a sentence of 12
months or less are released with £46 and typically receive no
support on the outside. I welcome the Government’s
acknowledgment that this cannot continue.</hs_para>

short terms often lead particularly chaotic lifestyles and have higher
levels of need in relation to homelessness, joblessness and drug and
alcohol abuse; 58% of people who have served a prison sentence of 12
months or less reoffend within  a year of leaving custody. I am
disappointed that the opportunity finally to implement the Corston
report, authored by my noble friend six years ago, which called for the
end of imprisoning women who pose no risk to the public and the closure
of women’s prisons and their replacement by small custodial
units for serious and dangerous offenders, has not been taken up.
Instead the Government intend to commission all rehabilitation services
under a single contract, regardless of the different offender
cohorts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000088">Rather
than wait for the promised review of women in prison expected this
summer, the Government are rushing ahead before the specific needs of
women have been considered. The Howard League rightly warns that the
proposed payment-by-results system poses a particular threat to the
continued provision of services for women. Many are small, local,
holistic and gender-specific, and some could now face closure as they
are not large enough to bid for contracts. However, the circumstances
surrounding women in prison, as set out in my noble friend Lady
Corston’s report, reveal that incarceration is not the best way
to help these already vulnerable women. Most women prisoners are
mothers; some are pregnant on entering prison; they are often drug
users with £200 a day crack and heroin habits; many are
alcoholics; and many are in poor physical and mental health. Common
experiences include sexual, emotional and physical abuse leading to
chaotic lifestyles and, often, to self-harming.</hs_para>

lower involvement in serious violence, criminal damage and professional

among women in prison than in the male prison population. Self-harm in
prison is a huge problem and more prevalent in the women’s
estate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000090">Women
represent just less than 5% of the overall prison population, and 20%
of sentenced women entering prison serve sentences of less than 12
months. Not only do women suffer grievously by being imprisoned, but so
do their families. It is estimated that more than 17,000 children are
separated from their mothers each year by imprisonment. Only half the
women who had lived with or were in contact with their children prior
to imprisonment had received a visit since going to prison. Maintaining
contact with children is made more difficult by the distance from their
home area that many prisoners are held. Taking children away from their
mothers and into care only creates the next generation of vulnerable
youngsters, many of whom

difficult to believe that efficiency savings will pay for it, as the
Government claim. It would be better significantly to reduce the use of
short-term prison sentences and invest in intensive community sentences
as an alternative. A prison place costs on average £40,000 a
year, whereas community sentences can be a tenth of that
cost.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1305206000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000093">There is

served in the community, followed by an additional supervision period.
Magistrates may “up-tariff” and sentence offenders to
prison, when a community sentence would have been more appropriate, in
order for them to qualify for the 12-month statutory rehabilitation, as
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, and the noble Lord, Lord
Dholakia, warned earlier. However, breaches while on licence could

the question of how we should be more effectively managing offenders in
our society; an issue which is rather like the holy grail, so seductive
yet elusive. We now have a new Minister at the MoJ, who is bringing to
bear his own perspective and his own solutions to the challenges of the
criminal justice world coming, as he does, from the world of business.
We have seen, in particular, the initiation of payment by results,
where financial incentives are being introduced as a means of
encouraging service providers to step up their efforts to change
offending behaviour through financial
reward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:45:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Starting
in Peterborough, which I have indeed visited, and Doncaster prisons,
they have been regarded as pilots to this new approach, which is still
in its relatively early days. Now, fired by the idea but ahead of
fully-tested results, we are seeing the proposed extension to the
management of a particular group of low-level, persistent offenders.
This has significant implications for the probation service, the range
of voluntary agencies in the field of offender management, the private
sector—which has been growing like Topsy in the past few
years—and, of course, the offenders

with the current context; the numbers of people being sentenced to
prison is dropping and last year there was a 5% decrease on the year
before. Recorded levels of crime are at their lowest for 30 years, and
youth crime is down 47% since 2001, thanks to the YJB. Surprisingly,
the prison population itself fell in the last 12 months for the first
time since 1999. However, the group that gives the greatest cause for
concern consists of those relatively minor offenders, who are serving a
year or less of whom at least 57% will reoffend—the figure goes
up, the younger the offender. This is more than 50,000 people annually,
as we have heard, so it is a huge problem which costs us all billions
and which the Government are now attempting to
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:47:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000098">The
focus of this Bill is on the 50,000 to 60,000 persistent, low level
offenders who are serving anything from a few weeks to a year in prison
and who currently have no automatic statutory follow-up support in the
community and usually precious little during their time in prison. This
is the most intractable group in the system and the Government’s
aim to provide for them with a year’s statutory supervision and
help, targeted to their needs, is potentially very important and
welcome. This is, typically, a very vulnerable and 
<?notus-xml column=658?>challenging group with a range of coexisting difficulties, including
drug and alcohol addictions, learning difficulties, mental health
problems and generally chaotic lives. Again, this has been alluded to.
Most have had no education past the age of 14, are unemployed, homeless
and all are in need of help to turn their lives around if they are not
to end up in prison again and again as they currently do. The benefit
of individual support is not only the guidance it can give and the
connections made but, ideally, the experience of a positive, personal
relationship which is precious. The Government are to be congratulated
on recognising and addressing this. This has the potential for changing
lives if it is properly done. However, as anyone in the business, as I
have been for years, knows, desistance cannot be
imposed—prisoners must want to
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000099">The

have unintended costs. The experience with custody plus in 2003,
already mentioned by my noble and learned friend and hero Lord Woolf,
demonstrated that and was then scrapped as a result—it was a
parallel scheme and was simply going to be too expensive. The very
nature of this group’s needs means that the likelihood of breach

Currently, continuity of YOT supervision past 18 is routinely
maintained to ensure continuity. The YJB and many others working with

the transfer, whenever it occurs, should be managed by public sector

element of concern is that young offenders who turn 18 before release
will be treated for the purposes of their supervision as adults, with
the same expectations and demands. This is contrary to accepted
practice by the YJB that young people should not be managed as adults.
Transition to adulthood does not have a neat cut-off point, and each
young person’s development and maturity must always be the
governing issue. The T2A pilots in three areas are examples of support
tailored to these young people, both as part  of community
sentences and after release.

conditions for short-sentence prisoners? How many offenders were
assessed as likely to breach? Were any facts, and therefore costs,

Government consider in estimating that there might be additional police
costs of only £5 million a year? What is the Government’s
estimate of the cost of providing a rehabilitative service to offenders
released from custodial sentences of less than 12 months and how much
of that are they looking to recover through competition? Surely, the
Government know the cost per individual of drug testing and treatment
and, based on existing figures, how many offenders are likely to
qualify for the testing and treatment that this legislation purports to
guarantee? Why then has the cost not been quantified on that basis so
that the affordability of the measure can be assessed? Finally, does
“not applicable” in the box showing the full economic

are all the assessments that the document contains. There is no mention
of the cost of extending rehabilitative services to short-sentence

unaffordable—or evidence to explain how it may be balanced by
competing services. There is no mention of any assessment of the
ability of the private sector, which failed so spectacularly to provide
security staff for the Olympic Games, and to provide trained and
accredited staff who can be relied upon to provide the regular contact
needed with offenders, whose chaotic and dysfunctional lifestyles are

IT costs. There is no mention of how reoffending will be measured. In
this connection, I wish that the Government would drop the use of
“reoffending” when talking about measurement because, as
the Home Office statisticians told me on my first day as Chief
Inspector of Prisons, when I asked what it meant, it simply cannot be
measured because nobody knows. We all know that reconviction rates can

something that is unanimously welcomed, only to have to admit that it
cannot be delivered because it cannot be afforded. I am always
suspicious of the word “new” when all that is meant is a
redistribution of existing responsibilities. In connection with this,
there are many questions about how the governance of the probation
service will be exercised, many of which have been asked already.
However, I am currently concerned that probation trusts are in the lead
of an array of essential local partnerships that I will not list. Under
the Government’s proposals, it appears that these trusts are to
be abolished. How are these partnership responsibilities to be

accept that there are good things in the Bill, I am concerned about the
timetable. The Government justify that by alleging that, by legislating
early, they can give potential providers clarity over the service that
will be required, allowing them to prepare their bids and form
partnerships. However, while the Bill may be clear to those who have
drafted it, there is a considerable lack of clarity about the
achievability of what it is designed to enable. I ask the Minister to
seriously consider delaying the Committee stage of the
Bill—which I note is to be on 5 June, three days after the House
resumes—because it leaves precious little time, either for noble
Lords to prepare amendments or for the Government to provide answers to
the questions that have been asked this afternoon, including those that

Bates:</Member></B> My Lords, in following the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, who must be foremost among all prison reformers of the
present generation and who knows more about this subject than anyone, I
fear that my only contribution for my friends on the Front Bench in
speaking in support of the Bill might be to allow them a gentle eight
minutes in which to receive messages from the Box to respond to the
noble Lord. None the less, I hope that that might be a useful
function<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:13:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000124" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000124">I
firmly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on one thing: the
value of our probation services. Sometimes it is very easy to cast
aside their contribution to the criminal justice system. Yet the whole
tenor of and reason for the Bill is an argument based simply on the
fact that the reconviction rate beyond 12 months is substantially less
than that under 12 months. The answer, of course, is the intervention
of the probation services in cases where people have served a longer
period, and their absence in the cases of those with short sentences.
That is worth drawing attention to. It points to a fact, in Annexe C of
the report that we are considering, <I>Transforming
Rehabilitation</I><I>: </I><I>A Strategy for Reform</I>, that for those
who have served a sentence of more than 12 months, the reconviction
rate—or reoffending rate, in the report’s terms—is
35%, due in large part to the intervention of the probation service.
For sentences under 12 months it is 58.2%. These are therefore
significant sums, and at the outset it is worth paying tribute to the
work of the probation services in bringing about that
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:14:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000125">There
are many reasons why this Bill is necessary and should be welcomed. I
would argue that chief among them are the crimes that are committed by
those who reoffend upon leaving prison after a short sentence. Again,
they are highlighted in Annexe C. In the year to September, there were
208,699 offences,
including,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="1305206000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000165">“35,000

a reduction in that rate is undoubtedly the greatest prize on

to that is undoubtedly the financial cost. The numbers have already
been mentioned: the £10 billion cost of those crimes,
the £3 billion spent on the prison system, and the £1
billion spent on community services. These sums are significant, and in
a sense it is sad  that we need an economic downturn, with
economic constraints and fiscal reorganisation, to focus on this
massive proportion of government spend and the need to reduce
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:16:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the 17,318 who reoffended during that period of one year. The
question of why they did that needs to be addressed. Of course, as
regards the answers, this area is not short of analysis. All the causes
have been mentioned and are known to us. We know of the very high
proportion of people who are subject to alcohol and drug addiction, and
there are welcome things in the measures in this Bill that seem to
address that for those who are released on licence. People also leave
prison and have no home to go to, or were homeless before they came to
prison. Housing is a critical element, so the joining up of the health
services and local authorities with the criminal justice system, which
this Bill provides for, seems very
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:17:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000129">I
conclude my remarks simply by referring to an area that is absent:
education. I know that there are good reasons for that, but they ought
to be addressed none the less, because there might be further
legislation coming down the tracks later in the year that seeks to
respond to the consultation paper that is currently before us:
<I>Trans</I><I>forming Youth Custody: Putting Education at the Heart of
D</I><I>etention</I>. We know the lack of education—of literacy,
numeracy and IT skills—is the critical common denominator of
those who find themselves in prison. It is also critical because
however well meaning we are when we say that people need employment, if
they do not have literacy, numeracy and IT skills it will be incredibly
difficult to provide that. How we can miss that crucial element when we
have a captive audience for education in our establishments and young
offender institutions is beyond me. We have a requirement only for a
statutory 15 hours of education, but the Centre for Social Justice, in
its report, found that not even that is being provided. In most young
offender institutions, the average is 11 hours. It should be 40 hours
or more to make sure that people have the
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1305206000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#1305206000130">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>

Hexham—to add to what the noble Baroness, Lady Armstrong,

to—wrote an excellent publication, which I commend to noble
Lords, called <I>Doing Time</I><I>: </I><I>Prisons in the 21st

progressive suggestions in education. One was the provision for what
would in effect be academy prisons: boarding schools that would be
secure detention areas but whose prime purpose would be not containment
but education. That is an example of the type of thing that we should
see. He quoted Victor Hugo, who

the purpose of this is to join up provision across different

the damage. It seems that the academies programme was in operation in

include unemployment, mental health, family problems and the generally

them of acting as a role model and reaching out. The connection for
them is life enhancing. However, it is not something that can be done

hesitate to use the word, because I do not want to be pejorative about

education can be resisted if it is not promoted in the right way.

effectively, raise. Supervision will be needed for offenders acting as

some prisoners positively do not want to return to their old

released near home. It should be a matter of choice for prisoners; they
should have some input. After all, if you are not consulted, you feel
downgraded. I am concerned about the transition here and in the

incentivise the services, but the risk will be carried by providers.

a reoffender must often feel to the person concerned like condemning
oneself to a life of crime, and that the second occasion must be
significant. As my noble friend Lady Linklater said, the younger the
age of the offender, the more reoffending rates increase. Work at and

is common ground between all political parties that reoffending rates

serve sentences of less than a year. It is also common ground that if
reoffending can be reduced, this will reduce the number of victims and
the overall cost to the criminal justice system. It is worth recording
that the probation service is not responsible for those leaving prison
who have served sentences of less than a year, so it would be wrong to
blame it for the current high reoffending rates, as the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, said. The figures we have heard this afternoon are
stark. The most prolific group among those committing some 600,000
crimes are the 60,000 or so people who receive sentences of a year or
less, as we have heard from a number of speakers today. Some 60% of
this group are reoffenders and many go on to reoffend multiple
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:33:54"></hs_TimeCode>. Certainly
in my experience as a magistrate, the vast majority of people I have
sent to prison have offended multiple times while serving community
sentences. It is comparatively unusual to send somebody to prison who
has never offended while serving a community
sentence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:34:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000020">The
Government’s stated objective is to drive down reoffending. They
will use the Offender Management Act 2007 to privatise large elements
of the probation service. That measure and this Bill will provide
private supervision in the community for the majority of offenders. The
Government’s objectives can be divided into two parts. The first
is the privatisation itself with payment by results, about which we
have heard, which 
<?notus-xml column=669?>comes across as little short of an article of faith on the part of the
party opposite. The second part is the administrative mechanism by
which this is to be achieved. Under the Bill, there is to be a welcome
expansion of support for offenders who leave prison having been
sentenced to a year or less in
custody.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000021">On
the first objective, the Government intend through this privatisation
to make sufficient savings to fund the expansion of support for those
leaving prison. On the Secretary of State’s figures, some 45,000
offenders will gain support financed through these savings. The
Government cite the example of Peterborough Prison, where additional
support has been provided to leavers financed by social impact bonds. I
have read the independent assessment of the project and agree that
there is good reason to be encouraged by it, although the project it is
in its early days. Surely, the central point is the additional money
provided for the project. That is the main reason why it is successful.
As we heard from my noble friend, the Secretary of State himself is a
repeat offender when it comes to the Work Programme, and he is
unsurprisingly very cagey about the commercial arrangements likely to
be entered into with the service providers. Surely it is appropriate
for the House to know the scope of the payment-by-results contracts,
their likely structure or even the Government’s definition of
payment by results in this context. I know very well from my own
experience that drawing up large complex contracts where both parties
are breaking new ground is an unnerving experience. There is every
reason to believe that things could go wrong, so it is reasonable for
the House to be given reassurance on the structure of the contracts to
be entered
into<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:36:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000022">It
is, of course, regrettable that the pilot schemes initiated by the
previous Secretary of State were abandoned by the current incumbent. I
also believe that commissioning should be managed to maintain a
diversity of providers. This point has been made and I know that it is
addressed in the strategy document issued by the Government last week.
I make the simple point that the greater the number of contract
packages, the greater the scope for smaller service
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:37:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000023">I
return to the Bill and the Government’s second objective, as I
have characterised it. This raises a whole raft of practical questions
about the competences and qualifications of those who will support the
offenders in the community, their payment and responsibilities in the
event of breach. Indeed, as we have heard, 25% of offenders move
between different case offender levels. What happens if, for example,
an offender starts drinking? Would that be reported to the court? It is
of central importance that the courts have faith in the probation
service providers to bring to court in a timely manner offenders who
have breached their conditions. I am not sure that any member of the
public will distinguish between people being supervised in the
community who have served a short prison sentence and those
being supervised in the community who are on community sentences. There
is a risk that the project could be undermined if there is
inadequate supervision of those who are released from prison
sentences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000024">It
is worth reflecting that the Government are proposing to transfer many
thousands of probation staff to different employers. A number of noble
Lords have 
<?notus-xml column=670?>mentioned the invaluable work done by the probation service. It has to
be said that under the new arrangements members of the probation
profession will get a narrower range of experience as there will be a
binary system, as referred to by my noble friend Lord Beecham. The
noble Lord, Lord Marks, referred to the possibility of a probation
officer charter. I do not know whether he proposes to take the idea
forward in the Bill but it is an interesting one. The right reverend
Prelate the Bishop of Newcastle spoke about the dissipation of
expertise through the new arrangement. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia,
wants an assurance from the Minister about the future prospects of the
probation service. I was interested to hear him ask for that. However,
I think it would be very difficult for the Minister to give that
assurance given that those staff will be employed by the private
sector<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:39:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000025">It
is also worth saying that co-operation on the ground between the
various providers is key to the success of this venture. Nothing must
be done which undermines this. A number of noble Lords have said that
this is really centred around the local authorities working with a
number of providers. It is the day-to-day management of these different
providers of housing, YOT, social services and so forth, which is key
to making any community sentence successful. I also note that the noble
Lord has made positive comments about restorative justice, and it is
said that he will be giving new comments about that in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000026">A
number of organisations have contacted me about the centralisation of
the commissioning process. First, I welcome that the police and crime
commissioners will be part of the selection process of new providers.
However, I want to mention one organisation in particular, and that is
London Councils. It is particularly concerned that this would not be an
appropriate arrangement for it. In London the PCC is the Mayor, there
are 33 local authorities, and there is an existing structure which
could be used for the commissioning process. The Government often state
their commitment to local services, local decision making, and local
accountability. This is a question which I intend to explore at a later
stage of this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000027">I want
to say, in brief, a word about the perspective of the courts on this.
They are of course the sentencing body. Clearly, the recently
introduced LASPO arrangements, whereby prisoners on sentences of less
than one year are unconditionally released at the halfway point in
their sentence, are to be reversed. Now there will be requirements on
release. The standard requirement, as we have heard, will be a
rehabilitation activity requirement, and the courts will have new
breach powers. I make a number of comments on this. First, when the
sentencer announces the sentence in court, it should be very clear what
actually is to be said, because it is not always clear to magistrates
and judges what one should actually say about the length of the period
in custody, the period on licence and the period on supervision. I know
from the comments of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, that his ministry
will be working with the Judicial College and working out suitable
arrangements for
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0001.htm#13052038000028">We had a
number of very interesting comments in this Second Reading debate, and
I want to address a few of them. First, the noble Lord, Lord Bates,
quite 
<?notus-xml column=671?>rightly talked about the huge importance of education. The noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, set out how important it is. I used to be a
trustee of the Wandsworth prison visitors’ centre and we
provided to all the prison visitors education facilities at some
cost—computers and the like. I have to say, very depressingly,
that they ere almost completely unused by the visitors to Wandsworth
prison. While I whole heartedly agree with the objectives, I note that

number of noble Lords spoke about other matters which could be
introduced to this Bill. We heard from the noble Baronesses, Lady Howe
and Lady Healy, about women offenders not being specifically discussed.

about a court for veterans, which I hope he will take
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:43:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000030">I
want to raise a point that was mentioned by a number of Peers. That is
the possibility of an increase in the overall custody levels because
magistrates or sentencers would be using a custodial sentence for
people who breach these sentences. In my experience, magistrates use
custodial sentences as an absolute last resort. This is not a new
problem. It is a very real dilemma when one has a repeat breacher of a
community order, for example, for perhaps a relatively minor matter,
but they just do not comply with the provisions of the community order.
I believe that magistrates should, as a very last resort, have the
possibility of enforcing custody, otherwise there will be even less
incentive for certain people to comply with their community
order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T17:44:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000031">Finally,
I want to pursue the point raised by the noble Baroness, Lady
Linklater, about the transition from youth to adult, and the work from
the YOTs to the probation service. This was not addressed by any other
Peer. It is a very important and practical point, and as the noble
Baroness very rightly said, the YOTs—the ones I have worked
with—have a more nurturing role, if you like, in trying to help
young people. When they move to the probation service, it is quite
often an unpleasant surprise for them. I hope we may explore that more
fully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000032">In
conclusion, we have the introduction of a payment system which is
untested anywhere in the criminal justice world, the abandonment of the
pilot schemes, and the removal of the 35 probation trusts and their
replacement with a centralised commissioning service. We will judge
this Bill in the wider context of the Government's rehabilitation
strategy. We agree with many of the specific provisions of this Bill
itself. Reducing reoffending while maintaining public safety must be
any Government's objective, but ill-thought-out policies based on an
unproven ideologically driven funding policy risks the very services

its place in the youth sector, but it also has an important role to

£500,000 grant to support VCS organisations to overcome the
barriers to participating in the rehabilitation reforms and, as has
been said, this morning my right honourable friend the Deputy Prime
Minister announced further funding. I should also like to follow up
with my noble friend Lord Marks the idea of a chartered institute of
probation officers or some such body. That is something that sits well
with the idea of a National Probation Service.  I have said
many times from this Dispatch Box that I have great admiration for the
probation service and  at no time have I suggested that it is
the fault of  the service that we have a 56% rate of
reoffending,  or indeed any other percentage. The service
does  an excellent job. What we are doing here is not a

Lords, Lord Beecham, my noble friend Lord Dholakia and the noble

small charities. Our reforms will open up the probation service to a
far wider range of potential providers. We want to encourage
partnerships between voluntary or charitable organisations and between
VCs and the private sector. In reply to the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Newcastle about faith group involvement in rehabilitation, I
recently went to Liverpool as a guest of the right reverend Prelate the
Bishop of Liverpool and saw some of the projects being run there. The

offenders. I want to put on record my appreciation of all the faith
groups, which already have a network and a committed flock who readily
make themselves available for rehabilitation work. That is something we
want to work with and build on. In St Albans and Norwich, which I have
visited in the past couple of years, the cathedrals are being used as

for going on too long, I will just deal with the question of payment by
results. Our payment mechanisms will ensure that providers have to work
successfully with all offenders, including the most prolific and
hardest to help, if they are to be paid in full. There will be a fixed
fee for service, ensuring that they deliver the sentence requirements,
and licence conditions for every offender. The remainder of their
payment will be dependent on the reductions they make in reoffending.
To be paid in full, providers will need to achieve an agreed reduction
in both the number of offenders who go on to reoffend and the total
number of offences committed by those in their cohort. So they cannot
just focus on the easy wins; they will have to work with the most
prolific offenders and keep working with those offenders who have
already reoffended. We will be developing the details of our payment
mechanism in discussions with providers and practitioners. I am sure
that will be developed in

does not surprise me, given the speakers list today and the range of
experience and expertise on view, that a lot of questions have been
asked. I hope we can delve deeper into this in Committee. I do not
accept that this is not worth pursuing. Most people have welcomed the
objectives and, as I have told the House before, we must accept that,
in these straitened times, the department cannot call on other
resources to fund ambitious programmes. However, we are spending just
less than £1 billion on the wide range of rehabilitation
services. We have heard about holistic approaches and making sure that
we have buy-in from other departments and from local government; these
are all important to 
<?notus-xml column=676?>its success and I passionately believe it is worth trying. I understand
the dangers but, in the end, you can spot so many dangers that you are
paralysed. I do not believe that is the right approach. We should press
ahead with this, let this House use its expertise to examine it in
detail and see if we can put in place a piece of legislation that will
give the framework to bring in ideas, flexibility, innovation and value
for money in an area where there is a great deal of common agreement
about objectives, as today’s debate has shown. As we take this

Syrian regime’s military offensive against opposition-held areas
around Damascus, Homs, Idlib, Hama and Aleppo is intensifying, with
complete disregard for civilian life. The death toll has doubled in the
first five months of this year, and now stands at an estimated 80,000
people. There have been well verified reports of massacres around
Damascus by regime security forces, and communities killed in cold
blood in villages around Baniyas. Online footage has shown bodies
heaped in the streets, and children butchered in their homes. Ten
thousand people are believed to have fled the area in panic created by
these brutal killings. And last week there were unconfirmed reports of
further attacks using chemical weapons.</hs_para>

are internally displaced and a total of 6.8 million are in desperate
need, including 3 million children. It is horrifying to
imagine what life must be like for these children, witnessing violence
and death on a daily basis, and enduring trauma, malnutrition and
disease. This suffering has devastating consequences. It is undoubtedly
contributing to radicalisation in Syria. Syrian people are facing a
regime that is using warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery,
tanks, cluster munitions and even ballistic missiles against them,
often without them having the means to defend themselves and their
communities. The conflict is therefore creating opportunities for
extremist groups. Syria is now the number one destination for jihadists
anywhere in the world today, including approximately 70 to 100
individuals connected with the United Kingdom.</hs_para>

regional peace and security, with over 50 people killed in a bombing in
Turkey last week, the kidnapping of UN peacekeepers in the Golan
Heights, cross-border shelling and clashes on 
<?notus-xml column=677?>the Lebanese-Syrian border. Half a million Syrians have become refugees
in the last 10 weeks alone, bringing the total number of refugees to
1.5 million, 75% of whom are women and children. The UN assesses that,
by the end of this year, on these trends, more than 3.5 million, or
15%, of Syria’s total population will have become refugees. And
the Foreign Minister of Jordan has warned that Syrian refugees are
likely to make up 40% of his country’s population by the middle
of next year, with similar numbers predicted for Lebanon.</hs_para>

current trajectory of extremism and murder. We have not sent arms to
any side during the conflicts of the Arab spring. No decision has been

France are both strongly of the view that changes to the embargo are
not separate from the diplomatic track, but essential to it. We must
make it clear that if the regime does not negotiate seriously at the
Geneva conference, no option is off the table. There remains a serious
risk that the Assad regime will not negotiate seriously. This is the
lesson of the last two years, in which the regime has shown that it is
prepared to countenance any level of loss of life in Syria for as long
as it hopes it can win militarily. We also have to persuade the
opposition to come to the table; recognising how difficult it is for

Britain plays its part, in partnership with the international

Statement had carefully chosen words on this subject. However, I

Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Iran. Also participating are foreign religious

al-Qaeda-aligned fighters. So will the noble Baroness answer these
questions? If the Government’s priority is peace, how does
contemplating arming the rebels address the central question faced by

is not between sending military support to Syria’s opposition
and doing nothing. Assad is sustained by external support from Russia
and Iran and the foreign funds that allow him to pay his forces. Will
the Minister explain why this Statement

I turn to questions about international efforts at establishing a
settlement in Syria, in particular an international peace conference. I
agree with the Minister that we should seize the opportunity afforded
by the proposed US-Russia conference to try to end the fighting and
prevent the Lebanisation of Syria. We will continue to argue for
exactly this type of direct engagement with the Russians, as we have
done for some time. As a country which has experienced minority rule
for 40 years, a comprehensive peace settlement for Syria must be
inclusive. So all parts of the country’s diverse society should
be involved in this peace conference—whether Alawite, Sunni,
Kurd, Shia, Druze or Christian—because it would be wrong to
underestimate the fear, particularly in the Alawite community, but
elsewhere as well, that a change from minority rule to democracy
provokes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052038000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000080">We
have learnt from recent history that when a country with such a range
of religious and ethnic identities emerges from a bloody war,
communities can be slow to trust each other again. In this regard, will
the Minister tell us what lessons she draws from the experience of
Syria’s neighbour Iraq, where the disbanding of the
Ba’ath Party and its associated structures contributed to the
challenges that that country faced in the immediate post-war period?
Will the Minister also explain the Government’s assessment of
the scale of post-conflict planning by partners in the international
community currently under way and what role our Government play in
facilitating that? Will the Minister also assure the House that in the
Government’s conversations with the Syrian national council and

strange that the Syrian Government should use chemical weapons in a
piecemeal way. Therefore, attribution is crucial in assessing who is

commitments made for post conflict reconstruction are met?
Finally, on the international conference, President Assad has already
said he will attend. Is it assumed that the opposition will also
attend? We understand that Iran has largely subcontracted the air
operations there to the Revolutionary Guards. Will Iran be invited to
the conference? We know the strong opposition of France to that. What

people return. It is not entirely clear who these people are fighting

different views on how we handle the situation but, like us, the

of the negotiations, including the Friends of Syria discussions which
took place earlier this year. Radicalisation, extremism and the
commitment of the Syrian national coalition were a big part of those
discussions. The countries which form the Friends of Syria stand by
those requirements not to support and foster extremism and
radicalisation. There is a huge discussion going on at the moment about
what inspires radicalisation and extremism. From a domestic
perspective, the ideological basis for radicalisation can take two
completely different forms. On the one hand, western intervention in
Muslim countries can be seen as encouraging extremists to go out and
fight, but there is also growing radicalisation and extremism on the
back of what is seen as western inaction while many Muslims are being
slaughtered in Syria. There is an argument being put which is more akin
to Bosnia rather than to Iraq, and it is important that we bear in mind
what different drivers of radicalisation and what drives people to
extremism.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Brooke of Sutton Mandeville" PimsId="2315" UID="13052038000221" xid="1726" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000221">Lord

we continue to assess it. The longer this goes on, the larger the
humanitarian need. Without being able to give specifics about what that
humanitarian need will be, we should be even more encouraged to bring
this matter to a political settlement so that refugees and displaced
people can return to their
homes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Soley" PimsId="4897" UID="13052038000223" xid="1906" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000223">Lord

answer about the religious aspect? I agree with her about Bosnia; the
failure to intervene radicalised and organised people. What I struggle
with, and I am certain the Government do too, is the religious divide
and how it is moving. The Sunni-Shia divide is getting wider and was
never as it is now. Driven, as it must be to some extent, by divisions
between Iran and Saudi Arabia, I wonder what thought has been given to
the Sunni-Shia divide. If that becomes, as it may well do, a much wider
issue playing out on the streets of Baghdad and elsewhere, we have got
a much wider and more complex problem. The Minister has painted a
picture which is already complex, but underlying it is a religious
divide issue which is feeding some of the

of the solution. Assad has slaughtered many of his own people and the
consequent break-down of trust between those communities does not allow
for Assad to play his part. However, if the Syrian people and the

presented with a situation that undermines these seemingly simple
assumptions. Many sufferers of diffuse mesothelioma, caused by exposure
to asbestos, are unable to find an employer or insurer against whom to
make a claim. These people were negligently exposed to asbestos and
subsequently developed a fatal disease, yet they must go uncompensated
for their immeasurable loss because sufficient records do not exist to
trace the responsible insurer or employer. The need to address this is
apparent and urgent.</hs_para>

public interest in asbestos-related diseases is long-standing. In 1965,
the <I>Sunday Times</I> brought this issue to the spotlight and
reported on research showing the fatality of exposure to asbestos
fibres. Since then, this spotlight has rightly not gone away.
Asbestos-related diseases have featured in the press and on television
repeatedly, with dedicated programmes produced in 1967, 1971, 1975 and
1982. In 1979, the then Government legislated to make payments to those
with certain dust-related diseases who had been exposed to asbestos at
work but who could not find an employer or insurer to sue, although
lump-sum payments under that were lower than civil damages. In 1999,
the insurance industry created a code of practice for better tracing of
employers’ liability insurance policies. Although success rates
for inquiries on difficult-to-trace policies increased, more needed to
be done. In 2008, the previous Government introduced a scheme to make
lump-sum payments to all people with diffuse mesothelioma regardless of
whether they were exposed to asbestos at work. I pay tribute to the
work of the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:54:16"></hs_TimeCode> of

the noble Lord
issued<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T18:54:27"></hs_TimeCode> the
consultation that has led us to where we are now. Without his efforts,

sufferers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000118">The
focus of this Bill is diffuse mesothelioma, a fatal disease caused
almost exclusively by exposure to asbestos. Diffuse mesothelioma has a
long latency period, often of 40 to 50 years. Once diagnosed, the
average life expectancy of a sufferer is short: between nine and 13
months. The long delay between exposure and developing the disease,
combined with inconsistent record-keeping in the insurance industry,
means that individuals often struggle to trace an employer or insurer
against whom to make a claim for civil damages. The insurance industry
and this Government recognise that this is unjust and that provision
must be made for these
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000119">Despite
the recognition of this market failure, the insurance industry alone
has not been able to put  this right. Disputes between insurers
and the different interests of companies that still offer
employers’ liability cover, which I shall refer to as
“active” insurers, and those that no longer do
so—I shall refer to them as “run-off”
insurers—have prevented the industry agreeing on a voluntary
levy. Industry representatives have therefore asked for legislation to
impose a levy to support a payment scheme.</hs_para>

cost. Timing is key; the number of diffuse mesothelioma cases is

foremost a means to create a scheme to provide for those people who

principle is that, where adequate records are not available, those who
have developed this disease as a result of their employer’s

at this point worth reflecting on the work that the Ministry of

specific pre-action protocol for mesothelioma cases, a portal and fixed
legal costs for such cases. None of these elements is beholden on our

turn to the question of payments. The scheme will make payments on a
tariff basis to eligible people with mesothelioma, or to an eligible
dependant if that person has died, where they cannot trace either an
employer who exposed them to asbestos or that employer’s insurer
and where they have not received civil damages or some other
compensation payment in respect of mesothelioma. The scheme is not
intended to be an alternative to civil damages, nor is it a
compensation scheme. The scheme will be set up by the Secretary of
State, who will make arrangements for another body to be the scheme

payment amount to be determined in regulations that will set out a
simple tariff, basing payments at roughly 70% of the amount of average
civil damages. Payment amounts in the tariff will be linked to an
individual’s age. Calculating the amount of civil damages that a
person is to receive is complex. However, published research shows that
awards in civil cases decrease with the age of the
victim<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:01:27"></hs_TimeCode>.
Regarding the amount of the payment, I ask your Lordships’
support in understanding that the scheme strikes a careful balance and
does so in a way that is fair and lawful. It ensures a substantial
payment to people who have mesothelioma and cannot trace the liable
employer or insurer, while ensuring that the contribution made by
insurers is fair and not excessive, since not all of them were in
business at the relevant time. It will ensure that the scheme can get
on with helping sufferers and not get bogged down in legal challenges
from
insurers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:02:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

criteria for eligibility. The first is that an individual was diagnosed
with diffuse mesothelioma on or after 25 July 2012. The second is that
they were employed at the time of exposure to asbestos and that this
was due to negligence or breach of statutory duty on the part of an
employer. The third is that they have not brought a claim for civil
damages against an employer or the employer’s insurer and they
are unable to do so. The fourth is that they have not already received
damages or other compensation payment in respect of their disease, nor
are they eligible to. I should point out that individuals who have
received a payment under existing state schemes will be eligible to
apply, but any such benefits and lump sum payments will be recovered
when a payment is made under the new
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:03:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Eligible
dependants of sufferers of diffuse mesothelioma may apply to the scheme
where the sufferer has died before making an application. Calculating
awards of compensation for dependants in civil cases can be complex,
but under the scheme it will be simple and quick. The scheme will pay
eligible dependants exactly the same amount as the sufferer would have
received. We will set out details of the application process in the
scheme rules. The scheme will give a right to an applicant to request a
review of decisions taken and confer a right of appeal to the

sufferer must have been diagnosed on or after 25 July 2012
to be eligible under the scheme. A cut-off date will always be
unfortunate for those whom it excludes. However, we must be pragmatic.
The costs to the active insurers funding the scheme would be
prohibitive if we were to make the scheme open-ended. It was on 25 July
2012 that the Government announced that they would set up a payment
scheme and so created a reasonable expectation that eligible people

not—and cannot—look to respond to all asbestos-related
disease. The issue of individuals who have developed other
asbestos-related diseases through negligence or breach of statutory
duty and are unable to bring a civil claim for damages of course needs
to be addressed. However, this Bill is not the appropriate instrument
to do that. Mesothelioma is distinctive, and its link to asbestos
exposure is undeniable. This allows for the fast processing of cases
because there is no doubt that asbestos exposure caused the disease.
The Bill supports the administration of a simple and streamlined
scheme. It could not cover other diseases, where there could ever be a
question as to the cause, because the lengthy investigations required
in order to prove these cases would choke the scheme, preventing the
comparatively simpler mesothelioma cases being administered with the
necessary speed. Again, I ask noble Lords to look at this emotive issue
from a pragmatic perspective and focus not on what is impossible but on
what can be achieved. This legislation is a huge step forward and

technical committee to handle disputes relating to cover is key. The
technical committee will be distinct from the scheme and will deal
solely with disputes related to insurance cover. If a question

maintained employers’ liability insurance with the insurer at a
particular time, the technical committee will be able to make a binding
decision on this issue. In practical terms, this means that if a person
with diffuse mesothelioma has some evidence that an insurer was
providing cover at the time they were negligently exposed but this
evidence is contested by the insurer, they can ask the technical
committee to make a decision. This will also benefit other mesothelioma
sufferers exposed to asbestos by the same employer at the same time,
who may wish to bring a claim against that employer in the future. The
technical committee will ensure consistency in decision-making and
allow more people to take a case to court, having had the issue of
cover already decided. Where the technical committee decides that an
insurer is not on cover in a particular case, and no other employer or
insurer has been traced, the person with diffuse mesothelioma may then

Bill envisages a review process for any decision taken by the technical
committee. Following a review, a person may refer a decision to
arbitration, after which very limited recourse to the courts is
possible under the arbitration legislation. Again, timing is key; undue
delays in the decision-making process would prevent an eligible
applicant taking further action while they are still alive, be it
seeking damages in the civil courts or applying for a scheme payment.

on insurers. The levy will be imposed on active employers’
liability insurers at large, not on the individual insurers who took
the premiums and who were on cover in the cases that will come to the

does not require the insurers to pass on increased costs to business.
The scheme could be jeopardised if the levy were set disproportionately
high, which might invite legal challenges from the insurance industry.
This would delay the introduction of the scheme, preventing a payment
mechanism being in place at the time of the peak of mesothelioma deaths

McKenzie of Luton:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for his
explanation of the Bill, for facilitating a briefing with officials and
the follow-up notes, and indeed for his kind words. The core of the
Bill, a lump-sum payment scheme funded by insurers for those diagnosed
with diffuse mesothelioma who cannot otherwise access redress from
their employer or an employer liability insurance policy, is one that
we strongly support. The Bill has its shortcomings and we will outline
our view on those in a moment, but they will come as no surprise to the
Minister. Without this sounding too much like a love-in, we should
acknowledge the Minister’s personal commitment to bringing
forward this legislation, which I can well understand has involved
difficult discussions with the insurance industry, which in times past
has resisted such
arrangements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:13:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000140">We
must also take this opportunity to pay tribute to those who have
campaigned tirelessly for those whose lives have been blighted and
shortened by exposure to asbestos and other occupational poisoning, not
least the trade unions and the Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum.
Doubtless the campaigns will go on, but their efforts have not been in
vain.</hs_para>

particularly pernicious disease of malignant cancerous cells in the
mesothelium, creating great suffering. It is caused by exposure to
asbestos, as we have heard, and is invariably fatal. Life expectancy
post-diagnosis is between nine and 13 months. As we have heard,
mesothelioma is a long-latency disease that might not be diagnosed

the Minister has explained, the passage of time between exposure and
diagnosis might mean that the negligent employer cannot be located or
might have gone out of business and, as important, that the
employer’s liability insurance policy that should have covered

is, then, entirely reasonable that the insurance industry, which has
had the benefit of the premiums over the years, collectively funds by
way of a levy a scheme that supports those who cannot make a civil

draft rules being available in Committee, together with some detailed
indicative figures of payment values and the construction of the
tariff, and indeed details of the technical committee.</hs_para>

of explanations given so far, we have some concerns and disappointment
with the Bill. The suggested levels of compensation at around 70% of
average damages awarded by the civil courts are too low and unfair; we
reject the “careful balance” proposition. Coverage is
inadequate; not all asbestos-related or other long-tail diseases are
covered. The cut-off date for the scheme at July 2012 is too
restrictive. And the prospect of the insurance industry running the
scheme gives rise to possible conflicts of
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:15:44"></hs_TimeCode>: on the
face of it, insurers have been able to negotiate a proposal that
excludes half of asbestos victims, liability for claims before July
2012 and a 30% discount on compensation levels. This must be
challenged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:16:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000145">We
should also like to see the insurance industry, through the scheme or
otherwise, continuing with an earlier commitment to fund ongoing
medical research into cancer. The ABI reminds us that in recent years
the insurance sector has contributed some £3 million to the
British Lung Foundation. Was the prospect of ongoing funding part of
the negotiation surrounding the arrangements in the Bill? We make
common cause with those who believe that the industry should commit to
a further round of funding research.</hs_para>

justify setting payment levels at some 70% of average damage levels
awarded by the civil courts. They argue that the level of the award
should be below the 100% level as a means of encouraging claimants to
seek to trace an employer or employer’s liability policy that
could lead to higher compensation. We challenge this analysis, and
certainly wish to examine in Committee the effect of using a tariff
based on average civil compensation. The process for a claimant to
establish exposure to asbestos and a relevant employment nexus and to
seek to trace an EL insurance policy would be necessary for entry into
the scheme, just as it would be for making a civil claim. Indeed, would
not both have to go through the same portal in

is surely indefensible to pay compensation at 30% less just because
someone cannot identify an employer’s liability policy—a
policy that existed but now, through no fault of the claimant,
is lost or destroyed. As the briefing from the Asbestos
Victims Support Groups Forum points out, reduced scheme payments are an
invitation to individual insurers to see the scheme as a cheaper
option. Why pay full individual compensation when you can pay 70%
of average compensation? We will seek to get some
improvement to the proposed compensation levels in

imperative of getting the scheme for those diagnosed with diffuse
mesothelioma in place as quickly as possible, and recognise that, in a
way, the fact that the awful consequences of a disease that is

makes for some administrative

there is no moral reason why the scheme should just be limited to
mesothelioma. For the future, the tracing office, ELTO, will improve
access to compensation, although it is by no means yet perfect, but it
will be a long while before it covers long-tail diseases. In Committee
we will examine why the scheme cannot be extended to all
asbestos-related and long-tail diseases, and at least see why the Bill
does not provide for an extension of the scheme in future in a way that
does not hold up the current proposals for sufferers of mesothelioma.
Can the Minister say—I think he did in his opening
remarks—whether the Bill currently precludes such an extension,
and if so why, particularly as the technical committee can be expanded
to cover diseases over than diffuse mesothelioma?</hs_para>

the start date of the scheme as 25 July 2012, for the reasons which the
Minister outlined, which is more than two years after the close of the
February 2010 consultation. During that period, another 600 people will
have died from this awful disease without them or their dependants
receiving proper compensation. We will argue for an earlier
commencement date but not an open-ended commitment. There are, of
course, other things going on in this area. The ABI makes clear that it
sees the pre-action protocol, fixed-cost arrangements, the central
mesothelioma claims gate or portal, and improvements to ELTO as an
intrinsic part of the overall arrangements.</hs_para>

only a part of this package is before us when considering the Bill, so
it is difficult to evaluate the overall effect. However, concerns have
been expressed about whether the pre-action protocol might make matters
more difficult for claimants by imposing a more onerous burden in
upfront disclosure rather than streamlining the claims process. Can the
Minister say how the emerging process will improve on the
current civil litigation fast-track process operated by Senior Master
Whitaker? Can he also say whether the Government see these other
components as an intrinsic part of an overall package and how the terms
of the support scheme might have been modified
because of
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000152">Concerns
in this area have been heightened generally by the Government’s
tightened attitude to compensation for workplace injury, displayed by
the denial of future claims of strict liability and breach of statutory
duty 
<?notus-xml column=695?>for health and safety failures. The Bill allows for the scheme to be
administered by the Secretary of State or for this to be undertaken by
another entity. Our briefing sets out that the insurance industry
itself is setting up a body to run the scheme, and this might have
timing benefits because it can be developed while the legislation is
proceeding through Parliament. This might be so, but we need to examine
possible conflicts of interest as the scheme administrator is supposed
to help claimants or their dependants to bring and conduct proceedings
against insurers.</hs_para>

the ABI expects the technical committee to be set up by ELTO, which has
itself been set up by the industry. The technical committee will
consider evidence of whether or not a particular insurer will provide
cover. Its decisions in this regard are binding on
insurers—active and in run-off—and claimants are subject
to review and arbitration. Can the Minister say whether it is agreed
that ELTO will set up the technical committee? We will want to test the
balance of power in all this where the ABI expects that the insurance
industry will administer the support scheme, has developed ELTO and
expects to run the technical committee, and is developing and expecting
to run the portal.</hs_para>

is a consequence of past negligent employer health and safety
practices. It is also important to recognise that the problem has not
gone away. We need to support the HSE and others in current awareness
campaigns. Despite some misgivings, this Bill is a welcome step
forward. It will get compensation to some 300 sufferers of mesothelioma
or their dependants each year who previously could rely only upon
support from the state. It will enable benefit recovery for the
Government of some £50 million net. We will work with the
Minister to seek to improve the scheme where we can but will do nothing
to frustrate its speedy passage on to the statute

Lords read the response to the consultation from the insurance

this Bill needs questioning and we need to develop our understanding

this Bill for a longer period. It may have a finite lifespan but that
may be 30 years or even more. The British Lung Foundation suggests 
<?notus-xml column=696?>30 years but it may well be that this Bill needs to be in place longer.
For that reason, it is important that Parliament maintains its
connection with the scheme. There will undoubtedly be inevitable
changes and tweaks over the coming decades as the scheme beds in and
the initial detail on the implementation will require careful scrutiny
to minimise the potential for future change and to maximise certainty
as far as possible. Therefore, it is a little strange to see that
Clause 1 makes no reference to Parliament when we know that there is
much detail still to be determined. I hope that my noble friend Lady

insurance industry had to be brought onboard with these proposals and
it was essential to attain its commitment to the funding levy. However,
with average claims coming in at £150,000 plus costs, it is a
bitter blow to those who may fall just outside the dateline for the new
scheme. I would be grateful if my noble friend the Minister could
inform your Lordships’ House of the balance of issues which led
to the choice of 25 July 2012 as the starting date for this new scheme.

second issue referred to is the 70% threshold. We need to understand
how this figure has been arrived at. Why is it not 75% or 80%? I
understand the need for a tariff-based system, but surely this would

the overall level of the tariff in the proposed scheme, expressed as a
percentage of civil claims, will always be set at a level where very
few claimants will get more than a civil claim. Would it not have been
better and fairer to raise the percentage value but to put a cap on the
amount which would have kept it at or below a civil-system payment? I
am told that the current average payment under the existing 
<?notus-xml column=697?>system is in the range of £150,000 plus costs. A 70%
tariff will mean that the average payment under the proposed scheme
will be £105,000 to £108,000. Surely that is far more of
a differential than what is required simply to avoid claimants taking
this new scheme course, rather than following the solvent-employer or

route?</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052038000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000162">There

the Bill, but the MoJ is about to make an announcement on its
proposals. However, the successful outcome of a claim under the current
system is virtually certain of having an award of costs with it.
Implicit in the new scheme is support from a solicitor. The very
helpful diagram from the ABI of how this will all work actually puts

Taylor of Bolton:</Member></B> My Lords, I think—I certainly
hope—that every speaker in the debate will welcome the
introduction of the Bill. I acknowledge and pay tribute to those who
have worked so hard to 
<?notus-xml column=698?>get us to this stage, including the Minister and, obviously, my noble
friend on the Front Bench, who has campaigned for so long, but also
those outside this House, the trade unions and campaign groups, who
have been unhappy with compensation arrangements for many
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:34:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I regret
the fact that industrial diseases and compensation for them are always
recognised only slowly, usually very late and often tragically late for
many of those who are involved. We should acknowledge that one of the
drawbacks in what we are trying to do is the insurance industry being
so much stronger than the other interested
parties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:34:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the previous Labour Government and what it did. I am proud of many
things that the previous Labour Government did, and we should shout
about them and apologise less. However, I am sorry that more progress
could not be made on this issue. I am pleased that my noble friend Lord
McKenzie was able to do so much of the groundwork for the Bill, and
glad that the Minister acknowledged that in his opening
remarks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:35:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

subject stems in part from my former constituency of Dewsbury. A number
of people worked in Leeds at Turner and Newall. I knew quite a few
people with family or friends who had been affected by asbestos-related
diseases; they had either suffered themselves or known people who had.
I also know what a difference compensation could make to the peace of
mind of those who were afflicted in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:36:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

coal-mining area. We therefore had quite a lot of contact with the
schemes for compensation for pneumoconiosis. Something that strikes me
from working with people over those years is how important it is that
people who are entitled to compensation not only receive it, but
receive it in full. I recall the sterling work that my good friend the
late Lord Lofthouse undertook in this House to ensure that he could
stop solicitors taking a huge cut out of the compensation claims of
miners who were clearly entitled to it, and who still suffer because
they lost a chunk of the money. I was interested that the noble Lord,
Lord German, made this point: I am still concerned that when you type
the words “asbestosis” or “mesothelioma”,
or the name of any industrial disease, into a search engine, the first
thing that comes up is a list of lawyers wanting to act on your behalf
on a no-win no-fee basis. We must be careful that we make sure that
people know how to access compensation when they are entitled to it,
and do so without having to pay fees in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:37:55"></hs_TimeCode>. In the
debate in the other place the other day, my honourable friend Kevan
Jones, who had been a trade union legal officer, talked about how he
had to fight for compensation and how that could be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:38:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

back, in the 1970s I was involved with the campaign to try to get
compensation for those affected by byssinosis which, as the noble
Baroness opposite will know, is the cotton-dust disease. I mention
this, although it perhaps seems a slight diversion, because it
illustrates how government, industry, society and insurers have never
really acted together as they should. Our record as a country on
compensating people with industrial diseases is not good. Compensation
for byssinosis started in the 1940s—only for men, only for those
who had worked for 20 years and only for 
<?notus-xml column=699?>those who had worked in a very specific part of the cotton industry, in
carding. Bit by bit, although every bit was a struggle, it was extended
first to women, then to a 10-year limit, then to other branches of the
cotton industry and eventually to everybody who worked in it. It was
piecemeal because of all the barriers that came down from the industry,
from insurance, from problems with record-keeping and from legal
difficulties. Although Labour Governments made very significant headway
in health and safety throughout that time,  I do not think that
any Government have fully acknowledged the need for a totally
comprehensive approach to industrial diseases. There is still a
shame—a record that we cannot be proud of because we should have
been acting much more quickly on all these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:40:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000171">The
Minister outlined some of the difficulties that he can see, and some of
the difficulties in the piecemeal approach to this particular disease.
That could give us a case for a no-fault compensation scheme, but while
that could avoid many of the barriers and delays, it is a bit late for
that in this context, and now is not the time to argue
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:40:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052038000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052038000172">I
welcome the Bill and congratulate the Minister on getting to this

said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:40:36"></hs_TimeCode>, there are
deficiencies and issues that we will want to address as the Bill
progresses. Questions have already been raised as to why this
particular date was chosen. I understand where the Minister is coming
from but we will have to look at that again, because to have that kind
of cut-off and affect so many people’s lives so
significantly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:41:13"></hs_TimeCode> is
a very severe

70% compensation figure was also mentioned. I feel some attraction to
what the noble Lord, Lord German, said about perhaps having a different
approach, and if there is a problem there, having a cap on the figure

civil

the question of why other similar diseases, such as asbestosis and so
on, cannot be included, I understand that the Minister wants a simple
and streamlined scheme, as I think he called it. However, having a
simple and streamlined scheme and extending the process to other
diseases are not mutually exclusive. We could have an incremental
approach so that this comes into force as soon as possible but the door
is left open for other diseases to join this scheme in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:42:12"></hs_TimeCode>. Other
people will be worried, and I do not see why they should have to wait

also hope that the Minister can give some assurances about the other
point that my noble friend made about awareness campaigns through
health and safety, and an increased emphasis on medical research. The
Minister said that a balance had to be struck, and I think we all
accept that that is the case. However, in Committee we have to ask
ourselves whether this is the best balance possible, or whether we
could make some improvements.</hs_para>

others have said, we are talking about a horrible, debilitating, deadly
disease caused by the workplace environment. We are talking about
people whom the Government, in their current parlance, would describe 
<?notus-xml column=700?>as strivers. These people worked hard and deserve the best we can give
them. While we want the Bill to have a swift passage, I hope through
both Houses, we have to try to improve it for their sakes and for all

Masham of Ilton:</Member></B> My Lords, I will say just a few words in
support of this Bill. Mesothelioma is not an easy disease to diagnose.
The earliest signs of the disease are quite vague. The most common
symptoms are breathlessness, chest pain, fatigue and weight loss. This
occurs as a result of an effusion, when fluid accumulates in the
pleural cavity, the space between the two layers of the pleural lining.
The patient will often visit their GP at this stage. The cancer can
spread to different parts of the body.</hs_para>

is a cancer caused by exposure to specific types of asbestos, which are
present in many homes and workplaces but no longer used for any
purpose. On average, people do not develop symptoms for 30 to 40 years
after exposure. Few people survive for more than two years after
diagnosis. The majority of victims today are former industrial workers
who were exposed before 1980. Around 2,400 people a year die from
mesothelioma. Around 56,000 people are expected to die in the next 30
years unless a cure is found. No change in lifestyle will help
them.</hs_para>

recently, very little was spent on research into mesothelioma in the
UK. If there is to be progress and hope in treating mesothelioma, there
will have to be an increase in research. I am told that the insurance
industry leaders would like to see their industry continue to fund
research, but it is felt that the long-term funding solution needs to
see the burden shared more

reasons for being interested in this Bill are threefold. First, one of
my sisters-in-law died of mesothelioma. She was a nurse and would push
trolleys through the basement of Scunthorpe Hospital. In the 1950s and
1960s, hospital basements were probably among the most dangerous places
to be. The mother 
<?notus-xml column=701?>of a colleague also died of mesothelioma. She did not work in a hospital
but washed the overalls of someone who did. So this is about very
personal
tragedies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:47:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

interested in this disease when I conducted my report into construction
fatalities and found out how many construction workers were affected.
My third reason is that, as a former trade unionist and president of
the TUC, I witnessed the tireless and continuing efforts of the trade
union movement over decades to claw, inch by inch, some concessions for
affected workers, despite the strongest possible resistance from
employers, the insurance industry and some in the legal profession. It
was as recently as 1968, only 45 years ago, that the
<I>British Medical Journal</I> suggested that mesothelioma was a
primary cause of death rather than a secondary cancer. This
is not an area, as my noble friend Lady Taylor said, in which we can
take pride in the UK, and we know that the worst is yet  to

the administration of the proposed scheme and the potential impact of
Ministry of Justice streamlining of the overall claims procedure, as it
affects mesothelioma suffers. If the administration of the scheme is to
be contracted out, I ask the Minister what safeguards will be written
into the tender to ensure absolute independence and integrity. This
would apply in particular if the insurance industry were to be the
scheme administrator. The conflict of interest would be obvious, even
if we were looking at an industry with a benign record. However, we are
looking at one more commonly characterised by delaying tactics,
spurious arguments and obfuscation. The Bill allows for the scheme

deal, what guarantee will there be that awards will not be

unlikely. One way of preventing this would be to cash-limit the awards.

Earl of Courtown:</Member></B> My Lords, I admit that this is not the
sort of area that I would normally speak about in your
Lordships’ House, but there are a number of reasons why I
decided to speak tonight. I have had the experience in the construction
industry of dealing with demolition work that involved the safe removal
and disposal of asbestos insulating board and corrugated sheeting.
Another reason that hit me harder was the death of the former MP, John
MacDougall, whom I knew well and counted as a friend. Only after he had
died did I hear that he was certain that he had contracted cancer in
his past career in the shipyards of Rosyth.  At this point I
pay tribute to his daughter, who after his death set up a charity in
support of mesothelioma
sufferers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:55:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

described by the Minister, is intended to help sufferers who are unable
to trace any insurance cover that might exist—or, in certain
cases, their  past employer—after being exposed to
asbestos. As I understand it, the disease may take many
years to develop and be diagnosed. As other noble Lords said, diagnosis
does not occur until the latter stages of the
disease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:56:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052048000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052048000018">In
describing the Bill, the Minister outlined the two key measures: first,
to establish a payment scheme to make payments to those with
mesothelioma; and, secondly, to create a technical committee that will
make binding decisions where there is a matter of dispute over whether
an insurer was providing employer liability cover at the time of the
negligent exposure to asbestos. As I understand the Minister, the
technical committee will have the ability to speed up many proceedings
that can get bogged down in the courts, such as decisions on an
employer’s liability cover and on disputes over the existence of
such cover. I was glad to see that the committee’s decision may
also be used in future court cases. As such, the existence of the
committee will lead to greater parity around standards of proof in
relation to employers’ liability. This should result in more
people being able to bring cases to
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:57:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052048000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052048000019">Having
looked further into past compensation claims concerning mesothelioma, I
am informed that case law refers to a considerable number of cases
concerning this disease. As I understand it, the main problems
associated with this have been the difficulty of proving negligence by
the employer, the difficulty of proving that the mesothelioma was
contracted as a result of the negligence of the employer, and the
length of time it can take such cases to be
settled<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:58:05"></hs_TimeCode>. I was
also glad to note that the Bill states that claims will be also
considered from eligible dependants. It is so important when people are
suffering from this fast-acting disease  that their dependants
can also claim some form of
compensation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:58:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052048000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052048000020">In
addition, I have noticed that my noble friend’s department will
bring forward draft scheme rules in Committee. Will he tell the House
whether these rules will be included in the Bill? I also understand
that they will apply to the compensation tariff. Will this be included
in the Bill or form part of secondary legislation? Will the Minister
also tell the House how any changes to the tariff and the scheme rules
will be managed in

noble Lords have expressed criticisms and concerns about the types of
cancer that will not be covered by the scheme. However, due to the
unique nature of diffuse mesothelioma and the often short period of
life expectancy after diagnosis, it is very important that we have a

families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:59:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052048000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052048000022">I
have also noted concerns about the insurance companies’ actions
in this situation. We would not be where we are unless we were actually
able to speak to the insurance companies in the first place. We are
also looking at concerns about how the insurance companies will set up
the company to administer the scheme themselves. I understand the
concerns, but the Government have the final say, should these matters
not work out. They can actually reclaim the scheme to work in-house or
put it out to other people to run. I

Giddens:</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to begin by expressing my
heartfelt sympathy to anyone who has, as I have, lost a loved one to
this horrendous disease. It is essentially a death sentence for anyone
who contracts it. I would like to correct my noble friend Lady Taylor,
who is not in her place. It is not always contracted in the workplace.
You can contract the disease in other contexts too, and that is true of
the person in my family. It is important to say that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:00:55"></hs_TimeCode>It is relevant
in this debate not just to concentrate on this country but to look
around the world at the eccentric, problematic and tortured history of
this disease and the response to it of the legal system and the
building and insurance industries. There is a lot to learn here that is
relevant to our
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

called a “magic dust” and it was used extensively with
that in mind in all sorts of installations around the world, where, of
course, it still remains. There is still an enormous amount of asbestos
in many buildings in very many countries across the world, especially
developing countries, where it is still in a lethal state. There is a
very interesting book on this and—my noble friend just referred
to this—on the resistance of industry and government to
accepting liability. It is by Geoffrey Tweedale and has the appropriate
title <I>Magic Mineral to Killer Dust.</I><I> </I>That is what it is
today. As noble Lords have said, it can take 20 to 50 years
to appear, and in that sense tracks to some degree the history of
tobacco, the diseases from which also take a long time to come out and
took a long time to identify. It just makes me wonder what other lethal
diseases might be lurking out there in the world, a point I will come
back to later on, because we now eat so many foods with additives that
no one has ever experienced before and we ingest all sorts of
substances from the air that have never existed before because they are
new forms of synthetic materials. It just makes me wonder what lies in
store elsewhere if diseases like this take such a long time to come out
and therefore to
identify<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:03:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

establish the aetiology of diseases that come to light after many
years. Tracking the history of mesothelioma is really intriguing in
this respect because there was enormous resistance at first to
identifying it as a single syndrome or disease, and secondly to
identifying its causation. Again, this tracked the tobacco industry.
The disease was known in some sense since just after the turn of the
century, but it was not until the 1960s that a vital set of researches
was published in South Africa that changed the consciousness of the
medical profession, and then, quite a long while after that, the other
authorities involved.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052048000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052048000026">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>
often with these sorts of things, publicity was gained for mesothelioma
by the fact that the film actor Steve McQueen died of it. He worked
with racing cars and he apparently ingested asbestos from their brake
linings. That brought it to the public consciousness in America, but it
is important to stress that there was very strong resistance from the
building industry, from the asbestos industry and particularly from the
insurance 
<?notus-xml column=705?>industry in most
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:04:45"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:04:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
They just picked apart the research in much the same way in which the
tobacco industry tried to pick apart the research on lung cancer.
Hence, in all countries, it was a long time before either business or
Governments accepted any liability at all.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:50:00"></hs_TimeCode> most
countries, there was an endless turmoil of lawsuits, which meant that
most people who brought the cases got no benefit from them at all, and
neither, often, did their dependants. I am sure noble Lords know that
in America there was a complete bottleneck of such cases. That is in
nobody’s interest. It is partly for that reason that I join
other noble Lords in welcoming this legislation and congratulate the
noble Lord on his part in
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:05:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

about the cut-off date. It is clear that the scheme must have some kind
of limitation, but I just worry that it is a recipe for bitterness
because it has a wholly arbitrary element to it. I have seen someone at
close hand dying of this disease. If you also consider that the cut-off
date is 25 July 2012, it is clear that it is purely a date on which the
Government responded to their consultation. It is an administrative
date; it bears no relation to suffering, and there is terrible
suffering from this
disease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T19:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052048000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052048000028">I
join other noble Lords in suggesting that, at least at some point, a
further exploration with the insurance industry is surely warranted.
Mesothelioma is not like the whiplash industry: there is no element
whatever of moral hazard in it. However, we know that there are large
areas like that in the insurance industry with lots of problematic
claims. You could argue that mesothelioma sufferers are paying for this
grey area of the insurance industry with this arbitrary cut-off. I hope
the Minister will give some attention to the impact that that might
have on a family before simply going ahead with it in other parts of
the discussion of this
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:07:11"></hs_TimeCode>. If the
Minister has not read it, I recommend reading Geoffrey
Tweedale’s book. It is a salutary tale of resistance to
regulation and the devious practices that can be involved in
it.</hs_para>

conclusion, I have two questions for the Minister. First, will the
Government at least give some attention to the moral and psychological
impact of a cut-off date of this sort? Could they see whether there is
any way in which it could be neutered for the sufferer? As I said, it
bears no real relation to the awful depth of suffering, not just for
the person but for the dependants of that person. Secondly, will the
Minister consider working proactively with the insurance industry to
scan similar problems in advance? This is where I come back to the
point I made at the beginning: that there might be lots of potentially
lethal diseases stored up in our environment, so it would seem sensible
to try to develop a kind of proactive response to this. I do not know
whether the Minister has any scheme in mind or whether the insurance
industry, the Government and medical research could work together. We
do not really want this sad and sorry tale repeated elsewhere, because
next time it could have even more devastating
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:08:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_20_PT_1/46410BAFF650C5A951A40B44CFF3D83AC657A3C2" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 May 2013">Monday,

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, thank and
congratulate the Minister on bringing the Bill to the House. He is a
good man who has fallen into bad 
<?notus-xml column=706?>company. He has had to present a number of pretty miserable policies to
the House. However, we should recognise that he has worked long and
hard to develop this scheme and today he brings us, by his standards,
very good news
indeed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:09:21"></hs_TimeCode>. We
should also express measured appreciation of the insurance industry and
the ABI. Goodness knows, the industry has been grudging and obstructive
in the past, but it has established the Employers’ Liability
Tracing Office and is willing to go along with this scheme. It is,
however, a scheme that needs
improvement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000003">Credit
should certainly be given to the previous Government for the
preliminary work that they did. The Minister was rightly generous to my
noble friend Lord McKenzie, who published the consultation document in
February 2010 on accessing compensation. Credit should also go to this
Government for pursuing the process, and I think that means that credit
should go to the permanent Civil Service. Credit should, of course,
also go to the campaigners. It is right that we should do all we
reasonably can to support those who are victims of the horrors of
diffuse mesothelioma because of their employers’ negligence.
This long-latency illness incubates for perhaps three to four decades
but at the end inexorably causes great suffering and death. It is right
that we should do what we can to support the dependants of people who
contract the disease. It must be grim for all of them in the
circumstances that follow diagnosis to struggle to achieve
compensation. I am not convinced that that process will be much eased
given that the new scheme is a scheme of last resort, but at least it
will yield better financial outcomes for more
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000004">I
also ask why the scheme is to be limited to mesothelioma alone. Other
asbestos-related diseases of the lung and the pleura caused by the
inhalation of asbestos fibres ought surely to receive equal
consideration such as asbestosis, diffuse pleural thickening, pleural
plaques, pleural effusion, rounded atelectasis and asbestos-related
lung cancer. With all these illnesses, employers’ liability is
equally disputed and equally hard to trace. Natural justice tells us
that people who suffer from this range of asbestos-related illnesses
should be treated alike. They all have in common that they suffer from
their employers’ negligence in relation to asbestos. The
Minister said in his opening speech that these problems also need to be
addressed but he thought that if they were addressed straight away too
many cases would spoil the
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:16:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000005">I
echo the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord German, because I am
not clear whether the Long Title allows the flexibility to introduce
under this legislation further schemes to support people suffering from
other asbestos-related diseases. If it does—I understand why the
Minister is unable to proceed with introducing schemes in relation to
other diseases now—will he indicate when he expects to do so? If
the legislation does not permit it, and is not susceptible to amendment
to enable it to do so, will he pursue his mission and introduce further
legislation? As my noble friend Lady Taylor said, we need a
comprehensive approach. In the mean time, we must address the project
that the Minister has placed before
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:13:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that their overarching aim is to ensure that employees who are injured
or made ill in consequence of their employment should not be denied
fair compensation. The scheme, in providing compensation where the
employer or the insurer cannot be identified or traced, goes a long way
to achieving that objective but does not go far
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:13:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000007">I
would like to probe the Minister on a number of points. I would be
grateful if he would clarify the position on legal costs which I do not
understand very clearly. The Government’s aim in the Legal Aid,
Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012—the LASPO
Act—was to remove personal injury from the scope of legal aid.
On that basis, legal aid would generally not be available to a person
diagnosed with mesothelioma who seeks advice from a solicitor, as he or
she is bound to
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:16:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000008">Part
2 of the LASPO Act implements the Jackson reforms to no-win no-fee
arrangements. However, the Government have deferred implementation of
the measure in relation to mesothelioma claims pending the findings of
a report which they have commissioned. When will we have the findings
of that report? If Sections 44 and 46 of LASPO are applied in
mesothelioma cases, as I understand it, lawyers acting under
conditional fee agreements will be able to charge a success fee payable
from the damages. Does the Minister think it is appropriate that that
should be so in mesothelioma cases?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052057000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000009">How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>
does the new scheme that this legislation enacts take account of the
new position on conditional fee
agreements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:16:24"></hs_TimeCode>? The
2013 impact assessment assumes that a scheme payment would include an
amount to cover legal costs in making an application. The 2012 impact
assessment estimated that would be £7,000 for a successful case
and £9,000 for an unsuccessful case. The overall legal costs for
the scheme are put at £24 million to £27
million. As with civil actions, will they be paid out of the scheme
award, which is already reduced to 70% of the level of civil damages,
or will they be paid by the scheme over and above that 70% award? Will
the payment take account of a personal injury solicitor’s fees
incurred for work prior to the application being made to the scheme?
Who decides these matters? As far as I can see from Clause 1, the
Secretary of State does. There will be no legal aid for appeals to the
First-tier Tribunal following the review scheme decision, unless they
are exceptionally to secure the claimant’s rights under the ECHR
or under European Union law. Are the Government content with that
situation? Are the Government going to control the fees that the
lawyers charge? The statement by the Minister for Employment, Mr Mark
Hoban, on 13 May indicated that the Ministry of Justice is
going to consult about a fixed-cost regime for mesothelioma claims. It
would be helpful if we could be told what he has in mind. It would also
be helpful if the Minister could give us, either today or in Committee,
a clear statement in relation to what, if any, legal costs incurred
under the new arrangements by claimants, either pursuing their own case
against an employer or an insurer or claiming from the scheme, will be
met under the arrangements that he has
designed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:17:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000010">The
interaction of the scheme with the benefits regime will warrant careful
consideration. The Bill would permit the Secretary of State to recover
benefits

benefits will continue in payment after an award has been made? If an
award under the scheme is to average £87,000, as we are advised
it will, what benefits will be left for the claimant? Will income
support and housing benefit be swept away? What will happen to
industrial injuries disablement benefit, which is a major benefit, and
very important in the budgets of such families? Is it correct that the
payment of benefits would not be affected during the first year after
an award? That is the case, I understand, where civil compensation is
concerned. Would it still be the case with this scheme? Is pension
credit to be ignored indefinitely? What will be the developing position

recovered where payments have already been made. Or will it only be the

1 contemplates the recovery of benefits on a scale such that the whole

State to claw back payments. What does the Minister intend? What scope
is there for discretion? For example, will the DWP refrain from clawing
back any payments that have been made in relation to pain and
suffering? Is he able, and will he be prepared, to limit to a certain
percentage the amount of benefits to be denied or recovered? Will he
take a lenient view of the treatment of carers under the benefits
regime in these circumstances? Past practice has been to an extent
discretionary and compassionate. I am quite sure that the noble Lord
will want to be as compassionate as he can in the appalling
circumstances that these families face. I hope he will err on the side

had hoped to have time—but I have gone on too long on these
subjects—to say that I, too, can see no justification for the
limit of 70%. I will just briefly say that it cannot be right to
discriminate against claimants where employers and insurers have lost
or destroyed the documentation. It is no fault of the claimant that the
employers and insurers are in that difficulty. If all claimants are to
go through a single portal to be followed by a rigorous search to trace
the documentation, then surely all claimants ought to be treated
equally. There will be a temptation for the industry not to trace the
documentation if failure to do so means they will only have to pay 70%
rather than the full amount of compensation they anticipate the court
will award, so there is a real risk of the industry being conflicted
here. Certainly employers’ liability insurers are not 
in a position to plead poverty. They did very well for 
<?notus-xml column=709?>decades. Up until 2008 they even kept the lump sums that were awarded by
the tax payer, aggregating to over £20 million a year to offset
the cost to them of compensation. We can be sure, notwithstanding what
the Minister has said, as sure as eggs is eggs, just as soon as market
conditions permit, the insurance industry will pass on the additional
cost to them of this scheme by way of increased employers’

Avebury:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may begin by mildly
disagreeing with the noble Lord, Lord Howarth. The Minister
is in excellent company because he has built on
the work done by the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, and I thank both of
them for their excellent work, for the processes which have led up to
this Bill and for the actual construction of the Bill by the Minister.
We owe them an enormous debt of gratitude for what has been an
extremely long and arduous task.</hs_para>

victims of this horrible disease, contracted as the result of working
in environments that contained asbestos many years ago, to recover
compensation even if the former employer, through whose negligence the
patient was exposed to the asbestos, has gone out of business and the
employer’s liability insurance, which would have covered a claim
against the employer, cannot be traced. This is partly because the
insurers irresponsibly destroyed policies taken out by firms that went
bust, even though it was known right from the start of
employers’ liability insurance in 1972 that mesothelioma has a
very long latency period. A pamphlet entitled <I>Asbestos Kills </I>by
Nancy Tait, which I published in 1976, quoted evidence going back to
the 1930s to show that asbestos causes a wide range of diseases and
that some of them have a latency period of as long as 30 or
40 years after exposure. There is absolutely no excuse whatever for
what is now being euphemistically termed “market
failure”.</hs_para>

to work being undertaken by the Ministry of Justice on a range of
measures, which include a pre-action protocol, and several noble Lords
have referred to the work being done by Senior Master Whitaker. Will
the Ministry of Justice examine that work carefully because the
administration of these mesothelioma cases by Senior Master Whitaker,
his practice direction and his use of the “show cause
procedure”—whereby once a claimant has established that
he was exposed to asbestos in breach of the employer’s duty, the
evidential burden shifts to the defendant to produce evidence to
demonstrate that it has a real prospect of success in its
defence—have been major causes of accelerating the progress of
these cases through the courts. Rather than having a pre-action
protocol, I wonder whether it might not be best to allocate a special
court for the conduct of these cases, where the experience and wisdom
of Senior Master Whitaker could be developed and extended to other
judges.</hs_para>

does not go as far as the Asbestos Victims Support Groups Forum UK
would have liked. I shall refer to two of its main concerns. It was
unfortunate that the forum was not invited to any of the consultations
held over the two-year period during which the scheme was being
negotiated, and I would be grateful if the Minister could explain why
the forum was not allowed to have its say. As I am sure he knows, the
forum would have preferred a scheme like the one that applies to the
motor accident victims of uninsured drivers. Representatives of the
forum say, as every noble Lord who has spoken so far has also remarked,
that it was wrong to apply the scheme only from 25 July 2012. As has
been mentioned, it was a purely arbitrary date, although I imagine that
that would have meant squeezing more money out of the insurance
industry. The Government have decided to go for the best settlement
they could get the industry to agree to voluntarily, and inevitably
that was bound to be less than perfect.</hs_para>

30% reduction, which, again, all noble Lords have condemned, from the
average compensation paid to claimants of the same age who can identify
the relevant employers’ liability policy. It is not clear how
the 30% figure was determined, although I understand that it was
intended to be a disincentive to claimants opting for this scheme when
they could have identified the insurer and made a claim accordingly. I
agree with the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, who said that this was
manifestly absurd—those were not the exact words he used, but
that was their meaning—because the claimant who is unable to
pinpoint the relevant insurer has no option but to apply to the
Employers’ Liability Tracing Office, whose remit is to conduct
the search, so the matter is entirely in its hands. A litigant cannot
enter the scheme without ELTO being involved, a point to which I shall
come back later.</hs_para>

itself. I do not believe that the scheme should be left to the
unfettered discretion of the Secretary of State, as my noble friend
Lord German has already said, but rather that it should be subject to
approval by Parliament, as should any amendment, replacement or
abolition of it. I have a couple of questions for the Minister. In
Clause 2, is the definition of “relevant employer”
intended to make a claim possible against any pre-1972 employer on
whose premises it can be shown that there was asbestos? Is negligence
to be assumed in these cases, irrespective of the circumstances in
which the victim now finds himself? How can you establish negligence
when the employer has gone out of business and there is no direct
evidence of what he was doing in the period before 1972?</hs_para>

age referred to the age at the date of diagnosis or the age when the
claim was submitted? They may not always be the same. In Clause 4(3)(a)
in what circumstances is it envisaged that conditions would be applied
to the payment? I was advised that what may be in mind is a situation
where the payment falls to be made to the trustees of a dependant who
is a child or mentally disabled, but if that is the case, should that
not be spelt out in the Bill rather than allowing the Secretary of
State to impose any conditions whatever at his absolute
discretion?</hs_para>

point, but Clauses 11 and 12 appear to be superfluous
because they merely repeat parts of what is already in the schedules.
On Clause 13, the Government have found it necessary to defend
themselves against the potential criticism of the levy as an
infringement of the property rights of the insurers under Article 1
Protocol 1 of the ECHR. One would have thought that securing the
agreement of the Association of British Insurers to the scheme would
protect it against litigation by an individual insurer. One of the
factors which they say is relevant in considering whether transferring
to the insurance industry the cost of remedying the market failure to
keep adequate records is that the compensation is limited to a
percentage of the amount that would have been payable if the records
had existed. In order to remedy this market failure comprehensively and
restore mesothelioma victims to the position they would have occupied
if the insurance records had existed, the figure would, of course, have
had to be 100%. Would my noble friend consider aiming for a lower
reduction—as all noble Lords who have spoken so far have
recommended—than the planned 30%, preferably with the industry
agreeing to an increase in the levy to fund the difference? I am
advised that the Financial Services Compensation Scheme pays 90%
compensation in a situation where the negligent employer is no longer
trading and where the insurance company for the defunct company is also
no longer trading. The FSCS is authorised by the Financial Conduct
Authority and, so far as the asbestos-related disease claims are
concerned, FSCS coverage is not limited to mesothelioma. Is this not a
model for the scheme that is to be launched under this
Bill?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000023">Mesothelioma
is an excruciatingly painful disease, and the struggle to get fair
compensation for those who are struck down by it has been
excruciatingly slow, having taken 40 years so far. As my noble friend
Lord German said, the Bill is a milestone, but it is not the end of the

discrimination, as my noble friend Lord Howarth so ably put it, against
people who cannot find their employer or insurer. Maybe it will be in
the interests of some of the less scrupulous insurers to hide a bit and
not volunteer all the information that they might. In those
circumstances, to discriminate in the compensatory award against the
individual concerned is not right. Fourthly, the insurance industry has
helped a little in funding research into the treatment of these
diseases and I hope that the levy on them will include provision for
them to help research even further into the treatments

Alton of Liverpool:</Member></B> My Lords, in his opening speech, the
Minister benchmarked our knowledge of mesothelioma to 1965. In that
year, the <I>Sunday Times </I>reported on how an epidemiological
investigation by Newhouse and Thompson for the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine had shed light on the origins and nature of
mesothelioma, finally laying to rest the scepticism of some
pathologists who had until 
<?notus-xml column=714?>that time disputed its existence or its long period of hibernation,
although more than three decades earlier, in 1930, the Merewether
report had warned of a latency for asbestosis of some 25 years.
Therefore, no one can reasonably claim that the industry, the
Government or employers did not understand the risks that workers
faced, although, scandalously, insurers routinely destroyed records
during that period. That was not market failure—the phrase used

dungarees and work clothes when he returned from work every night. In

I have some sympathy with that, but remember that for decades it was
asbestos victims who bore the burden of untraced insurance and insurers
have saved hundreds of millions of pounds avoiding liability for
insurances that they wrote. For decades, the taxpayer has funded the
government lump-sum payments for those who could not trace their
insurer, and they have recovered those payments only when an insurer
was found since 2008. Prior to that, insurers recovered all government
lump-sum payments which offset the compensation they paid, worth

me turn to my final point. As well as adequate
compensation, should we not be spending more of our time and money, as
was alluded to by the noble Lord, 
<?notus-xml column=716?>Lord Monks, in finding a cure to prevent the ravages of this fatal
disease? In 2011, the British Lung Foundation invested £1
million in research, the rest of the voluntary sector invested
£400,000 and the Government invested nothing at all. These are
scandalously small sums to spend on a disease which kills so many
people. Let us contrast the £0.4 million from the not-for-profit
sector spent on mesothelioma research with the £22 million for
bowel cancer, the £41 million for breast cancer, the
£11.5 million for lung cancer and the £32 million for
leukaemia. Indeed, there are 17 other forms of cancer for which far
more research resources are reserved than for mesothelioma.
Mesothelioma is literally at the bottom of the list. In 2011, the
voluntary sector invested £5 million in myeloma research and
£5.6 million on malignant melanoma—the cancers
immediately above and below mesothelioma in the table of mortality
figures. Yet, even with such limited funds there have been some
exciting developments, including the creation of the world’s
first mesothelioma tissue bank for researchers, a transatlantic
collaborative study of the genetic make-up of mesothelioma and work on
overcoming resistance to drugs used to treat the disease. It shows what
can be done with the right investment. This Bill offers an opportunity
to create a sustainable fund for mesothelioma research to help ensure
that future generations do not have to suffer in the same way that so
many have in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000047">I

Whitaker:</Member></B> My Lords, when I worked in the Health and Safety
Executive, mesothelioma was recognised as the most dread of all
occupational diseases. It is as yet incurable. There is no safe
threshold, so that the smallest exposure to crocidolite or blue
asbestos could produce it. There are many cases on record of a few
weeks’ work or less in which the tiny fibres lodged fatally in
the lung cavity, producing a lingering, miserable death in restlessness
and pain. A little girl contracted it simply from being around her
grandfather’s workplace. It was diagnosed when she was in her
40s.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0002.htm#13052057000050">Almost<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T20:56:57"></hs_TimeCode>
worst of all, although the toxicity of asbestos generally was
recognised at the very beginning of the 20th century, effective
preventive regulations had to wait until the 1970s. The import and use
of blue asbestos was not banned until 1985, after many hard fought
legal battles. As it is a disease with a long latency period, those
dangerous conditions from before the ban are
still now producing cases of mesothelioma.</hs_para>

recognised to be so clearly linked to occupational exposure that there

overly represented in construction and certain industrial sectors,

number of noble Lords, by undertaking renovation work on buildings or
even washing the clothes of those who work with asbestos. It has been

dependants, of course—and it is available only to those
diagnosed on or after 25 July 2012. The Bill makes provision for a
scheme that will make payments to these persons provided that they have
brought no action against an employer or that employer’s
liability insurer because they were unable to do so. Surely that date,
as has already been suggested, should be three years earlier, in line
with the three-year limitation period in law. That is an objective

without consulting claimants, support groups and relevant trade unions.
The fact that support will be limited to those suffering from diffuse

Employers’ Liability Insurance Bureau proposal by the previous
Labour Government in 2010. Thompsons Solicitors have also pointed out

what possible basis can a lower figure be offered in settlement of the
liability? The insurance industry’s rationale for allowing this
injustice to occur is apparently that it will maintain an incentive for
people to attempt to trace insurers so that claims will be brought to
this scheme only once all other avenues have been exhausted. I suggest
that paying only 70% shows a flagrant disregard for the highly
distressing and incapacitating symptoms that sufferers experience at a
time when they are likely to be seeking compensation, as well as the
very short life expectancy of these people. Expecting sufferers to
exhaust all other avenues before bringing a claim to the scheme makes
it quite likely that the person in question will have died before
compensation is gained, and will put increased pressure on terminally

Browne of Ladyton:</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to follow
the noble Lord, Lord Wigley. Characteristically, despite how late his
contribution has come in the debate, he has identified fresh points
that have not been raised by other speakers. That has added
significantly to our consideration of the Bill and challenges me to do
the same. I shall try to approach the next few minutes in a way that is
not repetitive, but I start by joining the Minister in his generous
words of praise for my noble friend Lord McKenzie of Luton and his
consistent contribution to advancing the cause of mesothelioma and
other asbestos sufferers—indeed, to health and safety law in
general.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052057000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000068">I
couple the Minister in that praise, because I know from my own
experience what challenges he faced in trying to deal with the
insurance industry over this very issue. For a short time in 2003, I
was the Minister for Employment and had responsibility for health and
safety. I came into the job at the beginning of a summer when there
genuinely was a market failure in relation to compulsory
employer’s liability insurance, and I know exactly the nature of
the challenge that he faced with the insurance industry over this
insurance. I pay tribute to him for getting the Bill before us in this
fashion<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:08:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000069">Having
said that, though—taking on board all his entreaties that there
are challenges of pragmatism and speed, the fact that we must bear in
mind the nature of this filthy disease and its effect on people, the
fact that there are people out there who are waiting for justice and
have been for some time, and that any delay will mean that people will
die before they get it—we still have an obligation to be fair.
Fairness and justice are important considerations in what we are doing
with this legislation. Having listened to the debate thus far, I think
that there is a very strong thread running through it: the judgment as
to whether a payment scheme such as this, as opposed to a compensation
scheme, serves justice has to be seen in a much broader context than
those challenges, with respect to the Minister and the papers that are
before us. It has to be seen in the broader context of what can be done
to improve the ability of people to get full compensation through our
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:09:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000070">That
leads me to a point that I cannot resist the temptation to make, just
because of the Minister’s initial words in introducing the Bill.
He said in an early sentence—indeed, it may have been the second
sentence that he uttered—that where a person is injured by
negligence or a breach of statutory duty, that person should be
compensated by their employer. I agree with them. I regret that that
statement of principle did not inform the provisions of the Enterprise
and Regulatory Reform Act, which we passed this year and which broke
the link between breach of statutory 
<?notus-xml column=721?>duty and compensation by an employer. I invite the Minister to reflect
on those words in a broader context, rather than just in relation to
the matters before your Lordships’ House this
evening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:10:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

we are being just has to be seen in the context of why we need to
address this issue in this way, at this stage. I do not intend to
repeat the words of other noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord
Alton of Liverpool and Lord Avebury, and my noble friend Lord Giddens,
who pointed out in short that, for decades, employers, and indeed
Governments, knew exactly what the risks of using this substance were
and did nothing about them but spent a lot of effort resisting justice

latency of this and other asbestos-related diseases, I do not think
that we can describe what the insurance industry did in
recklessly—and I am being kind in using that
word—destroying its records as inconsistent record-keeping.
These were deliberate acts. I cannot go so far as to say they were
designed to have the consequence that they have but they were
calculated to do so. If we had not had this combination of deliberate
acts over an extensive period, we would not be facing the problems that
we face
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:11:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

many noble Lords about the arbitrary nature of the anticipated payment
of 70% of average compensation and the cut-off date that will be very
brutal to certain people who have suffered greatly. I want to make two
points in particular, which I think will be additional arguments at
least, if not completely new points in the debate. The first relates to
the recovery of benefits. I accept the constraints that have been in
place in these negotiations and because of that I am willing to accept
that a payment scheme, as opposed to a compensation scheme, is the way
forward, at least in the short term. However, that is entirely
inconsistent with the approach that the Government plan for the
recovery of benefits. My noble friend Lord Howarth of Newport asked a
series of very detailed questions about benefits, to which I am sure
the Minister will be able to reply. I can tell my noble friend that the
answers will be extremely disappointing. It is very clear that the
Government intend to recover benefits paid to those who have suffered.
That may not affect continuing benefits because of the way the
compensation recovery system works, but it will certainly be a
significant injustice to people who have received benefits and find
them clawed back from their payment.</hs_para>

draw the attention of noble Lords to the Government’s impact
assessment. I accept that this is an excellent document but it is also
a quarry of very interesting information, as impact assessments always
are. I refer particularly to paragraphs 13 and 14 of the impact
assessment signed by the Minister on 2 May 2013. They set out in short
how the compensation recovery scheme works. Paragraph 14
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13052057000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000127">“In
a civil case, where an individual receives compensation from an
employer or insurer, the government … recovers the social
security benefits and lump sum payments it has made from the
compensation
paid”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13052057000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000122">That
is how it works, I agree with it and there is a justification for it,
as the Minister explained: you 
<?notus-xml column=722?>cannot be compensated twice. However, as he is at great pains to
explain, those who will get payments out of the scheme are not being
compensated. This is a payment scheme, not a compensation scheme. It is
not designed to compensate people for their loss and if it were these
benefits would be restricted to the part of the loss that relates to
income, not the part that relates to pain and suffering, because that
is how the compensation scheme works otherwise. Therefore, there is an
inherent unfairness in this. With respect to the Minister, the
Government cannot have it both ways. This cannot be a compensation
scheme for the recovery of benefits paid to those who have been paid
out of it, but only a payment scheme for the nature of the
compensation. Someone recently said to me in an argument that if you
cannot ride two horses you should not be in the circus, but that is not
a good enough answer to this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:15:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

that will happen to this scheme. That is what the impact assessment
says. I draw noble Lords’ attention to paragraph 97;
effectively, the research shows that that is the industry’s
intention, while the impact assessment stands itself on its head and
concludes the opposite in the last part of the
paragraph<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:16:08"></hs_TimeCode>. I
draw these two issues to the Minister’s attention. I hope that

I welcome the Bill and will not seek to delay it. Having said that, the
Bill is deficient. It needs to be strengthened, either in Committee in

is that I have been involved in this field for nearly 40 years. In the
early 1970s, when I was a trade union health and safety officer, I sat
on the first HSE drafting committee on the asbestos regulations. Of
course, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, has said, by that time the
scientific knowledge was clear on blue asbestos and pretty clear on
white and brown asbestos as well. However, it took a long time for the
government machine to get in place. Of course, employers were still in
denial. My union, the GMWU, had significant membership in Turner &amp;
Newall itself, and frankly some of them were in denial as much as the
management. However, the reality was that they were
dying<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:18:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

workers who liked to call themselves thermal insulation engineers, or
laggers, who stripped off asbestos from machinery in shipyards,
steelworks and royal government dockyards. There were some fantastic
leading figures among that group of workers, almost all of whom were
dead in their 40s from asbestosis. Many of those who survived came to
suffer from mesothelioma as

Jones and others have said, this is an utterly horrendous disease. I am
pleased that, belatedly—50 years on from the scientific
knowledge being here—we are finally getting to grips with it.
The previous Labour Government did a lot in relation to other
asbestos-related diseases, and the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, started
the ball rolling on this one against considerable opposition from the
insurance companies and, be it whispered, from the
Treasury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:19:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000081">However,
we still do not yet have a sufficiently effective Bill. Others have
pointed to the deficiencies in relation to those it excludes because of
the date. Frankly, many are excluded by that date, given the
life-expectancy after diagnosis. Given the exclusion of other
long-latency diseases and mesothelioma, which can generally be ascribed
to asbestos, although the causal association may be slightly weaker,
and to the whole structure of compensation, it is true that those who
get through this system, or their dependents, will belatedly get a very
significant sum. That is what, rightly, the civil courts have awarded
in individual cases which have been through the court system. I find it
pretty disgraceful that the average that comes out of that system will
now be discounted by a whole 30%.</hs_para>

one stands back it is not only that there are normally scanty records
that employers have disappeared, and that individuals kept changing
their employer in many of these sectors, but, as my noble friend Lord
Browne of Ladyton just deftly hinted, there was some degree of
destruction of records involved here as well. That is the
responsibility of the insurance industry, and one they should face up
to. His analogy with the motor insurance bureau is also apposite. After
all, in the motor industry insurance is compulsory on motorists, as
employer’s liability is compulsory on employers. Therefore,
despite the greater difficulty of proof, the analogy holds. In that
situation, rather than have a sifting body, possibly interpreted by a
technical committee, and then the DWP looking at it, or whatever body
the DWP eventually devolve this scheme to, effectively the insurance
industry faces up to its responsibility and pays effectively the proven
100% of the claim. That is not a complete analogy, but compared with
that 100%, a 70% figure seems very difficult to justify. There is a
higher risk on the insurers and an increased administration cost on
them. I think it was the noble Lord, Lord
Avebury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:22:12"></hs_TimeCode>, who
said that maybe 90% in other analogies is perhaps appropriate, but any
person would regard 70% as

on getting this Bill to this stage, and no doubt having the equivalent
arguments with the Treasury to get it to this stage. However, on the
negotiations, I dealt with the insurance industry on flood defence and
with some of the Minister’s colleagues in Defra who are in the
current Government. The insurance companies are tough negotiators. They

<?notus-xml column=724?>live for negotiation, even more than trade unionists do, and at times
are rather more successful than the trade unionists. We could afford to
be a bit tougher in this respect, in particular in relation to the
discount. We have a significant exclusion on the basis of the date,
another on the basis of the non-mesothelioma diseases, and on top of
that the insurance industry has somehow come out with a 30% discount. I
suspect that they went home and thought that was a result. The
Government could get a better result. I am not sure whether we will
manage to get a better result in the course of this Bill.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:24:01"></hs_TimeCode> hope that some
of those anomalies can be addressed; for example, the Minister ought to
be prepared to accept an amendment that allowed him or a future
Secretary of State to add the other diseases to the Bill. I would have
thought that that ought not to be a great difficulty for the
Government. I hope that when we debate the regulations that might
stipulate the 70% or something like it, a little bit of give in an
upward direction would be forthcoming from the

that, I welcome the Bill. We need to make sure that, for the reasons
the Minister spelt out at the beginning, it gets a speedy result within
this House and gets onto the statute book. At the end of the day, the

their nearest and dearest have watched them do that. We have a

adequate compensation as rapidly as

has been an extraordinary unanimity round the Chamber on almost every

convince us as the Bill goes through its remaining stages. In true
Eurovision style, the top three are already predictable. The first is
the scope of the Bill. I understand the pressures that may have led the
Government to settle where they have landed. The Minister argued that
the Bill’s focus on mesothelioma was based on the fact that it
is a terrible disease that is almost always fatal, and that is
exclusively caused by exposure to asbestos. That much is uncontested.
However, the fact that mesothelioma sufferers will have a case for
compensation does not mean that others do not also have such a case,
and does not take away from the fact that there are still too many
victims of other long-latency asbestos-related conditions who should be
entitled to compensation but cannot find either an employer or an
insurer to pursue. Of course, their claims would need to be tested, but
I see that the Government are not minded to go down that
road<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:27:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000090">I
understand the attractions of clarity and moving forward with the
support of stakeholders, but I hope that the Minister has heard the
breadth and strength of feeling from all around the House that the Bill
needs not only to address this pressing problem but, as my noble friend
Lord Browne put it, needs to be fair. It will not be perceived to be
fair if it cannot at least set out the way in which the Government will
move forward. If the Minister feels that the Bill is not the route
forward for that, I hope that he will be able to tell us what the way
forward will be, so that by the time we conclude these proceedings we

also hope that in Committee we will have a chance to discuss what can
be done to try to make the process of moving on in other areas more
systematic. I was very struck by the point made by my noble friend Lady
Taylor about the piecemeal way in which steps were taken in the past.
It would be very helpful if we could set out a way forward that did not
involve constantly being dragged step by step into solving problems
that will one day have to be solved anyway. Perhaps this time we could
be the House that breaks through that way of doing things and tries to
find a more systematic way of planning for the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:28:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000092">The
second question on which there is almost total unanimity is why the
cut-off point is fixed at 25 July 2012. This point was raised by many
noble Lords. Suggestions were made that it could be set at
February 2010, when the consultation opened, or
May 2010 when it closed. The Asbestos Victims
Support Groups Forum suggested that a three-year rule in law
should be applied. Whatever the Minister comes forward with, it would
be helpful if he would take the House carefully through his reasoning
for July 2012, and against having an earlier commencement date. From
the reaction of noble Lords around the House, it would seem that simply
feeling that one 
<?notus-xml column=726?>could not leave it open-ended was not enough of an answer to the
question: why this, why now and why only
then?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000093">The
third big question is the crucial question of the proposed nature and
level of compensation. My noble friend Lord Browne of Ladyton raised
some important questions about the way in which damages are
constructed. I hope the Minister can set out some more information for
us on the record about that, about how he came  to this
space—in particular, the question of why compensation is likely
to end up being set at 70% of the average damages being awarded by the
civil courts. I confess I have not yet heard a persuasive argument for
that. I understand that the Minister seemed to be saying—and it
is certainly what the briefing said—that the rationale is that
an incentive of some sort is needed to ensure that this is genuinely a
scheme of last resort. However, my noble friend Lord McKenzie raised
the telling question: since claimants can by definition access the
scheme only if their former employer’s insurers cannot be
traced, and since the body will actually have an obligation to help
people trace an employer, why is any incentive needed The door is only
open to people who meet this condition, so they surely do not need to
be bribed to step through it as well—or in this case, rather
than being bribed, they are facing  a hefty financial penalty
if they are unable to identify a provider of employers’
liability insurance through no fault of their own, a point made very
tellingly by many noble
Lords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:30:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

question of who runs the scheme. A number of noble Lords have made the
point that concerns are being heard abroad that it might be the
insurance industry itself that will run the scheme. The Bill, of
course, carefully sets out two options: one of having the scheme run
in-house, the other run externally by a scheme operator. However, it is
clear in the briefing that the plan is that the insurance industry
should run it. It is, we are told, already in the process of setting up
a scheme in anticipation of the Bill becoming law, which could then be
up and running right away on day one, on the assumption that the scheme
meets the criteria set out by DWP. However, as my noble friends Lord
McKenzie and Lady Donaghy and others have pointed out, there is a
potential conflict of interest here if the same industry that has to
fund successful claims not merely underwrites but administers the
compensation scheme. Aside from the actual conflict, is the Minister
not concerned that the perception of a conflict may be a cause of
concern to victims and their families? Have the Government done any
research to find out how claimants would view such a provision, having
the scheme run by the very industry with which they have to join
battle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:31:54"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000095">In
particular, could the Minister tell the House whether he considered any
alternatives? Would it not have been better, perhaps, to have had an
arrangement like that for the FiSMA bodies, such as the Financial
Ombudsman Service—and I declare my interest as a non-executive
director of that body—or the Financial Services Compensation
Scheme, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury? Both of those bodies
are set up in statute and funded by levies on the financial services
industry, but they are administered by independent scheme operators
overseen by boards. The job of the 
<?notus-xml column=727?>board is to guarantee the independence of the scheme, both from
consumers and from the firms that underwrite the scheme. Therefore, I
would be grateful if the Minister could tell me whether he looked at
that as an alternative, and, if so, why he rejected

very interested to hear the Minister’s response to the matters
raised by my noble friends Lord Howarth of Newport and Lord Browne
about the question of benefits. Why do the Government see this position
as analogous to that of a compensation payment, an interesting point
made by my noble friend Lord Browne, who did indeed manage to introduce
additional material very late in the day? Also, my noble friend Lord
Howarth asked whether there would be any caps on the amount that can be
clawed back, what particular benefits are in that situation—will
it be all benefits, including carers’ benefits?—and what
happens to way in which the money is
treated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T21:33:14"></hs_TimeCode>?

do not want to detain the House any further at this time. This is a
Bill whose purpose we support fully, as one would expect, since the
previous Labour Government in the person of my noble friend Lord
McKenzie started the consultation process which brought us at last to
this point. Action has long been demanded by victims, their families
and the organisations that have supported them over many years. We owe
it to them to act swiftly, but we also owe it to them to get it right.
We owe it to the people who depend upon this fund to scrutinise this
legislation as well as we can to ensure that it is robust and that the
redress it provides will meet the needs placed upon it. Furthermore, I
think we should take a moment to reflect on the terrible consequences
of a failure to take seriously the health and safety of workers and,

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I have been in this House long enough to
have an expectation that this would be a high-quality debate. I can
confirm that my expectations have been exceeded. This was a very good
debate which showed that noble Lords have focused on the issues and is
the precursor to a valuable process being undertaken as we go through
Committee and subsequent stages of the Bill.</hs_para>

with what I called a very damaging historic market failure. Various
noble Lords, such as the noble Lords, Lord Avebury, Lord Alton and Lord
Browne, implied that it might have been rather more than that. Indeed,
it was implied that there might have been reckless behaviour.
Observations have also been made about the way in which the paperwork
was dealt with. To be blunt, many people in the insurance industry
would admit that that was the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000101">This is
not the Bill I wanted to bring to the House. I will explain why that is
the case because it is very important that noble Lords should
understand that. I wanted to find a way of allocating responsibility to
the companies that had engaged in the relevant business in the year in
question so that we could levy a specific charge on those companies for
the business for which they were responsible over the relevant period.
We would thus have allocated the responsibility where it should lie. I
spent a lot of time and, indeed, some of the DWP’s money,
researching that proposition. However, I came to the conclusion that
such a course of action was legally too risky in a most litigious
environment. Therefore, we have moved to a second-best position, the
implications of which are driving many of the shortfalls that noble
Lords have pointed out vigorously tonight, because it is one thing to
say that there is a moral imperative to look after the individuals
suffering from this terrible disease and their dependants but it is
another to pin the responsibility on companies which, frankly, had
nothing to do with it. We are looking to insurers in the
employers’ liability market to fund this provision through the
levy and we are looking at the appropriate level of levy in that
marketplace when direct blame cannot necessarily be attributed. That is
why the scheme is designed in the way that it is and why various
constraints are in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000102">I think
that I heard support for the principles of the scheme. We can get money
to the sufferers regardless of whether the insurance records have been
lost. In general terms it is right that we look to the insurance
industry to provide this support, not least because this situation is a
horrific blemish on its reputation which it will, and does, want to
correct and mitigate.</hs_para>

spend a lot of time going through the detailed questions raised. As I
will be going through them in Committee, I do not intend to spend a lot
of time going through everything now, but I will try to pick up the
main themes. I need to add something that I admitted to earlier, my
thanks—which several Lords have mentioned—to the
victims’ groups and the trade unions for all the work they have
done and for which I am personally most
grateful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000105">Before
I get into the drier stuff of this, I must add that many noble Lords
talked about the human stories. Nearly all of us will know someone who
has gone through this, and there is an awareness here that in many ways
this is one of the worst diseases to get. I 
<?notus-xml column=729?>acknowledge that. The noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Monks, and many
other noble Lords made that point and told us some stories to remind
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000106">One of the
key issues raised by virtually all noble Lords—too many to
mention individually—was about setting the figure at 70%. There
was a real juggling act about what the right level of levy is, and that
is something we can spend more time in Committee debating. If we set
the levy too high, in practice what will happen is that it will just
raise the amount to be paid and the insurers will pass on virtually all
of it to British industry, which is something I was very keen not to
see. There is a lot of economics around this, but if you set a small
level in a reasonably competitive market, most of it will probably be
absorbed by the insurance industry, which should do so, rather than by
British industry, which should not be required to absorb it. There is a
real balancing act in the amount of money that it is sensible to raise
this way to get to the victims, and that is the main driver here. It is
not, I want to emphasise, the behavioural incentives that have been
floating around. That is not what we are doing here. We are trying to
get a balance of
funding.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052057000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-0003.htm#13052057000107">The
second issue is, because we went early—theoretically one can
start doing a levy like this only at the time at which it becomes
law—we have gone from the date of the formal announcement, from
which point the insurance industry can start to reserve. However, one
of the issues coming from that is that in the first year, we
effectively have to make over three years’-worth of payments,
and noble Lords will see the problem instantly. There is suddenly a
very large levy in one year of the kind that is very difficult to
absorb. That is the reason that we have worked to smooth that first
year over four years, so that we do not get these sudden large amounts,
but it is a constraint. I shall not go into the detail tonight of how
difficult all this is to do, although perhaps in Committee I could be
persuaded to open my heart a little about particular Treasury rules,
levies that are treated like taxes and why the Treasury, which collects
taxes, should give the DWP any money to make
payments.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-20?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_20_PT_1/1D0615E682C46272833665E16759A2EBAA7268DB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 20 May 2013">Monday,

Howarth of Newport:</Member></B> Even before the noble Lord opens his
heart to us in Committee, will he look again at the question of the
start date in the light of the figures we have been given? We have been
told that the life expectancy of a mesothelioma sufferer following
diagnosis is perhaps two years. We are told that around 2,400 people
die each year, and that the insurance history can be traced in more
than 50% of cases, which means that more than half are able to pursue
their case against the insurer. That leaves around only 1,200 people
who would benefit if the noble Lord were simply to remove the start
date. I would have thought that that ought to be affordable and that
the insurance industry ought to accept that quite limited extension of
its responsibility. I hope that the noble Lord will think about that

The trouble is that, in principle, this is a sheep and goats situation.
Any date, wherever it is set, 
<?notus-xml column=730?>as the noble Lord, Lord Monks, mentioned, is always arbitrary at one
level. To pick up on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth,
this concerns dependants as well, so if there was no start date and the
date went back indefinitely, we really would be talking about a huge

this to other asbestos-related diseases was the other big issue of

mesothelioma is that if you have it, you will essentially have
contracted it doing a job in which there was negligence, and
that it is fatal. You can fix a figure with a tariff level and you can
go very fast. The objective is to reach a point within five months as
compared with a typical period now of two years. Noble Lords will be
conscious of the meaning behind those periods, given the prognosis of
survival for up to 15 months. Getting something this quickly is really
important. There may be schemes for other types of asbestos-related
illness, but they could not be set up within this structure. We would

not asking for money from the levy? It is suggesting a membership
scheme for every insurance company, who would then contribute
£10,000 as part of that scheme. This would raise £1.5
million each year. He will also recall that I made a point about the
amount of money coming into the Treasury as a consequence of the
proposals before your Lordships

I have not given up on research. There are quite a lot of issues here.
The Government do not spend a lot of money  in this area and
there is a kind of chicken and egg situation because we commission
research only if it is of high quality, yet if there is nothing to
encourage it you do not get the bids. There is lots more and I am
working with my noble friend Lord Howe on trying to get more there. The

creation of an industry-supported payment scheme. I am grateful to hear
that noble Lords may try to amplify the Bill in different ways but that
the determination of the House is to not see a delay. If we achieve
that collectively, and pass the Bill in 2013, we can set up the scheme
in April next year and get the first payments to people in July, with
300 people receiving, each year, an average of about £100,000.

amendments to the Reservoirs Act 1975 by Schedule 4 to the Flood and
Water Management Act 2010 introduce a more risk-based approach to the
management of large raised reservoirs, and these regulations are a key
component of this process. The regulations are required to be brought

way of background to the Reservoirs Act 1975, while it is rare for a
large raised reservoir to fail, the impact of such failure on life and
property could be considerable. During the 2007 summer floods, there
was a near-miss incident at Ulley reservoir where a complete reservoir
failure was averted only by emergency action. In his review of the 2007
floods, Sir Michael Pitt made recommendations for improvements to
reservoir safety. These recommendations were addressed through
amendments to the 1975 Act made by Schedule 4 to the Flood and Water
Management Act
2010.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000004">Regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:31:37"></hs_TimeCode>-making
powers inserted into the 1975 Act by the 2010 Act include the allowance
of specific exemptions from the 1975 Act, the introduction of appeal
rights and clarity on the timing of inspections. The regulations
relating to exemptions specify what are not to be treated as large
raised reservoirs for the purposes of the 1975 Act. Exemptions from the
1975 Act include tips that are covered by mines and quarries
legislation and canals and inland navigations, and these exemptions are
maintained. Due to the new definition of a large raised reservoir as a
result of the 2010 Act, other bodies of water potentially fall within
the scope of the 1975 Act. This has led to a new exemption for road and
rail embankments with drains that have not been artificially blocked,
such as with gates. Where a road or rail embankment effectively acts as
a flood storage reservoir, it should be recognised as such and managed
accordingly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000005">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:32:46"></hs_TimeCode>

designation of a large raised reservoir as high risk and against
notices given by the 
<?notus-xml column=2?>Environment Agency either to appoint an engineer or to carry out a
recommendation of an engineer in the interests of safety.
The regulations provide that the First-tier Tribunal will hear all
appeals under the amended 1975 Act. To maintain the credibility of the
1975 Act and the efficacy of the designation regime, it is important
that the appeals mechanism is independent, efficient and comprehensive
and is a fair and cost-effective way of adjudicating any disputes. The
process for bringing an appeal is governed both by these regulations
and by the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (General Regulatory
Chamber) Rules
2009.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000006">The
regulations also set out the timings of inspections. Previously, under
the 1975 Act, all large raised reservoirs had to be supervised and
inspected, whereas the  2010 Act amends this to include only
those large raised reservoirs designated as high risk.
Transitional arrangements will be in place to ensure the smooth
introduction of these requirements. The regulations also require the
Secretary of State to review the operation and effect of these
regulations and to publish a report within five years after they come
into force. The powers to make these regulations are contained in the
amendments made by Schedule 4, which were commenced in October

Knight of Weymouth:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, anyone observing
this debate might think, based on attendance, that there is little
interest in these regulations. However, I think that this is one of
those circumstances where attendance signifies consent, and lack of
attendance signifies positive consent. I think the fact that more noble
Lords have not attended the debate simply demonstrates the extent to
which the regulations are not contentious.</hs_para>

floods of 2007 and how perilously close we came to real disaster when
emergency action averted the failure of Ulley reservoir. That was why
the previous Government, of whom I was a member, asked Sir Michael Pitt
to carry out the review, and the Pitt report recommended these
improvements to reservoir safety legislation and, in particular, this
risk-based approach. It would be extremely churlish of me to be
anything but supportive of these regulations given that they reflect
the work that was done following the Pitt review. It merely remains for
me to ask two or three questions that arise from the
regulations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000010">The
first, which might sound slightly oppositional, is straightforward. Why
has it taken so long to bring forward the regulations given that Sir
Michael Pitt carried out his review some time ago? They are dealing
with significant matters of risk in respect of flooding and we have had
a lot of flooding activity in the past 12 months. Everyone has noticed
the nature of the weather during that time and the flooding that goes
with it, so it would be helpful to know whether more could have been
done to bring these forward sooner.</hs_para>

on Regulation 3 and those items not treated as being large raised
reservoirs. As the Minister said in his opening comments, certain items
such as tips, which have been exempted as large raised reservoirs, and
other items are being added here. Assuming that some of those items
might have some high risk attached to them on a risk-based approach,
how is that risk being assessed? Who is inspecting them and how is the
risk then being raised and dealt with by the owners of those bodies of
water? If none is of high risk because of its very nature—such
as its embankments or drains—then to ask whether the risk-based
approach would not have dealt with it without this piece of legislation
is perhaps rather a pedantic, subsequential question to
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000012">Finally,
Regulation 4 deals with the right to appeal first against designation
and Regulation 5 with the right to appeal against a notice. The basis
of that appeal is to be able to go to a First-tier Tribunal. Can the
Minister update us on how much capacity the Tribunals Service has to
deal with these appeals? What is his expectation regarding the volume
of appeals? As we refer more things to the Tribunals Service, there is
a general concern that the service’s funding is not growing. I
am quite confident in saying that. I suspect that it might be
shrinking, and yet we are asking it to do more work.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:39:25"></hs_TimeCode> these matters
of public safety, which is what these regulations are dealing with, we
would certainly not want appeals to be delayed because of a backlog at
the Tribunals Service due to its lack of capacity.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052026000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000013">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:39:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is probably my most significant question. The Minister has been
assiduous in writing to me when things do not initially seem as
forthcoming as they could be, and any information that he could give us
about the Government’s assessment of the Tribunals
Service’s capacity would be very helpful. Incidentally, if an
appeal is unreasonably delayed in the Tribunals Service and an incident
then occurred, where would the liability fall? Would it fall with the
owner of the reservoir or with the Government because they did not have
sufficient capacity in the Tribunals
Service<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000014">My
final question also relates to the Tribunals Service. There was some
mention either in the impact assessment or the Explanatory Notes of
discussions that are still going on with the Tribunals Service about
how it will deal with technical matters as opposed to legal matters
when appeals are being heard. If the Minister has any update to put on
the record about those discussions that would obviously be very
helpful<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000015">To
summarise, we on this side are extremely happy to see the Government
coming forward with these regulations, although we would like them to
have happened a little quicker. There are one or two issues of concern
in terms of the tribunal arrangements for appeals, but it is right that
people should be able to appeal and it is right that it should be done
in the context of the Tribunals Service. I therefore do not have any
substantial argument with the way in which this is going forward. On
that basis, I hope that I have given the Minister enough time, by
talking a little longer, for him to give us some
answers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T15:41:30"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

taken longer than I would have liked. He was kind enough to
acknowledge, and he is right, that resources have to be prioritised. It
has been, as everyone knows, important to deal with ongoing, relatively
widespread instances of flood emergency. That simply has to take
priority and I think that everyone would acknowledge that life and

noble Lord also asked about the prioritisation of reservoirs, and if
reservoirs are excluded from this regulation then how the risk is
encompassed. Tips and so forth are covered by the mines and quarries
legislation, save for other extant arrangements there, and the Health

helpful to him. Canals are managed using risk-based management

start by setting out the background to these regulations. The Education

<?notus-xml column=5?>education or training until the end of the academic year in which they
turn 17. From 2015, that will rise to their 18th birthday. As noble
Lords will be aware, this is termed “raising the participation
age”. This does not require young people to remain in school and
they may choose an educational path that is best for them. This could

in education or training means that our young people will gain higher

giving this country a more productive and competitive workforce. Our
aim is that young people will be better educated and better prepared
for higher education and for productive, sustainable jobs. The evidence
is clear that participating in education post-16 improves young
people’s life chances. It means that they are more likely to
attain higher levels of qualifications, have increased earnings over
their lifetime, better health and improved social skills—for
instance, young people with two or more A-levels earn around 14% more

there are still a number of young people who are NEET—not in

the evidence shows that the better-educated children are pre-16, the
more likely they are to continue in education post-16. Therefore, our
reforms to the school system, increasing the freedoms of schools and
providing additional support through the pupil premium, will mean that
in the long term more young people continue in education for longer. By
increasing the number of university technical colleges and
studio schools, and supporting colleges to enrol 14 to 16

are better prepared to continue

that many young people are highly motivated by the prospect of work. We

Traineeships will offer a combination of high-quality work placements,

<?notus-xml column=6?>maths, together with other flexible training and support to suit
individual young people’s needs. We know that some young people
need additional help to overcome the barriers and difficulties that
currently prevent them from participating in education or training.
Through the youth contract we are providing intensive support for
70,000 of the most disengaged 16 and 17 year-olds with no or low
qualifications. Some young people also need financial support to enable
them to continue in education or training. Our £180 million 16

two instruments under consideration today are simple steps to ensuring
that the legislation that was passed in 2008 is still fit for purpose.
One is technical in content only. The other is in line with both the
primary legislation and feedback from public consultation and is
supportive of young people gaining experience from a range of valuable
opportunities. I will briefly address each in turn. The consequential
amendments order is made under the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children
and Learning Act 2009. That Act established the Office of
Qualifications and Examinations Regulation, commonly known as Ofqual.
This order simply updates the 2008 legislation to take account of that
Act. It is important for raising the participation age, as young people
undertaking full-time work are required to combine that with part-time
study towards a qualification that is recognised and
transferable.</hs_para>

to Participate in Education or Training (Alternative Ways of Working)
Regulations 2013 A key way for young people to meet the duty to
participate in education or training will be through getting a
full-time job and combining that with part-time education or training.
This will be an important route for young people who are motivated and
able to secure employment, while also allowing them to get rigorous
transferable qualifications. Gaining experience of employment before
the age of 18 is a key way to begin building the skills and experience
that will lead to a long, fruitful career. However, there are also
alternatives to paid work that can provide valuable experience to young
people and we would not want to prevent young people from pursuing
these activities for fear of falling foul of the
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000033">The
2008 Act makes allowance for further activities described as
“ways of working” that could be considered in the same
way as paid employment. These could be combined with part-time study to
meet the duty set out in that Act. We consulted on the possible options
available to young people in this regard, and that consultation agreed
with the three routes that are proposed in the 2008 Act. These are:
self-employment; working not for reward, for example by volunteering;
and holding a public office. In all these instances, the requirements
are the same as those set out for full-time employment in the 2008 Act.
These ways of working must be full-time and accompanied by accredited
part-time study or
training.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000034">In
summary, these regulations amend and give detail to the 2008

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her
comprehensive introduction to these statutory instruments. As she
rightly said, they bring into force legislation that we introduced in
2008, which I think, without appearing to be overly indulgent, was a
smart bit of legislation. Rather than raising the school leaving age
but the participation age took into account the fact, as the Minister
said, that not every youngster wants to stay on in full-time
education.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000036">I
want to draw out a few things raised by the Minister. She talked about
the study programmes, and I wonder whether she can come back to that in
her reply, as I am interested in that. The Minister gave a figure on
the youth contract support but unfortunately I did not have time to
note it down. Who will be employed in that? It seems that it might
refer to young people who have not been in significant employment or
education. I do not know whether it related to the
NEETs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000037">A group
of people that I am particularly interested in is those with
disabilities. I was at a specialist school that deals with autism last
Tuesday. In talking to a group of 15 and 16 year-olds when we got to
the end of the visit, it was interesting how small their chances of
employment are. I think that in their experience, they have managed to
have one or two jobs but it is really very difficult, and I wondered
whether they were going to be included in that youth contract
support.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052026000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000038">The
other questions that I wish to raise are in my general contribution. As
the Minister rightly said, we raised the participation age in the 2008
Education and Skills Act. It was a Labour Party policy. We agree that
if Britain wants to seek to maintain its competitive edge, it is
absolutely essential that we upgrade our skills base and ensure the
well trained workforce which is essential to that. We know that part of
our challenge is the long tail of poor performance within the 16 to 18
age group, so raising the participation age—as I said, it is not
the school-leaving age—is an essential part of confronting that
challenge. We are certainly not seeking to oppose these powers today
but I have a number of questions, which I would be grateful if the
Minister could answer.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052026000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000039">While we are happy to
agree that self-employment, volunteering and holding an office could
combine with part-time study to meet the duty to participate, we remain
unclear as to the precise description of holding an office. There seems
to be no explanatory guidance, so I would be grateful for some
examples. If they are not available, I am sure that the
Minister  can write. I would also be keen on an update on the
Minister’s discussions with the Department for Work and Pensions
on how the requirements for education and volunteering align with
benefits conditionality, as set out in the July 2012 consultation, and
what impact, if any, universal credit will
make.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000040">Within
the consultation, there was some concern that home schooling might be
exploited as a loophole when raising the participation age. I would be
grateful 
<?notus-xml column=8?>for the Minister’s thoughts in how this will be addressed. We saw
only last week the vulnerable situation that many young carers find
themselves in, so I would be grateful to know what special
considerations have been given to young people with caring
responsibilities. It seems clear that if we are not to repeat the
mistakes made in relation to some low value apprenticeships, which were
revealed in the Government’s system, we need a proper system of
agreements to ensure that young people are not simply engaged in
low-level activity at work but learning decent skills and having proper
training. The consultation document speaks of working with relevant
organisations to draw up such agreements. Can the Minister explain how
that will be taken forward?</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052026000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000041">Chapter 3 of Part 1 of
the Act puts duties on employers to take certain actions in respect of
young people who meet the duty by combining work with education and
training. The Minister has said that these duties will not be brought
into force at this stage and that the possibility of commencing them
will be kept under review. I would certainly like some indication of
the timetable of that review and who will be conducting it. Finally, a
series of responsibilities are placed on local authorities by this
legislation to ensure compliance. Will these apply to pupils in academy
and studio schools, and in university technical colleges?</hs_para>

challenge in raising the participation age is that we are inevitably
going to raise expectations—at least, I hope we are—that
at the end of this process the young will find a job. That is going to
be the biggest challenge, no matter who is in power, and I do not wish
to make light of it. We know of the significant numbers of young people
who are now in unemployment; it is nearly 1 million. It was
disappointing to see that if you looked at the number of
apprenticeships in the 16 to 18 year-old group, in 2012-13
that had dropped to 69,600 compared to 79,100 in 2011-12, which is a
12.1% drop. Although I pay tribute to the Government’s efforts
to increase the number of apprenticeships, there is sometimes a lot of
emphasis on the overall figure, which includes a significant number of
those aged 19 and above, whereas for us and society as a whole, the
biggest challenge is the 16 to 19
group.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13052026000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000129">4

on other occasions that one way that the Government could not only set
an example but create more apprenticeships is by public procurement.
The last time I raised that, I seem to remember the Minister telling me
that we could not do that because it was against EU legislation. I
looked at the issue and noticed that, for instance, that the UK Office
of Government guide, <I>Promoting Skills through Public
Procurement</I>, suggests that,</hs_para>

also draw attention to the fact that EU legislation did not seem to
prevent us doing that for both Crossrail and the Olympics. I urge the
Government to reconsider, because it could make an important
contribution—not only symbolic but numerical—in a vital
area. We are 
<?notus-xml column=9?>also still faced with the challenge that only a small number of
companies are participating in providing apprenticeships and work

opportunities.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13052026000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000044">There
were a lot of good intentions in the Minister’s contribution
about work experience, apprenticeships, et cetera, but if you go around
talking to young people, you know that their biggest concern, along
with participation, is whether they will find a job at the end of that
road. Make no mistake, we welcome the legislation, which follows what
we introduced. I look forward to the Minister’s
response.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Garden of Frognal" PimsId="5266" UID="13052026000154" xid="1973" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000154">Baroness
Garden of Frognal:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord for his comments

move to make to the breadth of possibilities to young people. On the
figures which he said that he had not had, the study programme is for
16 to 19 year-olds with qualifications and extended work experience. On
the youth contract, there is intensive support for 70,000 of the most
disengaged 16 and 17 year-olds. That was in my opening

the participation age will indeed be reviewed annually from spring
2014. We have not yet agreed the members of the review team, but they
will be agreed later this year. He asked about holding an office.
Obviously, that may be a bit more difficult for 16 to 17 year-olds, but
we have already had the example of someone being an adviser to a police
commissioner or a charity trustee. There are things that young people
might find, and if they do, that will count for
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000047">The
noble Lord mentioned young carers. They receive a carer’s

indeed taking place in a robust and proper
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000048">We

noble Lord also mentioned learners with learning difficulties. Of
course, we recognise that too many children and young people do not get
the support that they need and that their families have to battle for
services, but we are reforming the special needs system. That will come
through in the Children and Families Bill, which is in the other place
at the moment and coming to us later this summer. That will provide
points for debate, and we look forward to hearing the noble

to tell on apprenticeships. I will always give credit to the noble Lord
and his Government for what they did to beef up apprenticeships and
increase the numbers going through. The coalition Government have taken
that forward, with significant increases in the number of
apprenticeships. They will be looked at again in the light of the
Richard review. We are engaging more and more employers in taking 
<?notus-xml column=10?>on apprentices and some of the bigger companies such as BAE Systems, BT
and BP have well accredited schemes. Some of them have more applicants
for places than for some of our best universities. That is raising the
profile of apprenticeships and the fact that young people, their
parents and indeed their schools and careers advisers are aware of the
possibilities of apprenticeships and what an excellent way they can be
of getting into fulfilling careers. We have a great deal of work going
on in that regard and obviously we will work with the noble Lord to

contingent on government contracts. Sadly, I have to disappoint him
because I have no answer other than the one I gave him previously on
that. It is for the employers to decide how that will proceed. I do not

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></B> I have a couple of points before
the Minister sits down. Her answer on public procurement was slightly
different this time. Last time it seemed to be emphatic that there were

Government to look again. The Minister quoted the large employers. Yes,
they are good and if they were all like them we would not have a
problem, but the difficulty we face is the point that the Minister made
herself. Places are vastly oversubscribed. The demand is huge. We will
raise the demand even further when we raise the participation age. My
question to the Government is how are we going to meet that 
<?notus-xml column=11?>demand? Although the overall picture looks good, we still face the
problem that in the 16 to 19 year-old age group there is a drop. I do
not raise that to score any political point. I want the Government to

people—I go out and speak to lots of sixth formers—the

really should be straining every sinew to ensure that we give a work
experience or job opportunity to every young person. That should be the
target, and not at some distant point. If we do not do that, we will be
in danger of creating another lost generation, and a generation that
becomes disillusioned does not always respond in the most constructive
way, as we witnessed not all that long ago. Therefore, I hope that the

point to which the Minister might reply in writing. We also need to
check on the quality of training that employers provide. We know that
lots of young people are going into a job. For those who want to do so
and can get a job, that is great, but we want to make sure that every
employer who takes them on has a proper training programme laid out,
otherwise that will be another objective. I am not sure whether that
was covered in the Minister’s response. If she does not have the

question to the Minister. Chapter 2 of Part 1 of the Act places quite a
number of obligations on local authorities—in particular, the
rather difficult obligation of chasing up and identifying the young
persons not meeting the Section 2 duty. Guidance is to be published on
the Department for Education website, but I wonder when it is likely to
be published and what proposals it is likely to make. Given that the
diversity of schooling now means that it is not necessarily so easy to
chase up what young people are doing and how they are participating, I
think that this is going to be quite a difficult task for local
authorities.</hs_para>

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills (Viscount Younger of Leckie):</Member></B>
My Lords, the purpose of this order is to seek
authority for the Engineering Construction Industry 
<?notus-xml column=13?>Training Board—the ECITB—to impose a levy on employers in
their industry in 2014, and this will relate to an assessment of
employers’ payroll in the 2012-13 financial year. The prime
purpose is to meet the skills needs of the
industry.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000066">I believe that it is
worth spending a little time elaborating on the reasons why there is a
statutory training levy in the engineering construction industry. The
engineering construction industries construct and maintain the power
and utilities essential to  the UK’s infrastructure. The
industries include coal and gas power, offshore oil and gas, chemicals
and pharmaceuticals, steel and metal smelting, nuclear power and
renewable energy. The construction and maintenance requirements for
these industries call for a mobile, flexible and highly skilled
workforce. It is the employers in these industries who have, since
1991, come together to support collective action through the levy to
develop the workforce, manage risks and address skills
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000067">Similar
statutory arrangements are in place for the wider construction
industry, which operates under a separate levy order passed in
Parliament in 2012. The Government have made, and continue to make,
major investments in skills and training. However, while the Government
have a role in setting the framework for success, employers need to be
in the driving seat if we are to equip the workforce with the skills
that employers need. The ECITB has a central role in training the
workforce and supporting the industry to achieve sustainable growth. In
doing this, the Government look to the ECITB to minimise bureaucracy
and ensure that support to employers is relevant and accessible. The
ECITB is employer-led, rather than government-led, and its role is to
encourage the provision of adequate training of employees and
prospective employees in its industry. It provides a wide range of
services, including setting occupational standards, developing
vocational qualifications and delivering apprenticeships, as well as
paying direct grants to employers who carry out training to approved
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000068">Employers
in the engineering construction industry continue to support a
statutory framework for training. The ECITB is a model of the
successful application of such a framework, and the order that we are
considering today will enable these statutory levy arrangements to
continue. I welcome this order as evidence that employers in the
engineering construction industry want to continue to invest in the
skills of their workforce.</hs_para>

under the provisions of the Industrial Training Act 1982. That Act
permits the ECITB to raise a levy on employers so that the costs of
training are shared more evenly between companies in the industry. This
order gives effect to proposals submitted to us for a levy to be
collected by the ECITB in 2014. It is a condition of the ITA that a
levy order is made affirmative as a resolution in the House where it
involves the imposition of a levy estimated to be in excess of 1% of
emoluments—that is, essentially wage costs—for some
employers.</hs_para>

only if the Secretary of State is satisfied, first, that the amount of
levy is appropriate in the circumstances; secondly, that
the  
<?notus-xml column=14?>proposals are necessary to encourage adequate training in the industry;
and, thirdly, that the previous levy order received support from the
majority of employers and the levy rates remain unchanged. I confirm
that my right honourable friend in the other place, the Secretary of
State for Business, Innovation and Skills, is satisfied that these
conditions have been met.</hs_para>

the ECITB to include proposals for exempting small employers from the
levy. This order therefore provides that small firms will be exempt if
their expenditure on payroll and sub-contract labour is below a certain
threshold that the industry considers to be appropriate, and I will
come to the details of the thresholds in a moment. Those firms that are
below the threshold and exempt from paying the levy are still able to
benefit from grants and other support from the ECITB, and indeed many
of them do
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000072">The ECITB
does not propose to make any changes to its levy rates or small firms
exemption thresholds. The rate for site employees will remain at 1.5%
of total payroll, plus net expenditure on sub-contract labour.
Employers who spend £275,000 or less on payroll costs for
on-site employees will not have to pay the levy. The rate in respect of
off-site employees—often referred to as “head
office” employees—is 0.18% of total payroll, plus net
expenditure on sub-contract labour. Employers who spend £1
million or less in respect of payroll costs for off-site employees will
not have to pay the levy.</hs_para>

establishments which are considered to be leviable by the ECITB, it is
expected that around 35% will be exempted from paying the levy. For the
ECITB, the one-year proposal is expected to raise around £20
million in levy income. The Committee will note that the ECITB order
covers a one-year period. The Industrial Training Act requires ITBs to
submit proposals—and I quote—“from time to
time”. These proposals may provide for levies to be imposed for
a period of up to three
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000074">The
ECITB has proposed a one-year levy order because, in view of the
current economic conditions, employers considered that flexibility
should be retained on the issue of future levy rates. It is anticipated
that next year the ECITB levy order will also cover a one-year period,
with the intention of realigning with the Construction Industry
Training Board to a three-year levy cycle from 2015 onwards.</hs_para>

from previous debates that the ECITB exists because of the support it
receives from employers and employer interest groups in its sectors. As
I indicated earlier, there is a firm belief that without the ECITB
there would be a serious deterioration of the quantity and quality of
training in the industry, leading to a deficiency in skills levels.
Consultation with the industry in 2012 demonstrated that there is
strong support among employers for a levy system, with 71% of employers
liable to pay a levy in 2014 supporting the levy arrangements. Only 2%
of employers indicated that they opposed the levy. Those that did not
express a view are not counted as supporting the  
<?notus-xml column=15?>levy. This draft order will enable the ECITB to continue to carry out
its vital training responsibilities, and I commend it to the
Committee.</hs_para>

Young of Norwood Green:</Member></hs_speaker> I thank the Minister for
his comprehensive contribution. I must admit that I found it
interesting because, by mentioning all the different industries, he
stressed their importance. As he rightly said, this is a mobile,
flexible and highly skilled workforce. Our one concern is the point
that he raised near the end of his contribution: because of the
somewhat fragile state of the economy, which is clearly impacting on
these industries, they are going for only a one-year levy. I do not
expect the Minister to have the answer to this but I should be
interested to know what impact this will have on the number of
apprenticeships that are likely to be offered. These are highly skilled
industries and these apprenticeships are highly sought after, so it is
a bit worrying that they have decided to go for only one
year.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13052026000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000077">It was
interesting as well that the Government are proposing an alignment with
the ECITB in 2015, which is probably a step in the right direction. I
could not help reflecting that, in looking at that level of support
from the employers, a levy is perhaps one way of ensuring that all
employers contribute to training in industry. It gets us away from the
idea that so many employers have. They seem to think that they do not
have to bother and can poach their skills from other employers.
However, with those couple of questions and that slight caveat, we
offer our support to this statutory
instrument.</hs_para>

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord Young, for
his general support for this order. I will indeed refer back to him in
writing on the one-year levy and the impact that it has on
apprenticeships. I should make the point that the support that the
ECITB is giving for skills is over and above the other schemes and
initiatives that this Government are taking, which the noble Lord will
be aware of. I listened in briefly to the previous debate in this
Committee concerning apprenticeships, and it is the case that the
previous Government indeed started off much on the apprenticeship
scheme. This will add to that. It is pleasing to note that
apprenticeship numbers are holding up and, indeed, increasing. There
were 849 apprentices recruited in 2012, a figure which I hope I can
improve upon with an increase as time goes on.</hs_para>

about apprenticeships is that they remain the prime route into the
industry; the noble Lord raised this point. The ECITB supports and
promotes apprenticeships to employers. That is a very important part of
what it does. It also provides financial support and grants for
apprenticeships. In 2012, demand for apprenticeships was much tighter
than expected, indicating rising employer confidence and additional
demand from employers—in particular, in the nuclear sector. I
know that I could say more about apprenticeships but I am very pleased
that there is overall support for this order. I commend it to the
Committee.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the draft order makes changes to the cash
ratio deposit scheme, which is how the Bank of England funds its
monetary policy and financial stability functions. Under the Bank of
England Act 1998, banks and building societies of a certain size are
required to place a proportion of their eligible deposits in a
non-interest-bearing account in the Bank of England. The Bank of
England then invests these deposits in interest-bearing assets,
specifically gilts, and the return it makes funds its monetary policy
and financial stability functions.</hs_para>

Government continue to believe that the cash ratio deposit scheme is
the right way to fund the important policy work of the Bank. The
operation of the cash ratio deposit scheme means that the Bank’s
income is subject to changes in two variables: first, changes in the
gilt rate; and secondly, the size of deposits eligible for the scheme,
which is largely driven by the performance of the banking sector. Over
the past five-year period, both of these have been lower than expected,
which has caused a shortfall in funding for the Bank. The Government
seek to address this shortfall by recalibrating the parameters of the
cash ratio deposit scheme to current economic conditions.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052026000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000100">Specifically,
the order increases the proportion of deposits that eligible financial
institutions are required to deposit at the Bank of England from 0.11%
to 0.18%. It also increases the total amount of deposits that an
institution has to hold to be eligible for the scheme from £500
million to £600 million. These changes, when taken alongside
efficiency savings to be made by the Bank, aim to ensure that the Bank
of England’s income is able to cover the costs of its policy
functions over the next five years.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052026000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000101">The
Government have come to this conclusion after conducting their
five-yearly review of the cash ratio deposit scheme. The parameters for
the scheme were last set out in 2008, and, of course, economic
circumstances have changed significantly since that time. I shall set
out some of the more detailed findings of this review.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=20?><hs_para UID="13052026000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000102">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:41:46"></hs_TimeCode>
total costs of the Bank of England’s monetary policy and
financial stability functions between 2008 and 2013 are expected to be
around £600 million. The income that the Bank of England is
expected to receive over the same period is only £520 million.
This will generate a shortfall of £80 million, which the Bank
will have to recoup from its reserves, resulting in a reduction in the
dividend that the Bank passes over to the Exchequer. This has largely
arisen because the return the Bank has received on its investments over
the past five years has been lower than expected. At the time of the
previous review, the Bank had estimated that its investments would
generate a return of 5% based on market expectations of gilt yields in
2008. However, the Bank’s average return is now expected to be
about 4.25% between 2008 and
2013.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000103">In
addition, the level of deposits that the Bank has received under the
CRD scheme has grown slower than expected. In 2008, these were expected
to grow at 4.5%. They have instead grown by just under 2%, reflecting
the performance of the banking sector during the financial crisis.
Should no action be taken, the review found that the outlook for the
coming period is much worse. The projected costs of the Bank’s
monetary policy and financial stability functions over the next five
years are expected to rise to £670 million. This increase is
driven by the costs of additional responsibilities that the Bank is
taking on, including the supervision of clearing houses and security
settlement systems, macroprudential regulation and the setting up of
the Financial Policy Committee to identify, monitor and take action to
reduce risks to the financial
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000104">In
contrast, the income that the Bank will receive will fall further
because market expectations of gilt yields remain low over the next
five years. This means that if no action is taken, the Bank’s
income will be £440 million and its costs will be about
£670 million in the next five-year period, generating a
£230 million shortfall. In meeting that shortfall, the Bank is
playing its part. It has committed to bearing down on its costs. In
particular, it will seek efficiency savings through establishing a
shared corporate services model with the Prudential Regulation
Authority. The Bank’s budget for the next five-year period takes
these savings into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:41:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13052026000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000134">4.45

opportunities for the Bank to make further efficiency savings. These
potential savings have not yet been incorporated into the Bank’s
budget and are likely to reduce the Bank’s running costs further

model with the PRA has been established. As part of this review, the
Treasury will consider whether there are implications for the
Bank’s funding requirements and, in turn, the cash ratio
scheme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:44:53"></hs_TimeCode>. For the
time being, however, the changes set out in the order before us today

Tunnicliffe:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for presenting
this order. I would almost say that the scheme is essentially a tax on
banks and effectively a charge—a way by which the Bank of
England receives appropriate revenues to support its policy activities.
My understanding from the paperwork—I briefly read the
report—is that in essence the revenue from this scheme has
proved to be significantly less than predicted. Essentially, the Bank
got its forecasts wrong, and therefore it needs to adjust the
parameters of the scheme to raise its income over the next five-year
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:47:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government announced the setting up of a review on 18 September
2012. I just wonder how thorough this review has been, because it
concludes that this scheme is the best way of going about this but
there is little argumentation. It seems to be quite an elaborate
scheme. Banks and building societies funding this policy activity is an
entirely reasonable idea but the scheme does seem elaborate and I
believe that it would bear a more careful review.
Therefore<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:48:13"></hs_TimeCode>, my
first question is: in how much depth have the Bank and the Treasury
looked at this scheme of requiring banks to place non-interest-bearing
deposits with the Bank of England to fund the Bank of England? How much
study has there been into whether this is the best way of doing
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

levy—a de facto levy—is pretty substantial. As the
Explanatory Memorandum points out, the expected revenue will rise from
£436 million if the parameters have not changed to £657

increase<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:49:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

consultation that there has been no great squeal from the banks which
will be paying it, and therefore one must assume either that these sums
of money are lost in the roundings of such institutions or that the
banks feel that the increase is fair. Nevertheless, it calls into
question the efficiency of the Bank of England and whether, in what I
loosely call the 2013 review, the efficiency has been properly
considered.</hs_para>

have a very open mind on this. I think that the Bank of England should
be as efficient as possible. Equally, however, given the tremendous
change in circumstances and the responsibilities of the Bank of
England, not only do we need an assurance that the Bank of England is
as efficient as possible; we need an assurance that the resources are
adequate to meet the exceptionally increased responsibilities now being
placed on it. Has the Court of the Bank of England carefully considered
the funding over the next five years, and can we be assured that the
court feels that it is adequate for these new
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000115">I
turn to my final question. This number might be too small but, again,
it is in the roundings. The Explanatory Memorandum says that the larger
institutions will have to top up their deposits with the Bank to the
tune of £1.558 billion. To a mere mortal that is quite a
substantial sum. I do not understand from the EM the extent to which
this sum impacts on the balance sheet and capital reserves of the banks
and the extent to which that will have an impact on their lending
capability. The whole of industry, and in that sense the nation, is
looking to the banks to lend more, to create more liquidity and to
increase industrial activity. It is crucial that we do not see any
significant impairment in the banks by the changed parameters in this
scheme.</hs_para>

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord. I will
attempt to deal with his questions. He asked about the basis of the
scheme. There was a significant review in 2008 which considered
whether  a fee-based approach would be a better way of funding
the Bank. That review concluded that the benefits arising from the
Bank’s activities accrued to the whole banking sector and that
it was not possible to apportion the service being received in that way
to individual firms. That remains the case.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13052026000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000118">We<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
asked the banks whether they agreed with that. Some 154 organisations
were proactively invited to respond to the Treasury's consultation
which ran earlier in the year, in February and March, and the Treasury
received three responses. Broadly speaking, the responses were
sympathetic to what was being sought. I think that we can take it that
this is one of those cases where the banking community is not up in
arms about what is
proposed<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052026000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520-gc0001.htm#13052026000119">The
noble Lord asked about efficiency and whether this will be properly
reviewed, whether resources are adequate and whether the Bank is
operating efficiently. The background is that the Bank’s
real-term budget is not any higher now than it was in 2000-01, so there
has not been a drift. It is fair to say that the Bank has not been
subject to significant savings over the past year or two. However, the
Government’s view is that the past year or two has been a period
of almost unrivalled change in the financial services and regulatory
architecture and in the role that we wish the Bank to undertake. 
<?notus-xml column=23?>Therefore, this was not the time to have a root-and-branch look at
efficiency, particularly given that many of the efficiencies that we
are talking about will be realised only when the PRA is up and running
and it is possible to see how well the joint operation of the
back-office activities is going and how much can be saved in that
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-20T16:55:10"></hs_TimeCode>. Between now
and the next review, the Treasury and the Bank itself will look at
efficiency afresh in the light of the new arrangements which are
happening all around them and the new responsibilities that the Bank
itself has taken on in terms of the FPC and direct regulatory roles.
Yes, we are concerned about efficiency, but we need to get the balance
right and we will be looking very carefully at that over the next year
or two.</hs_para>

asked about the effect of the cash ratio deposits on the Bank’s
ability to lend. The cash ratio deposits continue to count as assets
for 
<?notus-xml column=24?>the financial institutions making them so they do not have an impact on
the capital requirements. Obviously, however, they represent an
opportunity cost as the cash is tied up with the Bank without a return.
Nevertheless, as he suggested, this opportunity cost is relatively
small. The best estimates of the extra return they will forgo is about
£220 million and this will be split between 150 institutions,
albeit not equally. Although this is a not-insignificant sum, it is
insignificant compared with the £13.8 billion that the banks
have drawn from the Funding for Lending scheme. Taken together, the
banks are bearing a modest cost. I think that that  is why they
were content when we undertook the consultation.</hs_para>

be positively assessed in the 2012 scheme, resulting in maintenance
flowing to these children for the first time); we will then end
liability on cases that are not currently compliant, again because
there is no current payment arrangement to disrupt; followed by any
cases that are compliant but not subject to enforcement action,
starting with those cases managed clerically. Finally, we will end
liability on CSA cases that are in legal enforcement (and where money
is flowing) or where money is only flowing as a result of an enforced

benefits from and contributes to the UK’s position as a global
leader in financial services. The UK is seen as having a strong tax and
regulatory environment that supports a competitive financial centre.
The size of the industry relative to the UK economy means the UK is
resilient to financial shocks and has in the Bank of England a strong
and credible lender of last resort. Consumers are in turn protected by

UK has established effective arrangements for protecting consumers of

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs (Lord De Mauley):</Member> During the
period 19-27 April, parts of the treatment process at Little Marlow
sewage treatment works failed and sewage was discharged directly into
the River Thames. This had passed through the storm tanks so some of
the solid excrement had settled out before it was discharged. The
Environment Agency asked Thames Water to remove foam and other visible
debris from the
river.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052030000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520w0001.htm#13052030000144">The
Environment Agency met senior managers from Thames Water on 25 April to
discuss the incidents at the sewage treatment works. Thames Water
produced  
<?notus-xml column=38?>a process recovery action plan that includes using tankers to suck
sewage foam and debris from the river, litter picking to clear up
debris from trees and banks and removing debris caught on the outfall
grills. All this work is ongoing as part of the recovery
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13052030000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130520w0001.htm#13052030000145">The
