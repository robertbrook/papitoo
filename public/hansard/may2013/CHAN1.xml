back in 1996, as I approached my first re-election, my son heard his
41-year-old father described in a BBC documentary as a
“middle-aged politician”. That phrase resonated in his
eight-year-old mind. For years after, his birthday cards came not to
“Dad”, but to the three-letter acronym
“MAP”. Children certainly keep you grounded. At the time,
I thought it was a premature description; now, I have moved beyond it.
So, with inevitable regrets, I have decided to leave this place at the
next election. [<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps>

King Edward I cornered the rebellious de Montfort and his army in the
bend of the River Avon at Evesham. In victory, Edward exacted a heavy
price. De Montfort’s body was dismembered and his head, with his
most intimate organs stuffed into his mouth, delivered as a gift to the
wife of Lord Mortimer, one of the architects of Edward’s
victory. I do hope she liked it. His head severed, his intimate organs

conservatism for his age, part of a long one nation tradition. That one
nation tradition inspired Peter Walker, as it has inspired me. It runs
though the Conservative party like the lettering in seaside rock, and
it is by holding fast to that tradition that my party will be trusted

am sure that most of us, whether we saw it in person or watched it on
television, will have enjoyed the pageantry of the state opening of
Parliament. My first experience of royal London was as a school boy,
when I stayed with my grandmother’s sisters in north London in
the late 1970s and early 1980s. My Aunty Eve and Aunty Edith lived in
Finchley. I was somewhat surprised, when walking down the high street,
to see framed photographs of the local Member of Parliament at the
time, Mrs Thatcher. It was something of a culture shock for
a valleys boy from the mining village of Abercynon in south Wales. I do
not know, Mr Speaker, whether there are such framed photographs of you
or, indeed, whether there are framed photographs of the current Prime
Minister in his constituency, but I remember at the Liberal Democrat
spring conference in Sheffield a couple of years ago being somewhat
startled to be confronted by enormous billboards paid for by
Unite—an organisation which, if I may say so, funds quite a lot
of mischief around the country—that were adorned with a curious
image of a creature called Cleggzilla who was trampling public services

Thatcher—this will not surprise you, Mr Speaker, or anyone
else—is certainly not my political hero. My political hero is
one of the other contenders for the greatest Prime Minister of the 20th
century: Lloyd George. I first saw a statue of Lloyd George by
Caernarfon castle and I visited the library and museum about him at
Llanystumdwy—another boyhood holiday destination, Butlins in
Pwllheli in north Wales, which is perhaps not quite so familiar to most
members of the Cabinet. Lloyd George and Asquith laid the foundations
of the welfare state, including the old age pension. I am therefore
delighted that one of the key announcements in today’s
Queen’s Speech is a further radical reform of the state pension
that will correct an injustice that has been within the system for many
decades for those who stay at home to look after their children. I am
also delighted that the single-tier state pension is to be taken

Minister and I were born within 48 hours of each other. For the
avoidance of doubt, he is the older of the two, but I can see from this
vantage point that genetics have been kinder to him than they have to
me, particularly in the tonsorial department, both in colour and cover.
While our family and school circumstances were quite different, we must
have had similar cultural reference points and experiences during the
1970s and ’80s. I believe that he was a fan of The
Smiths—though I understand that the feeling is not entirely
mutual—while I preferred Duran Duran and 
<?notus-xml column=10?>ABBA, with my favourite song being “Dancing Queen”, which

many people raised the issue of immigration during the campaign. The
Government’s proposals are limited measures that they have
announced before, but the Opposition will look at them. However, I want
to mention one very important measure missing from the immigration
Bill. The Bill fails to tackles the issues of jobs and pay, which are
at the heart of people’s concerns. The problem is the employers
who use cheap labour, through both illegal and legal migration, to
exploit and undercut workers who are already here. Let us be frank.
Right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House will know of
many examples brought to them by constituents. There has been only one
prosecution since 2010 for failure to pay the minimum wage, but that
does not reflect the reality across the country. We will therefore seek
to amend the immigration Bill to take action on the problems of
employers not paying the minimum wage; recruitment agencies that use
only overseas labour; and slum landlords using overcrowded housing
for—again—both legal and illegal migrants. There is
nothing on that last problem in the

of what we just heard from the Opposition, there are over
1.2 million more people now working in the private sector,
more than 1 million new apprenticeships and a quarter of a million
fewer people on out-of-work benefits than when this Government came to
office. In direct contrast to what the right hon. Gentleman said,
instead of presiding over a banking bust as he did, we are, for the
first time, regulating our banks properly and separating high street
banking from investment banking. That is just the start of clearing up
the mess we were left. There is only so much we can do in three years
to clear up the mess of the past 13 years. The Queen’s Speech
sets out the next vital steps forward. This Government have a solid
record of being on the side of those who work hard and want to get
on.</hs_Para>

the Leader of the Opposition did, let me briefly pay tribute to those
from this House who passed away in the last parliamentary Session. The
House lost two of its most respected and popular Members. Malcolm Wicks
was a real gentleman, a man of enormous integrity and compassion. He
served the House with great distinction for 20 years. His expertise on
energy earned him great respect on all sides of this House. He was well
known for his willingness to work across the political divide, although
I gather that even he wondered whether things had gone a bit too far
when his grandson was named Cameron. As the Leader of the Opposition
said, he showed extraordinary courage in fighting a long illness at a
relatively young age. He will be missed by everyone who knew
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:26:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050835000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0001.htm#13050835000186">Sir
Stuart Bell was another of Parliament’s great characters. He was
rightly honoured for his services to this House, and was dedicated to
the House of Commons

Second Church Estates Commissioner. As the Leader

Me”. We do not know whether that was true, but the House really
did love him, and he is sorely missed on all sides.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:27:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff). He made a great speech
and, rightly, spoke with huge power about the importance of
engineering. I have looked long and hard to try and find something
about my hon. Friend. He is a clean living man with a relatively
spotless record, but I have turned up one dirty secret. As he said, he
started his career as an adviser to Peter Walker. My hon. Friend was so
keen to succeed him in his Worcestershire constituency that he did
everything and anything for his political master: he wrote his
speeches, collected his shopping, cooked his dinner and organised his
social life—he even babysat for his children. I can now reveal
his secret: he even changed the nappies of his predecessor’s
son, my hon. Friend the Member for Worcester (Mr Walker),
who<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:27:58"></hs_TimeCode> is now
sitting next to him. We will not ask for a demonstration, but that does

hon. Friend spoke movingly about the support of his wife and family
during his parliamentary career, and I am sure that all of us would
want to echo that sentiment about the incredible love and support we
receive from our own families. There is another lesser known fact about
my hon. Friend: he simply will not leave a telephone unanswered. On the
campaign trail in the 2005 election, he walked past a call box and
found that the phone was ringing, and so picked it up. However, when

me turn to the seconder of the Gracious Speech, who, I did not know
until today, is virtually my twin. As my hon. Friend the Member for
Bristol West (Stephen Williams) said, he was born in the valleys in the
heart of south Wales. He is the first Liberal Democrat to be elected as
a Member of Parliament in Bristol in three-quarters of a century, but
needless to say, in true Liberal Democrat style, he billed himself as
the local candidate. In his time in the House he has already done
admirable work in fighting homophobia, and I thought that what the
Leader of the Opposition said about that was absolutely right. He has
won an award from Cancer Research UK, and he is an assiduous Member of
the House. However, he does not always pick the winner. I have done a
little research. He was Chris Huhne’s agent during his
leadership campaign against the right hon. and learned Member for North
East Fife (Sir Menzies Campbell), but he did then switch to the Deputy
Prime Minister during his leadership campaign against Chris
Huhne—although I note that he now calls him
“Cleggzilla”, which I thought was an interesting career
move.</hs_Para>

said that he was looking for a soulmate. I can reveal that he did not
find one when he went to the United States on a parliamentary exchange
with a member of Congress. He had wanted to shadow someone from the
liberal wing of the Democratic party, but ended up with a Tea party
Republican from Alabama, which is home, Members will be pleased to
know, of the Crimson Tide. So he spent a few days with someone who
opposes all regulation of greenhouse gases, opposes all recognition of
same-sex marriage, and is backed by the National Rifle Association. I
have looked into this deeply. The Congressman in question also wants to
establish a human colony on the moon, although history does not relate
whether he came to that conclusion before or after meeting my hon.

There is a very serious point here. If we borrow more, spend more, and

interest rates that this Government have earned. Let us be clear about

of the Queen’s Speech is a commitment to get behind the
aspiration of people who work hard, save hard and do the right thing.
The pensions Bill, which, by the way, is the biggest reform of the
state pension for 50 years, did not merit a single mention from the
Leader of the Opposition. The Bill marks a major shift towards
encouraging saving in our country. Under the current system, many
people are discouraged from saving during their working life. Why? It
is because the more they save, the less pension credit they will get. A
single-tier pension, at about £144 a week, changes that. It will
take hundreds of thousands of people in our country out of the means
test, and it will give people the certainty to know that the savings
they make when they work will benefit them when they retire.</hs_Para>

problem that can discourage saving is the fact that in so many cases
people’s homes are taken away to pay their care bills. The
family that has saved is asked to pay for care; the family that has not
saved gets all this for free. I do not believe that is fair. This
Queen’s Speech makes an historic move to put a cap on individual
contributions to pay for social care. Combined with changes in the

working in takeaways or as security guards. In the

what has created the anger and unease— I think this

believe that we live in a country where the majority of the million
young people who are out of work desperately want the chance to work,
to realise their potential and to fulfil their ambition? Mothers,
fathers, young and older men and women come to all our surgeries with a
sense of growing desperation that they are running out of solutions to
the circumstances in which they now feel themselves to
be.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0001.htm#13050838000004">So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T15:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>
these are the challenges, and many of the remedies are very simple.
When we were in government, we demonstrated that people did not have to
languish on jobseeker’s allowance for weeks into months. If we
apply what we know—that for every week people are out of work,
it gets harder for them to get back into work—and if we provide
people with support and retraining, and maintain their confidence that
they will get a job, the chances are that they will get off benefits
more quickly. But if we hollow out the services that are designed to
achieve that change and galvanise that human ambition, people are on

observed—and this is the warning to those who seek to dismantle
a universal welfare state that has at different times of our lives

press hard on the paradox that £800 million is being taken away
from local authorities’ ability to fund social care at a time
when the responsibilities and burden on families are increasing. It is
very hard to find those families who would not prefer their elderly
relatives to be loved and looked after in their own homes. Therefore,
that should not just be the rhetorical aim of the policy; it should be 
<?notus-xml column=30?>the organisational and administrative means by which
that hope is realised. Again, that is not difficult, but we must start
with the individual and their needs and build the structure and
organisation of the service around them, rather than, as so many
elderly people find is their lot, making their needs conform to
predetermined rules that have little to do with their
circumstances.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0001.htm#13050838000014"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:01:52"></hs_TimeCode>Therefore,
it is through the welfare state, and by increasing the responsibility
of employers in relation to the living wage and by recognising that
good care for people at home means building relationships and relevant
support around the individual, that the source of help might begin to
match the circumstances of individual families and their needs. That is
the only way in which confidence can be rebuilt. I am intensely proud
of the efforts of so many Labour councils, in particular, across the
country that are pioneering approaches to that. A Queen’s Speech

meeting the European Union obligations on the freedom and movement of

people can come in to take a job, that would not make them eligible to
receive a welfare or top-up benefit of any kind, and that it would not
give them automatic entitlement to a lot of fringe benefits for their
wider family. It should be the free movement of workers, not the free
movement of benefit-seekers. I believe that the contributory principle
is enforced in other parts of the EU, so why do we not have a rule that

that is of great interest to the trade union movement and the Labour
party, as well as to the rest of us, is the impact that high volumes of
migration have had on wages. Because Britain has been such a welcoming
home to so many people, it has seen a large number of migrants from the
rest of Europe. That has undoubtedly acted as a damper on wage levels
at the lower end of the market. Often, people of great talent and skill
come in and do jobs well beneath their skill level for very low wages
because they are better than the wages where they come from. Some of
that is a good thing, but too much of it creates enormous difficulties
because it means that people who have been here for many years or were
born here cannot get a job, the overall level of wages is rather low
and living standards are not as high as we would like. That causes

final point is about Europe. I know that the Prime Minister is not keen
to have a long debate on Europe. The trouble is that Europe is no
longer a single subject; it is about the life that we lead. If we want
to be sure that we can control eligibility to our welfare system, we
have to sort out European welfare issues. If we want to extradite
people from Britain, we need to sort out the European Court of Human
Rights and will soon have to sort out the European Court of Justice as
well, because there is an important European constraint on the power of
Governments to act in that area. If we want to have cheap energy, we
may well need to change European energy policy as well as our own. We
can make immediate progress through derogations and permissions, but it
would be far better to change the overall energy policy, because the
whole of Europe is being damaged by its dear energy strategy, which
allows America, Asia and others to take the jobs and markets that we
need. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:18:19"></hs_TimeCode> need to

have been a few comments, particularly from Opposition Members,
suggesting it is a rather thin Queen’s Speech, containing not
many Bills, but one of its meatier measures is the pensions Bill, which
will set up a single-tier state pension. I hope you do not mind, Mr
Speaker, if I spend all my time talking about that Bill, partly because
my Select Committee, the Work and Pensions Committee, was asked to
carry out the pre-legislative scrutiny. It is the one Bill in the
Queen’s Speech that is greatly relevant to my Committee’s
work, 
<?notus-xml column=35?>and I understand it will be published tomorrow, so today is my last
chance to record some of the Committee’s observations. I
understand that the Government’s response to our report will be
published as a Command Paper at the end of the week. I suspect that
both the Bill and the Command Paper have already gone to the printer,
so what I say this afternoon will probably not change the
Government’s intention, but it is worth rehearsing some of the
arguments that my Committee found important enough for the Government
to take into account during the deliberations on the Bill in both
Houses<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:20:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0001.htm#13050838000040">Why
is the Bill so important? Anybody who is under state pension age as of
April 2016 will be affected by it. The only people who will not be
affected by the introduction of the single-tier state pension are those
who will have already reached their pensionable age. The fact that 2016
is the year in question is a bit of a bone of contention, because when
my Committee undertook its scrutiny and asked for evidence from a range
of people, including the industry, individuals and anybody who wanted
to have a say, we thought that the starting date would be April 2017.
When we took oral evidence, including from
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:21:47"></hs_TimeCode> Minister of
State, Department for Work and Pensions, the hon. Member for Thornbury
and Yate (Steve
Webb<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:21:47"></hs_TimeCode>), at the
end of our inquiry, we still thought that the implementation date would
be April 2017. It came as a bit of a shock, and was a wee bit to our
annoyance, that the Chancellor announced in the Budget that the
implementation date was to come forward a year to April 2016.</hs_Para>

interrogated the Minister thoroughly about whether even April 2017 was
an achievable time scale or would slip, because we thought it was a
pretty tight time scale in which to implement the changes. It therefore
came as a bit of a shock to discover that the Government hoped to do it
a year sooner. We had not been in a position to ask the industry and
employers, in particular, whether they would be ready to implement the
changes in
2016<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:22:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0001.htm#13050838000042">Notwithstanding
the fact that we generally welcome the introduction of a single-tier
state pension, it is inevitable and obvious that the Government have
continued to roll out auto-enrolment, for which they should be
commended. Given that more and more people will have their own
second-tier occupational pension, some kind of reform of the first-tier
basic state pension has become almost imperative. However, it will not
be easy to get from the extremely complicated and convoluted pensions
landscape of today, which has a second tier through the state
earnings-related pension scheme or
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T16:23:40"></hs_TimeCode> state second

the Government have brought forward the implementation date by a year,

who have already made decisions about their retirement. At the moment,
someone can qualify for a full state pension after 30 years of national
insurance contributions. The Bill increases that to 35 years, but there
is already a group of people who have decided to retire although they
have not reached pensionable age. They will not necessarily be in a

before they reach the new single-tier pension.

about that in terms of the wives of expats, but it was possibly because
a large number of those who will be affected by this measure live
abroad. The measure will, of course, also affect women in this country.
That seems to have come as a complete surprise to many and perhaps
explains why a lot of people think they will be better off under the
new system when in fact they will not because their spouse will not
qualify for any of the new derived rights. Basically, what used to be

position who are within 15 years of State Pension Age should be able to
retain this right. We recommend that the Government assesses and

reason we chose the period of 15 years from retirement was that it had
to be more than 10 years. The Bill says seven or 10 years, but the
Committee recommends that it should state anything up to 10 years,
because people will probably need to have 10 years’ worth of
contributions before they get any state pension—they will get
nothing for less than 10 years’ worth of contributions. The
Committee believe that people within 15 years of retirement with no
national insurance contribution, who would have expected to get their
pension through their spouse, should be protected, and that there
should be transitional arrangements for them. Anyone further away can

Anne Begg:</Member></B> The Committee did not say that we were against
the abolition of derived rights in principle for future pensioners. We
accept the Government’s argument that people should have a state
pension in their own right, and that they should accrue their own
credits to get it. The consequence is that there will be no married
woman’s allowance in future. The problem I have addressed is how
we get from the current position to that one without being unfair on
the group of women who are within 15 years of reaching their
pensionable age. As the Bill stands—we hope it might change by
tomorrow—that group of women will get nothing from April 2016.
The Committee believes that that is a particularly harsh cliff edge. We
have no problems with what happens in future. Because women
work or because of changes made by the previous Government in how
national insurance can be credited for caring—not only for
children, but for disabled adults or elderly relatives—women are
more likely to have credits towards their own pension, which previous
generations did not have. We accept that the world and society have
changed and that, as a result, women who have not been in this country
and who have not been in a position to build up credits will not get a
pension in the long
run.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0001.htm#13050838000056">The
Government face a problem in getting over to people exactly what the
pensions Bill means. They have concentrated on saying that the new
arrangements  
<?notus-xml column=38?>are much simpler and easier to understand, which is
understandable. They have said, “The new single-tier pension
will be £144, and that’s it. That’s all you need
to know.” However, as a result of that simplification of the
message, people have got the wrong end of the stick with regard to what
it means in their individual cases. That is why it is crucial that the
Government think again on a clear communication strategy. That should
start as soon as possible, and not wait until the Bill has become an
Act of Parliament. In anything to do with pensions, planning is so long
term that people have to be sure about what they may expect. If things
are going to change, people have to know they are going to change. That
is especially true of the group of women born in 1952 and 1953, as they
have suffered a double whammy with the increase in the state pension
age. Many of them are worried that they will lose out, but they may
not. The point is that they do not know, and the Government have not
been able to given them enough information or explain what will
happen.</hs_Para>

got a letter from a lady who was convinced that she will get only
£144 a week because she will reach pension age after April 2016.
She has paid SERPS all her life and she is convinced that the
Government will steal her SERPS from her. She does not know that she
will get whichever is higher—SERPS or the single-tier pension.
One gentleman thinks that it is really unfair that he has paid SERPS
all his life, but will get only £144, whereas his next-door
neighbour, who was contracted out and gets an occupational
pension—and has been paying less national insurance—will
also get £144, but of course that is not true. The person who
has been contracted out will lose out, depending how the calculation
goes. The calculation is a complicated one and the headline message has
continued to be that everyone will get £144 for their state
pension, so many people think that the introduction of the new scheme
is unfair.</hs_Para>

that initially some people who had already reached pension age were
keen to get on to the new system until they realised that they would
not necessarily be much better off. They are not quite so keen now to
get on to the single-tier pension. It is worth pointing out that the
Govt are doing this only because it is cost-neutral. The Treasury does
not have huge extra wads of money sitting around somewhere to pay to
people who reach pension age after April 2016. The worry of many women
born in 1952 and 1953 is that they would have qualified for pension
credit anyway.</hs_Para>

was concerned that the single-tier pension was being set only £1
above pension credit levels. We thought that the Bill should include a
provision that would always ensure that the single-tier pension would
be above the level of pension credit. We were disappointed that the gap
between pension credit and the single-tier pension was so narrow. It
would help to allay some of the fears if there was a guarantee that the
single-tier pension would always be above the basic
level.</hs_Para>

Anne Begg:</Member></B> I am sure the Minister heard my hon.
Friend’s plea with regard to Tesco. There is still a concern
that some employers might take the introduction of auto-enrolment as an
opportunity to top-slice what they would be paying into a pension fund,
as part of auto-enrolment, off the salary they are already paying.
There does not seem to be any evidence of that, but perhaps some of
what my hon. Friend talked about is the restructuring by some big
companies with high employee turnover that are maybe looking to find a
way of cutting what they pay. There is no doubt that, with the
introduction of auto-enrolment and the pension, the single-tier pension
was inevitable. It is the right thing to do, but, as with anything this
complex that affects so many people, the Government have to ensure that
they get it right. If they get it wrong, there will be an awful lot of
angry people out there. I am sure the Minister is
listening.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_08_PT_1/F78EDE29B1E8907D873A7A2BC3A53B3D8F0214A2" __version__="1.10"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 May 2013">Wednesday

has been pointed out, this is the penultimate Queen’s Speech of
this Parliament: there are now two years to go. I think that one
political prediction on which we can all agree is that the next two
years will go an awful lot more quickly than the last three years did.
Whatever proposals are contained in the legislation outlined in the
Queen’s Speech, the truth is that much of the politics in the
next two years, and therefore at the next general election, will be
conditioned not by what is in today’s speech, but by the wider
economic scenario. We have welcomed the Queen to the Palace of
Westminster today. Perhaps of more significance is that the Chancellor
of the Exchequer is welcoming the International Monetary Fund to the
United Kingdom for its annual health audit. The implications for the
economy will play as big a role in the next 18 months to two years as
the proposals in front of us, important though they may be.</hs_Para>

orders that enabled the transference of powers to Edinburgh to hold the

implication, for United Kingdom politics as a whole. Although I am not
in the business of trying to resurrect conservatism—my loyalty
to the coalition does not extend quite as far as that—I think
that, on any rational basis, it is clear that there will be a very
skewed constitutional dialogue and debate if the traditional, historic
and continuing authentic voice of conservatism is not heard, and does
not have a degree of resonance. I think that that should be borne in
mind during our discussions about Scotland’s role within the UK,

Minister has made many times. There are those of us in the House, and
on the spectrum of British politics, who are unapologetic and unashamed
in saying that, historically as well as in contemporary terms, the
immigrant contribution to our economy and the values of our society has

celebrated, and it is not something in respect of which a Dutch auction

considerable unease—not least during the past few weeks of
British politics, and perhaps during the past week in

debates in the House and the so-called night watchmen of the time,

one of their leading lights. They kept the place going night after
night, week after week, month after month, and almost brought the

think that is a judgment he must make. I do not want to trawl through a
history lesson going back to the days of Maastricht, but the person I
blame most on all of this is Tony Blair. He is the one Prime Minister
who came into office with the wind behind him, and could have lanced
the boil of the European issue for an entire political generation had
he seized the opportunity. Sadly, he chose not to do so, which is why
not only has it festered, but what began as a rather eccentric minority

British interests that the British Conservative party is not anchored
more in the mainstream. We have been seeing that since its crazy
decision to take itself off into a rather loopy set-up within the

opportunity to poke fun at the Conservatives, but it also means that
the British voice and presence has been lost on more significant

detail first. We have got some initial inklings and there will
probably be quite a lot of detailed and, I suspect, sticky
debates to be had on some aspects of how this is going to be done. On
Europe, the Prime Minister has made it clear in his letter to his
parliamentary colleagues in just the last 24 hours that he cannot go in
the direction many of them are urging precisely because it is a
coalition Government. We can point to our presence having some
constructive restraining interest, although I will enter one caveat,
which is a challenge for the Liberal Democrat side of the
coalition.</hs_Para>

an unfettered majority Conservative Government and having a
Conservative party in government that is having to take account of
another set of views. Although Liberal Democrats are right to
argue—my colleagues and I do so regularly—that we can
temper this, prevent that, or perhaps improve on how something might
otherwise have been done, the bigger challenge for us over the next

the fact that simply saying, “Vote for us. If you didn’t,

different from being drawn into the potential political quagmire of
social engineering. The Lib Dem voice needs to be heard loudly on that,
within the echelons of the coalition and among the public: in
supporting reward for aspiration 
<?notus-xml column=44?>and responsibility we are not losing sight of the fact that those

telling domestic issues, such as immigration, and on the absolutely
critical international issues, such as Europe. On those issues and

Labour is achieving up to a glass ceiling but seems to have difficulty
getting much beyond that, so our voice needs to be heard all the more
on such issues, unambiguously, without any sense of retreat, nipping
and tucking, or dodging and weaving. On many of these vital matters, we
are going to get too much of that from the Labour leadership over the
next period. We should be clear, consistent and unafraid, because what
we are saying needs to be heard, in much the same way as what we said
about Iraq—even though many in this place thought there was not
much of a vehicle for that—needed to be heard out there.
Sometimes people will respect you even if they do not necessarily agree
with you on the issue of the day. Let us not be afraid, let us give the
Queen’s Speech our support, but let us use it as the launch pad

While I accept that many of those priorities are laudable and worthy of

Speech over the years, but how to achieve and implement them seems to
have escaped the imagination of successive Governments. Aspiring to
achieve must never be undermined, but we are in challenging times and
the nation looks to this Government and this House to provide a
legislative programme that will build a strong and vibrant economy, and
that rewards hard work while maintaining a caring environment for our
disabled, elderly and disadvantaged. I have no doubt, as the debate
continues, that we will have many eloquent contributions from across
the House, expressing the views of our constituents. We must remember,
however, that we are here not to make memorable speeches, but to

alluded to, many of the individual priorities outlined in the Gracious
Speech are worthy of support, but, as always, the devil is in the
detail. Our responsibility is, therefore, to scrutinise carefully the
detail, and to ensure that the implementation matches the sentiment. I
trust the Government will not have a closed mind on how to solve many
of the pressing issues. If Opposition parties have wise counsel to give

accordingly.</hs_Para>

heard many Queen’s Speeches. I associate myself particularly

aim.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050838000115">I

announced that he suddenly became a rebel by doing something for the

determine their future. I was also pleased to see how seriously the
Government are taking their forthcoming chairmanship of the G8, which
will be important not just for UK politics, but for world politics.
There are many measures in the Queen’s Speech that we can all
support. The antisocial behaviour, crime and policing Bill will ensure
that victims get a quicker and co-ordinated outcome. I particularly
welcome the provisions that will strengthen protection of victims of
forced marriage. That is really important. In addition to the
rehabilitation of offenders, we should see a criminal justice system

care Bill will modernise the law in this area and help people to plan
their later life with more certainty by capping care costs and

Not yet mentioned by earlier speakers, measures to promote resilience
to natural hazards such as drought and floods, and competition in the
water business so that business customers can choose from whom they buy
their water and sewerage services, are particularly welcome. I hope the
Government have found a solution to the problems with the Welsh
Assembly Government over Welsh Water, and I look forward to seeing the
shape of the proposals for that Bill and also the Welsh Assembly
election proposals. I hope that that Bill will rule out double jobbing,
which I have always disapproved of, and will allow candidates for the

that is where my approval stops. The deep concern that has been
expressed by my constituents and, I understand, by your constituents,
Mr Speaker, about HS2 has finally resulted in not one but two Bills
that were announced today in the Gracious Speech. People will ask why
there are two Bills. For the past four years, both the Labour
Government and the coalition Government have spent hundreds of millions
of pounds of taxpayers’ money on a project that has never been
discussed or voted on in this House, so instead of relying on a real
vetting process through the hybrid Bill that will naturally take a
great deal of time and in all likelihood will not now be passed before
the next general election, the Government are going to rush through a
quick little paving Bill so that they can claim parliamentary approval
while covering their financial difficulties, not least because the
expenditure has escalated without any legislative authority or proper
scrutiny<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T17:18:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050838000121">Much
of this project’s development has been conducted behind closed
doors. The Government must be far more open before slipping through
such a preparation Bill. We all know that there is a Major Projects
Authority report on HS2, but most of us have not seen that report. I
understand it is a red/amber report, a classification which indicates
that this is a high-risk project. As far as I am aware, the Government
have resisted all attempts and freedom of information requests to have
the report published. They must now do so, before the first HS2 Bill is

closely at the small print of the paving Bill because within it, I
think, will be the statutory authority to provide compensation for our

Gillan:</Member></B> The devil will be in the detail. The truth of the
matter is that until recently there was no talk of a paving Bill, yet
the project has been on the stocks for four years. It is a little late
to discover that we need a paving Bill. Also, some commentators have
already been referring to it as a blank cheque, which is not
something anybody on the Conservative Benches wants to
see<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T17:20:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050838000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050838000124">I,
like you, Mr Speaker, and like colleagues and neighbours both inside
and outside the Government, and particularly in Buckinghamshire, have
serious misgivings about HS2. The project was produced like a rabbit
from a hat by the previous Labour Government. It has already blighted
the lives of my constituents and will cause irreparable environmental
damage to the Chilterns. It does not represent good value for money and
will not bring the exaggerated benefits claimed by its promoters.
Increasingly, informed commentators and experts have started to cast
doubts on the claim that it will heal the so-called north-south divide,
and those doubts are growing.</hs_Para>

me, HS2 fails on many fronts. It fails on the business case, which is
fundamentally flawed, with a cost-benefit ratio that is eroding so
rapidly that it is getting to a level at which it would not be regarded
as worth while by any normal criteria. The calculations are based on
false assumptions, with the forecasting assuming that all time spent on
trains is unproductive. It also fails to take into account modern
communications and working practices.</hs_Para>

observe environmental protections. The current plans and route
design for phase 1, and the business case, are so conditional on speed

adequately—indeed, more than adequately—recompense people
whose businesses and homes will be bulldozed along with their lives. I
hope, at least, that the property bond will be taken up by the

the mother ship of the Home Office, there is a big opportunity at last
to get an organisation that is fit for purpose, so that Members who
write to it about immigration cases actually receive replies from
Ministers or officials, and

asking people to report illegal migrants and having the political will

since we have signed the treaties, it is not possible to do anything

What the Government can do is to ensure that we have sufficient

people will come every year for the next few years. The Romanian and

I noted his intervention on the Prime Minister and what the Prime

blame advisers, it is the Prime Minister and Ministers who make the
decisions, so the buck must stop with them. I think we need a more
detailed explanation of why we are not proceeding with that proposal.
Similarly, many of my constituents have made representations against
plain packaging for cigarettes, and there are small shopkeepers in my

worry is that while looking at the new landscape of policing we seem to
have forgotten that of the criminal justice system. When I was Justice
Minister we set up the community legal service, which seems to have
disappeared. Many law centres are closing. Sadly, the one I used to
work for in Leicester, now called the community legal advice centre,
had to close due to cuts of £700,000. It was used by 10,000
people every year.
Right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T17:46:34"></hs_TimeCode> hon. and
hon. Members across the House expect constituents to come to their
surgeries and complain about different aspects of policy, but I am sure
that now even more people are arriving with benefit and housing
problems because of cuts to those services. Michael Turner, chairman of
the Criminal Bar Association, anticipates that of 1,600 legal aid firms
currently in existence, only 400 will remain once
the cuts have gone 
<?notus-xml column=56?>through.

conclusion, I am sorry that the Queen’s Speech contained nothing
more about the health service. As the House knows, I have type 2
diabetes. Practically every day the newspapers carry information about
the fact that diabetes is becoming an epidemic in this country, and I
know that a number of Members of this House also suffer from it. We
need legislation to deal with soft drinks companies that have not
adhered to the principles of the responsibility deal. It is still the
case that every can of Coke contains eight teaspoons of sugar, and we
should be beginning—and pursuing—a war on salt. Unless we
do that, diabetes will get much worse in this country. There is no
legislation on that issue, but I take heart from the final words of the
Queen’s Speech, which state that “other measures”
will be placed before the House. That is the get-out clause for the
Government, and I hope those other measures will include some of the
issues discussed today that were not able to be included in

myself as an oily young man on the make. More importantly, I
referred to the noble Lord Kenneth Baker as a genial old codger on the
way out. Clearly, I owe him a considerable apology because, in the 21
years since I made that disgraceful comment, he has continued to
contribute enormously in the House of Lords and more widely,
particularly on education matters. I today offer him a resounding
apology for those remarks I made 21 years ago. I should also like to
offer my congratulations to the proposer and seconder of the

Gracious Speech has apparently been well received on both sides of the

If my right hon. and hon. Friends read the Queen’s Speech in
conjunction with the Prime Minister’s 
<?notus-xml column=57?>speech to the Conservative party conference in Birmingham last October,

were no local elections in my constituency of Sutton Coldfield this
year, but I can assure hon. Members that, without question, the top of
the list of my constituents’ concerns remains the state of the
economy. They are concerned on two key counts. First, they believe that
we should continue to tackle both the deficit and the debt that our
country has incurred. Secondly, they are concerned that we should
promote growth in our economy in every practical way possible. Every
business knows that they succeed not only by cutting costs; they must
also concentrate on the top
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050845000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050845000009">In
my view, that is precisely what motivates the Chancellor of the
Exchequer. He should not be deflected from that strategy. He is
absolutely right and, fortunately, shows no signs of being deflected.
If the IMF rides into town this week and gives different advice, I
would urge him to ignore it. Many of us remember very well the errors
of judgment made by the IMF in the 1980s. Any different judgment from
the one the Government have made on the central themes of the economy
would be extraordinarily
misplaced.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050845000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050845000010">Should
the Chancellor need to be comforted, he will be by the story of the 364
economists who wrote to <I>The Times</I> during Lord
Howe’s time as Chancellor of the Exchequer. The economists urged
Lord Howe to change course. He did not, and, as a result of the wise
economic measures he took, the British economy was revived and
reinvigorated. As the then Prime Minister, Baroness Thatcher, said, if
the 364 economists had all been right, one would have been enough. The
Chancellor should stick to his guns on the advice that he has taken and
given. He should also note that a generation of politicians in large
parts of the developing world who racked up enormous amounts of debt
have been found out. Not everyone has woken up to that, but we must
ensure that politicians do not make the mistake again of racking up
such debt, which will be hung around the necks of future generations

</B><B>Mitchell</B><B>:</B></Member> The Government are successfully
tackling the deficit, which, as the hon. Gentleman will know, is an
essential precursor to tackling the debt. I revert to my point that if
this generation fails to tackle that, future generations must address
it. The point is made clearly by Edmund Burke, who said that not being
responsible to future generations is a grave error for
politicians—that includes today’s politicians. Anyone who
doubts that should read the excellent biography of Edmund Burke by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T17:54:47"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hereford and South Herefordshire (Jesse Norman), which
makes that point extremely

must ensure that we focus on growth as well as on cutting the deficit.
In my view, there is nothing more important than pursuing the EU-US
free trade agreement. As has been said by hon. Members on both sides of
the House, boosting free trade is enormously important. Successfully
concluding an EU-US free trade agreement 
<?notus-xml column=58?>will have a huge effect not only on our trade, and on trade in Europe
and elsewhere, but on the lives and living standards of some of the
poorest people in the world. No one should be in any doubt that the
crisis in the eurozone has a negative effect on Britain as well as on
the eurozone countries. If I may use a cricketing metaphor, the
Chancellor finds himself at the crease at an unprecedentedly difficult
time for our economy. He is making the right judgment calls and
deserves the full support of the
House.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050845000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050845000014">One
other duty of our generation that directly affects my constituents is
the duty to preserve the green belt. Once again, Sutton Coldfield
languishes under a Labour council, which, once again, is unnecessarily
supporting an ill-thought-through suggestion that we build 10,000
houses on Sutton Coldfield’s green belt. It is completely
unnecessary—other solutions to the housing problems in our area
must be pursued before the green belt is attacked in that way. I hope
that I can pursue the matter further in the House in due course if the
ludicrous proposal from the Labour council in Birmingham
stands.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050845000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050845000015">Having
made those points on the economy and the responsibility of our
generation to future generations, I should like to address foreign
affairs, which have been raised in the debate and which were alluded to
in the Gracious Speech. The context is the British hosting of the G8 in
Northern Ireland. I hope that, in the course of the programme outlined
in the Queen’s Speech, the crisis in the middle east will be
addressed more trenchantly. I am speaking particularly of Syria. More
than 1 million people are now refugees and countless more have been
displaced. When I visited a camp last year on the Syrian-Jordanian
border, I met women and children who had been shot at by the Syrian
armed forces as they fled across the border to sanctuary in Jordan. The
camp is hot and dusty in summer and freezing cold in winter. Despite
the outstanding work of UNICEF and the Save the Children fund, which is
supported by Britain, those people live in great discomfort and great
peril, and wish only to return peacefully to their
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050845000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050845000016">In
recent months, the Foreign Office has issued some 43 ringing press
releases. I suggest that the inaction that inevitably imperils such
complex and difficult situations must be addressed in three ways.
First, we must address the humanitarian effects of that appalling

we must do everything we can wherever we can to document abuses of

insecurity. Somalia is important for Britain—we have a huge,
successful and diverse Somali population throughout the UK—but
it is one of the most ungoverned spaces in the world. Until recently,
there were more British passport holders training as terrorists in
Somalia than in any other country. Britain was heavily engaged in
trying to save lives through humanitarian relief in the dreadful famine
that struck the Horn of Africa over a year ago, imperilling the lives
of hundreds of thousands of children in particular. Britain gave great
leadership on that occasion and was able to bring international
resources to bear to tackle that situation.</hs_Para>

following that crisis that the Prime Minister made the brave decision
that last year we would have in London a conference that would bring
together all the different Somalian parties, the regional powers and
the leading nations in the UN to see whether we could do something
about a country that has been in chaos for the last 20 years and where
nine separate initiatives have failed to achieve anything to bring
about change or improvement. It looks as though considerable progress
is now being made in dealing with that intractable problem, and the
conference yesterday confirmed that. I mention that because it is right
to acknowledge that British efforts and support seem to be leading to
fundamental change in that country. That is hugely important to
Britain, as well as to those who live in Somalia, whose lives have been
so blighted in recent
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050845000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050845000028">Finally,
I want to give strong praise and support to the Government’s G8

news that he has said that it will be put at the heart of the G8
agenda. The lives of millions and millions of women and girls are
destroyed by insecurity and instability. Putting high on the
G8’s agenda the importance of tackling violence against women
will lead to the chance to transform the lives of some of the poorest

is the tenor of the pre-briefing of the speech that upsets me. It is an
attempt at dog-whistle politics, with its hints, suggestions and little
insinuations. Show a bit of leg, Lynton Crosby told them, and so they
did—just a tiny little bit of ankle. The trouble with
dog-whistle politics is that its cynicism eventually repels those it
tries to attract. It is like the boy who cried wolf once too often:
eventually the dogs realise that it is just a dog-whistle that does not
mean anything, and there is no reward or substance at the end. In fact,
it is a wolf-whistle, a sort of smutty insinuation that masquerades as
a compliment. It is not even a proposition. It is not a declaration of
love, but a leery suggestion of better things to come. The classic
example is the centrepiece on immigration that the Government have been
proclaiming for the past three days, which is already falling apart as

Bill that I really wish had been included in the Queen’s Speech
is a new fixed-term Parliaments Bill setting a term of four rather than
five years. I think that the Government will rue the day on which they
introduced a five-year fixed-term Parliament. People in this country
will start to say “We are absolutely sick and tired of
legislation that does not make sense, and of the Government’s
not addressing the issues that we really care about.” There is a
verse in the Book of Revelation that I think sums up the Queen’s
Speech perfectly: “Would that you were hot or cold, but you are
tepid, lukewarm, and I spit you out of my

me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050846000002" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000002">We
last debated a Queen’s Speech rather more than a year ago. On
that occasion, the House gained some amusement from my ability to
summarise the matters in it with which I agreed in less than 60
seconds, but today I shall take a different approach.</hs_Para>

of the speech of which I approved most was the one that was not in it.
I refer to the fact that the Government have dumped the idea of
a snoopers’ charter. We were told that the proposal had been
vetoed by the Deputy Prime Minister, which amused me, as there were
more Conservatives against it than there are Liberal Democrats in the
House of Commons. Nevertheless, we must give credit where it is
due.</hs_Para>

that the proposed legislation has been dumped, because it was offensive
and intrusive and would have shamed, I should have thought, either a
Liberal or a Conservative Government, let alone a Government consisting
of both parties. I am also pleased that the Deputy Prime Minister is on
our side on the matter. I only wish that he had been equally robust
last year in respect of the secret courts Bill. I hope that the
Government do not try to bring back the snoopers’ charter in one
of the “other measures” to which the speech
refers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050846000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000005">The
purpose of a Queen’s Speech is to set out the
Government’s strategy for the country, and to specify how the
Government will deal with the great threats and maximise the benefits
that the country can obtain in the coming year. It normally consists of
three parts, 
<?notus-xml column=65?>dealing with foreign policy, economic policy and
domestic, or home, policy. I shall comment briefly on each of those in
order to give the House an idea of where I think the Government are
going and, perhaps, an idea of where I think they ought to
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050846000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000006">In
the context of current politics, the most obvious element of foreign
policy—apart from the issue of Syria, which was dealt with by my
right hon. Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr
Mitchell)—is the matter of the European Union. Lord Lawson of
Blaby’s comments in the last couple of days have added a whole
new tenor to the Prime Minister’s proposed strategy relating to
what we do in the EU. As everyone knows, what Lord Lawson said, in a
nutshell, was that he would vote to withdraw. However, the keystone of
his argument, with which I do not agree, was his statement that the
negotiations that the Prime Minister could undertake would be
inconsequential, and that we would achieve very little in terms of
reform of our relationship with the European Union.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050846000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000007">I do not
think that that is necessarily so, although of course it has been true
historically. Very few nations have been able to win their own way, as
it were, in the European Union, and very few British Governments have
been able to do so. If we look back on our history since we joined the
EU, we may conclude that Margaret Thatcher’s recovery of the
rebate constituted one dramatic victory for a nation state over the
European elite, and that, interestingly, John Major’s exclusion
of us from the euro constituted another. Those were both massive issues
in their day and in their effect, but they were the exceptions, and,
what is more, since those days the balance of power between the
European Union and its member states has moved towards the EU rather
than the nations.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050846000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000008">In principle,
therefore, one would assume that Lord Lawson was right, and that it
would be impossible to achieve anything of any serious consequence.
However, there are some exceptions. It is a pity that the right hon.
Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz)—the Chairman of the Home
Affairs Committee—is no longer in the Chamber, because he would
appreciate some of the points that I am making. The exceptions,
essentially, are Denmark, Ireland and, together, Holland and France,
all of which have changed the course of a negotiation materially:
Denmark in respect of domestic issues, Ireland in respect of domestic
and constitutional issues such as abortion rights as well as financial
issues, and Holland and France by, famously, stopping the
constitutional treaty in its tracks.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050846000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000009">The common
denominator in the effectiveness of those countries was their holding
of prior referendums. They all held referendums before the negotiation
was over, which produced a formidable increase in their
Governments’ negotiating power. The European Union
officials—with some reason, given their ideology—take the
view that Governments are temporary, whereas Europe, or the European
project, is permanent, but they cannot say that in response to the
statement of a people, because peoples are permanent; and they are
afraid of referendums.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050846000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000010">What is
problematic about the Government’s present strategy is that they
are using referendums in the same way as Harold
Wilson—as a solution to a domestic problem, rather than as a
mechanism to solve the European problem. That is why some of us argue
in favour of the holding of a mandate referendum—a referendum on

<?notus-xml column=66?>the negotiating tactics that we are taking to the
European Union—before we do so. That, we believe, would enable
us to get probably 70% of the country to support the new model of
relationship that we want, and the Prime Minister would then have a
chance of achieving some sort of victory.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050846000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000011">What will
happen otherwise, if Lawson is right, is that there will indeed be an
inconsequential outcome, and the Prime Minister will find himself in
the position of arguing in favour of staying in the European Union,
because Prime Ministers and Foreign Secretaries never admit to error or
failure in negotiations. I will give way to any Member who can tell me
of an occasion when any of them has done so. The Prime Minister will
have to come back and say, “This”—this limp rag of
an outcome—“is a terrific success, and I want you to stay
in the Union.” Of course, he will be defeated, and the
consequences for Britain in terms of subsequent negotiations will not
be
clever.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050846000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000012">I
ask the House to think very carefully about that. It seems to me that
if we are to go down this route, a referendum is an inevitability, but
if we are to go down this route, we ought to give the British people
the right to choose between two good outcomes, rather than one good
outcome and one bad outcome. The way in which to do that is to hold two
referendums, one—soon—on the negotiating strategy that we
are seeking to present, and the other, a decision referendum, at the
end of the
day.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050846000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000013">The
second strand with which I wish to deal is the economic strategy. I
have some sympathy with those who argue that the Government’s
current strategy is necessary but not sufficient. Of course we must
gain control of the deficit and the debt levels—that is a
given—but, beyond that, we must ensure that we have a growth
strategy. I do not believe that the answer is to adopt the Keynesian
approach that Labour Front Benchers want to pursue, but we nevertheless
need a growth strategy. A good many Government Members would argue that
to get that we need less regulation and lower taxes, what could be
described as a supply-side growth strategy.</hs_Para>

context, an aspect of the Queen’s Speech of which I disapprove
is the Government’s approach to energy costs. Their current
approach is leading to an increase in the cost of living for ordinary
families, and to the loss of jobs as industries move from here not just
to China, Brazil and India but to Germany and France, because the
current carbon pricing arrangements mean that we are disadvantaged in
relation to our European competitors. Whatever view we hold on green
policy, it cannot be an advantage to export jobs and export the
emissions that go with them. I am concerned about that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050846000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000015"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T18:29:40"></hs_TimeCode>I
want to focus on one element of the economic arm of the Queen’s
Speech: the welfare reforms. Broadly speaking, the welfare reforms are
the unsung success of this Government. This is the most difficult part
of their policy to carry through. It is the most contentious and the
hardest part to get right, but it is the step that is leading to
employment increasing rather than reducing. It is getting more people
to go out and look for a job now than have historically. It is not
easy. All of us have in our constituencies people who have got on the
wrong side of the assessment process, but it is a necessary
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T18:30:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Davis:</Member></B> There is an element of that, and that is what I was
alluding to just now. There is no doubt that the system makes some
mistakes, but I have the advantage of having been an MP for a long
time, and I can remember when we changed the disability rules
the other way, and we had a 400% increase in people claiming
disability benefits of one sort or another. It was the right direction
to go in, but it went vastly too far. The problem is that we now have a
situation in which people are basically taken completely off the job
market. To be frank, it suited past Governments of both political
persuasions to have those people out of the job market, because the
figures looked better, but that does not mean we do not now have to put

argument here—it is the argument I will make throughout what I
have to say in the next five or so minutes—is that the difficult

raising three or four children—is a difficult task in its own

one element of the Leader of the Opposition’s speech that I sort
of half-agreed with was that we have not been fast or robust enough in
our approach to banking reform. There has been a lot of talk recently
about populist measures—about “Thatcherite

neither here nor there to me. What matters is the structure of the
banks. We should be breaking up our banks. At the level at which
economies of scale run out in commercial 
<?notus-xml column=68?>banking, we could have 30 high street banks in the

the reason for that is the state of the UK banks’ balance
sheets. They are getting money effectively for free, but they have got
such bad, or untrustworthy, loans on their balance sheets that they
dare not lend money, and the Government are putting constraints on them
to limit their lending, too. The outcome is that our small businesses
in particular are having a terrible time. Patches are being put over
this problem, such as the Chancellor’s mortgage support scheme

on home affairs, immigration has come to the fore, particularly because
of the UK Independence party’s activities in the past few weeks.
I dealt with the issue for a long time when I was shadow Home
Secretary. The difficulty is to come up with a set of measures that is
both firm and will deal with the issue without being
uncivilised—without being barbarous, or perceived as barbarous,
in approach. That applies to both the immigration problems the
Government are attempting to solve in the Queen’s Speech: the

Qatada serves as a good example. If Qatada faced torture or death

Let<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T18:38:36"></hs_TimeCode> us consider
the treatment of Christopher Tappin. He was extradited under the

have had lots of talk from the Government, including the Home

with already. I say that because about two months ago
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T18:39:14"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Esher and Walton (Mr Raab) tabled an amendment to
primary legislation to say, “We will take into account articles
2 and

Why would this work? It would work because the Human Rights
Act, of which I am no great fan, can be trumped, not by
regulation or ministerial decision but by primary legislation passed by
this House. We could have fixed this problem, but the Government talked
the measure out—it was the day of the Leveson debate—and
did not attempt to create time for it. They should have passed it. I do
not know what we will get now, but it will be different. Importantly,
the legislation must great clarity, because the courts will interpret
any vagueness to the advantage of the person who might be deported.
That is inevitable; it is what has happened over the past few years. We
can fix this problem, but we need to face up to the need for clarity
and for a decision on what we are really saying about the European
convention on human
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050846000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050846000034">The
other element of the immigration debate is mass migration. I agree with
the Government that we must limit the ability of people who have made
no contribution, perhaps having come here temporarily, to claim welfare

that I agree with the Government’s idea of withholding health

acting firmly without being uncivilised—without being barbarous.
I find it difficult to imagine doctors in an accident and emergency

Davis:</Member></B> Let me deal with those very good points in order.
First, health tourism is not new; people may now be coming from
Romania, but we have had people coming from the middle eastern states
for a long time. I used to live near King’s College hospital,
which has a great liver treatment centre, and a significant proportion
of its patients at one time were from Arab countries.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> They were not paying, that is the
point. Of course we have to do something about health tourism, but we
also have to be wary of unintended consequences. I mentioned A and E
because in London, as the hon. Lady knows, and in some other parts of
the country it is acting as a secondary GP service. In a huge,
three-hour queue of people coming to A and E to get secondary GP
services, I do not know how we distinguish between those born in
Britain and those born in Hungary or Romania. There is a great risk of
getting this wrong, and the medical profession would not go along with
it and be the
arbiters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T18:44:04"></hs_TimeCode>. As the
hon. Gentleman rightly said, communicable diseases are a problem,
irrespective of whether someone is a British citizen or born abroad.
They have to be treated differently and separately, but that is not a
question of payment or of health tourism; it is a question of getting
it right.</hs_Para>

morning, the Health Secretary talked on the radio about the pull
factor, characterising medical care as such. That is the case for a
health tourist, and we can do something about it, but we could not do
something about the half a million Polish immigrants that there were at
one point. The pull factor for most of the Romanians and Bulgarians
will not be health care, welfare or housing; it will be simple
economics, because the average income in Romania and Bulgaria is
approximately one third of our minimum wage. Most 
<?notus-xml column=71?>Romanians and Bulgarian could treble their standard of living simply by
coming to the UK and doing almost any job.</hs_Para>

did have a working European Union, we would by now have been able to
say to each other, “When we devised the rules about the freedom
of movement of people, they were not devised for an organisation of
states that had a tenfold difference in average incomes.” Let me
say that I am a free marketeer, so I think those things are terrific
and I am a believer in the free movement of people, but we have to
think of a better way of dealing with this matter, because these people

end up giving a lecture on this, but let me say that the previous
Government made a simple mistake in allowing access before the
transitional periods were up 
<?notus-xml column=72?>for those from the entire A8 group of accession countries—Poland,
Hungary, the Czech Republic and so on. Therefore a large number of
people who could not get into Germany and France at that time came to
this country, because they were allowed legitimately to do so; ours was
the only big country to do that. As a result, we end up with a Polish
community—with Polish shops, Polish newspapers and so
on—and so where do Poles go when everything is opened up? They
come to where there is an indigenous Polish community, and that is
perfectly reasonable. All of this is rational behaviour on the part of
people who want to work, make a living and get on in life, and I cannot
disapprove of them doing that. So one mistake was made then and that is
what it led to. We are not going to be in the same position in respect
of Romania and Bulgaria, so it is difficult to predict the

do, under political pressure. More generally, in our approach to
difficult economic decisions in the next year or two, I hope that this
Government, of all Governments, will work hard to balance the fairness
against the difficult decisions. We are going to make hard decisions,
which will lead to huge opprobrium from Labour Members for all sorts of
reasons. That does not bother me, but what does bother me is that we
get the balance of fairness

agree with his point that Britain should regain its ambition to be a
truly great engineering nation. I commend his efforts to bring more
women into engineering and into the study of STEM—science,
technology, engineering and maths—subjects. It is shameful that,
in relation to encouraging women into engineering, this country is
bottom of the league, so his efforts should have cross-party
support.  
<?notus-xml column=73?>It is disappointing that the word “engineering” was not

proposed piece of legislation will need to be examined closely, but I
warmly welcome the inclusion of the issue in the Queen’s
Speech. My constituency of Hartlepool is the 16th worst affected
constituency in the country for asbestos-related diseases. Incidence of
mesothelioma, a legacy of our heavy industry past—especially in
shipbuilding—is particularly high. Victims and their families
have been denied compensation and suitable justice for far too long,
often because the industry in the area has closed down, or successive
firms either no longer exist or are impossible to trace. I have had
tragic cases in my constituency of families not having the money to
bury their husbands or fathers, because the insurance industry refused
to pay out. During the passage of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and
Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, the Government did themselves no
credit by requiring victims of asbestos-related diseases to surrender a
quarter of the damages awarded for their pain, suffering and
life-shortening illnesses to pay for legal costs. I hope that the
announcement made today will help to make
amends.</hs_Para>

legislation and priorities that the Government did not include in the
Queen’s Speech were deeply revealing. The right hon. Member for
Haltemprice and Howden, who is, I think, about to leave the Chamber,
mentioned the purpose of a Queen’s Speech, which is to provide
not only the legislative programme for the next Session but a strategic
direction, outlining the priorities of the Government. As I said, there
was no mention of engineering, there was no mention of manufacturing
and there was not a word about an industrial strategy. There was no
mention of the world-beating sectors that this country has and needs to
enhance, such as aerospace, automotives, pharmaceuticals or the
creative industries.</hs_Para>

there was no mention in the Queen’s Speech of the national

would welcome measures that would do that, but on the basis of the
Government’s record and of the announcements made today, I
remain unconvinced. If we are to address Britain’s
competitiveness with the rest of the world, the Government will have to
tackle the country’s growing lack of productivity relative to
our economic rivals, but there was not a single mention in the
Queen’s Speech of our declining productivity. In the decade from
1997 to 2007, this country was second only to the US in the list of
rich nations in terms of the growth of GDP per hour. Now, we are second
bottom, behind only Japan. UK productivity is now 16 percentage points
lower than the G7 average—the widest productivity gap between
ourselves and other leading nations for 20 years.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13050848000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000015">Output and
economic growth have flatlined for the past two and a half years, while
manufacturing output, for all the talk of a Government reportedly
determined to rebalance the economy, has declined by a tenth from its
2008 peak and has today fallen by 1.4% from 12 months ago.
Productivity across the UK economy has fallen by 2.3% in the past year,
and measures of output per hour in manufacturing fell by 5.2% between
quarter four in 2011 and quarter four in 2012, the largest fall since
records began. We will not address our competitiveness as a nation, and
be able to compete with developed, fast-growing and ambitious rising
nations in the globalised 
<?notus-xml column=75?>economy, if we do not address our productivity problem, yet the
Queen’s Speech does not even see fit to mention it.</hs_Para>

biggest social and economic issue facing Hartlepool is unemployment.
The notion that some growth in private sector employment is cutting the
jobless queue is ludicrous, bears no resemblance to the reality on the
ground in my constituency and is deeply insulting for those proud men

wants to work, but Government policies are making it harder, not
easier, for decent aspirational people to find a job.</hs_Para>

illustrate that with some statistics. The number of jobseeker’s
allowance claimants in Hartlepool has increased by 25% since this
Government came to power, and it now stands at about 4,700. For
long-term unemployment, the situation is even bleaker. The number of
people in Hartlepool who have claimed JSA for more than a year is up by
155% since the Government came to office. The number who have claimed
JSA for more than two years has increased in the same period by a
staggering 560%. One in four young men in my constituency is without a
job or a training place, and the House will appreciate that the longer
a person is out of work the more difficult it is for them to find any
sort of work, let alone well-paid, meaningful employment.</hs_Para>

experience, talent and potential are being lost in Hartlepool and
elsewhere, possibly forever, as a result of this Government’s
misguided and short-term views on skills and employment. It is economic
ignorance at best, and indifference to the economic plight of people in
constituencies such as mine at worst, to suggest that the Government
agenda is helping communities such as the one in Hartlepool. The
worst-hit region anywhere in the country for reductions in public
expenditure per head is mine—the north-east—with an
average loss of £566 per capita. Hartlepool has lost an average
of £724 a head, making it the most badly affected town in a

agree. That money is spent in local businesses. Take it away and the
private sector in Hartlepool suffers enormously. It suffers
disproportionately, with negative consequences for private sector
employment and competitiveness, but the measures in the Queen’s

such as Hartlepool and other parts of the north-east will see
still-higher unemployment, further contraction in economic activity and
falling living standards and opportunities for my

Government were serious about aspiration and tackling welfare
dependency, they would have included in the Queen’s Speech a
jobs and training Bill, committing the Administration to helping people
into work and providing a boost to families’ living standards
and quality of life by providing meaningful and decently paid
employment, as well as improving the competitiveness and size of our
economy by increasing demand in all areas of the country, not just
within the M25. If they were serious, they would also have announced a
house building and modernisation of housing stock Bill, designed to
provide the homes that we need in the 21st century. Yes, more homes
would be built, but cold, leaky and inefficient existing homes could
also be refurbished, which would provide a much-needed short-term boost

businesses do not believe that the Government are making a difference.
In a report by the CBI and KPMG last September, just 35% of businesses

issue. It could have announced a British investment bank Bill, which

end in the same way. One of this country’s competitive
advantages, which sets us apart from some of our rivals, is our rule of

intellectual property. Investors and creators come to this country,
providing jobs and new, innovative business

Government have had a tendency to consider intellectual property as
somewhat about red tape or bureaucracy, rather than what it
is—legal protection. In the previous Session, we saw the
incoherent and ill-thought-through changes to copyright in the Bill

which—thankfully—the Government had to back down. The
intellectual property Bill announced today, with its proposals to
reform design law, can be cautiously welcomed as a means of protecting
design rights. I hope that no amendments will be made to it at a late
stage without their being discussed with industry or being thought
through properly by Ministers, which happened with copyright during the
passage of the 2013 Act. However, the general direction of the
intellectual property Bill announced today seems to be
sensible.</hs_Para>

for all my talk of welcoming certain measures and for all its rhetoric
about improving competitiveness, the Queen’s Speech seems to do
very little to encourage enterprise, innovation or

Hughes</B> (Bermondsey and Old Southwark) (LD):</Member> I am grateful
to be able to contribute to the debate on the Queen’s Speech,
and I am happy to follow the hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr Wright). He
is always good and robust in arguing the corner for his well-respected
constituency. He always makes a passionate case for the north-east,
which deserves to be made. However, some of the things that he has said
are unfair critiques of a Government who are trying very hard to ensure
that we do not just concentrate development in the south-east, where I
am an MP, and that we take out the resurrection of manufacturing to all
the regions of England and to all parts of the UK.</hs_Para>

absolutely right that we should ensure that places such as the
north-east, which have been heavily and principally dependent on the
public sector, continue to see private sector growth and
development as well. There have been very good examples in the motor
manufacturing industry, and in the chemicals industry in the
constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Ian
Swales).</hs_Para>

Member for Hartlepool made a plea for engineering, and I join him in
making that plea, as well as echoing the comments of the proposer of
the Loyal Address, the hon. Member for Mid Worcestershire (Peter Luff).
I have the Brunel museum in my constituency and I have always argued in
this place—in your part of the world, Mr Deputy Speaker, people
understand this argument very well—that unless we continue to
get people in this country to make things of the highest quality, both
for our own infrastructure and to sell abroad, we will not pay our way
in the world. Engineering has a hugely important part to play in that
process.</hs_Para>

contribution of the hon. Member for Hartlepool also highlighted a short
but important Bill, which is the mesothelioma Bill. I have been on
Committees and  
<?notus-xml column=78?>I have participated in debates in this House in which we have argued
that people who have suffered from that particularly dangerous form of
cancer, which is caused by asbestos in the workplace, should be
assisted. I hope that there can be consensus across the House that we
should legislate in the right way to deal with those who so far have
not received the appropriate compensation. Some of them are not with us
anymore, which is a tragedy, but a small group of people deserve our
support and respect.</hs_Para>

eve of VE day, and I will join others tomorrow at ceremonies in my
constituency at the war memorial just beside the Imperial War museum
for the annual commemoration of that important event. So it is right
that, across the House today, there have also been tributes at the
beginning of people’s speeches to our armed services and our
armed forces. Since we met last, more people have died on active
service.</hs_Para>

constituent whose company, F.A. Albin and Sons, has the contract with
the Ministry of Defence to do the important but sad and difficult work
of bringing home those who have lost their lives on military service
around the world. I was with the head of that firm, Barry Albin-Dyer,
when the message came through that three more people had lost their
lives last week in Afghanistan. On behalf of my party, I want to join
in the tribute that has been paid across the House to those who have
continued to risk their lives in the name of our country, thank them
for their service and send our commiserations, consolations and
condolences to their families, comrades and
friends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050848000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000039">There
is one other group of people to whom I hope we will send our support
and condolences, but also our promise of support. I have a significant
Bangladeshi community in my constituency. Since we last met, there has
been a terrible event in Bangladesh that has seen hundreds of people
killed, thousands injured, many still missing and thousands of families
affected. I hope that our country’s strong ties with Bangladesh
will mean that we continue to give them all the support they need in
Dhaka and beyond. I also hope that we will learn the lessons of what
appear to be exploitative practices, not only by the builders in that
country, but by companies who make their money out of exploiting
workers in that country to sell clothes to us and other countries
worldwide. I hope that we shall put the tragedy in Dhaka in the last
couple of weeks to good use.</hs_Para>

ago today, on the second Wednesday of May, the coalition Government was
formed. On behalf of my Liberal Democrat colleagues in Parliament, I am
clear that we made the right decision to enter a coalition Government
on that day and in those circumstances. We are determined, in this
third Session of this fixed-term Parliament, to make the right
decisions over the next year, as we have tried to make the right
decisions over the first two Sessions.</hs_Para>

tribute to my colleagues, and to our coalition partners, that two
parties that contest elections against each other regularly and have
never regarded themselves as close mates decided, in the national
interest, to work together; and with only one exception over the three
years, we have both honoured the coalition agreement that we entered
into and held to the terms of the agreement. I believe that is good for
politics and has been good for the country. Despite all the economic
and political difficulties, the coalition has held firm.</hs_Para>

why it was the right decision last Friday night, when I went across the
river to a production in the National Theatre of “Our
House”, which, for those who have not yet been—I gather
some colleagues are there tonight—is a play about the
Governments of the 1970s, and specifically the working of the Labour
and Conservative Whips Offices during those times, with the character
of my predecessor Bob Mellish, then Labour Chief Whip, playing a
starring role. Anybody who has forgotten the history of how difficult
it is to run a Government with a small majority or no majority should
see the play before it finishes its run.</hs_Para>

alternative, in 2010, was either a coalition with Labour, had they been
willing to make one, which would not have had a majority; a coalition
with Labour and others, which still probably would not have had a
majority; or a minority Conservative Government, which by definition
would not have had a majority. Given the dire economic circumstances
that Britain faced—the worst since the second world war—I
am clear that we needed a Government with a clear majority, in order to
see out a full term to seek to implement a set of policies to try to
give us growth and rescue us from the dire economic situation we were
in.</hs_Para>

were dire economically and “Our House” reminded me, and
everyone else in the audience, of them. They were equally difficult in
2010, and very slowly and gradually, but surely and in the right
direction, we are moving ahead. I absolutely understand and share, as a
south-east London MP, the views of people like the hon. Member for
Hartlepool that the test of the Government’s success,
fundamentally, is the economy and whether we get jobs and growth going
in a sustained and committed way. I and my colleagues are committed to
delivering that, and to delivering it over five
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050848000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000045">Over
the past year, many of the things that matter to people like me, in an
old working docks constituency, and my colleagues, have been delivered.
Jobs are up. I looked at the Library’s figures as the hon.
Member for Hartlepool was speaking. There are 29.7 million people aged
16 or over in employment in the last quarter for which we have
figures—about the same as in the previous quarter, and up
488,000 on the previous year. That is nearly half a million. The
employment rate for people aged 16 to 64 is now 71.4%—not far
off the pre-recession level of 73% in March to May 2008.</hs_Para>

public sector employment fell by 20,000 in the three months to December
last year, to 5.72 million, or 19.2% of total employment, the number of
people working in the private sector was 24 million, up 151,000 on the
previous quarter—81% of total employment. We knew that there
would be a contraction in public sector employment, but from the
beginning the Government said we were determined to have net growth in
jobs and the economy. There has been such growth; the jobs are
predominantly in the private sector. That will lead the way out of the
recession, and we must continue to do things such as reducing national
insurance on small businesses—a measure in the Queen’s
Speech to ensure that business grows and takes more people into
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050848000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000047"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Tami" PimsId="4198" UID="13050848000083" xid="579" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000083">Mark

Hughes:</Member></B> There are all sorts of reasons. The hon. Gentleman
must know that the last quarter has just been on the right side of
zero. Growth has been small but positive. We avoided the triple-dip
recession that people were saying was likely, given the terrible winter
and the dreadful weather we had. The answer is that there has been a
combination of failure.</hs_Para>

failed the economy at the end of the last Labour Administration. They
were not sufficiently dealt with or regulated by that Administration,
and they still have not got into a position where they are lending our
constituents and small businesses in the right places the money to
enable them to invest. Every single colleague around the House tells
tales, rightly, of how difficult it is; people come to see us and tell
us that they do not get the investment.</hs_Para>

been selling enough around the world, which is one of the avenues by
which we must earn our way. That is why the Prime Minister, the Deputy
Prime Minister, the Business Secretary and others have been out and
about, going not just to our traditional trading partners but to the
large, developing partners—Brazil, Mexico, Turkey, India,
China—to develop our trade. That is why we are working very hard
to get an EU-USA free trade agreement, to deliver growth.</hs_Para>

the question is that the economy has been faulty as a result of a
combination of historic and more recent factors, but the Government are
seeking to do as many things as they can. Last year, the green
investment bank was another initiative to get growth going in an
economy in which the Energy Bill this year is likely to assist in the
creation of up to 250,000 new jobs in green energy. That is really
valuable and important. The hon. Member for Hartlepool called for a
Bill to set up another form of investment bank. The Government have, as
he knows, a plan for further investment lending to companies as well as
the green investment bank, and that is
welcome.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050848000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000052">So
jobs are up; apprenticeships are hugely up. The state pension is
significantly up—higher than at any stage since Lloyd George
introduced it. The income tax threshold is significantly up, from
£6,500 more or less when we started, to nearly £9,500
this year, and next year to £10,000 before anyone pays any tax.
Inflation is still low. Interest rates are very low, and that is hugely
important for people with mortgages and businesses borrowing. Crime is
at its lowest level for many years. Those are significant achievements,
and I think we should be proud of that. It shows that many of the
things that the Government have done over three years are
working.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050848000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000053"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Iain Wright" PimsId="4684" UID="13050848000085" xid="667" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0002.htm#13050848000085">Mr

what my right hon. Friend the Business Secretary calls the greatest
economic heart attack we have had in his lifetime and mine. My
constituents have seen, over several months, unemployment come
down—not consistently, but there have been months when it has
come down and youth unemployment has

in Britain whereby there are still people a mile and half from this

bonuses that are completely without justification, while there are many
people on the minimum wage and struggling to get work. We need a

that took many people on low and medium incomes out of tax altogether
as a result of the raising of the tax threshold, and only when I was
satisfied that people on very high earnings would pay more net. Yes,
they had a reduction last month in their top rate of income tax from
50p to 45p in the pound, but with all the other changes that affect
them they will make a bigger total contribution to the economy in tax.
The hon. Lady knows what I am going to say next. I was here for all the

the welfare cuts, the Liberal Democrats argued strongly in the

pensioner householder in the country. Some rates of increase of benefit
for people with disabilities are higher than 1% to try to achieve
equity. These are all attempts to deal with a welfare bill that is
extremely high. It is not pleasant and I do not pretend that it is
easy. We would

I will answer that intervention very quickly and move on. Many people
with disabilities have had their benefits protected. For everybody
there is now a scheme that will make sure they are
reassessed—fairly, we hope. The so-called bedroom tax does not
apply to people who need a live-in carer and other categories have now
been exempted, not least because of internal discussions in the
coalition which delivered that outcome. But I am very conscious that we
need to do better for the people in the bottom 20% of income. I have
argued that within my own party and in the coalition and will go on
arguing it. We need to end up with a much fairer society than the

Member for Chesham and Amersham (Mrs Gillan) is no longer in the

know that people will say that London will benefit enormously, but I
believe that it is one of those projects that started off as the idea
of some civil servant and became the idea of many engineers and
transport experts. Everyone then gathered round and it became an
establishment project, and no one wants to say, “Maybe
we’ve got it wrong.” I hope that, as she said, during the
detailed consideration we will be able to see that the economics of HS2
really do not stand up to scrutiny and that some of the experts who
have been offering their knowledge on it are perhaps looking at it from
a slightly different view from those who live in the areas that will be
affected. In particular, I have grave doubts about the idea that it
will boost our economy. I think that the billions that will be spent on

matters that can be laid before the House, after another month or two
the Government, even if they cannot get coalition agreement, will have

more people have arrived on these shores as immigrants in a single year
since 2004 than in the entire period from the battle of Hastings to the
year of my birth, 1950. That was a deliberate policy of the previous
Labour Government, not something that happened by accident or was the

July the Government introduced tough new rules seeking to protect the
public from foreign criminals and immigration offenders who try to hide
behind family life as a reason to stay in the UK. The new rules set
proportionate requirements that reflect Parliament’s view of the
balance between the public interest in deporting a foreign national
offender and their rights under article 8 of the European convention on
human rights. It appears, however, that some immigration judges are not
paying sufficient heed to the new rules, and it is thus right that new
primary legislation is introduced to put beyond doubt the

think that almost all my constituents find it particularly offensive
that foreign nationals who commit serious crimes are not pretty much
automatically deported. Indeed, pressure in prisons such as Bullingdon
in north Oxfordshire is made worse by the fact that the prison system
is having to accommodate foreign nationals who have completed their
terms of imprisonment and who it seems difficult, if not impossible, to
deport. Shockingly, at the recent rate of removals it would take some
200 years to remove all those who are illegally present in
the United Kingdom, and unless we take serious and sustained action
their numbers will probably grow at a faster rate.

support the draft care and support Bill, which not surprisingly
prompted a considerable number of detailed recommendations in the
pre-legislative scrutiny published in mid-March. Most attention has
been focused on the costs of nursing home care, but that is only part
of what needs to be addressed. I have no doubt that in the debates on
Second Reading and in Committee we will need to consider how we secure
sustainable funding for the care system as a whole. We must ensure that

co-chair of the all-party group on carers, I am glad that the
Government are giving recognition to carers, particularly given the
increasing number who are having to manage work, their own
family’s lives, and caring for frail parents. It is good news
that they will receive more help, including, I hope, more access to
respite care and training in care techniques. We should never forget
that some 1.25 million people, most of them women, spend more than 50
hours each week caring for family members who cannot look after
themselves, and the number will rise sharply as our population grows
older. We need to ensure that carers do not feel isolated. On the
contrary, carers should feel valued and appreciated by us all. They
should feel able to have their needs assessed by their local authority
and to get help, depending on their means. All carers should feel that
they can get information about local groups that can support them and
offer guidance on how they can help in caring for loved ones.
Somewhere, either in the care and support Bill or the Children and
Families Bill, Parliament needs to give consideration to the rights of
young carers. Nevertheless, it is important that Parliament will at
last be seeking to resolve the challenges of nursing home and
residential care home costs, which are of concern to so
many.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000025">I

Bill will ensure that patients at the end of life and their
families are able to access the care they need to exercise choice. We
must in no way underestimate this Bill, which will be a historic step
forward. It will dramatically simplify the current legal framework for
care and support, replacing provisions in well over a dozen Acts of
Parliament with a single modern statute. It will modernise care and
support law so that the whole system is built around people’s
needs and what they want to achieve with their lives. It will clarify
entitlements to care and support to give people a better understanding
of what is on offer, help them to plan for the future, and ensure that
they know where to go for help when they need it. Importantly,
it will simplify the care and support system to provide the freedom and
flexibility needed by care professionals and local authorities to
innovate and to achieve better results for those who need the support
of social care.</hs_Para>

very much at the heart of the Government’s programme. The
Queen’s Speech announces no fewer than five separate Bills

small businesses, together with other measures. This is very much a
pro-business and pro-growth agenda that seeks to give practical help
and support to job creators and millions of people working throughout
the economy to promote growth. One of the biggest inhibitors to growth
is the cost of recruiting new employees, particularly for small
businesses. It is very good news that the Government intend to reduce
national insurance bills each year by entitling every business and

convinced that HS2 is necessarily best value for money in transport
infrastructure investment will need to be very careful about reading
the small print of the paving Bill—the high speed rail

parliamentary mechanism that enables compensation to be paid to those
affected by HS2, and I think that the Government may well have
constructed the legislation so that without the paving Bill it will be
difficult for constituents to access compensation. I suspect that many
will actually welcome the High Speed 2 hybrid Bill, as it will give

also increase the size and role of our reserve forces. The Bill is of
interest to me because in Bicester we have one of the largest defence
distribution depots in the country. I would say to Ministers that the

the next few days of debate on the Queen’s Speech, I have no
doubt that, as has already happened today, some will draw attention to
Bills that they consider should have been in the Queen’s Speech.
I suspect that there will be a fair amount of comment about our
relations with Europe. It is important to put any such comments into
context. The Prime Minister has committed to negotiate a new settlement
for Britain in the European Union. People questioned whether the Prime
Minister would veto an EU treaty; well, the Prime Minister has vetoed
an EU treaty. People questioned the Prime Minister’s ability to
get the EU budget cut; well, the Prime Minister has succeeded in
getting the EU budget cut. Given that previously it had not even been
possible to freeze the EU budget, it was a significant achievement for
the Prime Minister to secure a cut. People have questioned the Prime
Minister’s ability to get powers back from the European Union,
but the fact is that he got us out of the EU bail-out mechanism and
saved the country millions of pounds. The Prime Minister has said that
he is committed to negotiating a new settlement for Britain within the
EU, and I have every confidence that that is what he will achieve. It
will then be for the British people to judge that settlement in a
referendum. There will be a referendum on our membership of the
EU—that commitment is

commitment to engineering and engineering skills in this country. I
welcome the fact that the Gracious Speech refers to apprenticeships. We
need to ensure that

developed in conjunction with the engineering professions so that the

the previous Session I was privileged to attend an awards ceremony in

apprentice and is now undertaking an advanced apprenticeship, and she
got a degree through the company. She added proudly that, as a result
of that process, she does not have a student debt. That programme,
which was worked out in partnership between training agencies,
universities and employers, provides an important way forward. If we
are serious about apprenticeships, we need to develop such programmes

and Technology Committee heard a very good presentation from an

need. First, on science practicals, I was privileged to address a
conference alongside Sir Mark Walport, the then head of the Wellcome

I sang off exactly the same hymn sheet. We need to get young people to

We need to look at schools such as the JCB academy in Derbyshire, which
has done inspirational work on developing young people aged 14 to 19 in
order to prepare them for higher level skills in industry and the
university sector. Beyond schooling, we need to think about how to
build stronger bridges between universities and industry, and consider
the examples of the advanced manufacturing centre in Sheffield, the
Warwick manufacturing group and the current work being undertaken at
the university of

aspects of the skill sets we
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T19:58:26"></hs_TimeCode>. I presume

Member for Wokingham (Mr Redwood)—we need to consider some
workplace issues. Last week, I listened to some vox pops from
Lincolnshire on Radio 4. Sadly, the BBC did not challenge the farmer

with such issues and considering the agency workers legislation that I
sought to drive forward in the last Parliament will be
central to finding a solution. If we do not have properly
regulated working practices at the heart of those parts of the economy

populations that have been referred

second point brings me back to education. There is an urgent need for
the Government to decouple overseas students from the broader
immigration debate. I strongly urge the Government to work with
Universities UK to find a better way to deal with this massive
industry. Something like £7 billion is at stake in the British
economy. We have already seen losses from the Indian subcontinent.
Given that about one in eight Chinese hopes to have their child
educated abroad and that by 2020 that figure is predicted to be one in
three, this is a massive potential market. I would like there to be a
dialogue between the Government and Universities UK on creating a
regulatory framework. That would put significant responsibilities on
universities that some have perhaps not maintained in the recent past.
We should separate the process of determining whether somebody is
coming here to study from the broader immigration debate. It is
important that the figures are separated because this is an enormously
important industry, and I use the word “industry”
deliberately. We must develop university structures that have tight
mechanisms for dealing with applicants for such

takes me back to my opening point. The Government say that economic
competitiveness is their first priority. We need to get the framework

<?notus-xml column=92?>working properly. That will involve the development of skills at all
levels. There are challenges with the broader student population and,

on to the speech by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister, I support
all the measures in the Gracious Speech. This Government have cut the

23%.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000050">The

Member for Leicester East (Keith Vaz), is the high-speed rail link.
Many of us were here when we considered the Bill on the channel tunnel
rail link. Many Conservative colleagues were genuinely upset about the
effect on their constituencies. Sir Keith Speed in particular had a
tricky job to balance the needs of the nation with those of his
constituents. However, that was an entirely different project from the
current high-speed rail link. For the life of me, I cannot understand
why we will spend so much money and upset so many people in order to
get to the end of the line 20 minutes sooner than would otherwise be
the case. That is absolutely ridiculous and I hope that the Government
will think

Friend the Member for Sutton Coldfield (Mr Mitchell), I had no local
elections in my area last week because it is a unitary authority.

had no idea when I asked my question at the last Prime
Minister’s questions that my own mother would have such an

the Prime Minister had proposed because we did not have the votes to
legislate on it. 
<?notus-xml column=93?>However, I am now keen to put it to the test. If I am drawn in the top
four or half dozen in the ballot for private Members’ Bills next

colleagues would do the same.

veteran Member of the House. My hon. Friend now reminds me that the
referendum was 40 years ago. I voted in that referendum and I
voted no. I absolutely agree with what he says. I would welcome the
opportunity to put the matter to the test before all the parties. Let
us stand up and be counted, and let the people speak. It is quite wrong
to marginalise last week’s local elections. We all know that
people no longer have the Liberal party to vote for as a protest vote,
because for various reasons it joined the coalition. Personally, I
always felt that it was much closer to the Labour party than to the
Conservative party, but there we are. We should reflect seriously on
how people voted last

has been criticism of the content of the Gracious Speech, but what is
the point of our legislating and legislating when the legislation that
we already have is not enforced? I have been the proud promoter of two
Acts. One was the Protection against Cruel Tethering Act 1988. I often
ask questions to find out how many people have been convicted under it,
and I do not get a satisfactory answer. I also spent 18 months of my
life, when I came fourth in the ballot, promoting the Warm Homes and
Energy Conservation Act 2000, which promised to eliminate fuel poverty.
However, 13 years of the Labour Government did not do so, and that
important legislation does not appear to have been enforced.</hs_Para>

is no good Members saying that the Queen’s Speech was thin and
that we should have a lot of legislation. Frankly, I would like less
legislation, but when we do legislate I would like it to be enforced.
For instance, the House spent a lot of time talking about making it
unlawful for people to talk on their mobile phones when they are
driving, but from what I can see everyone seems to do it, not just in
traffic jams but when they are going around roundabouts. The law is not
consistently enforced. The idea that we should have more and more
legislation is absolutely

am delighted that a national insurance contributions Bill will be
brought forward, easing the pressure on businesses and charities with a
£2,000 employment allowance. I hope that the move will boost
employment and growth across our nation. Similarly, I welcome the
deregulation Bill. I remember that when Neil Hamilton was a Minister,
he made a marvellous speech at the Conservative party conference, with
miles and miles of bits of paper, saying that there would be less
regulation. 
<?notus-xml column=94?>Yet again, we are told that there will be less, and all the businesses
in our constituencies would certainly welcome
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T20:12:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000060">We
are going to have a draft consumer rights Bill, which is an excellent
idea for which I believe there will probably be all-party support.
There will be easier access to compensation, which is much overdue. We

is widely accepted that if someone has worked hard all their life, they
should be rewarded in retirement. That is why I am delighted to see
that care costs are going to be capped, ensuring that no one will have
to sell their home in old age to pay for residential care. I know that
many of my constituents will celebrate the Bill on the matter, which
reaffirms the fact that the only party that will protect the rights of
the elderly is the Conservative party, not least as many of our members
are of somewhat mature
age<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T20:13:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000062">The
pensions Bill and the care Bill are particularly welcome in my
constituency, as we have the most centenarians in the country. They
will ensure that more women can get a full state pension in their own
right, which will stop the problem faced by mothers who take time out
of their career to look after their children. The state pension system
certainly should not punish that, and I am glad that our Government
will examine the flaw in the system and put it
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T20:14:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000063">While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T20:14:30"></hs_TimeCode>
I am on that subject, a constituent of mine whose wife is dying of
cancer is not currently eligible for bereavement payments as he is 38.
Loss is just as hard at 38 as at 68, and perhaps the pensions and care

changed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T20:14:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000064">I

about immigration should not be branded racists. If any Member of

delay the House by talking about that. It is quite wrong that such
people are being housed, fed and watered by the British taxpayer. I am
sure many hon. Members will have heard that remark from their
constituents as they have knocked on doors, so I am glad that steps
have been outlined to address that ludicrous situation. The border
agencies’ resolve and power will be strengthened—we have
heard that the UK Border Agency will be abolished—and the
Government will ensure that taxpayers’ money is spent in a more

to deal with antisocial behaviour are hardly original—we have
them every year—but it is deeply depressing that there were 2.4
million incidents of antisocial behaviour across England and Wales in
the past year. That is a staggering figure. Those incidents range from
drug dealing to noisy neighbours and from littering to property
damage—the sort of crimes that can push individuals into more
serious crimes and drag communities into a downward spiral. I hope that
the legislation will fix that problem, which our constituents feel
strongly
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T20:16:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

was expecting a measure on dangerous dogs. That was not mentioned in
the Gracious Speech, but I understand that it will be covered in the
antisocial behaviour Bill. Those of us who were here when Lord Baker of
Dorking introduced the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 know that it was in
response to a terrible incident in which someone was killed. The media
take an interest when a dog savages someone, but the measure on
dangerous dogs is important.

I counsel the hon. Gentleman and a number of other Members who have

make a decision on a proposal that, of course, I will not support. I am
sure the hon. Gentleman would take the same position, although
unfortunately he will not have a vote. However, the way it halts all

Queen’s Speech of a failure to govern in the national interest.
This should not be a party-political issue. The evidence of harm is
known, we accept that that harm is likely to be greater if someone
takes up the habit in their early years, and we recognise the
attractiveness of advertising as more likely to influence the young and
impressionable. Other western countries have already taken a lead

the legislation has not been used as an opportunity to tackle issues
that our constituents talk to us about all the time: rising energy

OFT report earlier this year was utterly damning in its review of the
industry. It stated that almost a third of loans taken out in 2011-12
had been rolled over at least once, and that those loans accounted for
almost half of lenders’ revenues. Nearly 20% of revenue came
from 5% of loans that had been rolled over four times or more. The
obvious conclusion was that too many people were being granted loans

us not forget that the OFT inquiry started after the industry stated 
<?notus-xml column=97?>that it would toughen up its codes of practice. As
Ministers are well aware, more than one trade group represents that
sector, and they do not represent all practitioners. Therefore, a
voluntary approach was never going to provide the protection needed by

spent 18 years in the property business before I came into the House,

place the taxpayer at considerable risk of fuelling rocketing property
prices in the parts of the country that do not require it. At the same
time, it fails to address the shortage of houses, which is at the root
of the problem in our housing market. It does not change our housing
market so that we have greater control in the long term over the
private rented market and more stability, and it will not mean that
people can buy houses when they can afford to do so. Many people,
particularly younger people, no longer have types of employment that
offer the security that gives them the confidence to buy.</hs_Para>

a better way is for the Government to invest in social landlords and

mean that local authorities can borrow money perfectly reasonably and

tackle the housing crisis, which is at the root of many of the problems
we encountered before the bank crash. Unless we are serious about them,

we should be a safe haven for those who seek asylum, and those who are

therefore need to encourage people to come to this country who can give

problem—whether it be signal failure, a fault on the line or a
broken down train —will cause delays of three to five hours. At
least at Euston station one is under cover. At Lichfield Trent Valley
station we do not have cover, so unless one is under the railway bridge

have to say that the Government did themselves no favours in 2010 when
they argued that the reason for HS2 was to shave five minutes off the
journey from Birmingham to London. That is not the reason for HS2. They

time and valueless. A very senior person in the Department for
Transport—I dare not mention his name—said to me two or
three weeks ago, “Michael, I see people on trains working on
computers. Myself, I just stare out of the window and look at the
cows.” The point is that even that activity is valuable time.
No, the reason for HS2 is the north-south capacity problem on the west

Fabricant:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Their homes
are not just blighted now—they have been blighted for three
years, even since this God-forsaken route was published. I know elderly
people who want to downsize, but cannot sell their homes. They are now,
one might say, asset rich, but very cash poor. They cannot afford the
homes they live in as they are retired, and they cannot sell them
because they are blighted. It is essential that the Government are
generous and swift in their compensation. I welcome the paving Bill,
because it will, I hope, enable swift compensation. The Government are
currently conducting a compensation consultation on phase 2. I do not
know whether you responded to the phase 1 consultation, Mr Speaker, but
I did. It was very tightly worded to such a degree that in the
end I began to ignore the questions being asked,
because I thought they were completely wrong. The phase 2
consultation has been formulated much more openly and
satisfactorily.</hs_Para>

trying to find out from the Department for Transport whether, when it
finally reaches a conclusion on the phase 1 and phase 2 compensation
consultations, the compensation packages will be the same. I certainly
hope that they will be, because it would be grossly unfair if people
living south of Lichfield were treated differently. Incidentally, I am
in a unique position because phase 1 ends in the Lichfield constituency
and phase 2 begins there. A former chairman of the Conservative party,

in the pure, theoretical sense of what conservatism is all about. We
need to think carefully not about whether we need HS2, but about how we

to listen to the hon. Member for Lichfield (Michael Fabricant). I can
only imagine what it would be like if he really disagreed with the
Government: the vehemence of his attack would be something to behold.
He made some good points about the impact of the HS2 project and the
need to speed it up, as did his neighbour the hon. Member for Tamworth
(Christopher Pincher). Speeding up the construction would help the
economy, and the blight point was also well made. I live very near to
the route of HS1, and that will drag on and on. One of the lessons of
HS1 that should be applied to HS2 is the need to deal with
blight as speedily as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000110">This

Coldfield (Mr Mitchell) come out with the usual Government line about
politicians racking up debt around the world. He mentioned his business
background and referred to the need for not just cost-cutting but
top-line investment. However, he conveniently neglected to mention the
role of the banks around the world in contributing to the financial
crisis, and the fact that they lent money to people who could not repay
it.</hs_Para>

analogy illustrates the importance of investment. Without investment,
business cannot succeed. Similarly, it is the Government’s role

refer to the creation of jobs and growth, but there was precious little

Friend the Member for Glasgow North (Ann McKechin) accurately described
the current state of the housing market and the problems that exist not
just in her constituency, but all over the country. She spoke of the
lack of affordable housing, social housing to rent, and low-cost
housing to part-rent-part-buy or to buy outright. Developers want to
build the most expensive housing they can, because, of course, they
want to make as much money as possible. It is no coincidence that over
the years about 2 million houses have been sold under the right to buy
and we 
<?notus-xml column=103?>have a shortage of about 2 million affordable homes. We unquestionably
have a housing shortage, and according to the Homes and Communities
Agency, affordable housing starts collapsed by 68% in the financial
year 2011-12. We have seen an increase in homelessness and
rough-sleeping, which is particularly affecting families and
children.</hs_Para>

is not that use of Government-backed mortgages one of the reasons why
we ended up in a financial crisis in the first place? We all remember
Northern Rock and 125% mortgages in this country.

the Chancellor chose to ignore the advice and plough on regardless, and

calls for him to ignore any advice from the IMF and to carry on
regardless, but for my constituents that would mean more austerity. It

There was no suggestion of how the economy might grow so that public

important factor on which he should be judged. Many Government Members
want deeper spending cuts, but just a few weeks ago thousands of people
earning more than £150,000 a year, including many millionaires,

30% of those in social housing will be affected by the bedroom tax, and
offering discretionary payments is simply not good enough. The housing

that money does not go anywhere near far enough. People are facing real
hardship, and the measure has only just been introduced.</hs_Para>

work in his work capability assessment, despite having a degenerative

troubling for everyone. That sums up some of the problems that people
face. My constituent also now has to pay council tax for the first
time. She used to work, but when she goes for an interview now people
take one look at her and say, “No, I’m sorry, we
can’t employ you”, because they assume that it will be
difficult for someone with spina bifida to do the work that she has
applied for, although she is extremely well qualified. She has no

have helped the economy in my constituency. When the Government took
office in 2010, however, they scrapped Building Schools for the Future,
and that had a profound effect up and down the country. With school
building programmes not going ahead, the construction industry and the
economy as a whole were hugely affected. One school in my constituency,
Aintree Davenhill, was in the primary capital programme. The children
at that school used to have lessons in disused aircraft hangars made of
corrugated iron. As one can imagine, it was boiling hot in summer and
freezing cold in winter, and it certainly was not an ideal
teaching and learning environment. The previous Government had
approved funding, but whereas phase one—the infants part of the
school—had been completed, phase two had not been. When the
current Government came into office, they stopped the funding for phase
two. Fortunately, Sefton council, which had sufficient capital in
reserve for a primary school, stepped in to fund the rest of the
project. I was lucky enough to go to the opening two weeks ago of the

the point about the importance of investment in the economy. There was
not enough in the measures announced in the Queen’s

economy and to get the growth we need. Ultimately, to get the deficit
down, we must have growth. We must have the investment now; it will not
wait. We have had three years of delay. We need immediate investment in
construction, in housing and in the kind of projects that we have been
discussing in the past hour or so. It is also important that we
consider the measures that my right hon. Friend the Leader of the
Opposition and the shadow Chancellor, my right hon. Friend the Member

support for small business.</hs_Para>

final plug for small business. I ran a small business for 15 years and
many small businesses in my constituency—not only in
construction, but throughout the economy—need growth and the
support of Government investment to succeed. Small businesses will
create the jobs; they will be the key drivers of the economic recovery
that we desperately need. It is no good lending going just to the
medium-sized and large companies that are already financially
successful and have lots of money in reserve. There must be proper
support for the smallest of businesses, and I urge the Government to
take that point on board as well as the other points that I
have made about investing in the
economy.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-05-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_05_08_PT_1/A75650A5F4C382A7B93ED0DFA32441D6357E2360" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 May 2013">Wednesday

expressed those reservations about HS2, I welcome almost everything
else within the Gracious Speech. My principal point is about the draft
care and support Bill. To see that Bill finally being introduced in
this Session of Parliament is very welcome. I remember well the shock
and horror of many of my former patients when they realised that if
they had assets above the threshold of £23,250, they would
receive absolutely no support with their care needs. We know that one
in 10 families face losing more than £100,000 of their income
just to care for a relative, and that very many people end up having to
sell their homes to pay for their care needs. So, such a massive
increase in the asset threshold and a cap on lifetime costs is very
welcome, particularly because those measures will encourage people to
come forward at an earlier stage to seek the help that they need. In
turn, that will help to reduce unnecessary admissions as well as
helping people to remain as independent as possible for as long as
possible.</hs_Para>

the Bill will introduce support and proper assessments for carers, not
only for adult and elderly carers but for child carers, who suffer and
are robbed of so much of their youth as a result of their caring
responsibilities. I am looking forward to seeing the detail in the
Bill, and I very much enjoyed being part of the Joint Committee
on the draft Bill that made recommendations to the Government; I hope
that many of those recommendations will be included in the Bill when it
is placed before Parliament.</hs_Para>

particularly welcome the fact that there will be compensation for the
victims of mesothelioma who cannot trace an employer and for those
whose employer has gone out of business, or who do not have any
insurance. It is particularly cruel that they receive no access to any
compensation, despite mesothelioma being almost entirely attributable
to asbestos exposure. But, and this is a big but, how ironic that while
providing fairness and support for one type of lung cancer we are
failing in this Queen’s Speech to address preventing a far more
common type of lung cancer—failing to address how we are going
to stop the next generation of smokers coming on stream. We should bear
in mind that every year 200,000 children take up smoking. Those
children will be at risk of going on to face a lifetime of problems. We
know that 100,000 people a year at least are dying as a result of
smoking-related problems. The failure to take forward plain packaging
is a huge missed opportunity.</hs_Para>

clarify one thing: there is nothing plain about so-called plain
packaging. I would encourage everyone to google what plain packaging
looks like. Plain packaging sets out very clearly what is involved. It
sets out the disease and suffering that people will face if they do not
address their smoking. My experience as a doctor was not so much that
people feared the thought of death, but that they most feared the
process of dying. The process of dying from many smoking-related
illnesses is hideous. We are not just talking about lung cancer. We are
talking about, for many people, the years spent in a kind of living
death, tied to an oxygen cylinder, suffering from end-stage chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease and many other conditions; or the
suffering that comes from needlessly losing a leg from arterial
disease. Smoking is a leading cause of blindness. There are many
effects of smoking—all entirely preventable. So-called plain
packs spell that out graphically, and to anyone who hands around such a
pack, it is quite beyond a simple public health message. It is a very
graphic
message.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000145"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bill Esterson" PimsId="5716" UID="13050849000293" xid="1148" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000293">Bill

Wollaston:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention. Indeed, this is about protecting children, and that is
what we should focus on. It is not about introducing a nanny state. The
so-called plain packs would not necessarily change the habits of a
committed lifetime smoker, but they are aimed predominantly at
deterring the next generation. I feel this is a missed opportunity, and
I very much hope that as further evidence emerges from Australia, the
Government will reconsider their position and send a very sensible
public health message.</hs_Para>

have commented that the Gracious Speech is not just about setting out
what legislation will be introduced; it is about sending a message on
the direction of travel. My very clear view is that Government’s
core business does include public health. Members know that I feel
strongly about minimum pricing for alcohol. I am not trying to be the
nation’s supernanny here— I enjoy a drink myself.
This is about trying to get rid of ultra-cheap
alcohol.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000148">In
my part of the country, we have shops that sell white cider with a
maximum price. They are not allowed to sell it for over 23p a unit. I
am afraid that is causing carnage. We have recently seen deaths of
rough sleepers in my community, and rough sleeping is very closely
associated with dependency. We know that as people start to lose
control of their drinking, they start to target cheaper and cheaper
alcohol. We know that the heaviest drinkers spend 40% less per unit on
their alcohol. Just as with the smoking issue, this is not necessarily
about saying that it is always possible to save everyone who has become
a dependent drinker. We know that 40% of dependent drinkers will,
whatever happens, be unable to control their drinking and will lose
their life as a result of their dependency. It is about trying to help
those who are starting to lose control of their drinking. 
<?notus-xml column=109?>It is about helping those who are right at the beginning of the journey,

argument goes beyond the public health message and towards what alcohol
dependency is doing to our communities. We know, for example, that
there are 705,000 children in this country living with a dependent
drinker—not just a hazardous drinker or a harmful drinker, but
somebody who is dependent on alcohol. We also know that in 40% of child
protection cases, alcohol is a key part of the problem. We know that
nearly half of all violent crime is partly attributable to alcohol, as
I know from my experience of seeing victims of crime and domestic
violence. We know that a huge number of those who are victims of
domestic violence report that alcohol directly caused or significantly
worsened that violence.</hs_Para>

are paying for that. It costs us a staggering amount—about
£21 billion a year just within our health service. I welcome the
suggestion from the Secretary of State for Health that
members of the Front-Bench team should spend time on work
experience, and I suggest that suitable work experience for all members
of the Front-Bench team would be a Friday night in casualty. If they
really want to see what is causing delays in casualty departments at
the weekend, they need look no further. Perhaps they would like to go
out with the special constables in my area, who tell me that all their
time at the weekend is spent dealing with alcohol-related crime and

final point that I would like to make about the subject is that it is
an important cause of health inequality. To all those who say that
minimum pricing penalises the poor, I would say that it is the poor who
are suffering the most as a result of ultra-cheap alcohol. There are
many reasons why we need to address the problem. If alcohol harmed only
the individual who was drinking, that would be purely a matter of
personal choice, but the wider harm is caused by the ripples that
spread out from the individual who is losing control of their drinking,
affecting those closest to them, their wider family and their
community. So there are good reasons for saying that this is
fundamental and core Government
business<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000152" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000152">I
feel very disappointed that such a well-evidenced measure has been
dropped from the agenda. It is not good enough to say, “We have
not made a decision.” Continually kicking a ball down the road

that alcohol-related measures come back as “any other
business” within the legislative programme.</hs_Para>

call on the Government particularly to look at the emerging evidence
from Canada. Apart from the myth from the alcohol industry that such
measures would make alcohol unaffordable, which is not the case, other
myths are perpetuated. We need to challenge those. What we have seen
clearly from states in Canada that have introduced a floor price is
that following a 10% rise in the floor price there is a 32% reduction
in deaths directly caused by alcohol. That is important evidence. There
has also been a decrease in alcohol-related hospital admissions. Let us
look at the evidence and have evidence-based policy, rather than
listening to the power of
lobbyists<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
vital that we look at the power of the alcohol lobby and the way that

policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000154"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T21:19:25"></hs_TimeCode>I

course is where Members of Parliament should be, we might consider that
Twitter can reach parts that other tools cannot. In particular, if we
look at the tools that others use, and at the power of the lobbying
industry, we will see that MPs need to use every tool at their disposal
to fight for the causes they believe in. Public health is fundamental

Members might recall that last year the Wales Office published a Green
Paper on future electoral arrangements for the National Assembly. Its
main suggestion was that the Assembly might change to an Assembly of 30
constituency Assembly Members and 30 regional list Assembly Members.
The Government’s intention was straightforward: having
gerrymandered the Westminster boundaries in Wales and
reduced the number of Welsh MPs by 25%, they hoped also to
gerrymander the composition of the Welsh Assembly. Their objective was
clearly to prevent the future election of a Labour Government for the
National Assembly. However, as we all know, the ERA Bill was
amended so that the Conservatives’ attempt to change the
constituency boundaries and the number of MPs was

Assembly’s electoral term at five years, rather than four, as it
is currently, and it will allow individuals to stand as
candidates for both a constituency and a regional list. The fixing of
the term at five years is probably relatively uncontentious, but I
think that it is wrong that individuals might be able to stand for both
a constituency and a regional list, because that will mean losers can
be turned into winners. In other words, someone can be rejected in a

then, do we have in the Queen’s Speech? One of the more
significant elements is the promise to introduce further legislation on
immigration. I feel that Labour Members will probably support a number
of the measures that the Government introduce. However, it is likely
that the impact of many of those measures will, by definition, be very
limited. I am concerned that by placing such an emphasis on
immigration, the Government may convey a wrong impression about the
difficulties that this country faces, possibly in the context of the
fact that from 1 January there will be free movement of labour from
Romania and Bulgaria. It is right that people’s understandable
concerns are addressed and that safeguards are put in place, but in
some quarters of our political life and the media we are coming very
close to whipping up unnecessary fears among people in a rather
irrational way.</hs_Para>

nothing to stop the exploitation of migrant workers and the

non-enforcement.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T21:29:34"></hs_TimeCode> also want the

would suggest to those hon. Members present for this important debate
that the most memorable occasion during the previous
Parliament—it will live long in my memory for many Parliaments
to come—was when Aung San Suu Kyi addressed both Houses of
Parliament. Her brave and long fight for freedom and democracy
represents our strong and vibrant hope for the future of
Burma<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T21:32:19"></hs_TimeCode>.
Today’s state opening has shown that Parliament does pageantry
well, but Aung San Suu Kyi spoke of how Parliament is also a beacon for
freedom and democracy. It is, therefore, appropriate that this first
end-of-day debate will shine a light on the human rights situation in
Burma<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-08T21:32:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050849000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0003.htm#13050849000175">Ministers
have been diligent in pressing the Burmese Government to improve their
human rights record. We must recognise the importance of the United
Kingdom’s approach to a country that is far from these shores:

Gentleman that one of the fundamental issues for humanitarian access,
or the lack of it, is the question of citizenship. The way things are
practised and the reality of people’s everyday lives is like
apartheid. As well as the need to address the catastrophic humanitarian

its predominantly Rohingya population, has been one of the most
persecuted areas. It is striking that Médecins sans

in the world most at risk of extinction. When one considers 
<?notus-xml column=114?>that there are approximately 1 million Rohingya in Burma,

the hon. Lady said, aid is an important responsibility of the UK

major donor country for internally displaced people and are very much

ensure that the aid gets to the right places. I therefore call
on the UK Government to work alongside the Burmese Government and
non-governmental organisations to continue to provide that aid and to
ensure that there is an increase in the emergency aid for the tens of

balanced with the need to encourage Burma along the way of democracy

robust, independent investigations. We must work alongside and in

the past year, Burmese minorities have suffered extraordinary attacks

Burmese army launched air strikes against Kachin Independence Army
troops in Kachin state in December. The strikes lasted nearly a month.

violations increased significantly, and 100,000 people fled their homes

One man told of how his wife was raped by Burmese soldiers and is

station, demanding she be handed over to them. At 1 pm, mobs looted
200 Muslim properties, destroyed two mosques and burned down
an Islamic school in the township. At 4 pm, three other villages were
arson attacked—three mosques and hundreds of Muslim houses were

lifted, they should take the lead to ensure they have not been lifted

decision a year ago to suspend economic sanctions against Burma was a
key step in encouraging the regime to continue down the road of
democratic reform. The decision on 22 April by EU Foreign Ministers to
lift those sanctions, except the arms embargo, recognises the
significant progress that has been made. By-elections a year ago gave
Aung San Suu Kyi and her party 42 seats in Burma’s
Parliament. Ceasefire agreements have been signed with 10 out of the 11
ethnic armed groups. We have seen many hundreds of political prisoners
released. Daily newspapers are now sold on the streets of Rangoon, free
from censorship. Those are real benefits to ordinary Burmese people who
want to live, work and raise their families free from fear. As Aung San
Suu Kyi herself said,</hs_Para>

it is right that we acknowledge the strides Burma has made towards
reform since President Thein Sein took office in 2010, it is also right
that we continue to express our concerns and take action. That same
balance has been echoed by those who have spoken in the debate. Human
rights remain at the heart of UK policy and our discussions with the
Burmese Government. By lifting EU sanctions, we have paved the way for
deeper engagement on issues of concern. Our engagement has, to date,
yielded progress in a number of areas. The United Kingdom is supporting
peace negotiations and reconciliation to turn ceasefires with ethnic
armed groups into political dialogue. In Kachin state, we are
cautiously optimistic about early engagement between the Burmese
Government and the Kachin Independence Organisation. We recognise that
a ceasefire agreement will require time and effort.</hs_Para>

of the EU Council conclusions—referred to by a number of

the need for action to address the conflict in Kachin state. The EU

the aftermath of the violence last year. We note the release of the
Rakhine commission report on 29 April into the causes of last
year’s violence, and we are examining its many detailed
recommendations —that deals with the point about our response
made by the hon. Member for Bethnal Green and Bow (Rushanara Ali). We
have consistently called on the Burmese Government to take action to
meet humanitarian needs, ensure security and accountability, and to
address the rights of the Rohingya people to citizenship. We are of

be moved to safe areas. Lobbying alongside the UN, the United States,
Australia and the EU, we have also strongly reinforced the
message—as I indicated a moment ago—that NGOs operating
in Rakhine state must be granted the freedom to operate, free from
bureaucratic constraints. We gave £2 million over the past

violence will be averted only through security and the establishment of
the rule of law, and we again call on the Burmese Government to uphold
those. All those guilty of having instigated, incited or carried out
violence in Rakhine state need to be held accountable for those crimes.

plight of the Rohingya, a people who have lived in Burma for many
centuries, will not be resolved until the long-term issue of their
citizenship is addressed. It is essential that the Burmese Government
uphold the rights of all individuals, including the right of the

out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13050850000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm130508/debtext/130508-0004.htm#13050850000030">As

about the violence directed against Muslim communities in other parts
of Burma. The attacks against Muslims in central Burma in March and in
Oakkan, near Rangoon, just last week point to a highly worrying new
trend. We continue to make our concerns very clear. More work needs to
be done by  
<?notus-xml column=126?>the Burmese Government to bring the organisers and perpetrators of
violence to account. Both Baroness Warsi and the Foreign Secretary
raised our concerns with senior Burmese Ministers on 15 and 16 April.

well as upholding the rule of law and ensuring accountability, the
Burmese Government must tackle the hostility underlying the recent
attacks. President Thein Sein’s speech earlier this week, in
which he called on Burmese citizens to stand up against hatred and to
reach out to those of different beliefs and backgrounds, will be an
important starting point. We have provided funds for inter-faith
dialogue in Burma, and will continue to do so, in order to build trust
between communities. We have encouraged the Burmese Government to issue
a formal invitation to the UN special rapporteur on freedom of religion

half a century of repression, the last two years have seen Burma make
progress towards the goal of being a freer and more democratic nation,
but as the House indicates, and as my remarks have set out, there is
still much to do to achieve greater democracy. To make progress, Burma
must deal with the ethnic conflict it faces and tackle discrimination
against minority groups. As colleagues know, this is not my normal area
within the portfolio, although I have spoken on Burma before and, as a
practising Christian, it pains me to see how religion is used, and
faith is abused, to separate people and inflict cruelty and wickedness
on others. We see that time and again in too many other places. We need
religious leaders of all faiths to speak out against such actions
constantly, so that faith is not abused in the way we have heard
described tonight.</hs_Para>
