nurseries more flexibility over staff/child ratios where they employ
suitably qualified staff. We have consulted on what those

politicians to listen to their concerns. I realise that the Government
are consulting, but given the scale of public opposition, especially
from parents and all those involved in childcare, will the Government

Farrington of Ribbleton:</Member></B> My Lords, there is a fear in the
country now that the Government know the price of everything and the
value of nothing, despite the response from professionals to government
proposals. They ignored the view of the police about police officers
being more important than the money spent on police and crime
commissioners, as well as the views of other professionals, for example
on the curriculum and history teaching, and even the health service,
which the coalition government manifesto promised would not be
reorganised top-down. When will this Government please start to listen
to those who know more than they do as a result of their professional
training?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:14:58"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13050924000669" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000669">Lord
Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, we have the tightest ratios in Europe for
under-threes. Other countries manage better childcare more efficiently.
Our childcare is very expensive and we are motivated to deliver
better-quality childcare and more choice for parents. These ratios will
not be mandatory; they will be in childcare facilities only where
suitably qualified staff are located and parents may choose whether to
send their children to those
facilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:15:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Deech" PimsId="4986" UID="13050924000670" xid="1903" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000670">Baroness
Deech:</Member></B> My Lords, are the Government aware that the working
mothers of this country do not have time to organise and lobby and that
groups such as Mumsnet are not necessarily representative? There are
women who go to work and who are ambitious and high up the scale; there
are women low down the working scale who cannot afford childcare. The
Government have to listen to working women who need affordable
childcare. I have been involved in setting up nurseries and, over 40
years, the ratios have changed this way and that way—more square
footage this way, more square footage that way—but it does 
<?notus-xml column=25?>not make a scrap of difference if you have well intentioned staff, and
you will of course have several staff in a
nursery<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:16:13"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I was a social worker of
some years, having begun my career in children’s departments. At
that time, more children were cared for by minders than are
now—the ratios were different. Certainly, the ratios have swung
back and forth. Will the Minister look carefully at the evidence which
shows that children need a certain ratio of carers of good-quality
training in order to gain the stimulation they need to go on into the
education establishment where they will benefit from 
<?notus-xml column=26?>their learning? If the Minister is looking at other jurisdictions, I ask
him to look particularly at the different training and pay of carers.
Although our care is expensive, there are other reasons for that
expense. I agree entirely with the view that if we have a different
ratio all that will happen is that child carers will charge the same
and have more children, and we will have poorer childcare with less
finance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000018"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:20:04"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13050924000681" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000681">Lord

my right honourable friend Kenneth Clarke. I count myself lucky in my

two of the big beasts of the Whitehall jungle, Ken Clarke and Jim
Callaghan. Since last September, I have had the opportunity to work
with the new Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary, my right honourable
friend Chris Grayling. I cannot pretend that there has been no change
in approach since last September, but from day one the new Lord

have clearly set out our priorities: first, reform of the criminal
justice system and the courts, putting victims first and getting the
various agencies around the table talking to each other. I am pleased
that the new Victims’ Commissioner, our colleague the noble
Baroness, Lady Newlove, has now taken up her post. We can also look
forward very shortly to the criminal 
<?notus-xml column=28?>justice strategy and action plan, which will show just how we are
joining up the different players and using technology to drive forward
efficiencies. We are also consulting on a radical approach to how we
treat our young people in custody. Despite fewer and fewer being
incarcerated, more than seven out of 10 young people sentenced to
custody still go on to offend again, so we have just consulted on a
fresh approach to dealing with these young people by putting education
at the heart of our youth justice system.</hs_para>

reoffending is the key challenge not only in youth justice but
throughout the criminal justice system. I have never doubted that
prison works, both in terms of punishment and protection,
but if we could break the cycle of reoffending the benefits for society
would be enormous. The high rate of reoffending does not ruin just the
lives of the victims of further crimes, very important though that is.
It is also a dreadful deal for the taxpayer. We spend £3 billion
a year on prisons. You do not have to be some woolly-minded
liberal—if that is not a contradiction in terms—to see
this as a bad return on investment if we continue to
tolerate a high rate of reoffending. The worst part is that,
at the moment, despite those sentenced to less than 12
months being most at risk of reoffending—I remind your Lordships
that women are represented disproportionately among that
group—they do not get help with rehabilitation. They are seen
off at the prison gate with £46 in their pocket and very little
else.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000034">I have,
earlier this morning, introduced the Offender Rehabilitation Bill,
which will extend our rehabilitation measures for the first time to
those serving sentences of less than 12 months. To carry through this
rehabilitation revolution, we intend to open up the market to new ideas

providers bringing new ideas and methods incentivised by their being
paid, in part, for the results that they achieve. I have
consistently said in this House that I have the highest regard for
the probation service and those who work in it. The public
sector part of the probation service will shrink,
it is true, but it will have great
responsibilities and increased status within the new structure. Before
the Labour Party weeps too many crocodile tears over the demise of the
old system, let me state again that we are using the powers contained
in the previous Government’s 2007 Act to carry through the bulk
of these reforms.</hs_para>

genuinely encouraged by the response of the voluntary and
not-for-profit sector in its enthusiasm for the opportunities to
deliver real changes and new ideas to the challenge of offender
rehabilitation. A number of noble Lords on all Benches have been
campaigning for years for greater support to be given to those
sentenced to less than a year; they have argued for better
through-the-gate services and for more effective and better respected
community sentences. I have to say to those noble Lords, very frankly,
that without these reforms, much of what they have campaigned for would
remain a pipe dream. With the legislation proposed in the gracious
Speech, they have a real chance of becoming reality. The blunt truth is
that we simply cannot afford the status quo, with offenders passing
through the system again and again—more victims hurt, more
communities damaged.

Timpson and Jo Swinson. The judiciary and local government have also
been engaged in the development of the family justice provisions in the

that child’s welfare, unless evidence shows that it would not.
This legislation seeks to deliver a system that is more responsive,
more efficient and in which more timely decisions are made to give
vulnerable children the stability and security to enable them to make a
success of their lives. I look forward to working with my noble friend

Smith of Basildon:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, for his introduction to the gracious Speech. He is quite right
that today’s debate covers a wide range of issues: crime,
policing, Northern Ireland, constitutional issues, the rehabilitation
of offenders—which the noble Lord spoke about in some
detail—and forced marriage. Those are all important issues but
it is clear that the headline that the Government 
<?notus-xml column=31?>really want from the gracious Speech is that they are tough on
immigration. After their rout in the county council elections last week
the Government are now on a mission to persuade the public that they
understand their concerns. The role of your Lordships’ House is
scrutiny—to see whether these measures really do what the
Government say they will. Will these measures make a difference? My
noble friend Lord Beecham will say more about the criminal justice
plans in his winding-up speech for the Opposition at the end of the
debate, so I shall start with the Government’s proposals on
immigration.</hs_para>

ensure that immigration, which is important for and to the UK, is
properly controlled and managed and is fair. However, the
Government’s programme promises to take action on issues where
action has already been taken, where other government policies make it
virtually impossible to deliver and where they have not yet worked out
how such action can be achieved. Nothing in the speech would tackle the
undercutting of local workers’ wages and terms and conditions or
the exploitation of foreign workers. Nothing in the speech would have a
real impact in improving the enforcement of the national minimum wage.
Where in the gracious Speech are the measures to tackle the abuse of
student visitor visas by bogus colleges or the backlog at the UK Border
Agency in finding failed asylum
seekers?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000050">The
programme includes legislation to ensure that Article 8—the
right to stay in this country because of family connections—is
not abused. We agree with that, and it is already in the Immigration
Rules which were passed unanimously last year when we said that it
should be in primary legislation. Those who do not have the right to
live in this country should be deported. However, while the Government
are talking tough, their actions do not mirror their words. Last year,
the Government deported 900 fewer criminals than were deported in
Labour’s last year in office—a fall of 16%. The backlog
in finding failed asylum seekers has gone up, and the number of illegal
immigrants deported has gone down. The UK Border Agency stated that in
40% of cases it has not been able to deport individuals because of
administrative problems with the Home Office and diplomatic
complications. Despite ministerial denials, therefore, it would be
foolish to believe that budget cuts of 34% and staffing cuts of 5,000
have not had an impact. Of course they
have<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:40:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Can the
Minister give an indication of how the Government propose generally to
tackle the issue and assure us that the proposed legislation is not

new

the issue of limited access to certain benefits for European Economic
Area national jobseekers and retained workers for six months, this is
already in current regulations and in DWP guidance. It is something of
a surprise that the Government have flagged this up as something new.
Can the Minister tell your Lordships’ House what the difference
is between the current law and the Government’s new
announcement? Where are the changes that the Government have heralded?
It seems to me that they are already in the guidance and that no real
difference has been proposed. This is a missed opportunity because
changing the habitual 
<?notus-xml column=32?>residence test would make a real difference. Although the test is
effective in the majority of cases, one practical change which could be
made quickly and very easily would be to add a presence test to clarify
absolutely that jobseeker’s allowance cannot be claimed in a few
days or weeks but that people will be expected to be in the country for
some time or to contribute before they get anything back. Surely that
would be more effective than the rehash which the Government have
reannounced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:41:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000052">We
agree with strong and effective action against those who employ and
often exploit illegal immigrants. Such behaviour is already illegal,
with fines of £10,000 for unknowingly employing each illegal
immigrant and the possibility of a prison sentence for knowingly doing
so. In so many cases the real problem is not the law but the
enforcement of the law, with 800 fewer businesses being fined last year
than were fined in 2010 under the previous Labour Government.
Legislation can only ever be effective if it is monitored and enforced
and in this case it is not. It is interesting that the Government now
want to legislate for private landlords to check the immigration status
of their tenants and to face fines if they do not and rent to somebody
who is in this country illegally. It would be extremely helpful if the
Minister could say something about this and shed some light on how it
will be enforced. Only a few months ago the Housing Minister, Mr Mark
Prisk MP, dismissed our proposals for a national housing register of
private landlords. Do the Government now intend to set up such a
register? If not, how do they expect to manage the checking and
monitoring of private landlords? Would it not be far more effective to
monitor and enforce standards in private rented housing and thus
prevent the exploitation of the vulnerable—proposals which the
Government have consistently
rejected?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000053">Similarly,
the proposals to restrict migrant access to the NHS seem very unclear.
As hospitals already have a legal duty to recover charges from overseas
patients, this, too, is a matter of better enforcement. However, the
notion that doctors will become an extended arm of the border force has
rightly been met with alarm by the Royal College of General

same applies to the Government’s proposals on crime and
anti-social behaviour. The Government are cutting 15,000 police

tackle crime and anti-social behaviour. While the Government boast of
falling crime, what becomes increasingly clear from evidence and
reports, some published last week, is that budget cuts imposed on
policing are leading to more criminals getting away with it. Last year
more than 10,000 crimes of serious violence were dealt with through
community resolution. That meant there was 
<?notus-xml column=33?>no formal sanction, no caution and no criminal record: just an apology

were very critical of Labour’s anti-social behaviour orders,
which I accept were not perfect. However, instead of reforming and
strengthening them, the Government have decided bizarrely to water them
down. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, said in his opening speech that the
Government want to ensure a faster and more effective response.
However, despite his claims that action could be taken in a matter of
hours, the proposals for a community trigger to replace the ASBO would
mean people having to wait until three separate complaints, or
complaints from five different households, had been made before the
agencies were compelled to take action. If we tell a complainant whose
life is being blighted by anti-social behaviour that nothing will be
done until there have been several more complaints, they will rightly
conclude that no one
cares<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:46:16"></hs_TimeCode>. We
understand how anti-social behaviour can blight people’s lives.
That is why we propose a 24-hour guarantee to ensure a rapid response

will raise one further issue on constitutional matters and
hope that the Minister will be able to reassure me. It is the
transition to individual electoral voter registration. All of us in
this House should—and, I think, do—want the widest
possible participation in all elections. Turnout figures of 30% and
even lower in local elections are truly shocking. Turnouts at general
elections are falling consistently and we should be concerned. There is
a general concern among all of us who wish to see the maximum turnout
in elections that the move to individual rather than household
registration will, if undertaken too quickly and without sufficient
safeguards and resources, lead to a fall in the number of people
registering to vote, and a loss of people who are engaged in the
political system. A transition date for a new type of register to come
into effect and go live has been set for 2016 but, during
the passage of the Electoral Registration and Administration
Act, the Government gave themselves a reserve power to bring the date
for individual registration forward to 2015 if they felt that the
transition was progressing well. Who is to make that judgment? In the
interests of transparency, and given the importance of the issue, it
should not be rushed but should be put before an independent assessment
of the impact. I hope that the Minister can provide reassurance on
this. Will he commit to ensuring that the Electoral Commission is asked

afforded by this debate on the humble Address, with its particular
emphasis today on the matter of equalities, to consider an issue that
was not directly mentioned in the gracious Speech but may well be
considered among those other measures that will have to be considered
by Her Majesty’s Government during this Session. That is the
question of gender equality on the boards of publicly listed companies,
which is currently being considered by the European Parliament. A
directive was considered by your Lordships’ European Union
Sub-Committee B during the previous Session, and a report on that
matter and the sub-committee’s consideration of it was debated
in your Lordships’ House. At this point, I remind noble Lords of
my interest as a member of that
sub-committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:52:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000065">The
directive proposes that a quota will be set at 40% to ensure that there
is gender equality on the boards of publicly listed companies within
the European Union, and that, if companies fail to achieve that,
sanctions will be applied against them. There is no doubt that
achieving gender equality on the boards of publicly listed companies is
vital. Much work has been done on that matter. Indeed, the report of EU
Sub-Committee B clearly highlighted the vital loss of talent if women
are not appropriately appointed to the boards of publicly listed
companies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:53:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000066">A
reasoned opinion was sent from your Lordships’ House and,
indeed, from the other place, to European institutions in November last
year, because serious concerns were raised about the nature of the
directive and, indeed, a potential infringement of subsidiarity. The
use of the reasoned opinion—the so-called yellow card—is
a mechanism defined in the Lisbon treaty that provides for a test by
Parliaments, rather than by Governments, of subsidiarity issues. The
yellow card, which was the first stage in that subsidiarity test,
required nine Parliaments in the European Union to send a reasoned
opinion raising subsidiarity concerns. Regrettably, only six did so, so
the mechanism to test subsidiarity
failed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:54:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:53:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000067">Other
concerns were also raised in consideration of the proposed directive
with regard to whether the European Union had demonstrated that there
was European added value by having a directive at European level

forward, two committees of the European Parliament are now considering
the directive and eventually it will come back to the Council of
Ministers to be finally considered, approved and then sent to national
Governments for transposition into domestic legislation. However, a
serious concern arises with regard to the broader approach that our
country has taken towards equality legislation. The Equality
Act 2010 permits positive action but defines positive
discrimination as unlawful and considers a number of potential
situations 
<?notus-xml column=36?>of positive discrimination, of which one is the setting of quotas; that
is made very clear in the Act. Under those circumstances, if the
directive was agreed by majority voting at the Council of Ministers and
returned to this Parliament for transposition, how would Her
Majesty’s Government deal with setting a quota in domestic
legislation, which would appear to be contrary to the terms laid out in
the Equality Act 2010 as it represents positive
discrimination<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T11:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000069">Serious
concerns arise beyond the important issue of ensuring gender balance on
the boards of publicly listed companies. If a quota were to be
established for that, would it undermine the standing of equality
approaches and positive action in other important areas of equality
legislation in our country, given that there is no quota for those
issues but there is for gender balance on boards? That could have a
serious undermining effect. Would the transposition and adoption of
this directive into domestic legislation require a change to the
Equality Act 2010 to ensure that setting quotas is no longer defined as
unlawful in that Act? Indeed, might other measures be required? One
possibility is to have a period during which a quota is allowed to
apply. This is certainly the case with regard to the Sex Discrimination
(Election Candidates) Act 2002, which permitted all-female lists for
parliamentary elections, European elections, certain local government
elections and elections to the Welsh Assembly and the Scottish
Parliament, but had a sunset clause which ensured that that provision
ended in 2015. However, it was extended to 2030 under an amendment to
the Equality Act

reason for raising this issue now is that during this Session of

Government have focused in particular on their proposals on
immigration. There are real complexities involved in removing a small
number of people who are considered very dangerous to us, but these
hard cases should not detract attention from the human impacts of the
immigration system. I will not forget the experience of joining the
wrong queue for immigration at Heathrow, having to wait ages to be
seen, and watching the distress of the families and elderly being
poorly treated by overworked staff. The administrative 
<?notus-xml column=37?>splitting of the UK Border Agency will be welcome if it aids efficiency
and speeds the processing of cases, especially as the so-called
backlogs in the immigration system often represent real people who have
been waiting many years for decisions, unable to work or contribute to
our society. The emphasis on law enforcement raises some concerns about
a presumption of guilt creeping into the
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000073">It may
well be appropriate to take particular measures to reduce the pull
factor for those contemplating coming to the UK, but the problem
remains of inadequate practical support for those, including families
with children, who are caught in the asylum system but cannot be
returned to another country. Further, in considering whether a foreign
national offender should be removed from the country, it is important
that judges retain their discretion to make judgments between
people’s Article 8 rights in terms of family life, and the risk
of harm that the person presents. Not everyone appreciates that many
organisations, including our own church, are global in reach, and it is
becoming more and more difficult to invite visiting bishops and
professors to make their contribution to the unity that we all
seek.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13050924000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000074">In the
Government’s proposals on curbing anti-social behaviour, the
rationalisation of the system is broadly welcome, especially with the
changes recently made in response to parliamentary scrutiny, but the
nature of the new injunctions and orders carries a risk of
net-widening. As many have pointed out, the measures proposed in the
Bill are reactive. The Government’s strategy needs also to
include preventive measures to address the root causes of anti-social
behaviour and focus especially on early intervention and active support
of family life. This is especially important because of the sanctions
attached to breach of the injunctions and orders proposed. There is
strong evidence that drawing children and young people into the youth
justice system can often do them more harm than good.</hs_para>

that the reoffending rate of more than 70% among young men in
particular is shocking. However, there are organisations such as the
church’s scheme in the Potteries that have succeeded, even in
the most difficult cases, in bringing that figure down to 10%. I am
sure that the Government will want to listen more carefully to such
organisations. However, the plans to contract out most of the work
currently done by probation trusts have perhaps been developed in
haste; and this major change, which will affect more than 200,000
offenders each year, on the basis of a relatively untried system of
contracting and with many questions unresolved about the effective
management of risk in a fragmented offender management system, is
itself a high-risk

citizens—in this country. The scandal forced the closure of one
high-circulation and profitable newspaper because of the action that
had been taken. Journalists and quasi journalists have been
arrested—about 100 to date—and 24 have been
charged.</hs_para>

the answer to those who say that as phone hacking is a criminal offence
no further action is required because the criminal law will look after
all that. The point is that the culture of newspapers, where phone
hacking was allowed and the results published, had to be changed. It
was for such reasons that the Government proposed their royal charter.
Even more important, that was why the House of Commons supported them.

is a much more serious point. The Government’s royal charter of
March has been subject to a barrage of black propaganda from the
newspapers that eventually produced their own royal charter. No issue

Leveson inquiry in spite of Lord Justice Leveson’s assurance
that there was no effect whatever. The poor old Hacked Off campaign is
portrayed as a deeply sinister organisation with unlimited funds 
<?notus-xml column=40?>to do damage to the British press. If anyone had any doubts about why
the Government’s course was best, we had only to look at the
tactics employed by newspapers whose self-interest is utterly clear.
The truth is that this has been a David and Goliath struggle, and the
Goliath has been the big national newspapers, which have had the

Bluntly, it will be seen as a defeat, and it is not healthy in any

views of those who are opposed. I underline that. I do not want to set
out cases as if this is a Second Reading debate. That is to come.
Suffice it to say at this stage that my personal view is that
Parliament should value people equally in the law, and that enabling
same-sex couples to marry removes the current inequity. A legal
partnership is not seen in the same way and does not have the same
promises of responsibility and commitment as marriage. There are many
same-sex couples, including those working in the churches, who view
marriage as fundamentally important and want to enter into that
life-long commitment. It is therefore Parliament’s duty to
enable that to happen, and in so doing strengthen the society in which
we live

the fundamental point that I want to make is not that. I want to see
this country setting an example of equality of treatment in a world

about this. Over the past months I have visited a range of cities and
countries around the world looking at the HIV/AIDS position. 
<?notus-xml column=41?>Whether I have been in Ukraine or Uganda, what has shocked me

opinion poll in this country suggested that many Christians in Britain
believed that they were a persecuted minority. I can only say that if
anyone wants to see a persecuted minority they should look at the
plight of gay, lesbian and transgender people around the world. As you
travel you go to countries where homosexuality is a criminal offence
and where people who are suspected of being homosexual are persecuted
and even forced to leave their family homes. In one country a newspaper
was dedicated to exposing homosexuals—to identifying them,
photographing them and publishing their addresses—so that the
local population could take action against them. In one case, this led

can go to countries where the most popular political cause is to
toughen up the laws against homosexuality rather than to modify them.
Action of that kind has been taken in Russia, while in Kampala a

homosexuality and a penalty of imprisonment for those who suspected
that someone was homosexual but failed to report it. You may feel that

do not think that one Act passed by this Parliament or one action will

some parts of the world what Parliament does may have some persuasive

the criminal laws against homosexuality were introduced into those

were the authors; we set out what the standards should be. It remains
the case that 42 out of 54 Commonwealth countries criminalise same-sex

Dholakia:</Member></B> My Lords, I am delighted that the gracious
Speech contains measures to reduce crime and protect national security.
As one who promoted the legislation on the Rehabilitation of Offenders
Act in my Private Member’s Bill, I welcome the coalition
Government’s intention further to legislate for reforms in the
way in which offenders are rehabilitated in England and Wales. I
congratulate the coalition Government on some of their major successes
so far, and I do not mind if my noble friend Lord McNally takes credit

first three years of the coalition Government have seen some important
steps towards achieving a fairer and more effective criminal justice
system. The Government have abolished the discredited and unjust IPP
sentence, legislated to reduce unnecessary remands in custody, reformed
the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act and given legislative underpinning
to restorative justice. Over the past four years, we have seen a
dramatic and welcome reduction in the number of juvenile offenders in
custody. Moreover, the rate of increase in the adult prison population
has slowed down. In the past three years, between 2009 and 2012, the
prison population has risen by an average of 1% a year compared with
2.5% to 4% a year during the period of the Labour Administration. I am
particularly pleased to note that the Government are developing a
determined strategy to divert mentally disordered offenders from the
criminal justice system into medical and social
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000102">So far,
so good, but we still face many serious challenges. Even after these
welcome improvements, the size of our prison population remains a
national 
<?notus-xml column=43?>disgrace. At the end of October 2012, 78 out of 131 prisons were holding
more prisoners than they were built for, and over 20,000 prisoners were
being held two to a cell in cells designed for one person. This country
now has 153 prisoners for every 100,000 people in the general
population compared with 102 in France and 83 in Germany. Far too many
offenders are still sent into custody for short sentences and then
released after no more than a few months. These sentences serve little
purpose. They are far too short for sustained rehabilitation
programmes, but long enough for offenders to lose their jobs and homes,
which makes them more likely to reoffend.</hs_para>

these prisoners do not receive supervision by the probation service,

prisoners<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:24:50"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
pleased to see that the Government are now consulting on proposals to
provide post-release supervision for short-term prisoners and I welcome
the announcement made earlier by my noble friend Lord McNally. However,
most of these offenders will be better dealt with by community orders.
These orders can provide a longer period of supervision and of work to
change offending behaviour than a short period of post-release
supervision would provide.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:29:27"></hs_TimeCode> prison

offenders. We need to rethink an approach which spends such a high

sense<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:25:55"></hs_TimeCode>. At a time
when all other areas of public services have to work within the reality

courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T12:26:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
Sentencing guidelines should scale down the number and length of prison
sentences except for the most serious crimes. They should remove prison
as an option for low-level non-violent crimes. Courts should be

low age of criminal responsibility from 10 to at least 12. I hope to

statistics on this point to the House yet again. Getting offenders into

reconviction by at least one-fifth. Drug rehabilitation programmes cut
the volume of reoffending by up to 70%.</hs_para>

employment and drug rehabilitation on release. Such a strategy would
help to move this country away from the unenviable position of having
the highest prison population in western Europe. In doing so, it would
help to concentrate resources on the measures that are most likely to
protect the public by rehabilitating offenders and reducing

Fortunately, in this country we do not have the problem of firearms
being widely available in people’s homes, as in the United
States. Gun crime is relatively infrequent and, in wanting to reduce
crime, the Government will be cognisant of this. However, noble Lords
may not be aware that two-thirds of gun deaths in America are suicides
and only one-third homicides—perhaps not what the Second
Amendment, which permits American citizens to own guns, had in
mind.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13050924000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000122">Our

there has been an upward trend since 2010. The highest rates of suicide
in men since 2002 were recorded in 2011. Recent studies have shown what
impact specific mental health service improvements have on suicide
rates, but there is also evidence that restricting access to the
methods used by suicidal people, including medication and guns, reduces
the number of completed suicides. Maintaining a strong government
position on suicide prevention at all ages and for all reasons is
critical and, I suggest, needs a cross-government

this Parliament took a historic step to protect citizens from abuse

introduction of effective, independent press self-regulation. I trust
that there really will be no looking back, despite attempts by editors

Tyler:</Member></B> My Lords, I first spoke in a debate on the then
gracious Speech in March 1974. I recall being mystified by that vital
penultimate sentence heard again today: “other measures will be
laid before you”. I could not then imagine that such innocent,
innocuous words could be so important, but on many occasions since,
they have proved to be the most significant warning of political
earthquakes to be anticipated—in Harold Macmillan’s
words, “Events, dear boy, events”. Those words today give
me— and, it would seem, many other Members who have spoken in
the debate—hope that there will be other vital measures excluded
at present from the text of the gracious Speech.</hs_para>

the noble Lord, Lord Lang, and the noble Baroness, Lady Royall,
referred yesterday to the absence from the gracious Speech of any
reference to reform of your Lordships’ House. For once, I and my
party shed no tears for that omission. We could hardly have expected
the resurrection of the Government’s 2012
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000147">However,
it is salutary to remind Members that, far from being defeated in the
House of Commons, as some members of this House have recently started
to claim, the Bill received a record majority last July of 338 votes at
Second Reading in the other place. Indeed, a majority of MPs in all
three major parties supported it: 193 votes to 89 in the Conservative
Party, 202 votes to 26 in the Labour Party and 53 votes to nil in the
Liberal
Democrats.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000148">I
agree with everything that my noble friend Lord Fowler said earlier. He
made an extraordinarily powerful case for the primacy of the House of
Commons in this debate, as also in the others to which he referred. Had
the Labour Party agreed to a programme Motion—any 
<?notus-xml column=51?>programme Motion—to ensure that the time on the Bill was well
managed, we would now, in May 2013, be faced with legislation which had
received Royal Assent, or which had been carried over, or a Bill which
was to be subjected to the provisions of the Parliament Act. I suggest
that the noble Baroness, Lady Royall, was being rather disingenuous
yesterday in failing to acknowledge the role that her party played in
postponing serious reform. The truth is that her party sacrificed
political reform at the altar of political opportunism. When its time
came to make a difference, it flunked
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000149">I
am certain that the matter of reforming this House will come back to us
in due course. Unless the result of the 2015 general election is a very
long way from the current state of the parties, there will certainly be
a majority in favour of reform. I hope that then, rather than
attempting to re-invent the wheel, the incoming Cabinet—whatever
its political composition—will simply reintroduce the 2012 Bill,
which was backed by such a huge majority in this Parliament, and get on
with the job in a workmanlike
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000150" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000150">Meanwhile,
to avoid any possible perception or accusation of personal interest, I
suggest that party leaders would be wise to make it clear that any MP
who voted to retain the fully appointed House should not expect to be
nominated to join us here. It would do nothing for the reputation of
either House of Parliament, or of politics generally, for them to be
seen to be rewarded for putting self-interest ahead of their manifesto
promises to the
electorate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000151">I
know that one “other measure” that many in this House
would like laid before us is progress on modest changes to the
membership of the House, along the lines of the Bill introduced by my
noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood. Through all the muttering about
this, I am never quite sure which Bill colleagues are referring to:
Steel mark 1, which would have converted hereditary Peers into life
Peers by abolishing the barmy by-elections, or Steel mark 2, which was
filleted for easy digestion by hereditary Peers even before it
completed its Committee stage in your Lordships’ House? The
latter would hardly change the current situation. After all, there is
already a retirement scheme—two Members have taken advantage of
it—and the only other provisions related to disqualification.
Anyone inside or outside this House who pinned their hopes on that
latter Bill relieving overcrowding or easing the entry of new Peers was
doomed to disappointment. Had the original Bill survived, I for one
might have been bemoaning its absence from the gracious Speech, but the
absence of Steel Mark 2 is no
loss.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000152" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000152">There
are two other commitments in the party manifestos and the coalition

and my Liberal Democrat colleagues in both Houses had high hopes of
progress on that issue. It was indeed the Prime Minister who, as Leader

the noble Baroness, Lady Smith, of Basildon, said, lobbying by and for
powerful interests—she may have been thinking of the Murdoch
empire—under both the previous and the present Government has
brought to the fore the urgent need to deal with lobbying. I understand
that Mr Lynton Crosby, who previously helped the Conservative party
when it was “the nasty party”, is reputed to consider
such issues as mere barnacles on the ship of state to be completely
ignored in deciding electoral principles. As an Antipodean, he should
know that too many barnacles can dangerously impede the smooth travel
of any vessel on a long-distance voyage. I prefer the view of Cameron
to Crosby, of the captain to the cabin boy, of the organ-grinder to the
monkey.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000154">Then
we come to the vexed issue of money and politics. Following firm
commitments in party manifestos in 2010, the coalition agreement
promised:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13050924000549" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000549">“We

interparty discussions have indeed been taking place, but apparently
without any outcome. We can hope only that they, too, will still result
in “other measures” in this Session. The current
situation is far from satisfactory. As a member of the informal
all-party group which advises the Electoral Commission, I have been
only too well aware of the yawning gaps in the present monitoring,
reporting and control regime when it comes to the funding of political
campaigning activity which falls outside the normal definitions of
party and candidate support.
An<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:02:11"></hs_TimeCode> enterprising
Russian oligarch, bored with football clubs, or some other maverick
multi-millionaire could completely distort the campaigns in 2014 and
2015. Buying political influence through third-party campaigning
organisations with vast sums of money, from outside the well
established rules for the parties, could take us along the discredited
road that they have experienced in the
USA.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13050924000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000155">To draw
attention to this unsatisfactory situation, and to emphasise that this
is certainly unfinished business after the excellent November 2011
report of the Committee on Standards in Public Life on this issue, I
and a number of parliamentarians from across parties have been
contributing to the preparation of a draft Bill. This will be published
for consultation next week at a seminar to be chaired by Sir
Christopher Kelly, newly retired as chairman of that committee. In the
absence of proposals from the Government or from those official
discussions, we can but hope that this draft Bill could still stimulate
yet another “other” measure for this Session. Certainly,
without appropriate legislation, there is a real danger that the
campaigns for the 2014 European parliamentary elections and for the
general election a year later—and their outcomes—could be
mired in controversy. Where then would be the promise of this
Government to take the big money out of
politics?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000156">I

March this year, the McKay commission report, or more properly the
report of the Commission on the Consequences of Devolution for the
House of Commons, was published. The Government had asked the McKay
commission in effect to deal with or attempt to solve the vexed West
Lothian question posed famously by Tam Dalyell, the MP for West
Lothian, in the devolution debates of the 1970s. Tam Dalyell pointed
out that, post-devolution, MPs from outside England could help to
determine laws that apply in England, while MPs from England would have
no reciprocal influence on laws outside England in the policy fields
for which the devolved Administrations would now be responsible. Sir
William McKay was a distinguished Clerk of the House of Commons from
1998 to 2002, and his commissioners are a most distinguished group.
Their answer is an interesting one.</hs_para>

commission report is a suggestion that whenever measures separately
affect England, or England and Wales, the voice of England is heard
before the final word is spoken by the House as a whole. As Professor
Yvonne Galligan, one of the commission’s members, expressed it
on “The Thoughtful Scholar” blog, the essence is
that,</hs_para>

the West Lothian question is not fundamentally insoluble. As the McKay
commission report quite rightly points out, the question predates
Scottish issues. It was in fact initially an Irish issue: these
questions were discussed between Parnell and Gladstone in the 1880s.
They could not resolve the difficulty, the reason lying fundamentally
in the fact that they could not define what a purely English question
was. I am not sure whether this problem does not still lurk behind what
is, in so many respects, a very impressive and interesting
report.</hs_parafo>

least signals quite clearly the existence of something: the growing
element of an English question in our polity. It is quite disturbing,
as your Lordships will see if they look at the commission’s
tables of English public opinion, that there is a growing 
<?notus-xml column=54?>impatience with, for example, the level of public expenditure in the
devolved Administrations. This is a matter which those of us who live
in areas governed by those devolved Administrations, as I do, have to
take into consideration. Those Administrations also have to consider a
sentiment of growing edginess in English public opinion—perhaps
not an explosive edginess, but an edginess that is certainly
growing—about what appears to be a double weighting of the
political class of Scotland, Northern Ireland or Wales: the sense that,
in principle, that political class has its own bailiwick, which cannot
be interfered with, but that it can also play a decisive role in the
affairs of England. In such a context, it is important not to add any
new cause for exacerbation between the devolved Assemblies and the
Westminster Parliament. As the noble Lord, Lord Lang, said yesterday,
co-operation is a two-way street.</hs_para>

that reason that I have been disturbed by the Northern Ireland
Assembly’s decision, as it seems, not to apply but to reject the
recent Defamation Bill, which was passed by Parliament. There are very
important reasons to be disturbed by this development. Perhaps
selfishly, as an academic, I would stress that one of the core elements
of that Bill is the attempt to expand the academic freedom of
discussion and to protect those who write for peer-reviewed journals.
It is very important for university culture throughout the United
Kingdom generally that such a protection should be there, for both
scientists and those who work in the humanities. It is important for
those who work in universities in Northern Ireland, as I in fact do,
that such a protection is there for them as well. In the struggle to
have good universities, which is fundamental to the economic success of
a region such as Northern Ireland, it sends out a bad signal if the
local Assembly displays itself as fundamentally indifferent to the tone
or substance of academic freedom as an issue.</hs_para>

that, of course, is the issue on which there has been much recent
comment in the press: that Belfast would now become the new libel
capital of the United Kingdom, London having lost its previously
perceived role as libel capital of the world as a result of the changes
in the law. If this were to happen and Belfast became, as the dark joke
now has it, a town called Sue, it will place enormous, and I suspect in
some way unfair, burdens on the local judiciary. It would send out a
signal that again would be disturbing. One of our media lawyers in
Belfast, Mr Paul McDonnell, unselfishly made the point than while it
would increase his income enormously if this gap and the status quo
remained, as envisaged by the Assembly, he would simply regard it none
the less as morally unacceptable. He went on to say that,</hs_para>

newspaper reports that the Members of Parliament from Northern Ireland
are uneasy about the McKay commission report. I can understand why they
might feel that way. MPs from the devolved regions will be very nervous
about anything that hints at all at creating a second-class status of
MP. It is a 
<?notus-xml column=55?>very sensitive question within the United Kingdom, even though the
report itself has tried to deal with it as subtly as it conceives to be
possible. However, I quite understand why the Northern Irish MPs are,
according to newspaper reports, uneasy and unsympathetic. As the
Troubles have receded as a kind of natural focus of obsession for our
MPs, the range of interventions made by Members of Parliament from
Northern Ireland across the board on different policy aspects in
Westminster life has been one of the most refreshing aspects of the
work of this Parliament. I understand their unease but, as the noble

Northern Ireland. The agenda now is of an altogether different
character. Is Scotland to remain part of the UK? Is the UK to remain
part of the EU? Is there to be a common understanding of marriage not
just between church and state but across the different jurisdictions of
this relatively small group of islands? These issues, in turn, raise
deep questions about national identity, questions which have enormous

interesting to reflect on the book that the former US ambassador to the

diplomat to be US ambassador at the Court of St James, he contrasted
the British and American approach to handling difference. He said that
in his country when people disagreed, they tended to go their separate
ways and do their own thing. The frontier spirit meant that there was
always new territory where you could set up on your own. By contrast,
the experience of living on a relatively small island had bred the
habits of accommodation, compromise and trying to rub along

Church of England could be seen, historically, as an embodiment of that
approach, trying, so far as possible, to hold people in, working for
the good of the whole community, not drawing tight lines around its
membership. However, increasingly it is not something that the church
finds as easy as it used to. Witness, for example, the temporary
failure last November to reach a way forward on women bishops. But what
we are experiencing in the church we see writ large in wider society.
The holding together of diversity in unity, with a common language and
shared frame of reference for public policy and community values, seems
to be something that wider society is finding even more difficult.
Various attempts to engage with this issue through the language of the
big society or one nation—fill in the blank yourself—do
not seem to have had much real effect. A growing tendency to grapple
with the challenge through defining ever more issues in terms of
enforceable, justiciable rights has not been entirely helpful because
it has tended to foster the notion that solutions are best found
through forensic arguments, when what is most often needed are
negotiation, mediation, accommodation, and reasonable give and

of social hardship and economic stringency, such as those we are facing
at present, can lead to the increasing fragmentation of society, the
polarisation of communities and an increase in the pressures which can
appear to be forcing us apart. Sometimes this is so quite literally,
when legislation and public policy have the effect, intended or
unintended, of forcing people from their home and disconnecting them
from existing networks of support and care at precisely the point of
vulnerability where there is the greatest need. This is because
communities that care for the young and the old and that have
sufficient energy to shape local public life, including public
services, exist where people are able to settle in one place long
enough to create 
<?notus-xml column=57?>trusting relationships. Relationships with neighbours, teachers,
doctors, shopkeepers, those who deliver the post or see children safely
across the road to school—they are the community. They enable us
to invest in making the place we live in together better. This means,
of course, that communities are also central to how we care for our
environment. It is communities with an investment in place that will
battle to get cars off their streets so that children can play safely,
band together to clean up their local park and get to know, protect and
love their local woodland and the wildlife it supports.

responsiveness, quicker to learn from each other, less inclined to
reinvent a wheel in every local setting and—fascinatingly, in
terms of my earlier comments about signs of a loss of generous
cohesion—taken up across the spectrum of different strands that
make up the complexity of the church. The fruits of such responses I
see right across my diocese in, for example, the work of street
pastors, the growing number of food banks and

Part of the problem that we face in trying to achieve a sense of
cohesion and mutual belonging in our society today is that the strong,
informal, local community and voluntary structures that existed even in
past decades have become more and more attenuated so that the balance
between 
<?notus-xml column=58?>local neighbourliness and state provision has been skewed unsustainably.
Her Majesty’s Government are right to recognise that this
balance has to be redressed, but the churches and the voluntary sector
are not in the business of replacing comprehensive provision with
patchy charity. What is necessary is that they are fully engaged in
shaping a language and a policy framework that respects and balances

coalition Government are to be congratulated on much of the content of
the gracious Speech, in that it certainly contains and confronts some
issues that have been ignored by previous Governments. Not least among
them is the existing situation in the UK, which has an increasingly
ageing and costly population and totally inadequate resources to
provide them with a dignified end to life. The state certainly has not
budgeted the necessary resources for them for far too long, and nor, in
the majority of cases, has the individual. If, to meet the existing
situation, the Government can genuinely provide a neighbourly way in
which we all share the responsibility of caring for this ageing
generation, preferably in their home environment, and if, in addition,
the Government can devise, for the long term, a scheme by which people
pay for such care during their working life and are therefore not
obliged to sell their homes to meet the cost, considerable progress can
be claimed. However—forgive the cynicism—I shall await
more detailed examination during the Committee stage of any such Bill
before I am sure of exactly how much progress can be genuinely
claimed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000178">There
clearly will be interest in and concern about the Government’s
plans to provide an alternative method of dealing with offenders who
would currently be given a year’s imprisonment. The concern,
which I share, is over the effect this will have on the probation
service. As I have mentioned in other debates, immediately the noble
Lord, Lord, Lord Carter of Coles, began his reform plans for that
service a few years ago, I would have looked for another job if I had
been a probation officer. So how many probation officers will lose
their jobs as a result of Chris Grayling’s plans? Almost
certainly the answer will not be good news for those officers or for
our quite invaluable probation
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000179">Having
said that, the interest of the scheme is in the realisation that a
short, costly period in prison serves no useful purpose at all. The
proposed scheme recognises that nearly 60% of these 50,000 offenders
reoffend. The Government propose to give their payment-by-results plan
to organisations that will mentor and supervise each offender.
Presumably the aim is to get them into a job or training and a place to
live as a basic beginning. Will this idea lead to a much earlier look
at the family history of offenders? If that were a result, I suspect 
<?notus-xml column=59?>that some useful evidence would be uncovered in many cases of the
offending background from which today’s offenders come, which
might help—I certainly hope it would—to press the case
for the early intervention policy of Frank Field and Graham
Allen.</hs_para>

immediate tasks in the Lords, I join other noble Lords in welcoming
many aspects of the Children and Families Bill, which your
Lordships’ House will be receiving shortly from the other place.
The earlier placement of a child with the right potential
adopters—the fostering for adoption policy—is clearly
sensible, as is loosening the requirement to find perfect ethnic
matches. The urgent need is for each child in that situation to have a
family. The expansion of the right of parents of both sexes to request
flexible working during the statutory maternity leave period is another
welcome step, but one must still hope for a more sensible long-term
policy which allows flexible working for parents throughout their
children’s childhood to become the norm. Equally important, in
light of the Government’s desire and incentives to encourage
more business start-ups, would be to make flexible working available
for everyone.</hs_para>

Atkinson in that report reminded me all too vividly of a very similar
situation which existed many years ago when I was, for some 20 years,
chairman of a London juvenile court. Whenever a youngster appeared for
committing a criminal offence, we would immediately adjourn proceedings
for a school report. In almost every such case the child’s
school attendance record was either appalling or non-existent. For,
alas, in those days too, the incentive for teachers to turn a blind eye
to disruptive or difficult children not turning up for school was
equally self-evident. I am glad to say that we always started with at
least one adjournment of the case to see if school attendance could be
resumed before passing sentence for the actual offence
committed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000183">Equally
worrying are other concerns of families with SEN children.
Scope’s recent report <I>Keep Us Close</I> points out that 62%
of the families it surveyed say that the services they require are not
available in their local area. Unsurprisingly, this causes 80% of these
families anxiety and stress. Scope is also concerned that
the Bill’s local offer does little more than require local
authorities to set out the support available—that is, a
directory of services—with no requirement on them to improve
either the quality or availability of such services. This will clearly
require more detailed examination of the Bill during its later stages.
Again, unsurprisingly, Scope is concerned that the accountability
measures around the local offer are

Trimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I will not follow the example of the
noble Baroness who has just spoken by referring to the contents of the
Queen’s Speech. My attention has been drawn to something that
was published a few weeks before the ending of the last Session. I
refer to a report that has already been mentioned by the noble Lord,
Lord Bew: the McKay report, entitled the “Report of the
Commission on the Consequences of Devolution for the House of
Commons”. As the noble Lord, Lord Bew, said, that report was
sparked largely as a response to the clear sense of grievance among
many people in England about how devolution has worked out.</hs_para>

sense of grievance is very real, and there is substance behind it in
that they have seen over the last few years a number of cases of
different policies and decisions being taken in some of the devolved
areas that have left people in England feeling that things are in some
respect unfair. That is a real feeling, and it should be addressed, but
I would hope that the McKay commission, in addressing this issue,
looked a bit more broadly at the issue in
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:32:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000187">One
point to make is that while there have been cases of significant
variations in social policy in a devolved area from social policy here,
if you look at the broad scope of policy you will find that those
differences occur in quite a minority of cases. In all the devolved
regions, the same broad scope of social policy that is brought in with
regard to England and Wales also occurs in the devolved regions. There
are a number of reasons why what is decided on in Whitehall still rolls
out into the regions as a whole. One of them is that, as noble Lords
will remember, people in some areas complain about policies made on a
postcode basis. That concern to avoid the postcode lottery applies just
as much to people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Their
expectations of social policy are set largely by the media. Of course,
in the United Kingdom we have a highly concentrated media, so
people’s expectations are largely set by the largely
Anglocentric, London-based media, and they expect to see the same
things happening in their
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:33:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000188">Another
factor that one should bear in mind is that the policies brought up by
Her Majesty’s Government are policies that evolve within the
Whitehall departments, which actually have a greater policy-making
capacity than their equivalents in the regions. This is particularly
true for the region that I am most familiar with, which is the smallest
of them all. Our policy-making capacity was limited. We knew that the
folk in London would have a broader range of persons to draw on to draw
up the policy. Therefore, the regions, and the public services in the
regional areas, tend to look to what is happening 
<?notus-xml column=61?>in the centre. The Arts Council of Northern Ireland, for example, is
separate from the Government, but when in the 1990s the Arts Council of
England started to focus very much on outreach, community arts and all
the rest of it—bingo, the Arts Council of Northern Ireland
followed exactly the same patterns and borrowed a lot of its paperwork,
such as application forms, from the Arts Council of England. There is,
therefore, a tendency in the regions to look to Whitehall for guidance
on
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:34:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000189">That
tendency is then reinforced by quite a significant mechanism that is
not terribly widely known about, and is not mentioned at all in the
McKay report: the joint ministerial councils. JMCs are brought into
existence by the Government here in London in order to involve the
devolved regions in the formulation of policy—in other words, to
get them to buy into the policy that will come from the Whitehall
departments. There is no statutory basis for the JMCs; it is simply a
practice. However, as so often happens in our case, the way in which
things are done matters as much as what is said in the print of
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:35:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000190" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000190">The
third thing, which cuts both ways because as one will see it helps to
explain why there are such differences as well as uniformity, is the
way in which the Barnett formula operates. Because Barnett relates to
increases in public expenditure in England, in effect it finances the
regions to carry out the policy determined in England. Increases in
funding in England will happen because of the policies that the
Government here adopt. Therefore, the money that goes to the regions is
the money that is needed to carry out those policies regionally. What
went wrong with Barnett, which the Select Committee of this House went
into a couple of Sessions ago—I was a member of that Committee,
which perhaps helps me in dealing with this—is that it became
clear that in a number of cases there was what we called a Barnett
bypass: the Barnett formula was not strictly followed, and some
regional Administrations were quite adept in persuading London to give
them extra money. The most successful at that was Scotland, because the
Secretaries of State for Scotland regarded their primary job as making
sure that Scotland did better than anywhere else, and they were most
effective at it.</hs_para>

course they do not: it was their Secretaries of State who did that. The
ordinary Member of Parliament did not need to do it for Wales and
Scotland because they were dependent on their Secretary of State. I
suppose that to a certain extent we did the same in Northern Ireland.

Lords will also notice that the principle also refers to decisions at
UK level. In fact, McKay’s terms of reference do not focus on
decisions. McKay was asked to produce a report on legislation. The bulk
of the McKay report deals with procedures in the House of Commons with
regard to legislation. There is a problem with the way McKay
understandably focuses on decisions, because decisions and policy give
rise to the sense of grievance. This morphs into the question of
legislation. The problem with the notion of separate and distinct is
how you define it. In paragraph 136, McKay says that separate and
distinct is easier to define in practice than in the abstract. No
effort is then made to define it in the abstract. Perhaps one can
understand
why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:40:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000195">However,
the issue has been looked at for decades within our government system.
It is a key part of the Barnett formula. Every time a policy evolves
from Whitehall departments, or a decision is taken, the Treasury has to
take a decision. Paragraph 44 of our report on the Barnett formula
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13050924000553" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000553">“When
making spending decisions for a project or event in England the
Treasury has to decide whether that expenditure is
‘UK-wide’ or ‘England only’. The decision
to categorise spending in England as ‘England only’
requires an exercise of judgment by the Treasury triggering a
‘consequential’ payment through the Barnett Formula to
the devolved administrations. By contrast categorising expenditure as
‘UK-wide’ does not trigger a
‘consequential’
payment”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13050924000511" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000511">The
report goes on to give examples. The example that it gives of UK-wide
expenditure is the Olympic Games. They did not trigger consequentials.
The example given by the report of expenditure in England on a national
policy was Crossrail. The money is spent in London. It is part of a
national policy of providing an effective rail network, so the
England-only decision triggers a Barnett
consequential.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13050924000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000196">I
am afraid that this gets a little complicated, because while McKay
talks about the separate and distinct effect in England that requires
special procedures in the other place, under Barnett terminology
“England only” triggers a consequential and so is not
separate and distinct from England. That is hugely important.
Unfortunately there is no discussion of this in McKay. The report makes
a couple of references to consequential payments as side-effects of
decisions. If it reflected more fully on Barnett and the fact that
Barnett consequentials are attracted by decisions that are
“England only”, in Treasury speak, it would see that the
number of occasions on which procedures to do with things that were
separate and distinct in England would be comparatively few and
limited<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:42:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Bew, said, there is an interesting history to this. It is mentioned in
only one sentence in McKay, which refers to the home rule Bills. The
noble Lord told us that the problem was just that Parnell and Gladstone
could not agree. With respect to him, I should say that the problem was
a little wider than that. There were three home rule Bills, and the
persons who framed the Bills had to put a provision into them relating
to this. They may have had difficulty working out the basis on which
they would take a decision, but they had to take a decision. Therefore,
in each of the three home rule Bills, a different decision was adopted
as to what to do with this sort of problem. I will not go through all
of them in detail.</hs_para>

summary, in the first home rule Bill they decided to solve the problem
by not having any Irish MPs in the House of Commons. In the second they
decided that that was not a good idea and that they would ignore the
problem so that all the Irish MPs would be in the House of Commons. The
third home rule Bill was not titled a home rule Bill because the
Government of Ireland Act 1920 was intended to apply to all Ireland but
was operational only with regard to Northern Ireland. Their basis was,
“We’ll have a sort of compromise, but we can’t
think of a principle on which to make a compromise so we’ll
roughly divide representation of the Irish area in the House of Commons
by half. We’ll just give them half the MPs that strictly

of those decisions involved a clear principle. I am not surprised,
because I do not think that there are any issues of principle in
dealing with this. The West Lothian issue, created by the flamboyant
Member for that area, was a marvellous bit of rhetoric in terms of its
argument, but the reality of the situation was that the House of
Commons decided that devolution was going to apply not universally but
to only three comparatively small areas, for particular reasons that I

is entirely up to our sovereign Parliament to decide that it is going

mind that they are not talking about the same things. There is only one
sovereign Parliament. The devolved Administrations are not sovereign.
They have a limited capacity that in no way changes the capacity of the
sovereign Parliament, which could, if it wished, legislate for the
devolved areas or decide to abolish devolution at any time, in which
case we would not need to look at things further. That is the

I leave the question of home rule, I will mention one little
side-effect. It is another issue that people might like to look at.
Between the various home rule Bills, another area that was deeply
discussed was the fiscal powers of the devolved Administration. The
view of what fiscal powers could be devolved to the Administration
changed with each of the three Bills. It got narrower as it went on. I
hope that the people who in some Scotland-related areas talk about 
<?notus-xml column=64?>devo-max will look at what was thought about this when those Bills were
considered. They will find that the view taken then was that the scope
in fiscal matters for what is now called devo-max was very limited. I

final point is that one of the ironies of the situation is that, at the
end of the day, devolution was considered necessary in those areas
because of the way in which England, by having 85% of the population of
the United Kingdom, had become so dominant that the London-based
Administration repeatedly failed to take local circumstances fully into
account. Devolution was intended to balance that. It would be hugely
ironic and very damaging if, as a result and consequence of devolution,
special measures were taken in the House of Commons to see that the

measure I wish to raise relates to the way in which the private
security sector, which is increasingly important in policing and
safeguarding considerable amounts of public and private space, is
regulated in the future. Regulation of the private security industry
over the past eight years has been very successful. Do not take my word
for it; ask those who work in the industry. That is why there was such
an uproar in 2010 when, as part of the now infamous bonfire of the
quangos, the coalition Government proposed to deregulate the sector and
abolish the regulator. This was fiercely opposed, not just by most of
the industry through its major professional bodies but by the Scottish
Government and by the Northern Ireland Office. In the end, the
Government agreed that although they would abolish the Security
Industry Authority in its current form, this would be as part of a
transition to a new regulatory regime in which businesses would play a
more active role. This was something I had been advocating for some
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:49:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000205">We
were told that this would be a speedy transition. Indeed, I was told in
no uncertain terms by the Home Secretary herself in early 2011 that
this change was regarded by the Government as urgent and had to be
completed by the end of 2013 at the latest. When I protested that this
was a very demanding and possibly unrealistic time scale, I was firmly
told that completion by the end of 2013 had to be the target. Now here
we are in May 2013, and how far have we got in the transition process?
We have seen no legislation thus far, and nothing definite has been
promised in the Queen’s Speech. Not surprisingly, private
security companies are clamouring for progress, particularly in regard
to what they and the Security Industry Authority wanted in
2010—namely, a move to licensing businesses rather than
individuals. It has repeatedly been promised by the Home Office, and
may indeed be brought about through secondary legislation in the
autumn, but the problem is that secondary legislation would not enable 
<?notus-xml column=65?>a new regulatory body to be established or allow for a full and
effective range of sanctions and penalties to enforce the move to
business
licensing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:51:00"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:50:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000206" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000206">I
fear that the Government have impaled themselves on a hook of their own
making. There is an obsession with deregulation, and we are promised a
Bill to reduce what is perceived to be the excessive regulation on
businesses. This is no doubt making it extremely difficult for the Home
Office to sell the move from individual to business licensing to the
Cabinet Office and the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills,
since this could be seen as increasing the regulatory burden on
industry rather than reducing it. But to move to business licensing in
the private security industry through secondary legislation without the
capacity for enforcement of the new regime through appropriate
penalties and sanctions will not be effective, which is why private
security businesses are so anxious to see primary legislation deliver
the transition to the regime that was promised in 2010. Recent research
reveals why they see this as so important. A group of businesses that
were surveyed about regulation, including small private security
companies, said that they wanted not less but better regulation, to
ensure that higher quality, compliant firms were not undercut by
cheaper, unscrupulous operators. Business licensing without proper
sanctions to enforce the regime will not avoid this danger, so instead
of obsessing about deregulation, the Government should commit
themselves to introduce the necessary primary legislation to underpin
the licensing of private security businesses. In addition to an
appropriate and effective range of penalties and sanctions, the new
regulatory body that is established will also need to be equipped with
effective gateways to national bodies, such as Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs, the National Crime Agency and the Home Office with
regard to the right to work, to enable it to work effectively with
major partners in the fight against fraud and crime. I hope that the
Minister will be able to give an indication at the end of the debate as
to how soon such primary legislation can be
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000207">Another<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:53:14"></hs_TimeCode>
casualty of the new coalition Government in 2010 was the regulation of
private investigators. This was ready to be brought in in the spring of
2010, but the incoming coalition Government immediately halted the
work. Before too long, of course, the Leveson inquiry showed the folly
of the delay. Private security industry regulation was introduced in
2001 to protect the public, and it must be extended to include private
investigators as a matter of urgency. The relevant professional bodies
want it, the regulator is ready to work on it, and I would be most
grateful if the Minister could tell me when this urgent measure will be
introduced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000208">The
private security industry clearly recognises the need to raise
standards across the industry and has worked hard in recent years to
introduce more professionalisation and chartered status for industry
bodies and individuals. There are now over 750 approved contractor
companies, covering around two-thirds of the workforce in the private
security industry. What have the Government done to encourage this
trend? In Scotland, to win a contract funded by the public sector, a
company has to have approved contractor status. The Scottish Government
have insisted on it, 
<?notus-xml column=66?>but no such provision exists in England. Yet it is absolutely essential
that the Government work with the industry to raise standards, because
the public increasingly rely for their safety in public places on
private security. Whether in shopping precincts, on industrial estates
or university campuses, at sports grounds or large outdoor festivals
and concerts, or around night clubs and bars, private security
companies police and secure the space. What is often an ill informed
debate about outsourcing police activities misses the point that
significant partnerships between the police and the private security
sector already exist, and they already operate effectively in
protecting the public. One outstanding example of such collaboration is
Project Griffin, pioneered in the City of London but now rolled out
nationwide, in which security guards working in urban centres and
around sensitive sites are specially trained and briefed by the police
on a regular basis to alert them to ongoing security and other threats.
This partnership worked extremely effectively during the Olympic Games,
and it continues to underpin public safety across the

is because the private security industry already plays such
a major role in protecting the public that the Government must play
their part by ensuring that the industry is effectively regulated and
that public contracts are awarded to high-quality providers and not to
those companies that put in the cheapest tenders by making their
employees work excessively long hours at minimum rates. We also need an
effective complaints mechanism where private security companies are
operating in the public arena alongside the police. I was very pleased
to hear the Minister, in opening the debate, outline that one provision
in the forthcoming crime and anti-social behaviour legislation will
extend the remit of the IPCC to deal with complaints relating to
private security personnel operating in the public arena alongside the
police. It is very important that the public know how they can register

Marks of Henley-on-Thames:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome proposals
in gracious Speech for legislation to reform the way in which offenders
are rehabilitated and the introduction this morning by my noble friend
the Minister of a Bill to that effect. Liberal Democrats have always
believed that increased concentration on the rehabilitation of
offenders can be a major contributor to
cutting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:58:27"></hs_TimeCode> crime. A
wider use of well run and well resourced community sentences can be far
more effective than putting ever more offenders in prison and keeping
them there for terms that are longer than necessary. Considerable
publicity has been given to the appalling reoffending rates for people
leaving prison, but the figures bear repeating. More than 57% of
prisoners released in 2010 from sentences of less than 12 months 
<?notus-xml column=67?>reoffended within a year; the figure for prisoners released from longer
sentences over the same period was just under
36<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:59:12"></hs_TimeCode>%. In
particular, as my noble friend Lord Dholakia pointed out, we imprison
far more women than we need, and there is evidence that many of those
we imprison would be less likely to reoffend if given community
sentences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:59:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000212">The
coalition Government propose to provide greater diversity of probation
services in the belief that a wider range of well targeted services,
involving the voluntary and not-for-profit sectors, as well as those
currently in the probation service, will produce more imaginative and
more effective delivery of community sentences and a better service for
offenders leaving
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:59:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:59:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T13:58:12"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, for these new arrangements to work well, they must be properly
resourced. Payment by results can be successful, but wider savings to
the public purse from cutting reoffending rates, not so easily
recognised by traditional Treasury accounting principles, may justify a
more flexible approach to expenditure in this field. The points made by
the noble Baroness, Lady Howe of Idlicote, lead me to stress the
importance of retaining the service of experienced probation officers
within the field, even if they are to work within new
structures<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:00:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000213">We
welcome the Government’s proposals to give support for the first
time to prisoners leaving prison after serving sentences of 12 months
or less. However, to achieve the best chance of rehabilitation on
leaving prison, prisoners need somewhere to live, something to do and
preferably family to go to. Many also need medium and long-term help
with mental health problems and drug and alcohol dependency. It follows
that if we are to help prisoners settle back into the world outside
prison, we must ensure that at least the last few months of their
sentences are served at locations close to the communities into which
they are to be released. Only then can through-the-gate services be
effective. The gate in question must be in the right place to enable
the care given to prisoners to be continuous through their preparation
for release and following their
release<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:09:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000214">However,
for the Government’s plans for rehabilitation to work, we must
continue to provide a fair and humane criminal justice system in which
offenders are properly represented by high-quality specialist
advocates. I declare an interest as a practising barrister, although
not now undertaking criminal work, but with many colleagues who do.
Just as the quality of justice in criminal trials depends on the
quality of the advocates involved, so the success of sentences imposed
on offenders depends heavily on the contribution of defence barristers
and solicitors in securing sentencing decisions for their clients that
can be made to work. It is therefore important on both counts that we
do not undermine the system by reducing the availability of
high-quality lawyers prepared to undertake criminal work, particularly
defence work, at modest but viable cost. I fear that some of the
Government’s proposals for criminal legal aid, on which they are
consulting, threaten that availability. The proposals for price
competitive tendering and generalised fee cutting present such a
threat. I expect that my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford will go
into greater detail

barristers, have in the past been attracted to criminal practice by the
opportunities for advocacy, the challenges and the excitement of

performing an important societal function. Traditionally, they have

in other fields of practice. However, there is a limit, and the
brightest and best new entrants to the profession will not opt for
criminal work if it is so underrecognised and underrewarded that it
does not offer them a reasonable living. They will simply opt for other
fields, perhaps less glamorous but financially more rewarding. After
all, they have a choice. Already most criminal judges complain that
there has been a significant decline in standards of advocacy in the
criminal courts over the past few decades because of the continual
rounds of real terms cuts in criminal legal aid rates. Creating a
demoralised corps of underfunded criminal lawyers will not only
undermine our criminal justice system, it will also prevent us making
the most of the other changes the Government
propose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:04:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000216">I
suggest that there needs to be a new settlement between the legal
profession and the Government on legal aid. The Government must
recognise the importance of retaining the services of legal aid lawyers
and paying them appropriately while the legal profession must accept
the need to provide services efficiently and cost-effectively and to
look for savings where they can be made. I give one example of where
innovative thinking might save money. The Government have rightly
pointed out the disproportionate amount of public money spent on
high-cost criminal cases. These are a small number of long-running and
complex cases, mostly fraud cases, which consume a very high proportion
of the legal aid budget. They require detailed and careful work by
senior and specialist lawyers. They are the interesting and challenging
cases which many ambitious younger criminal lawyers aspire to
undertake. Yet the consultation paper’s response has been to
suggest cutting the rates paid by 30%. The effect of such cuts would be
that these cases would be less well handled, aspirant lawyers would be
further deterred from criminal practice and the quality of the criminal
justice system would suffer
accordingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:06:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000217">Many
of these cases involve company directors and officers, many of large
and medium-size companies. We could consider funding the defence costs
in an entirely different way. Were we to introduce compulsory legal
expenses insurance to cover the defence costs of company directors and
officers prosecuted for fraud, a great deal of cost could be removed
from the system altogether. We do not object to compulsory insurance
for motorists; why not here? There are other areas where innovative
thinking can save money and government and the profession should be
willing to explore them. However, the endless drive to reduce spending
by indiscriminate salami slicing of legal aid rates will ultimately
destroy the system we are trying to
improve.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13050924000628" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0001.htm#13050924000628"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:07:01"></hs_TimeCode></I>2.07

for social cohesion built upon a strong economy and nourished by agreed
common values and, in the case of our society, the Judaeo-Christian
ethic, but, somehow, along the way the big society vision has been
forgotten and in its place we find division and great distress, as the
right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter mentioned
earlier—indeed, a “broken society”, to quote the
Prime Minister once more. Of particular concern to many is the
bewilderment caused by a law concerning same-sex marriages which will

particular concern at this point in the Bill’s passage is, for
the first time, the way in which the proposals effectively
institutionalise competing views of marriage in our society. Rather
than promoting social cohesion, this will lead to greater social
fragmentation. Far from ending the so-called battle over marriage,
these proposals will formalise and exacerbate that battle. The Bill
will lead to a scenario that is destructive for community, thereby
necessitating further change in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000222">How
did we get to this point? A commitment to legalising same-sex marriage
was not in the manifesto of any major political party at the 2010
general election. The Government have not demonstrated at any point
evidence that there was a great demand for such a change. The
Government produced a so-called public consultation on the introduction
of same-sex marriage but declared a timetable for the draft Bill and
its implementation before publishing the results of the consultation.
Their mind was made up. The consultation was never about whether
same-sex marriage should be introduced but how. The Government had
promised in the consultation that same-sex marriage would not take
place in religious premises. In the draft Bill they did the opposite.
The consultation cannot be described as a serious exercise in eliciting
the views of the
public.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000223">Had
the Government listened more and not engaged in a desperate bid to
paint all the opponents of this Bill as elderly Christians, a strange
breed of non-relevant dinosaurs, perhaps they would have started to
address these issues and picked up the chorus of disapproval from
those, for example, from our black and minority ethnic communities who
have, for no apparent reason, been excluded from the legislative
process. The Secretary of State was sent a letter by the leaders of
Britain's so-called black churches, but I understand that she

from their back-benchers but from thousands of their grass-roots
supporters. The local election results tell the story of a substantial
section of the public who are extremely worried about the effect of a
redefinition of marriage on family life and the well-being of children.
It is not therefore surprising that many feel that they have been

Williams of Crosby:</Member></B> My Lords, I begin by congratulating my
noble friend Lord McNally on an impressive attempt to deal with the
issue of offenders and the reoffending rates that are far too high in
this country. Let me ask him in particular whether he can say something
in conclusion about the fact that a large number of the young offenders
in this country are illiterate. More than half the young men and women
under the age of 20 who are in prison do not have the capacity to be
fully literate, and that makes it almost impossible for them to get
jobs, however hard they
try<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:14:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
delighted that my noble friend has said that education is now
increasingly seen as a key part of dealing with the whole issue of
offenders, but it is also important to recognise that it has been a
long time since we required young men and women in prison to undertake
adequate education which would give them at least the basic ability to
get some sort of job. It is therefore good news to hear these brave and
radical proposals, and I was delighted that my noble friend Lord
Dholakia, who has a distinguished record in the field, gave them such a
warm
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:15:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

address two other matters, however, rather than the issues of prison
and penal reform, which will be well covered in this House and on which
there are many experts in the area. Those other matters are, first, the
issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and, secondly, the even
more toxic issue—if I may put it that way—of
immigration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:15:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Fowler, had to say, many of us richly appreciate the
courage he has shown for many years on the issue of press behaviour and
the level of press complaints. Although it has served him no particular
use in his career, he has had the courage to continue to insist on the
crucial importance 
<?notus-xml column=71?>of addressing the issue of complaints against the media. In the past
couple of years he has had immense additional support as a result of
the emerging horrors of what some members of the press have seen fit to
undertake—and, frankly, what some proprietors have seen fit to
accept in the pursuit of larger and larger
circulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:16:22"></hs_TimeCode>.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:16:48"></hs_TimeCode> addition to
mentioning my great respect for the noble Lord, I also want to say that
he was one of the few who made it clear that the original Press
Complaints Commission was not doing its job and was at best papering
over some of the issues that needed to be looked at. He has now, in a
sense, come into his own with the Leveson
report.</hs_para>

about not only Home Office matters but also constitutional affairs.
Perhaps I may therefore say one word on that issue. It is of the
greatest possible significance that all parties in the other
place were able to agree on a solution to the problem of the
independence of the press versus the protection of victims from cruel
and sometimes brutal treatment. As we well remember, those victims

important to give true weight and accord to the relatively small number
of issues on which the parties can together agree on a constructive

possibly being seen as an ineffective rubber-stamping House to one
where—largely because of the remarkable work of the Select
Committees, and I have in mind the Select Committees on Public
Administration, the Treasury and others—it has shown its real
ability and talent in a way that cannot be limited or constrained by
the Whips. We have seen what the House of Commons might be if it were
given real respect for its decisions. Such respect should be shown now
over the Leveson report and the outcome in terms of a committee to look
at the press and the media. We owe a great deal to the noble Lord, Lord

reminding the Prime Minister that, in the light of what he has said,
the constitutional value of using Parliament—a united Parliament

which I want briefly to refer is the toxic issue of immigration. I was
in one or two areas during the recent local council elections, and
friends of mine were in other areas such as Somerset, where the whole

of Romania and Bulgaria, adding up to 29 million people, would
universally and collectively take some sort of Noah’s ark and
immediately arrive in Britain to settle down in one constituency after
another. Luckily for us, despite it having some considerable flaws, we
have the BBC. Through “Newsnight”, the BBC undertook a
serious and detailed study, as some of your Lordships may have seen, of
the likelihood of many Romanians and Bulgarians deciding to hurry over
to the United Kingdom 
<?notus-xml column=72?>to join the unemployment queues. One point that the
“Newsnight” study made was that less than 1% of Romanians
and 3% of Bulgarians showed any great desire to emigrate to this
country. Of those who did, 0.4% in the case of Romanians had made any
inquiries at all with recruitment agencies or other bodies about where
they might live or what jobs they might
get.</hs_para>

said that about the Romanians and Bulgarians, I shall turn for a moment
to what I believe to be one or two of the serious problems that have
arisen in this country due to the nature of our immigration policy,

opportunism<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:21:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

want to mention is the huge dependence of our universities on overseas
students for obtaining excellence. Whether we like it or not, the
300,000 or so students—about one-third of the total—who
come from overseas to study in British universities and colleges,
which, quite properly, are inspected to ensure that they offer not a
bogus but a genuine and honourable education, are of huge economic
value to this country. Higher education earns something like £8
billion a year from the rest of the world through overseas
students. However, equally importantly, as I think many of us
understand, those overseas students give us access to an understanding
of other cultures and other countries, and that, in turn, encourages
not only exports but, more importantly, a high respect and a high
liking for this country. It is very hard to overestimate the value of
overseas students in a country such as ours but, if we are to adopt
something like a national curriculum, it is all the more important that
we also remember that we are part of the globe and that that globe is
understood, through us, above all by human
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:22:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the Government should think very carefully about attitudes by the
Home Office, the visa offices and, in particular, the UKBA
towards overseas students. Sadly, they have begun to show real signs of
discouraging people from choosing to come to this country—there
has already been a substantial decline in the number of, for example,
Indian and Chinese students. I advert not only to members of my own
party or members of the Opposition but to the ringing warning given by
the Mayor of London, Mr Boris Johnson, about the evident
effect of these restrictions on the level and standing of overseas
students wishing to come to this country to receive their education. I
draw attention, in particular, to the abandonment of the so-called tier
1, which allowed people who studied here to continue for two years
only—but two years none the less—after they had completed
their degree studies in order to practise what they had learnt. That is
crucial, for example, in professions ancillary to medicine and to
medicine itself. Tier 1 has been withdrawn 
<?notus-xml column=73?>and replaced by an extremely complicated system, which depends upon the
rules that apply to residents in this

in the gracious Speech that I really dislike refers to the need to have
people who can contribute to this country and not the kind of people
who simply live off the country. It is perhaps worth mentioning that it
is not only Russian oligarchs who contribute to this country but health
assistants and nurses. They are part of the crucial fabric of the
National Health Service and they enable it to deal with the large
number of people who go to A&amp;E. Heaven knows what we would do
without their contribution. Contributions can be small and
great—no doubt the right reverend Prelate will inform me, quite
rightly, about the widow’s mite—but that contribution has
been of extraordinary value to this country in many ways. It would be a
great mistake to narrow it all down to whether somebody is a
businessman or entrepreneur coming to this country often in order to
live in a mansion

thing that we have to be very cautious about in this country is our
attitude towards other people who want to come here. Over the years we
have benefited immensely from such immigration. I remind the House of
the huge value of two great streams of migration to the United Kingdom.
The first of those in recent years was the great Jewish
entry between the wars. That has been immensely valuable to us in field
after field—medicine, science and business. The second was the
entry of Asian immigrants from east African countries after the rise of
Idi Amin and others, who in turn brought to this country great
entrepreneurial skills and great innovation. I hope that when we look
at the gracious Speech we will bear these things in mind, particularly
when we consider immigration and our treatment of those who want to
come to this

I think that the Government’s commitment and credibility are on
the line here. First, some positive developments deserve to be
acknowledged. These include, at a societal level, the fact that there
is now widespread support for Britain being a diverse country. For
example, in a recent poll by British Future, substantial majorities
said that they were comfortable with someone of a different racial
group marrying into their family, being friends with their children and
being a boss or colleague. It is not all rosy, of course, as the
persistence of hate crime and harsh public attitudes towards benefit

many employers now see the business case for equality and want to get
this right. Companies as diverse as B&amp;Q, Ernst &amp; Young and BAE
Systems are joining employer networks to help them to secure the
business benefits of good equality and inclusion practices. Thirdly,
there are the Government’s proposals for equal marriage for gay
and lesbian couples. Contrary to what the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Cathain, said earlier, there is public support for equal
marriage. A June 2012 YouGov survey found that 71% of Britons favour
gay and lesbian couples being able to marry. Ministers have shown
political courage in taking this forward. Finally, there have been some
other useful initiatives from the Government, for example, a more
strategic approach to addressing violence against women and girls, the
transgender action plan and the well intentioned social justice
strategy.</hs_para>

as we survey the current scene I am afraid that concerns outweigh the
positives. These include the rhetoric from Ministers talking about
equality as a burden and the tangle of red tape. This is in contrast to
the Government’s published equality strategy, which states that
in these difficult times equality is even more important, and the
coalition agreement, which recognises 
<?notus-xml column=75?>that there are many barriers to social mobility and equality of
opportunity and pledges to tear them down. This is also in sharp
contrast to evidence from the Government’s own research showing
that employers are generally positive about equality. A recent survey
of small employers found that 90% were positive about equality and that
only 6% had experienced complaints or grievances. The good intentions
in some policy documents and their recognition in entrenched and
persistent inequalities that hold people back are not always matched by
targeted action. For example, the social mobility strategy recognises
that although participation in higher education by white British
teenagers is lower than for many ethnic minorities, ethnic minority
graduates are underrepresented in the graduate recruitment of large
organisations. It also recognises that there are large differences in
employment rates and wages between disabled and non-disabled people and
that the gap appears to have grown in the past 25 years. Where are the
policies to address those
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000246">The
recession and slow recovery have exacerbated these problems of
entrenched disadvantage. According to the Fawcett Society, almost three
times as many women as men have become long-term unemployed in the past
two and a half years: 103,000 women as against 37,000 men. The TUC has
found that young black men have experienced the sharpest
rise in unemployment since 2010, with more than one in four of all
black 16 to 24 year-olds—26%—currently out of
work. Yet, there has been no targeted action to address the fact that
we are not all in this together and that some groups have suffered much
more severely than others. Compounding the absence of policies to
tackle entrenched and persistent inequalities, a range of policies are
making the situation worse and reducing the life chances of
disadvantaged groups. The most obvious examples, of course, are the
impact of welfare reforms on disabled people and the impact of the
social care funding crisis on both disabled and older people.</hs_para>

was not dealt with in the gracious Speech. I refer to the inexplicable
actions of the Northern Ireland Parades Commission, a body that is
answerable to the Northern Ireland Office. Before doing so, I want to
acknowledge that my native land of Ulster is considerably different
from the one beset by civil unrest of 20 years or more ago. For that I

a few issues remain, the most serious of which is the activities of the
Parades Commission. It was set up to remove from the police the
responsibility of regulating parades—a job that it seems to do
in an insensitive and ham-fisted way. I refer to one decision in
particular as an example of the extremely bad handling of a situation.
Last year, in a determination, the commission proposed a position that
put the traditional Orange parade, which passes the Ardoyne interface
in Belfast, into an impossible place. Let me explain: the Parades
Commission received applications for two parades for the afternoon of
12 July 2012. They were from an Orange lodge and the Greater Ardoyne
Residents Collective, a cover name for dissident republicans condemned
by unionists and Sinn Fein alike. The Ardoyne shops, which is an area
of contention, is a line of premises fronting the Crumlin Road. The
area behind the shops is strongly republican in character. On the other
side at this point, Twaddell Avenue meets the Crumlin Road. This is a
residential street that is strongly unionist in character. The area is
therefore an interface between the two communities with a long history
of sectarian trouble.</hs_para>

for 150 years Belfast Orange lodges have held a parade in the city on
12 July to commemorate the Battle of the Boyne. A feature of this event
is that many lodges parade from their lodge halls to assembly points
and then proceed in procession to a major assembly area in a park or
large field on the outskirts of Belfast, where an afternoon of culture
and family activity is available to
everyone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:39:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000253" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000253">Lodges
had followed the proposed route at the same time of day for many years
and had been praised by the Parades Commission in earlier years for
their good behaviour and stewarding. Their application asked for
permission to parade up the Crumlin Road in the usual time, passing the
Ardoyne shops at some time between 6 pm and 7.30 pm. They sought
permission 
<?notus-xml column=77?>to be accompanied by one band. The Greater Ardoyne dissident republican
group sought permission to hold a parade in the same area, partly over
the same road, from 6 pm until 8 pm. It did not complete any
applications to be accompanied by a band.</hs_para>

5 July 2012, the Parades Commission determined as follows. The Orange
parade must pass the Ardoyne shops by 4 pm at the latest and must be
accompanied by a band which must not play music or produce drumbeat in
this locality. The republican parade was granted permission to parade
along its chosen route from 5.30 pm to 6.30 pm. This ruling brought the
time of that parade closer to the traditional Orange one. The
commission also specified that the republican parade should not allow
excessive loud drumming, an interesting point as it had not applied to
bring a band with
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:41:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000255" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000255">The
hall of LOL 647 lies on the outskirts of Belfast and the only available
and practical route to the centre of Belfast is via the Crumlin Road.
The parade takes two hours and the first lodges arrive at the assembly
point shortly after 12 noon and start to leave the assembly point to go
home at 4 pm. The assembly point is at least five miles by road from
Ardoyne. In order to comply with the Parades Commission ruling members
of the lodge would have to forgo all of the family events in the
assembly park and proceed on their way back to the Crumlin Road. They
could not walk back in the time available and therefore would have to
be transported to Ardoyne by car or
bus<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:42:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000256" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000256">The
commission’s decision is seen by most people as very odd indeed.
The problem is that it appears to be one-sided. There may be very good
reasons for this determination but the reasoning is not available for

rise in tension in the province. That is why there is so much confusion

commission allow two mutually antagonistic parades on the same route
within 90 minutes when it is generally agreed that the
Ardoyne interface part of the parade was most contentious, bearing in
mind that the commission praised the Orange Order in previous years as
being well organised and peaceful? Could I be told by the commission
why a republican parade should be allowed in a 50/50 interface area at
almost the same time on a traditional route used by the Orange Order
for over 150 years? The commission not only allowed the lodge to be
accompanied by one band, which must remain mute, but did not specify
how many bands the republicans, who had not applied for band
permission, could bring with
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T14:43:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000258">I

set an unfortunate backdrop for this summer unless we can understand

research and so on. The reports come from the BMA, the Home Affairs

BMA, not surprisingly, makes absolutely clear that of course drug

reflect that at all: it requires that drug use and possession must be
regarded as criminal offences. All four reports implicitly or
explicitly—all but the BMA explicitly—call for a review
of our drug laws. Something needs to be done, for example, about the
fact that it is the Home Secretary who leads on drugs policy. If drug
addiction is a health problem—as I have said, everyone
recognises that it is—what is the Home Secretary doing as the
lead Minister? The Home Affairs Select Committee suggests a shared
responsibility between the Home Secretary and the Health Secretary. The
all-party parliamentary group would be content with that

Marlesford:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall start by saying how very
much I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, in everything she
has said. It is a lacuna in Government thinking. There has been so
little in terms of imagination about drug policy. If eventually it is
possible to decriminalise almost everything to do with drugs, while
that would result in perhaps a few more deaths from their abuse, it
would certainly result in far fewer deaths from criminal activities
related to them. It is a very important

why one week ago the electorate expressed such dissatisfaction with the
coalition Government. I do not intend to speak on the most obvious
issue, that of the survival of our national sovereignty within the EU
at a time when economic pressures are driving 17 of the 27 member
states into a political federation. I must mention another factor, and
that is the perceived infirmity of purpose. By this I mean the failure
to tackle the issues which the people do mind about, and instead
diverting Parliament to support the Prime Minister and Deputy Prime
Minister in legislating for their passionately and sincerely held
personal agendas. They should concentrate on their real
responsibilities of defining and delivering national priorities.
Indeed, the Prime Minister’s decision to renew the deplorable
practice introduced by Mr Blair of cutting short debate by guillotining
all legislation in the House of Commons has played a part in devaluing
Parliament in the public eye and thus making it less effective. That
does not help with good governance.</hs_para>

which is sapping the success of the Government; that of perceived
incompetence, especially that of those Ministers who fail to get a grip
of their departments and instead allow the Civil Service to drive
government at a time when the effectiveness and, sadly, in some cases
the integrity of the Civil Service, has fallen far below what I
remember from my own service in Whitehall during the 1970s. It is a
level of incompetence in government which is the more inexcusable since
there have been such great advances in the technology of administration
and management. To illustrate this, I shall focus on one narrow but
crucial issue, that of the guarding of our national borders. This is
part of the defence of the realm and there can be few higher
priorities, especially for a Conservative-led Administration. On this I

first illustrate why it is so urgent. This country is in mortal danger
of further terrorist attacks. It is only thanks to the excellent work
of the Security Service, the Secret Intelligence Service, GCHQ and the

attacks. It is clear that the main threat today comes from Islamist
jihadists from both overseas and within the UK whose overall mission is
to install a worldwide caliphate with Sharia law. We are all aware of
the threat presented to us by Pakistan, which is rapidly turning into a
failed state. But I would quote another example, which is that of
Egypt. The Egyptian elections were won by the Muslim Brotherhood, which
is now regarded as a moderate Islamic—not Islamist—party
ready to preside over a basically secular Government, yet 25% of the
vote was won by the extreme Salafi 
<?notus-xml column=81?>movement, which is headed by Mohammed al-Zawahiri, the brother of the
new head of al-Qaeda and successor to Osama bin Laden. He has declared

Muslims.</hs_para>

where the failure of competence has been greater than in the management
of the UK Border Agency. There have been periods of inadequate
leadership, normally rewarded with promotion, interrupted by gaps
without anyone being appointed to the leadership role. After all, it
was in May 2006 that the then Home Secretary, now the noble Lord, Lord
Reid of Cardowan, denounced the Home Office immigration department as
“not fit for purpose”. It was over a year ago that the
report by John Vine, the Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and
Immigration, concluded that the UK Border Agency had,</hs_para>

impressed when I met the chief executive of the UK Border Agency, Mr
Rob Whiteman, who was appointed about a year ago. He faced a huge
challenge. The problem with the staff of the border agency was not just
that it was of low calibre, but that it had been shown to be seriously
and systemically corrupt. As the Minister knows, because he gave the
Written Answers, some 30 members of Home Office staff have received
heavy prison sentences—I am talking about five, six, seven and,
in one case, a term of nine years—for misconduct in public
office; the great majority of them came from the border

year, the Government split the UK Border Force from the UKBA. On 25
March this year, the Home Secretary announced that the UKBA was to be
abolished and its functions absorbed into the Home Office. That is cold
comfort in the light of the Home Office performance to date, but we
shall see. I myself suspect that the staff of the UK Border Force are
still not of the quality that we should expect. The command
of it should not have been the temporary appointment of a retired Chief
Constable. Now we have a new commander of the UK Border Force,
Vice-Admiral Sir Charles Montgomery, who until recently was
the Second Sea Lord. He has a tough challenge and I wish him well. The
border force should be reformed as a highly
trained and tightly disciplined uniformed force, which is not allowed
to take industrial action. It should have a clear command and control
hierarchy, as do the military and the police. Members should be closely
vetted and should have British nationality and only British
nationality. It should be under the close control of Ministers, who
represent the elected Government. The link between the commander of the
border force and Ministers should have the same characteristics as
those that Ministers have with the service chiefs. At this time, when
Britain’s Armed Forces are being reduced, it should be possible
to recruit some really first-class retired
officers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000277">Who<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>

I turn to the question of passports. The UK Identity and Passport
Service has, I believe, done a decent job in recent years in improving
the administration of the routine issue and renewal of British
passports in peacetime. However, we do not face peace, we face peril. I
was warned by security sources five years ago of the danger of
terrorists and, indeed, other criminals concealing their activities
with the use of multiple passports. I am not against people having more
than one passport or, indeed, dual nationality. However, I have for
years urged that the Government should take steps to establish details
of what other passports UK passport holders hold. There should be a
strict obligation to divulge full details to the British passport
authorities, including photocopies et cetera, of any other passports
held. One response I have had from the Government is that people would
not necessarily disclose that they had a second passport. The answer is
quite simple: anyone found to have concealed their non-British passport
would be liable to have their British passport
cancelled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000279" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000279">If

second topic relates to something which, to my great regret, is not in
the gracious Speech—the Government’s failure to implement
the major plank of their alcohol strategy. I have said previously that,
in relation to both health and crime, I endorse the Government’s
efforts to try to take action over the problems that come from alcohol
and, to a degree, drugs. I have supported what the Government have been
trying to do and, in particular, was originally greatly heartened by
what our Prime Minister said in his foreword to the strategy. After
listing in the document a number of problems that arise from alcohol,
he went on to say that there will
be,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13050924000584" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000584">“a
real effort to get to grips with the root cause of the problem. And
that means coming down hard on cheap alcohol. When beer is cheaper than
water, it’s just too easy for people to get drunk on cheap
alcohol at home before they even set foot in the pub. So we are going
to introduce a new minimum unit price. For the first time it will be
illegal for shops to sell alcohol for less than this set price per
unit. We are consulting on the actual price, but if it is 40p that
could mean 50,000 fewer crimes each year and 900 fewer alcohol-related
deaths a year by the end of the decade”.</hs_quotefo>

the document was produced the Government have been out to consultation

we have not moved a great deal further. I was not sure whether I should
speak today as, a bit like the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, I was not
sure whether this topic pops up under the Home Office or the health
brief. Alcohol has a significant cost impact within the NHS: it is a
major factor in high blood pressure, cardiac problems, liver disease
and cancer. Although it has not yet been properly acknowledged, alcohol
is also a big factor in obesity and diabetes. If the Government take no
action on minimum pricing and are not prepared to tackle the root
problem, this failure to move will significantly undermine efforts to
take a strategic approach to confronting increasing levels of obesity
and type 2 diabetes, two major problems which are facing the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:06:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000283" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000283">When
it emerged that the Government were likely to execute an about-turn on
the issue the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Taylor of Holbeach, kindly
answered a Private Notice Question on it. He said that a decision had
not yet been taken and that we should not believe everything that we
read in the press or hear on the BBC. He said that the Government were
reviewing the position and that the results of the consultation were
“very finely balanced”—I think that those were the
precise words—in deciding whether to move forward with
legislation. He was also concerned about the possibility that the legal
challenges raised in Scotland about the Scottish Government’s
attempts to introduce minimum pricing there could have a knock-on
effect here. As I understand it, the Scottish Government have so far
been successful in seeing off those challenges. The noble Lord will no
doubt correct me if I have got it wrong but I understand that the firm,
decisive leadership in Scotland is such that they will stick with the
plan and fight all the way through, even if that means going to Europe.
I gather that the drinks industry is likely to take challenges to
Europe, if needs be, to try to resist this change. They are going for a

40p<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:08:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000284" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000284">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:09:30"></hs_TimeCode>
of the problems raised when the noble Lord spoke to us in reply to the
PNQ has therefore been answered, to a degree, but we are still left
with the 
<?notus-xml column=84?>Government’s failure to come forward and say where they stand on
the consultation. I would be grateful if the Minister would advise the
House on where they are at and why it is taking so long when there is
so much evidence showing that the change is required. Who has sought to
change the course of events when the Prime Minister was, as I have
quoted, so firmly in favour of moving in this direction? I even hear
stories that if it does not happen, it may appear in the next Tory
party manifesto. I do not know what will happen with the Liberal
Democrats but I presume that they are similarly committed to it. I urge
my own party, as I have done in some of our private meetings, to get a
very clear line on where we stand on this so that in the interests of
the nation and its people, we might get a uniform approach, even though
we may offend a number of people such as those in the drinks industry.
So I hope that even though it is not closed down yet the Minister will
be able to give me some heartening words this afternoon when he
responds. He always smiles when he is at his best, but I want to hear
that the firm decision will have been taken and that, if not this time
round, when we come to the Queen’s Speech next year we shall
have it clearly laid down for legislation; otherwise, it will be a
great missed
opportunity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000285" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000285">When

in different government departments, they are all about 
<?notus-xml column=85?>the self-same thing: fundamentally, many of the problems with
crime and so on relate back to the identity of the individual and where
he or she lives. The only way that that would be answered and worked
through properly would be by having an ID card with a link to
residence. I urge the Government to think again about that, instead of
spending all the money that it seems they are going to spend with all
this paraphernalia of new checks of one sort or another that will be
introduced on the NHS, on GPs and so on. The basic answer to all of
this would have been to come together with an identity card, as the
previous Labour Government were planning and working through. Indeed,
it was a former Conservative Government who first thought of this idea,
going back to 1996, I think.</hs_para>

back and tell the public that it supports the introduction of an
identity card, which will help us in so many different areas. Not only
will it help the party—if it does it—it will be appealing
to the vast majority of people in the country, who are in favour of
identity cards. They see no problem with them at all. They see them as
being useful in many respects, for authentication and ease of
transactions. They have nothing in principle against them and it was a
minority that was opposing them at the time. My party should change its
mind and move in favour of ID cards and see where UKIP stands on that
as well, because we are probably the only party that would be in favour
of it. We would be bang in line with the wishes of 70% to 80% of the

think that introducing identity cards is going to solve the problems
that the noble Lord has just outlined. I am sorry to hear voices raised
in favour of identity cards—we thought the Labour Party had lost
its desire to control which it exhibited during 13 years in
government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000292" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000292">Turning
to something quite different, I very much regret that there is nothing
in the gracious Speech that would permit parliamentary scrutiny of
proposals which seem to be designed to destroy access to justice in
criminal cases. The Ministry of Justice’s current 
<?notus-xml column=86?>consultation is for a scheme of “competitive tendering”
for criminal legal aid, which will not require primary
legislation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050924000293" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000293">The consultation is a
sham, as Ministers have already decided that they are in favour of such
a scheme in principle and, regardless of the consultation, competitive
tendering will be introduced within months. The only question posed in
the consultation is the precise model. The model proposed by the
Government could have been brought forward only by Ministers and their
advisers, who have not the slightest experience of the way criminal
courts operate or of the professional values, ethics and practices of
the legal
profession.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000294" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000294">The
key parts of the consultation document are chapter 4, on introducing
competition in the criminal legal aid market, and chapter 5, on
reforming fees in criminal legal aid. Chapter 4 is about introducing
price-competitive tendering. Those proposals will be the death of the
high street solicitor. The intention is to remove competition on
quality and replace it with competition on price alone. In each of the
contract areas, which will match the 41 police areas, there will be a
set number of contracts. In my own immediate vicinity, there will be
four in north Wales, four in Cheshire and some 37 in Manchester.
Contracts will be awarded on a three-year basis. Successful bidders
will receive a guaranteed equal share of the criminal work in that
area. To achieve equality, work will be allocated by a central agency
on neutral criteria; for example, by surname alone. The explicit
intention is therefore to abolish client choice. A solicitor will be
appointed by a central agency to act for a defendant. The reputation
and goodwill which solicitors have built up within their area
disappear. The skills of firms which have built up particular
specialisms—for example, in fraud, terrorism or mentally
disordered offenders—will count for nothing. In cities such as
Manchester, the skills of firms which have a client base within
particular ethnic communities or with particular language
skills—for example, Urdu or Polish—are of no value
because work is to be allocated on random criteria. As for my home
territory, Welsh language provision is seriously
compromised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000295" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000295">The
contracts will be one size fits all. There is a Goldilocks problem
about this: most firms are too small to bid at all and, ironically,
many others are too big to bid. In Manchester there are a couple of
firms which have 10% to 15% of the market but which under the new
system of equality would be restricted to one-37th of the market, or
2.7%. There may be a handful of firms, or networks of firms, which are
just the right size to bid. However, these contracts will go mostly to
service companies which have the capital to create a national network
with contracts in every area; for example, G4S, Serco, Tesco and the
Co-op. Perhaps the most aggressive is the newly arrived Stobart
Barristers, an offshoot of Eddie Stobart truckers. Its legal director,
Trevor Howarth, confirmed that the firm would bid for the new criminal
defence contracts. He said:</hs_para>

the service at a cost that’s palatable for the taxpayer …
Our business model was developed with this in mind. We at Stobart are
well known for taking out the waste and the waste here is the
duplication of solicitors going to the courtroom. At the moment there
are 1,600 legal aid firms; in future there will be 400. At Stobart, we
wouldn’t use 10 trucks to deliver one
product”.</hs_quote>

Ministry of Justice, he regards people in trouble with the criminal law
as units and justice as a common product to be delivered like a load of
bricks. Mr Howarth is, I believe, currently on trial himself for
contempt of court for allegedly lying in court. I say no more about
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000297">From<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:20:56"></hs_TimeCode>
a business perspective, however, the changes do not make sense. The
companies which win the contracts will be monolithic, national firms.
The government agenda generally is supposed to be to support
SMEs—small and medium enterprises—but the effect of these
proposals will be to send the existing providers, the high street
firms, to the wall. There will be mass bankruptcies and redundancies.
The new providers, the big companies, will bid low to start with, but
once they have destroyed the competition from existing solicitors,
inevitably prices will rise, with the profits going to the big
boys.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000298" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000298">If the
Government’s proposed model is adopted, quality is to be driven
down to minimum standards. The single determining factor for success
will be price. Practitioners will be valued and rewarded for producing
the highest turnover of work at the lowest cost. Literally and
intentionally, no value will be attached to quality of representation.
If the professions are dumbed down, it will impact ultimately on the
judiciary. Someone has already said that, if you have Tesco-grade
lawyers, within 10 years you will have to start appointing Tesco-grade
judges because they will be the only people to have experience in this
field.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000299">The
complaint about the chapter 4 proposals is that they represent the
intentional dumbing-down of the criminal justice system. Quite
explicitly, the intention is to reduce the quality of representation to
a set of minimum standards. No value will be attached to quality of

confidence in the
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000300">The
proposals in chapter 5 are about the reform of fee structures. There is
opposition to the reduction in fees, which are cutting to levels which
are unsustainable, but that is not the main thrust of opposition. The
concern is that the new structures are unworkable, the most obvious
being the proposals to cut trial fees. In many cases, the advocate will
be paid the same for a guilty plea as he or she would get for a trial.
In more complex cases, refreshers would be paid on a reducing scale so
that, in some cases, they might fall to £14 a day, without
expenses.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13050924000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000301">The
intention is presumably to add to the incentives to defendants to plead
guilty. The effect of that is to create conflicts of interest between
the advocate and his/her client. The advocate is punished financially
if the client pleads not guilty and goes to trial. Not only is that
wrong in principle, it is counterproductive: if defendants know that
the advocate has a conflicting financial incentive, they will not
listen to him when he tells them to plead guilty, because it will be in
his financial interest to do precisely that. Hence, there will be more
trials, at greater
expense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000302">The
proposals will mean fundamental changes, but there is to be no pilot
scheme. One of the most dangerous aspects of the price competitive
tendering proposal is the compete lack of modelling or trialling. The
Attorney-General, Dominic Grieve QC, gave the

introduce tendering without full trials first. Why has the one person
in this Government with practical experience been
overruled?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000303" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000303">The
proposals are to be brought in nationwide, commencing this autumn,
without any trial period. They will be irreversible, because once the
existing providers have gone, they will never come back. It was made
clear in Tuesday’s Law Society <I>Gazette</I> that most of the
significant current providers regard the scheme as unworkable and will
not tender.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000304">On
the subject of minimum quality standards, there is a link to a separate
set of proposals to introduce a quality assurance scheme for advocates.
I will not go into that at this stage. Suffice it to say that solicitor
advocates can presently obtain higher level grades on the basis of
attending a course and giving a good performance in role-play
exercises. They are not judged on their actual performance in real
cases at a lower level.</hs_para>

am a former solicitor, so I have no axe to grind, but a very
experienced Crown Court judge, who was also a solicitor, told me
recently that the quality of advocacy in the Crown Court is, unhappily,
appalling. He faces the dilemma that if he, as the judge, steps in to
the arena too often to correct a solicitor advocate who is making a
hash of the case before him, it quickly gives the appearance of bias.
He was also concerned that in very serious cases, where two advocates
are required to represent an accused, the fees structure is such that
solicitor advocates now frequently seize the role of junior to
themselves. However, he told me, if the lead counsel has to be
elsewhere—for example in the Court of Appeal—far from the
junior taking over, as has been the tradition at the Bar for ever, the
solicitor advocate immediately applies for an adjournment. He can not
carry the weight or responsibility of the hands-on conduct of the case.
That judge told me that he was in
despair.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000306">I

North Yorkshire felt that their local police dealt well with their
concerns, and that the North Yorkshire police force regularly rates the
highest public satisfaction levels in the huge Yorkshire and Humber
region. All of this was achieved before the new regime of police and

the system. What utter nonsense. You cannot expect police officers to

a policing background. It may well help ease the transition to eventual
retirement when they are still fit and young enough to have another
career. Indeed, I recently met a serving police officer who is also in
the RAF Police reserve and doing a first-class job. Perhaps the
Minister will speak to his MoD counterpart to see whether this might be
an option for retiring or, indeed, still-serving police officers to
consider, should they want to.</hs_para>

know they have to change. Their HMIC has left them in no doubt about
that, but my hope is that this can happen through sensible, adult

are aired. When things go wrong, it is the police, as always, who pick

Cormack:</Member></B> My Lords, the House always listens with interest
and respect to my noble friend when she talks on police matters. She
has great experience and real passionate feeling for the police, as was
evident in her peroration. I am not saying that I agree with everything
she said this afternoon, but I was particularly grateful, as a former
chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee in the other place,
for what she said about Northern Ireland. I was appalled to think that,
having devolved policing and justice to Northern Ireland, the sort of
ghastly mistake to which she referred could have happened, and I am
glad to know that it has been put
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000324">This
debate has ranged far and wide on the subjects that we are supposed to
be discussing today; indeed, it has ranged further and wider than the
subjects we are supposed to be discussing today, to the benefit of us
all, I think. I am very concerned and alarmed by what my noble friend
Lord Thomas of Gresford said, and I want to look into that extremely
carefully, as I think we all should.</hs_para>

one or two things, but before I do so I shall make a general point. The
Queen’s Speech is the great set piece of the parliamentary year.
The problem about the Queen’s Speech and the debate that follows
is that it tends, implicitly, to associate parliamentary activity with
legislation. That it is a pity because Parliament is about more than
legislating, and this House in particular is about more than
legislating. I think that by common consent we have had the thinnest
Queen’s Speech in recent years, and I hope that will not lead to
a repetition of what I considered to be a mistake in recent
weeks—the House being sent off on an extra week’s recess
when there were grave issues of national and international importance
that we could and should have debated in that time. This House is rich
in experience, and we could have had some fascinating foreign affairs
and other debates. I hope that if this proves to be a thin
Queen’s Speech in legislative terms, we will have extra time for
the sort of debates in which this House
excels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000326" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000326">The
speech touches on many things, but the one thing it is does not touch
on is your Lordships’ House. As I listened yesterday, I could
not help but feel a little glow of pleasure in the fact that the
flagship of last year’s Queen’s Speech was holed below
the waterline very satisfactorily in another place, and I am delighted
to be wearing this tie as I address your Lordships because it was
produced by the 91 who holed that Bill below the waterline in another
place. The fact that the grandiose and, as the Joint Committee’s
report on House of Lords reform made plain, frankly ill thought out
Bill has gone—and I hope, unlike my noble friend Lord Tyler,
gone for good—does not mean that we do not have to address this
House and look at some of the things that could improve its
effectiveness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000327">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>
there is nothing in the gracious Speech that touches on any measure of
Lords reform, and fully accepting that there cannot, and indeed should
not, be wide-ranging reform in the penultimate Session of Parliament, I
hope there can be a measure, perhaps based on one or other of the Steel
Bills or perhaps even a combination of the two, that we can take
through this House. If we do, I very much hope that the Government will
feel able this time to give it a fair wind. I have enormous faith and
confidence in my noble friend the Leader of the House. I believe that
he brings a freshness and a sensitivity to his responsibilities that
are themselves refreshing, and I hope that if a Bill is presented it
will be able, in one way or another, to go forward and on to the
statute books, to address some of the housekeeping measures that we
have talked about in the
past<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:45:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000328" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000328">As
for the future, obviously we have to bear in mind that in the autumn of
next year there will be a referendum that could change the composition
of the United Kingdom. I hope and pray that it will not, but we cannot
assume that it will not. The worse thing one can ever do in political
life is to underestimate the strength of the opposition. We have in Mr
Salmond perhaps the wiliest of all political operators in the United
Kingdom at the moment. We must not underestimate him, nor must we
underestimate the fact that the franchise will be significantly
extended for that referendum.</hs_para>

this morning, but we will debate that later when my noble friend Lord
Tyler introduces his Bill. Whether one agrees or disagrees with it, it
will extend the franchise significantly and could have an effect. I
believe that what I consider to be common sense will prevail, but we
must not be patronising to those of our fellow country men and women
who live north of the border; we must accept that it is their choice
and hope they will recognise that the United Kingdom together is much
greater than the sum of its parts.</hs_para>

mention that because we have to look at parliamentary reform in that
context if we are to go forward and look at the composition of the
respective Houses and their respective roles. There is no point in
doing anything on a wider front until that issue has been settled. I
hope we can then look at a proposal, which I hope will be settled in
the way I have indicated, that was made in the alternative report
produced by members of the Joint Committee last year, and maybe take
time over a constitutional convention that looks at the respective
roles of the two Houses. At the moment this is the more effective of
the two Chambers. As one who sat in the other place, proudly and with
great enjoyment, for 40 years, I despair that business is over by 7 pm
or 7.30 pm most evenings. I despair that Thursday is almost
a non-parliamentary day at the other end of the Corridor. Although I
welcome the advent of the Back-Bench committee and believe that it has
done a great deal, it has not arrested the Executive’s
stranglehold over the legislature at that end, which of course is
exercised mainly because of the automatic imposition of a timetable on
any Bill that is introduced.</hs_para>

need a convention that can look at all those things and consider the
implications of the timetable on parliamentary democracy and on the
balance of power between the Executive and the legislature, which is
out of kilter. The spotlight of reform should be focused at that end at
least as much, if not more, than at this end. As we consider that the
Prime Minister may not get his way with the withdrawing of the
boundaries because of Mr Clegg’s obdurate opposition to that, we
do not want to revisit that debate. However, we could well enter a new
Parliament in 2015, with 650 Members rather than 600 at the
other end of the Corridor, and with a need, therefore, to look at the
whole composition of Parliament, and, as I said earlier, at the
respective roles and powers of the two Houses.</hs_para>

advocate for this Session and the Session beyond a degree of modest,
incremental housekeeping reform at this end of the Corridor, and then,
in a new Parliament, I hope there will be a proper look at the whole
structure of the parliamentary system in this country, because
it is overdue. I add that all that could still be
accomplished in the timetable of the ill-fated Clegg Bill. He envisaged
everything being completed by 2025. That would still be possible, given

will touch briefly on one further thing that has already reared its
head in the debate. When I modestly and gently intervened on my noble
friend Lord Fowler, who had made an utterly splendid speech on Leveson
and then turned his attention to another issue, and reminded him that
the same-sex marriage Bill was not 
<?notus-xml column=94?>in the manifesto, he rounded on me as if he had been bitten by our noble
friend Lord Deben. It was a most extraordinary moment. All I would say
is that we should not think that this is an issue of equality. I do not
think that anyone in this Chamber—I look at the noble and right
reverend Lord, Lord Carey, who made a most interesting and important
speech—does not believe in genuine equality.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050924000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000334">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:40:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Bill redefines the basic building block of our society. Some of us
believe that marriage is between a man and a woman, and believe it
without in any way casting aspersions of any sort on different
relationships. In the 21st century, we ought to be able to preserve the
best of what has sustained the nation through the centuries, and at the
same time extend a greater and more generous recognition to those whose
ways are different and whose beliefs are diverse. All I would say to my
noble friend Lord Fowler and those who feel passionately as he
does—the noble Lord, Lord Low, for whom I have great respect,
indicated that he took that line—is that we will of course speak
in the debate as we believe, but let us have the generosity to
recognise that others will speak with equal conviction and belief. I
would hate to see the Bill tear this place apart in the coming weeks,

Soley:</Member></B> My Lords, I will speak on constitutional matters.
Before I do, I will strongly endorse the comments made by the noble
Lord, Lord Fowler, and the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, on the
Leveson report and the current situation. It should deeply disturb the
whole country that when people in financial industries such as banking,
or indeed MPs and Peers, are caught in dubious situations or in
wrongdoing, the full force of the press is turned against them, but
when the press itself is caught, it suddenly goes into hiding and
starts distorting and twisting the arguments made against
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:53:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000336" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000336">I
also recall that the press couches so many arguments in terms of press
freedom. However, it is important to remember that when the <I>News of
the </I><I>W</I><I>orld</I> was closed we lost a successful newspaper,
but the chief executive of the company continued in office. That was
totally the wrong way round. I will also mention my frustration that
some of the leaders of the press, for example Paul Dacre, who are busy
pulling strings behind the scenes at the moment, do not put themselves
before the public and expose themselves to the sort of accountability
that they rightly expect of the rest of us. Perhaps it is time for
radio and
television<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:54:22"></hs_TimeCode> to
start inviting people like Rupert Murdoch and Paul Dacre on to
programmes to discuss this. I am sure that in very many cases they
would refuse to come. But it makes the point that people who have been
very good at invading the privacy of others, sometimes correctly and
sometimes incorrectly, surround themselves with a wall of secrecy that
is dishonest, devious, hypocritical and frankly, at times, cowardly.
They need to face up to that. We all want a free press, but closing
newspapers with a failing chief executive is not the way to get
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:55:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000337">I
turn to what I wanted to speak about today. It is a constitutional
matter, which I was very pleased to see in the Queen’s
Speech—and I was not surprised to see it—the confirmation
that the Government wish to 
<?notus-xml column=95?>continue the argument to keep Scotland in the United Kingdom. I have
said a number of times before, and I am pleased to see the Government
use this phrase, too, that the United Kingdom has by almost any
standards been the most successful political and economic union that
the world has ever seen. It is important at times like these to
recognise that the argument, which is so far taking place largely in
Scotland, is about the United Kingdom. It is not just about Scotland.
If Scotland chose to leave the United Kingdom, the implications for
Scotland would be great, but they would be great also for the rest of
the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000338">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:56:12"></hs_TimeCode>
times, those of us speaking in England make the mistake of referring to
the United Kingdom or Britain as “England”, a mistake
that is picked up at times in the media. We need to be much clearer
about that. I understand fully as someone who has spent a great deal of
my life in Scotland—in terms of my own heritage, I have very
little English blood in me, if any at all—that it is undesirable
that England, although it is the largest part of the United Kingdom,
talked as though it was Britain. It is not. It is very important that
we recognise
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:56:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:55:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000339" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000339">I
want to put this issue in the context of the consequences of
devolution. I am a great supporter of devolution; I think that it will
continue and will expand in England, as well. I notice today that Boris
Johnson is making the case for extended powers for himself in London.
My guess is that that will continue and, if it does, as one or two
other noble Lords have mentioned today, will change the nature and
structure of the United Kingdom. It will have implications for the
House of Commons and for this place, and we need to put that in some
context. It is time that we stepped back a little and looked at the way
in which our constitution functions. I do not want to see another Bill
like the House of Lords Reform Bill, which we saw in the last
Queen’s Speech. That was a mistake—and I say that as
someone who, over the years, has occupied just about every position
that it is possible to have on the reform of the House of Lords. I have
never gone for abolition, because I think that a large country needs
two Chambers, but it is about the only one that I have missed out
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000340" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000340">Any<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:58:34"></hs_TimeCode>
Government who chose to go down the road of electing the second Chamber
would end up writing a constitution. To do that would be a very brave
action for a Government, because it is very difficult to get it
right—and, of course, you would unpick other aspects of the
constitution, including the role of the church and the monarch, and so
on, so it becomes a major issue. However, as the noble Lord, Lord
Cormack, said a few moments ago, that does not mean that we should not
reform this Chamber.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:58:39"></hs_TimeCode> am very much
in favour of the proposal put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Steel,
and the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, at other
times<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:58:37"></hs_TimeCode>, on having
a more independent method of selecting Peers. The noble Lord, Lord
Steel, also touched on the question of trying to get the numbers down,
and a number of other attributes. If we did those two
things—reduced the numbers in the House and made the
appointments system more visible and transparent, as well as less party
political at times, although not getting rid of the party-political bit
because it is very 
<?notus-xml column=96?>important—we could make reforms, so this place would not be the
same in five or 10 years’ time. But I do not think that it ends
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000341" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000341">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T15:59:25"></hs_TimeCode>

However, what is most interesting and, in a way, deeply troubling, is
that the Government use this Chamber to alter the Bills that they have
brought before the House of Commons. This applies to all recent
Governments in my experience. For example, the Localism Bill, which was
brought forward in the previous Session, attracted 514 successful
government amendments, the Health and Social Care Bill attracted 390
and I could give similar figures for previous government Bills of all
parties. This Chamber has increasingly been used to alter
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:00:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000342" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000342">It
is important to remember that we do not legislate in this Chamber in
any significant way; that is done by the House of Commons as everything
we do here can be overturned by the House of Commons because it is the
elected Chamber. We need to give some thought to how this could change
because one of the great changes that have taken place in the House of
Commons recently, about which I am very pleased, is that Select
Committees have become much more effective at criticising government.
It may be a mistake to be optimistic after having spent so many years
in the House of Commons, but I am optimistic enough to believe that
ultimately that will transfer to the Bill committees in the House of
Commons. If it does, those committees will become much more effective
at scrutinising legislation and that will have a knock-on effect in
this

with the noble Lords, Lord McFall and Lord Foulkes, and the noble

revised version of which appeared in <I>The</I> <I>House Magazine</I>,
that, taking a much longer-term view, if we continued down the road of
devolution, bearing in mind what is happening in the four parts of the
United Kingdom, part of the future role of this Chamber could be to
bring the United Kingdom back together again by representing those
parts here. In other words, we should not go for a simplistic option of
saying that we have to write a constitution and elect everyone or go
for the other end of that scale and simply say, “Let us keep it
as it is and appoint as we are doing”. There are a variety of
options in between, many of which, incidentally, are practised in other
countries. I am not automatically arguing for a mixed Chamber, but one
of the mixes which could be useful would be something that represented
the regions and countries of the United Kingdom but retained the
scientists, experts, former ambassadors and former senior civil
servants who add value to this place. We need to look at that sort of
structure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:02:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000344" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000344">I
do not think there are any quick solutions to this issue. I do not
think that we ought to try to look for a quick solution because, if we
do, we will get it wrong. Frankly, that was one of the things that led
to the failure of the Clegg Bill. It was an attempt to get a quick fix
and it was bound to fail. I say to my own party that if it attempts a
similar quick fix, it will also fail. We need to give much longer
thought to this issue. We need to hold the United Kingdom together. We
need to recognise that devolution is developing, and is 
<?notus-xml column=97?>likely to continue to do so, and give more powers to the regions of
Britain as a whole, including England. Therefore, it might be useful to
find a way in which the second Chamber can bring the United Kingdom
back together again so that its voice can be heard here. There are very
real possibilities there and I hope that at some stage we will find a
mechanism to enable us to look at this more constructively which does
not make the mistake of a Government trying to bring forward a Bill and
then desperately trying to amend it on the Floor of the House in a way

Phillips of Sudbury:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak to the
constitutional aspect of this debate and about the volume and
complexity of legislation. I am encouraged to do so because it has
preoccupied me since before I came into this House 15 years ago. I
suppose that is partly, if not mainly, because I have been a general
practitioner solicitor for a great part of my life and was for 24 years
what was called the “legal eagle” on “The Jimmy
Young Show”, fielding citizens’ concerns about the law
from all round the kingdom. The other thing that has encouraged me to
talk about this matter briefly is the report—I do not know how
many of your Lordships have seen it—<I>When L</I><I>aws

for my few brief words is the state of politics in our country. That
was manifested clearly by the local elections last week. Surprisingly,
one may think, it is impossible to obtain from anywhere the level of

Lord Smith very much for that vital piece of accuracy. I rather get the

around 30%, on average. If you consider that among voters aged under
30, of whom fewer than one in four turned out at the previous general

<?notus-xml column=98?>your Lordships that our Library does not stock a complete set of

copies of statutory instruments from 2010, for example. However, those

criminal offences. I suspect that that represents rather more than were
created in the whole of our previous history. EU law finds reference in
10% of our legislation, and on top of that we gold-plate EU legislation
to an astonishing extent. These are not my statistics; they come from
the fine document by the parliamentary draftsmen to which I referred.
They provide an example of directive 2002/42, which consisted of 1,167
words in the English text issued from Brussels. By the time we had
ploughed it into our own legislation, it had gone from 1,167 to 27,000

state of affairs is brought about by a combination of circumstances,
one important aspect of which the noble Lord, Lord Cormack, recently
referred to—the production-line legislation in the other place
and the guillotining Motions that render much of the legislation there
not merely inadequately considered but not considered at all. Large
chunks of legislation come here never having been debated. Added to
that, there is the manifesto theory of government—that if it is
in your manifesto, you are entitled to legislate for it. The fact that
nobody reads or buys the manifesto is neither here nor there. In the
1945 election, the manifesto for the Attlee Government was, I think, 15
pages long, whereas for the current Government it is 115 pages, but
that is apparently of no importance.</hs_para>

issue of demoralisation in a literal sense—de-moralisation. The
more law you have, the more you take from the citizens of the state, in
whatever situation, the need to reach their own decisions or to think
through the consequences of acting in this way or that. In effect, you
provide a rule that all must abide by, and too often the statutory rule
is the rule. As I said, it discourages businesses, societies and
organisations from taking responsibility for their own affairs, and
all that has had an indirect impact on the public service
ethos. I do not think it is at all contentious to remark
that in this age community life is under severe attack. There is a real
dilution of the strength of communities throughout our land,
and those communities are the building blocks of a good
society—I do not think that anybody disputes that. Consider
today how few of what one might call the natural elite are
engaged in their communities. My own profession which used
to be the classic pillar of local communities is today far less engaged

Deech:</Member></B> My Lords, we heard an interesting legislative
programme from Her Majesty the Queen, with particular implications for
our constitution and legal system. The noble Lord, Lord McNally,
emphasised the Government’s focus on the criminal law, but all
legislation of the past and the laws to come depend on enforceability
and the rule of law. They in turn depend on fair access to the courts
and to legal advice from independent lawyers. The fascinating speech by
the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, has shown just how necessary that is.
For decades, British citizens have had the advantage of assistance
through legal aid and the pro bono services of lawyers, volunteers and
citizens advice bureaux. The new proposals, however, will damage our
system, the best justice system in the world and one that attracts
billions from foreign

it from a different perspective. It is self-evident that there cannot
be a bottomless fund for legal aid but the wrong impression has been
given in the media in relation to the sums and how they are allocated.
The large sums said to be spent on legal representation do not take
into account the overheads of the self-employed or that the fees may
represent several years work. Only a very small number of cases dealing
with the most serious crimes—terrorism and the
like—command large resources. Many young barristers practising
publicly funded criminal law are earning around £25,000 a year
or less. Not only will they abandon it, depriving the courts of good
judges in future years, but the way in which the legal system is now

opportunity to debate the impact in this House. The ministry is
proposing competition in the provision of criminal representation.
Where no competition is proposed for now—that is, in Crown Court
advocacy and very high-cost cases—a new fee framework is
proposed that will encourage early pleas of guilty, for the longer a
case lasts the less the daily fee will be. There must be a case to fear

large firms, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, said, leaving high street
solicitors to go to the wall. The client will not be able to choose who

person accused of wrongdoing ought to be able to take advice from a
lawyer he knows and trusts, and who can act expeditiously to prove his
innocence. Cuts in family law will bear especially hard on women, who
are more likely to be carers of children and have less knowledge of the
law and details of ownership of the family assets. Mediation is not the

be no assistance for most divorcees, it is urgent that the law on
financial provision on divorce be reformed to make it user-friendly.
The sums involved amount to £220 million a year. One could make
savings by reforming the law of financial provision on divorce. It is
now so complicated, uncertain and unfair that it is almost impossible
to predict the outcome of litigation about dividing family assets on
divorce. There are cases where almost as much is spent on fighting as
the assets themselves are worth. There have even been cases where the
entire assets are spent on costs. That is because the law is unjust and
based on old-fashioned principles without regard to today’s high
breakdown rates, women’s equality and independent 
<?notus-xml column=103?>earning power. The Law Commission has recently put forward for
consideration proposals to replace the current unsatisfactory statutory
provisions on financial provision in divorce with new ones that might
rely on a formulaic calculation. While this is a blunt instrument,
there is much to be said for having a law that enables separating
parties to calculate for themselves how their assets should be divided.
An alternative, which I am minded to put forward for your
Lordships’ consideration in a Private Member’s Bill, is
to replace the English law on financial provision on divorce with the
Scots law. That law by and large provides for the equal sharing of
family property and limited ongoing financial support. It works well in
Scotland, there are few reported cases and there is no reason why it
should not be imported here.</hs_para>

between spouses and cohabitants about sharing property on separation
should be respected and not subjected to dissection by the courts. In
other words, we should recognise pre-nups and do away with expensive

about the division of their

one should get the extent of legal aid savings into perspective. Great
damage is about to be done to the court system, litigants, the legal
profession, diversity and the rule of law to effect a saving of
£220 million a year. We have just spent £10
billion on the Olympics, with so far not much legacy. The Government
have recently committed to spending £60 million on
converting the Olympic stadium into a football ground for West Ham. We
have lost our moral compass if we think that it is preferable to spend
on the Olympic stadium rather than on legal aid, to give tax relief on
wind turbines rather than spend sums on access to justice, and when we
send overseas aid to Argentina rather than supporting the rule of law
at home. The requisite savings could be made if alleged
criminals’ assets were unfrozen and used to fund their legal
representation as the litigation unfolds. I am sure that everyone in
this House has a taxpayer-funded project in mind that is unnecessary
and less significant than cutting access to justice. If the legal

Rennard:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to make a few remarks on some of
the constitutional reform issues, with which I have mostly been
associated in this House over the past 14 years, that I would like to
have seen in the gracious Speech. I will then discuss the issue of
fairness, which was a central theme in the gracious Speech, in
particular in relation to the equality issues with which I have also
been strongly associated in this House. I believe that my Liberal
principles are linked in these issues, because my passion for democracy
is about giving everyone a fair and equal opportunity to have a say in
the democratic process—my passion for equality issues is also a
lifelong commitment to opposing unfair discrimination in all its
forms.</hs_para>

gracious Speech a year ago, I welcomed changes to the
Government’s original plans for registering voters. I had a very
major hand in bringing about fundamental changes to the draft
legislation. I noted earlier the remarks of the noble Baroness, Lady
Smith of Basildon, and I hope that she will pay some attention to the
detail of those changes, because they reduced considerably the risk
that individual voter registration would mean that many millions of
voters were to be effectively deprived of their chance to vote. I am
pleased that I helped to achieve
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000377" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000377">I also
spoke on that occasion of the need to have a proper debate about on
which days elections should be held. In my view, the UK discriminates
against people in employment by holding elections on a working day. I
regret, therefore, that there was no indication in the gracious Speech
that the Government either recognise the problem or will seek to
address it. In the aftermath of the most recent elections, to which my
noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury referred a few moments ago, it is
time to consider this issue of when elections should be held. Holding
elections on a Thursday, it seems to me, makes elections much easier
for the retired and the unemployed than it does for people in
employment. People who are in work find it very much harder to vote,
especially if they have school-age children. I believe that we should
have had a measure announced to hold next year’s European
elections over a weekend, with the counts to be conducted on a Sunday
evening. However, as an alternative, I suggest that, as in many other
countries, polling day should be declared a bank holiday. That would
give everyone a more equal chance to
vote.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000378" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000378">I also
think that a measure should have been announced to change the
closed-list system for the European elections next year. This system,
introduced by a very controlling Labour Government, was very strongly
criticised by both Liberal Democrats and Conservatives when it was
introduced. It should now be changed to allow voters rather than
parties to rank the order of the candidates who are elected. Such a
change would, for example, make it easier for voters wanting to support
a woman candidate to do so, even if the party machine put forward only
men at the top of its list.</hs_para>

in which I helped my party to achieve gender balance when we began
electing our MEPs by proportional representation. When I oversaw my
party’s European election campaign in 1999, I had to rank all
the constituencies in order of winnability to ensure that half of our
top candidates were women. We elected 12 MEPs in those elections, six
women and six men, but this relied on the party using a system known as
“zipping”. Open lists would allow voters themselves to
prevent parties from failing to ensure fair representation of women and
men. This has been shown to work in other countries, such as
Finland.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000380" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000380">On

one of the themes of the speech of my noble friend Lord Rennard and pay
specific regard to gender equality in corporate life. I make no apology
for again raising this issue because the problem is not improving
quickly enough and in some respects is getting worse. Three examples
illustrate
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:40:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000386" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000386">First,
women have suffered much greater job losses than men in the current
recession, as the noble Lord, Lord Low of Dalston, emphasised earlier.
Secondly, 
<?notus-xml column=106?>women are still paid substantially less, job for job, than their male
counterparts. Only last week it was reported that women earn 20% less
than men in financial services. Moreover, the European Commission
ranked the UK 21st out of 28 countries on equal pay.
PricewaterhouseCoopers has found that Britain’s progress on
other measures such as female unemployment and part-time working has
been slower than in other countries so that its relative position has
deteriorated. Thirdly, and more widely researched, is discrimination
against and consequent gross underrepresentation of women in business
at board level. This had been the subject of the government-appointed
Davies commission, which reported in 2011. That report showed how dire
the situation was and called for a 25% ratio of women directors among
FTSE 100 companies by 2015. This was to be achieved by evangelistic
encouragement or “nudging”, as it is called. The noble
Lord, Lord Davies, and his colleagues explicitly refrained from
recommending the imposition of quotas despite the outstanding success
of the quota scheme in Norway, which has been extensively emulated in
many other
countries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000387" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000387">“Nudging”
has palpably failed. Recent research has revealed that FTSE 100 firms
will fall far short of the Davies target, while the situation among
FTSE 250 firms is quite abysmal. In a debate on 13 November last, both
the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, and I predicted that the position would
deteriorate—as it has—and said that only a quota scheme
would bring success. The latest Cranfield University survey shows that
the number of female executive directors has fallen in the
past year among FTSE 100 companies, as has the number of female
CEOs—which is always miniscule in any event. It also showed that
the number of women on sub-board executive committees had fallen since
2009 from 18% to 15%, which is a bad omen as it indicates a real drop
in the number of women in the pipeline for promotion to full
directorships. On his recent trip to India, the Prime Minister
reiterated his commitment to gender equality and we await
some further action, although in his most recent
reshuffle he reduced the number of women Cabinet
Ministers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000388" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000388">Quotas
are opposed often by the very women who, commendably and against the
odds, have successfully scaled the heights of corporate life, saying
that promotion should only be by merit. That clearly does not apply to
men. What appropriate skill sets did the directors of HBOS, RBS,
Northern Rock and other failed institutions bring to their boards which
led to the crisis of 2008, not just in the UK but across the western
world? I recall in a newspaper a montage of photographs of leading
bankers together with one of Sir Terry Wogan. The caption asked:
“Which one has a professional banking qualification?”. Of

subject of police reform which, as some Members of this House will
know, is very close to my heart and something which I support
vigorously. I shall watch with some interest its progress in subsequent
legislation, particularly as to whether it involves legislation or
comment upon the subject of leadership in the police—something
which needs to be resolved and enhanced against the hitherto
remorseless trend towards management rather than leadership. That will
embrace things such as direct entry and accelerated promotion to middle
rank.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13050924000400" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000400">The
question of persistent anti-social behaviour has blighted societies for
a long time. I would certainly support any reasonable measures that
will do something to enhance any thrust to reduce anti-social
behaviour. In terms of the rehabilitation of offenders, what can I say?
I am frequently asked how one can improve the police service. My answer
to that is, “Do something about the probation service and
something to stop the remorseless<B> </B>churn of offenders going
through the system”. It is sometimes called the revolving door;
recidivism is another term that is often used. They mean the same
thing. Anything we can do to rehabilitate offenders and prevent them
reoffending, and going into that constant cycle we know so well, is to
be applauded. I shall throw my weight right behind that.</hs_para>

I say zoological because there is a popular expression these days of

considerable significance or a significant problem, or something that
is known to all and sundry but never mentioned, never referred to or
simply ignored. Today, as your Lordships have concluded, we have an
elephant of significant proportions in this Chamber, as the Government
appear unable to speak its name. It 
<?notus-xml column=109?>is, of course, the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill, which is now in its

the question: why are the Government so secretive about it? What is the
problem? Why was it not included in Her Majesty’s Speech
yesterday? Carryover Bills have been included in the Queen’s
Speech before. One obvious example, going back a few years, is the
Equality Bill that was carried over from the 2008-09 Session with no
fewer than four lines of reference in the Queen’s Speech. Moving
up to the present week, the Energy Bill—another carryover
measure—was included in the Queen’s Speech yesterday, so
why was the marriage Bill not mentioned? Is it that the Government are
losing heart or do they not intend to do other than smuggle it in

all the usual procedures have either been evaded or ignored. It seeks
to effect change to a principal institution in society: the institution
of marriage, which has existed for at least 2,000 years in civilised
society. Some people would say that it has been going for double that
length of time. It will affect every single member of society, one way
or another. Yet it has not so much been introduced by the back door;
rather, it has slipped in through a crack under the back door. The
noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey of Clifton, has already gone
into some detail on that. Given the time, I will not repeat what he
said, which I support.</hs_para>

that the way in which the Bill’s introduction has been handled
is shameful. There has been no royal commission; no committee of
inquiry; no mention in any party’s manifesto prior to the last
general election. Indeed, the possibility of its introduction was
flatly denied by the leader of the Conservative Party in an interview
on national television only three days before his successful election.
There has been no proper public consultation, no matter how much the
Government try to massage the results of what was, it has to be said,
their limited consultation process. They were more concerned with the
process of the matter than with content. If one goes into that
procedure, the figures indicate that only one member of the public in
every 10 supports the Bill. Nine out of 10 against is a substantial
majority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:54:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:54:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000405" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000405">The
Bill is vigorously opposed by all the leading religions. After the
catastrophic losses in the local elections last week—your

education and in employment law. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop

will not prolong this catalogue of criticism; there will be time later

opposition to the Bill is most definitely not anti-gay. I dedicated
much of my life in the public service to the protection and enhancement
of minority rights and securing equality under the law, including the
protection of homosexual rights and equalities. But I sincerely believe
that the passage of this Bill into law will, in turn, create such
opposition to homosexuals in general that the climate of tolerance and
acceptance in this country that we have all championed and supported
and seen flourish over recent years could well be set back by decades.
The noble Lord, Lord Fowler, who is not in his place, spoke eloquently
and, indeed, spread his wings on the subject of what is going on in
Uganda. None of us would want to see anything like that in this

centuries ago. I ask the noble Lord and others to reflect on the fact
that this Bill is not so much about equality as sameness. I leave those

opposition to the Bill is quite unambiguously pro-marriage, supporting

consideration. It should not, as has happened this year, be introduced

Berridge:</Member></B> My Lords, violent crime is down and the UK is a
much more peaceful place. It is not often that one wakes up to such a
good-news story as the lead item on the “Today”
programme. So despite a recession and a decline in police numbers, the
UK has seen a substantial and sustained reduction in direct violence
over the past 10 years.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050924000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000413">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:59:49"></hs_TimeCode>
were the findings of the first UK Peace Index, launched in Parliament
on 24 April. I, too, remained sceptical of such good news until I saw
the quality of the research and the statistical analysis.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T16:59:24"></hs_TimeCode>Between 2003 and
2012, the homicide rate halved in the UK. Violent crime is down from
1,255 to 933 offences per 100,000 people. Broadland in
Norfolk is the most peaceful place to live, while unfortunately
Lewisham is the least. The UKPI also shows that public perception 
<?notus-xml column=111?>of the threat of violence is inflated and is apparently linked to mass
media coverage of high-profile crimes. One only has to think of the
recent wall-to-wall coverage of Boston, but perhaps our diet of
“NCIS”, “Miss Marple”,
“Law and Order: UK”, “Midsomer Murders” and
“Homeland”, to name but a few, does not help
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000414" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000414">What
did not get much coverage was the UKPI’s finding that over the
past five years there has been a reduction in the number of first-time
offenders. With recidivism rates of around 66% and it costing
£40,800 for a year’s imprisonment, preventing the first
offence and the beginning of the cycle is vital. It seems that one of
the causes is many small voluntary groups doing imaginative youth work,
which makes gangs and crime less attractive and helps young people cope
with often complex family situations. So while some serious offenders
will always need the state as the probation service, many others do
not, especially young people. I speak as a trustee of a prison
rehabilitative charity, Kainos Community, that works in four prisons in
the UK. While we depend on the governor, Kainos staff and prison
officers to deliver our rehabilitative community, the prisoners
repeatedly say that what they value most are the volunteers who come in
to spend time with them. It is this volunteer aspect that a probation
service delivered by a charity can give to young people that often the
best probation officer cannot. A relationship given from choice not
contract can do wonders for a prisoner’s self-worth.</hs_para>

charities, including the Message Trust in Manchester, have seen that
such stable relationships need to be supplemented by training and
employment. In January 2013, the chief constable of Greater Manchester
Police opened the Message Enterprise Centre, which is creating
businesses to train and employ young offenders who, in this economic
climate, are, unfortunately, virtually unemployable. A probation
provider that might also give you a job is way beyond what the state
can give you. The challenge will be whether the huge Ministry of
Justice contracts can include the often small, local providers, as
without them the rehabilitation revolution in the gracious Speech will
not be
delivered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000416" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000416">Also
in the gracious Speech was the reform of the police, which included the
introduction of a police remuneration review body. Before going out for
six shifts on the streets of Peckham recently, I was warned that police
would complain to me a lot about pay and pensions, but I was very
encouraged as their complaints were mainly about poor kit. They were
uniform in their view that British and German makes of car for their
patrol cars were great kit and that the replacement Japanese cars were
poor kit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000417" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000417">I
also saw first-hand the need for more sophisticated statistics on the
stop-and-search situation on our streets to see what is really
happening. However, as I mentioned recently in your Lordships’
House, I was even more convinced that police who exercise the coercive
power of the state on our streets must reflect the communities they
serve. The statistics I obtained from the House of Lords Library are
sobering. More than 40% of Londoners now are not white, but only 11.6%
of police constables are from a BME background, and once you go up just

<?notus-xml column=112?>one rank the figures on average halve to 5.5% of chief inspectors and
3.8% of chief superintendants. In bald figures, at senior ranks of
superintendant and above, the Met has 315 officers, and just 17 of them
are from a BME background. I was encouraged that the figures for
Greater Manchester Police and West Midlands Police are much better, so
it is not an impossible task. It is true that the ratio for PCSOs in
the Met is much better at 34.5%, but that post was introduced in 2002
so for how much longer can we listen to the clarion call that this will
be the solution to the situation?</hs_para>

entry is now viewed as the solution, but when that other recent
innovation, the national College of Policing and its board,
has no ordinary person from the communities it polices on it, let alone
anyone from a BME background, I find it hard to be optimistic. This
issue is often viewed as historical. I am told that what I am saying is
very much last-Government, as if this is some kind of fashion, but the
Riots Communities and Victims Panel, which looked into the 2011 riots,
showed that this is still very much a live
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000419" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000419">Finally,
being a trustee of the think tank British Future, which speaks on
identity, migration and integration, leads me, of course, to mention
the immigration Bill. Whatever might be the practicalities for the NHS
and landlords, I am pleased that we can now speak about immigration
without fear of being called a racist. Perhaps this change was
inevitable because the latest wave of mass migration, in 2004, was from
Poland, and therefore the race and immigration issues were helpfully
separated. However, that enforced silence, while people had very real
issues to be addressed, sent people to extremes and is one of the
reasons why the tone and language of debate can still be acerbic and
polemical. Had we been able to talk about this more freely, the debate
would now be held in a more constructive manner. As politicians, it is
vital that we keep our categories clear. There are legal migrants,
illegal migrants and asylum seekers, and we must remember that many
British citizens are very recent legal migrants and asylum seekers,
which demands that we understand the sensitivities around this
issue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000420" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000420">The
correct tone in this debate will also help the UK to retain our long
tradition of being a refuge for those who need it. In a recent YouGov
survey, conducted for British Future on the asylum claims from Afghan
interpreters who helped the British Army, 60% of those who expressed an
opinion believed that Britain should allow those workers to settle
here. We should be justifiably proud that Pakistani schoolgirl Malala
Yousufzai is being treated and educated here in Britain. Before its
disbandment, the UKBA was open to working with the Asylum Advocacy

added to that list, as guides, sound information, logic and a clear
head. I have also just added “not acerbic or polemic

Time and debate both in and outside Parliament will tell how the Bill
is guided, and whether it appeals to fear and pessimism.</hs_parafo>

components of the Bill are not wholly clear. In March, announcing the
splitting up of the UKBA, the Home Secretary said that a Bill in this
Session would address its “complicated legal framework”.
That matter does not seem to have been discussed publicly but
presumably will occupy us. If it is to be part of the Bill, what of the
Immigration Services between now and the commencement of
legislation—or is that an administrative
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:09:52"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000426">There
has been much discussion of restrictions on services and benefits for
immigrants, where fear—as many noble Lords said—is too
easily whipped up. The big question is whether it is the right thing to
do. Another question is whether it is workable. I hope that, before the
Government bring forward a Bill, they will undertake very full
consultation with landlords who may be required to check the
immigration status of tenants, with employers who are already required
to check for possible irregular migrants—how realistic is it to
give them further immigration responsibility, and how are confusion and
discrimination to be avoided?—and with health professionals, who
I am sure do not want to go down the road of, “We need to see
your papers”, which would be comparable to, “We need to
see your insurance” in the
US<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:10:54"></hs_TimeCode>. A framework
Bill against a background of an arms race of rhetoric would not be the
reminder that we need of the benefits that our country has gained and

understand that the Bill will also deal with the deportation of those
who have no legal basis to remain. We must be concerned about the
impact of that on refugee and migrant children and families, including
unaccompanied children and those trafficked into the UK. I echo the
reference of the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Lichfield to the
wide impacts of the administration of the immigration system. This in
part takes us back to the quality of
decision-making<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:11:51"></hs_TimeCode>.
If legislation is to include what is currently within the immigration
rules, in what position does that leave the thousands of
other rules? I do not understand the need to

mentioned trafficking. I was delighted to hear the Prime Minister say
bluntly the other day that trafficking is slavery, and announce his
intention to involve himself closely with the issue. On that occasion
he met a 
<?notus-xml column=114?>woman who had escaped domestic servitude—eventually. She was
helped by the wonderful little charity Kalayaan, which reports the
markedly worse treatment of those it encounters on the relatively new
tied migrant domestic worker visa—tied, that is, to the
employer. This must be an unintended consequence that we could address
in the
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:13:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000429" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000429">Much
of the impact of other rules introduced last year on family migration
must have been unintended and unforeseen. I am at the moment involved
in an all-party group looking at these rules, and we are working on our
report. I will share two stories with your Lordships. The rules make
new provision for bringing to the UK adult and elderly dependants. We
heard from the BMA of a woman consultant in the NHS who was
unsuccessful in her application to bring to the UK her elderly parents,
for whom she wanted to care. She decided to move back to Singapore. Her
sister, feeling that it was wrong that only one child should take on
this responsibility, moved back with her, as did her brother-in-law.
They, too, were consultant psychiatrists. This country lost three
consultants in that one episode. One was a psychiatrist specialising in
children with learning difficulties—a very specialised
specialty, if I may put it that way. If all we are looking at is
numbers, I suppose that was a double
win<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:14:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000430" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000430">We
have also raised considerably the minimum income threshold and other
financial requirements for applications to bring in a spouse or
partner—with any children—who is a non-EEA national. We
heard from a gentleman living in Swansea, an area of very low wages,
who is earning an adequate wage for his area but well below the
threshold. He has an autistic daughter, and he would like to bring his
new wife to this country from Canada, but he is not able to do so
because of the financial limits. That woman would help to care for the
daughter, which would be a saving to the state, not a drain on it. We
heard, too, of British children separated from a parent because of the
tightness of the rules. I was particularly struck by hearing more and
more of the understanding of the impact of separation on a
child’s development, and the attachment disorders that may
result<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:15:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000431" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000431">We
will address questions of attachment and identity when this House comes
to the Children and Families Bill, to which my noble friend has
referred, and the work of the Adoption Legislation Committee. There
turned out to be both post and pre-legislative scrutiny. I was a member
of that committee, and we will be debating that for the first time next
week<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:15:56"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope,

the last Session, the Government acknowledged the role of the victim in
rehabilitation of offenders—and therefore, of course, as we all
know, the prevention of further offending in future—in
legislating for restorative justice. That was very delicate, but
welcome. The community trigger for communities on the receiving 
<?notus-xml column=115?>end of persistent anti-social behaviour will also be delicate. These
things need sensitive handling, and there is a difficult line between
early intervention and prevention and assumptions of guilt. The fairly
new Chief Inspector of Constabulary at the HMIC recently spoke about
the police needing to focus on crime prevention, which is something
that we would all support. I hope that he did not mean crossing that
delicate line when he said that resources would be needed

hope, for my part, that the Bill will extend the restorative justice
approach, working with a young person, and with those affected by

difficult line is to know what a result is, when an organisation is
paid by results. I congratulate the Government on their determination
to cut reoffending by recent ex-prisoners, especially those on short
sentences—or, to put it another way, to help them back into
mainstream society. The Government know that this needs facilitating
different, new, imaginative, risk-taking ways of doing things. When I
was making notes for today, I decided that I was really too weary of
the terms “innovation” and “radical”, which
I think are becoming a bit devalued. To find a way to succeed, an
organisation must be allowed to fail. The St Giles Trust is rightly
held up as a model of this way of working. It is admirable and engages
ex-offenders to work with its clients to very great
effect<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:19:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:19:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:17:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:19:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050924000435" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-0002.htm#13050924000435">Conversations
between all who come within the very extensive umbrella of
stakeholders—another overworked term—must be the right
way to go about things. In the interests of time, I will not develop
that thought in relation to terrorism and counterterrorism except to
say that we would not have got where we did in Northern Ireland if we
had not been prepared to talk directly to terrorists. I wonder whether
we need the same leap of imagination and faith to take creative steps
not just with the moderates in various communities where there is a

was mentioned in the gracious Speech in the context of foreign affairs
and so, too, was my final topic—preventing sexual violence in
conflicts worldwide. This matter is more than prevention; it is a case
of responding to people’s needs and giving aid. I congratulate
the Government, particularly the Foreign Secretary, on the Preventing
Sexual Violence Initiative. I very much hope that the Government will
be able to use feedback on local capacity in conflict and post-conflict
situations provided by those working on the initiative. We must not be
yet another entourage of experts who come and go. We must build up
lasting relationships as the way to achieve lasting change through
working with local experts and local NGOs. After all, it is what we are
trying to do at home with payment by results. NGOs in these situations
often need very little payment to achieve very significant
results<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:21:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

those unsuccessfully put forward by Her Majesty’s Government in
last year’s legislative programme. Before I deal with that
issue, I wish to deal briefly with three other sins of omission from
the gracious Speech. My language must be influenced by the fact that I
am sitting next to the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Carey. I
very much regret the absence of the expected legislation on the plain
packaging of tobacco and minimum alcohol pricing. Both measures were
mentioned earlier and both could have played an important part in
public health policy and the prevention of illness. Not including them
in the gracious Speech is a lost opportunity for improving health in
this country, which is of great

also regret the omission of enshrining in legislation the
Government’s commitment to spending 0.7% of GDP on overseas
development. I have enormous respect and admiration for what this
Government have done in overseas development in both quality and
quantity. Their achievement is more impressive having taken place at a
time of such strict economic circumstances. It is therefore a sadness
that they have not carried through into legislation their commitment in
practice to the 0.7% target. To have done so would have ensured the
sustainability of spending, but not just that; it would have encouraged
other countries to follow the UK’s example. It would also have
added to the huge respect that other countries have for us and our
influence if we had shown in legislation that we intended this to be
not a one-off but a continuing commitment to the developing
world—an issue which the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of
Crosby, talked about. We have gained tremendous international respect

made it clear then, and have done so since, that there is a substantial
agenda of reform—some of it legislative, some within the control

inevitably feature ministerial double acts. Today, the event stars the
noble Lords, Lord Taylor and Lord McNally. The genre is, of course, a
familiar one. We think perhaps of Neil Simon’s “The Odd
Couple” or the Geordie comedy “The Likely Lads”,
though perhaps 
<?notus-xml column=118?>“The Likely Lords” would be a more appropriate
description. The latest example is the new comedy series
“Vicious”, although I would not for a moment suggest that
that is an appropriate adjective to describe two highly congenial and

Last<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:32:24"></hs_TimeCode> Wednesday,
the Select Committee on the Constitution published a report entitled
<I>The Pre-emption of Parliament</I>. The report deals with the
tendency of the Government to pre-empt legislation or, in a phrase that
I coined with regard to the Public Bodies Bill, to engage in
pre-legislative implementation, as opposed to the established concept
of pre-legislative scrutiny and post-legislative review. The report
asserts that,</hs_para>

there are other aspects of the way that the Government deal with
legislation which arouse concerns across the House. The committee of
the noble Lord, Lord Goodlad, reported recently on the
Government’s approach to consultation and was critical of the
shortened timescales that they too often impose. Frequently, moreover,
we receive details of the response to consultation and, in turn, the
Government’s response to the outcome of consultation at a very
late stage in the legislative process. Proposed statutory guidance or
draft regulations are all too often simply not available at all in time
to be taken into account as we scrutinise the legislation. In these
circumstances, neither House is able to discharge its responsibility to
scrutinise and improve legislation properly.</hs_para>

to the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act and the
Crime and Courts Act. The president of the Family Division has
proclaimed that the courts are “wholly unprepared” for
the changes now being implemented. The Government are pressing ahead,
as we learnt today, with the privatisation of much of the work of the
probation service and the introduction of a payment-by-results system.
Not only have they cancelled the two pilot schemes they were running,
in Staffordshire in the

the concerns expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and the noble

Government have charged ahead with ill-thought-out measures that have
caused huge problems and cost large sums of money. The fiasco of the
new court interpreter system, the process of issuing all civil monetary
claims from a single court, the outsourcing of court
security—that paragon of efficiency, G4S, apparently pays its
staff £6.45 an hour but is itself paid £11.49 an hour for
the hours worked by its staff, and makes a gross profit of £42
million a year—all testify to that ideological obsession with

root-and-branch examination, and I look forward to the outcome of that.
Equally, I welcome what I take to be the Government’s intention
to proceed with the equal marriage Bill, and I support those, such as
the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, who made a remarkable speech this morning,
on what he said about the Bill. Too often, it seems to me, the Lord
Chancellor indulges in the politics of the dog whistle—a
tendency that will no doubt become more evident as the UKIP pack snaps

it is in the fields of legal aid and litigation that the most profound
damage is threatened to our system of justice and of access to it. It
is extraordinary that one of the main justifications advanced for the
changes which will deprive 650,000 claimants a year of legal advice or
legal aid is that the scheme has changed over the past 65 years to
cover more areas of law, although, as it happens, a smaller proportion
of the population. Would the same argument be advanced to justify
cutting the National Health Service where more treatments become
available, or any of the other areas of public policy where needs
change as society, the economy, technology or the environment change?
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:39:44"></hs_TimeCode> will continue
to scrutinise and challenge the regulations still to be made to
implement the LASPO changes, and we look forward to the Low
commission’s report on the effect of the changes and the cost to
the court system. Both in this context and in relation to criminal
legal aid, to which I now turn, we will look for alternative savings

Government’s proposals on criminal legal aid rely yet again on
the discredited tendering system which has given us Atos, Group 4, the
interpreter fiasco, and more besides. But these proposals are even
worse because, as the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, pointed out, those who
qualify for legal aid will have no choice of representative. A mere 400
firms will be given contracts and clients will be allocated to them
apparently on a crude rotation basis. Fees for both barristers and
solicitors will be cut by at least 30% and 17.5% respectively from in
most cases a low base which, of course, includes substantial overheads.
The criminal Bar in particular will be very hard hit, but the real
damage will be done to the client and the courts as well as to the
practitioners. Nor do the Government’s sums add up. They claim a
saving of £220 million a year but their estimate shows only
£118 million a year by 2016-17. As that is the product of the
cut in fees the tendering exercise appears to make no difference. The
proposed savings on prison law will save all of £4
million allegedly, and Answers to Parliamentary Questions tabled by
colleagues in the House of Commons have established that there is no
estimate of the savings to flow from the proposed 12-month residency
test, or even how much is now spent on legal aid for foreigners. It is

They have ranged far and wide, and way beyond the areas I have been

this kind. However, we have dealt with topics such as constitutional
affairs, equalities, home affairs, justice and the law. My noble friend
Lord Cormack complained that this is a thin Queen’s Speech, but
I think noble Lords will agree that his definition of thinness perhaps
differs from mine. He was a little concerned that this House would not
have enough work to do. I think that is an unnecessary anxiety. As one
who will be partly responsible for seeing through elements of this
programme, I have to say that there will not be a shortage of things
for noble Lords to do. It is very much in the tradition of this House

to some of the issues that noble Lords have raised. We heard that the
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill will radically reform
the way in which anti-social behaviour is tackled. Generally, it has
been warmly welcomed by noble Lords. Through the introduction of the
community remedy and the community trigger, it will focus response on
the needs of victims and communities, which all too often are let down
by the current system. That will give front-line
professionals—the police, councils, housing providers and
others—more effective and streamlined powers. As noble Lords
will have heard, the Bill will also address a number of other important
crime and policing matters, including making it easier for landlords to
take swift and decisive action against their tenants, thus creating a
powerful deterrent against problem behaviour. It will tackle
irresponsible dog ownership. Although that has caused some amusement,
it is certainly a very serious issue and one which, when I was a
Minister in Defra, I was much exercised about. It will extend to any
place the offence of owning or being in charge of a dog that is
dangerously out of control. It is a measure that I think is long
overdue. It will explicitly make an attack on an assistance dog, such
as a guide dog for the blind, an aggravated offence. In addition, the
Bill will target not only people who use illegal firearms but those who
import or supply them. We need to send a clear message that people who
are involved in this trade are as responsible as those who actually
pull the trigger for the terrible harm that gun crime
causes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-05-09T17:49:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Smith, and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Exeter both
talked about the community trigger and expressed some concern about how
effective it will be. There was a suggestion that there needed to be
several complaints before the process came into play. It will become
evident, when we take the legislation through the House, that this is
not the case. The duty already exists on local agencies to deal with
every report of an ASB incident, and many agencies already respond
quickly. The community trigger will be used in situations where
victims’ problems have been ignored and will give victims the
right to demand that agencies take action. There is some evidence that
some individuals have been ignored in the past in this regard, and this
empowers them to demand that their complaints be taken

concerns that this issue has been ignored. In March 2012, the

radically reshape the approach to alcohol and reduce excessive
drinking. Public consultation closed on 6 February and we are carefully

matters carefully before we rush to legislate and we will set out our
proposals in due course. The noble Lord will know that the court in

leave the country and that foreigners who commit serious crimes should
be deported from the UK in all but the most exceptional circumstances.

to the offender rehabilitation Bill, all the contributions recognised
that this was an important area and indeed welcomed the

long. The case for a new approach is clear. We spend more than
£3 billion a year on prisons and almost £1 billion
annually on delivering sentences in the community. Despite this
investment, almost half of all offenders released from prison offend
again within 12 months. The very highest reoffending rates are among
prisoners sentenced to custodial sentences of less than 12 months:
nearly 60% reoffend within a year of release. Our reforms to

Professionalism lies at the heart of so much of public service. I

will be possible to bring together the best of the public, voluntary
and private sectors and give them the freedom to innovate and focus on
turning round the lives of offenders. We heard examples of where
voluntary and third sector services had been remarkably successful in
this area. We can build on that success, and I assure noble Lords that
there is no intention that these contracts should be given just to big
organisations. They will be given to voluntary and third sector
organisations as

professionalism already in place that makes an important contribution
to public protection. I support the comments of noble Lords who have

Under-Secretary of State for Skills, (Matthew Hancock) has made the

reform the education system we need better support for young people
aged over 16 who are focused on securing an apprenticeship
or sustainable jobs. We want to make it the new norm that young people
go into either an apprenticeship or
university.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050927000322" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000322">Employers
frequently tell us that they are not satisfied with the quality of
young applicants that they receive for their vacancies. They would like
young people to have better English and maths, experience in the
workplace and the skills and character needed to secure and hold down a
job.</hs_para><?notus-xml column=12?>

a framework for delivery for a new programme of traineeships.
Traineeships will address the needs of young people and employers
directly, providing an important link between school or college and
apprenticeships or sustainable work.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050927000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000324">The programme will
begin from August this year for 16 to 19 year-olds, and we will look to
extend the programme up to 24 in due course. Traineeships will be
designed to help young people develop in three core areas and have
flexibility around this core to respond to individuals’
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13050927000325" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000325">First,
they will include high quality work placements. This will allow
trainees to work with an employer, developing the behaviours necessary
to find and keep a job.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050927000326" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000326">Secondly, traineeships
will offer flexible training in other relevant areas to build character
and help young people get ready for work, such as job search and
interview skills, timekeeping and teamworking.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050927000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000327">Thirdly, and crucially,
the programme will develop the English and maths that employers
consistently tell us are essential prerequisites for successful
employment.</hs_para>

will have the freedom to work together to develop these core elements
and any additional flexible content in the best way to engage and
support individual trainees and meet the needs of local employers.
Traineeships will be part of our new study programmes, which will
ensure simplicity and enable young people to move between
options.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13050927000329" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000329">Each
traineeship will last up to six months, after which the trainee will be
much better placed to progress into an apprenticeship, a sustainable
job, or into continued education to develop the skills they need for
their chosen career. Traineeships will conclude with a guaranteed
interview with the work placement host, either for a job or a reference
from their work placement to develop their CV.</hs_para>

will restrict the providers who offer traineeships to those that Ofsted
have judged to be outstanding or good. This will help to ensure a
high-quality start that we can expand upon in future years.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13050927000331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/130509-wms0001.htm#13050927000331">Employers will have a
key role in making the traineeships programme a success, both leading
delivery and working in partnership with education and training
providers. I believe that the traineeships programme that I am
announcing today will set more young people on the path to
apprenticeships, sustainable jobs and successful careers.</hs_para>
