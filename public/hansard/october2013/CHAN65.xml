willingness to negotiate and to come to an agreement with the
international community on its nuclear programme. The programme
continues: Iran claims that its 20% enriched uranium is fuel for its
one small research reactor, but it already has enough enriched uranium
to fuel that reactor for the next 10 years. That is why we argue that
there is no plausible peaceful explanation for the continuation of
enrichment and of many features of Iran’s programme. But we must
test Iran’s willingness to negotiate, and we continue to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000094"><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Gwynne" PimsId="4785" UID="13102964000498" xid="827" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000498"><B>Andrew

many right hon. and hon. Members on both sides of the House, I am
sceptical about the value of the pervasiveness of CCTV in our lives and
in our communities, but I wish to explain to the House why I believe
that its provision in private hire vehicles and taxis is warranted and
justified. For too long our private hire and taxi drivers have been
treated like second-class citizens. Indeed, they are an overlooked
community when it comes to personal safety. Yet they are an essential
part of our public transport system, for in many towns across the
country, who is going to take people home in the evenings? It will be a
private hire cab or a licensed taxi. However, the safety provided in
those circumstances is below that provided in other forms of public
transport. It is the most trusting of circumstances: one, two or three
people in a single vehicle late at night, with nothing to provide any
evidence if a crime is
committed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000207">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:39:51"></hs_TimeCode>
types of crime that are committed run the gamut, from theft to racial
abuse and assault. Many of our taxi drivers are drawn from ethnic
minorities. Racial abuse, wherever it happens, is unacceptable. In
Doncaster, taxi drivers requested that the local council bring in CCTV
because they were concerned about the incidence of racial abuse. They
noted a significant decline in racial abuse following the introduction
of CCTV.
Theft<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:34:59"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>
is almost thought of as a cost of doing business. We should consider
what it must be like for a taxi driver when two or three people they
have driven home simply refuse to pay. What evidence does the driver
have that a crime has been committed? What power does he or she have to
stop those people perpetrating that crime? There is little ability to
stop the crime and little evidence that it has happened. The number of
assaults that occur in disputes between drivers and passengers is
horrifying, and occasionally they lead to
murder.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000208">Having
CCTV<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:37:51"></hs_TimeCode> in taxis is
about providing safety not only for drivers but for passengers, because
there are sometimes instances of passengers attacking each other in the
back of taxis. In my conversations with the Metropolitan police, I was
interested to hear that they regard the provision of CCTV in taxis and
private hire vehicles as helpful in cases of sexual assault or rape
that occur after people have been taken by taxi to a place of
residence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000209">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>
are some general examples, but I have been moved to seek to bring in
this Bill by specific examples in my constituency. A year ago one of my
constituents, Mehar Dhariwal, was murdered. His murder brought into
sharp relief the dangers that men and women in our taxis can be under

dangers faced by taxi drivers were also brought into sharp relief when
a friend of mine who works for 24-7 Cars was held at knife point
between Bedford and Luton. He managed to escape only because he was
smart enough to realise that there was a police car parked at a petrol
station he was approaching. He rolled out of the taxi, sustaining
injuries, and the taxi came to a halt. The two perpetrators of the
crime got out and were chased by two police officers. One of those
idiots threw a knife at the police officers and the other turned a gun
on them, but the officers bravely dodged the knife and one of them
knocked the gun away. I am pleased to say that our chief constable was
prepared to take all necessary measures to ensure that those criminals
faced the full force of
justice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000211" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000211"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:39:34"></hs_TimeCode>This
Bill proposes to provide for secure and encrypted CCTV in taxi cabs. It
is important from the point of view of privacy that the information is
secure and encrypted. It should also be accessible by the police only
in circumstances in which a crime is reported to have been committed.
The system should be mandatory, because then the citizen would know
that it was being used when they got into a taxi cab. If the take-up
were voluntary rather than mandatory, people would not know exactly
what type of safety provision was in use. Councils around the country
have seen the value of introducing a mandatory system over a voluntary
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:40:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000212">There
is a question about whether CCTV should provide just video coverage or
audio coverage as well. This issue was subject to an Information
Commissioner review involving Southampton council earlier this year.
The consequence was not to ban audio recording outright, but to say
that it could be provided only in a panic situation—a short
burst of audio at the particular point when a driver felt a crime was
being committed. I believe that that is the correct
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:41:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000213" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000213">There
are also issues with costs. The last thing I would wish as a result of
this Bill is to place additional costs on drivers. We do not ask bus
drivers to pay for the CCTV that protects them, and nor should we ask
taxi drivers to pay for their own personal safety while they ply their
trade. Southampton has built on its work with the Information
Commissioner and has a very good approach to covering costs: the
council covers the cost of the camera and the taxi drivers are
responsible for the maintenance and installation of the system. That
also allows the driver to recoup their costs through insurance
reductions, because CCTV is able to look outside as well as inside the
vehicle and can therefore be used as evidence in claims when crashes or
whiplash are caused. In such circumstances, I believe that the costs
that would fall on the drivers would be negligible at
best<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:42:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000214" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000214">This
Bill seeks to provide a level of security for our taxi drivers that is
long overdue. Workers in other high-risk transport situations already
benefit from it and I believe it would have a significant impact. A US
study recently compared the effect of measures such as CCTV and
barriers between the driver and passengers. It found that only one
method contributed to a significant reduction in crimes against
drivers, and that was
CCTV<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:42:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Webb:</Member></B> This group of amendments contains a long list of
disparate topics. To give the House a feel for what we are discussing,
it includes an attempt to limit the scope of automatic enrolment, the
transfer of small pension pots, short service refunds, the vexed issue
of pension scheme charges, issues with governance and administration,
the decumulation of pension pots, the specific issue of rail pensions
and the pension protection fund compensation cap. I shall do my best to
whizz 
<?notus-xml column=770?>through all those issues to minimise or obviate as far as is possible

should start on a note of consensus. This part of the Bill deals with
private pensions and I think that the House would agree that the
process of automatic enrolment into workplace pensions is going
exceptionally well. The process started a year ago. British industry
has automatically enrolled about 1.7 million employees into workplace
pensions. The rate of not opting out, or of staying in, has been far
better than anybody predicted. Our survey evidence suggests that of the
order of nine in 10 workers have chosen to remain in their workplace
pensions. That is something that we should all
welcome<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:48:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000264">The
Bill is designed to improve that situation further and to deal with
some unfinished business. Although the principle of automatic enrolment
was legislated for in the previous Parliament, many issues were not
dealt with. If those are not dealt with, it will undermine the success
of automatic
enrolment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000265" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000265">Amendment
53 relates to the scope of automatic enrolment. Clause 34 gives the
Government the power to exclude some people from the employer duty for
automatic enrolment. I will give the House a flavour of the sorts of
people that we might be talking about. In automatic enrolment, we have
sought to strike a balance between setting out the rules at the start
and giving employers and the industry certainty, and learning and
listening and then changing the rules when we have got something wrong
or when something needs to be refined or streamlined. We could have
changed the rules and constantly tweaked things, or we could have said
at the start, “These are the rules for the next five or six
years until everybody’s in. Go and deal with it”, but we
tried to strike a
balance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000266">As
we have learned, the rules require employers to put a certain set of
people into workplace pensions who may immediately opt out. For
example, people with what is called enhanced or fixed tax protection
status—high net wealth individuals—could face a tax
surcharge if their pension pot exceeds the lifetime allowance. In
general, such individuals will want to opt straight back out of the
scheme, and their employers have said, “Why are you making us
put these people into pension schemes? We all know they are going to
opt out, and indeed they will be cross with us if they fail to opt out
and later face a tax penalty.” At the moment, the Government do
not have the power to enable firms not to enrol those people, so clause
34 provides the power to exempt them from
enrolment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000267" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000267">The
second example concerns those who have already given notice. Someone
may have given a month’s notice, but in the middle of that
period the Government require the employer to put them in a pension
scheme. As Members will understand, that is silly, because that person
will probably opt out immediately. In any case, asking firms to enrol
people who have already given notice does not do much for our relations
with the CBI. Those are examples of where we have given employers a
comprehensive, rigid legal duty that creates perverse outcomes. Clause
34 therefore allows employers to exempt certain categories of workers,
and I have mentioned the sorts of examples it would
cover.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000268" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000268">Amendment
53 says, “That’s all very well, but we don’t want
you using the power to exempt categories of business such as small and
medium-sized firms.” Leaving 
<?notus-xml column=771?>aside the fact that the amendment does not define an SME and it is not
clear who would be covered, and that any amendment with “such
as” suggests it is a bit vague to begin with, in responding to
the spirit of the amendment I assure

is otiose, because if we were the evil Government that the hon.
Gentleman thinks we are and wanted to exclude small and medium-sized
firms, we could do that anyway. The staging schedule is set in
statutory instrument, subject to negative procedure. Therefore, if we
wanted to exclude Britain’s small firms, we would have only to
produce a statutory instrument that would say that small firms will be
required to stage in 2099. That would not even be subject to a vote in
the House. If the amendment seeks to stop the Government doing
something that, in any case, we do not want to do, it would not work;
we could still do it even if the amendment were successful. I hope I
have reassured the House that amendment 53 is unnecessary, because we
do not plan to do such a thing. Secondly, the amendment is not well
drafted because it is not clear who it means. Thirdly, even if passed,
it would not achieve the desired objective. An unnecessary, poorly
drafted amendment that does not work should probably not be approved by
the House.</hs_Para>

to 52 concern what happens to small pension pots—an issue that
was not addressed when the original legislation for automatic enrolment
was drawn up. People change jobs perhaps 10 or 11 times in their
working life, and they leave behind small pension pots. From the
Australian experience, we know that can mean lots of people losing
track of their pension pots and not engaging with pension saving
because they have large numbers of small, silly pension pots all over
the place.</hs_Para>

often mentioned as having one of the world’s best pension
systems, and the Australians say that the one thing they wish they had
addressed at the start was small dormant pension pots. The Australian
Government have been going at this for longer than we have, and they
estimate that they have 5 million lost pension accounts containing 20
billion Australian dollars. It is a serious issue. Clause 29 in
schedule 16 sets out the Government’s response to the issue,
which is what we call pot follows member. When someone moves from an
auto-enrolment defined contribution pot to another one, their
pot—as long as it is below a £10,000
threshold—automatically follows them unless they opt for that
not to be the case.</hs_Para>

provisions for the automatic transfer of small pension pots, which will

Opposition amendments suggest a different route and would mean that
when someone changes job, the dormant pension pot is automatically
transferred to a third-party pension scheme called an aggregator. As I
understand it, there would not be just one aggregator but multiple
aggregators, and I have multiple concerns about that. First, such a
policy would clearly lead to greater fragmentation of pension
saving—it must do. Let us imagine the simplest example in which
someone moves from firm A to firm B, and works only for two firms in
their working life. In our model, the small dormant pension pot follows
them from firm A to firm B—or scheme A to scheme B—and
they end up with a single pension pot. In the model suggested by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T12:55:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East, the dormant pension
pot gets shunted off to some third-party provider with whom the
employee has never engaged. They therefore have a pot with the current
employer and with the third-party provider.</hs_Para>

not just to hoover up small pension pots but to get people engaged in
pension saving. The problem with someone shunting their money off to a
third-party provider, perhaps one they did not choose—there is
not much detail in the hon. Gentleman’s model, but I do not
think it involves a person choosing a third-party provider, although
perhaps it does—is that they get a letter from a pension company
they have never heard of saying, “Guess what, we’ve got
your dormant pension pot.” It is not exactly a ransom note, but
it might be the first that someone knows about it, and that will not
lead them to become
engaged.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000277" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000277">Under
our model, someone’s pension savings are with their current
employer. That is what they are interested in and where workplace
pension engagement takes place. We therefore believe that our model
provides better consolidation of pension saving and better engagement.
Our model also saves on the cost of running pension schemes, compared
with the model set out in the amendments. With a pot size limit of
£10,000—obviously our published research relates to the
£2,000 pot size limit on the aggregator model—which is
the same across the two systems, we still estimate that the aggregate
approach will achieve only half the cumulative administrative savings
by 2050 of our pot follows member system. While aggregators are worth a
look—we considered that option—it is clear that pot
follows member is the best solution.</hs_Para>

issue of what happens if money is automatically transferred from a
“good” scheme to a “bad” scheme, and I
accept that point. That is why we are regulating for scheme quality. It
should not just be a worry that someone’s small pension pot gets
auto-transferred to a bad scheme; it should be a worry that an entire
work force have been auto-enrolled into a bad scheme. We
should not have bad schemes and must deal with that. That is why we are
tackling pension scheme quality, which includes a range of issues such
as governance, investment, costs and charges. In a few moments I will
have news for my hon. Friends and the House about what
action we are taking on charges. For those
reasons, we are not convinced by the multiple aggregator model, as it
is catchily known. We believe that the someone changing job and their
money 
<?notus-xml column=773?>following them is a simple, attractive notion that I commend to the

5 to 10 are largely technical and deal with short service refunds.
There is a category of money purchase pension schemes through which
someone who has worked for a firm for under two years can have their
money back when they leave. That is not in the spirit of what we are
trying to achieve through our pension reforms. We want people, even
those who put in relatively small amounts of pension savings, to
accumulate that, build up what I call a big fat pot, and have a decent
retirement. Short service refunds fly in the face of the view that even
modest pension savings are worth having, and we therefore propose to
eliminate them. The danger with the current legislation is that
although someone joined to a pension scheme through a contract has
30 days to opt out, under the Bill they would be in the
scheme on day one, and a day’s or month’s worth of
pension contribution would be lodged. On purely pragmatic grounds we
took that view that we ought to apply the same 30-day rule to short
service refunds. Clause 32 abolishes short service refunds, and
technical amendments 5 to 10 deliver a 30-day breathing space so that
someone who is a member of a scheme for fewer than 30 days can receive
a refund of what are essentially nominal contributions. I hope that
amendments 5 to 10 will be welcomed across the
House.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/FFFB77408AC29E9189A1B1C02B9B510F21977D3F" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 October 2013">Tuesday

central issue in the debate on this group of amendments is pension
scheme charges. The charge quoted on a pension scheme might be 1%,
which sounds pretty innocent, because if 99p in the pound of a
person’s money goes into their pension, the chances are that
they will believe they are getting a good deal. However, pension scheme
charges are compounded, so 1% of the fund is taken out in the first
year, 1% of what is there is taken out in the second year, and so on.
The Government estimate that the cumulative impact of charges can be
very substantial, despite apparently innocuous, low-sounding
charges.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000281" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000281">Some
attempts have been made to tackle charges. The previous Government set
a charge cap on stakeholder pensions at what now looks like an
astonishingly high level. To remind the House, someone who takes out a
stakeholder pension can be within the previous Government’s caps
if they pay a charge of 1.5% for 10 years followed by 1%
thereafter. That is acceptable and regarded as qualifying for the
stakeholder stamp. The then Government said, “That’s
great. As long as your pension scheme is charging you less than 1.5%
for the first 10 years and 1% thereafter, the box is ticked and it is a
good pension scheme.” I do not regard charges of 1.5% for 10
years and 1% for the rest as good value for money. This Government can
and will do
better.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000282">Why
is 1% significant? Suppose you save, through your working life,
£100 a month into a pension—I am not posing this question
to you directly, Mr Speaker, but rhetorically—how much of your
pension pot will have gone compared with the situation for a pension
that has no charges? If the charge is 1% of £100 a month, the
total charge for a year will be £12 or something, which does not
sound like very much. However, 
<?notus-xml column=774?>it accumulates to more than £160,000—the difference
between no charges and a 1% charge on savings of £100
a month is £160,000, which comes out of the pension pot. That is
why I regard the charge caps that the previous Government sought to
apply to stakeholder pensions—they applied no charge cap
whatever for automatic enrolment—as alarmingly high and
alarmingly gentle on the pensions
industry.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000283">I
believe this Government can do better than that. I am therefore pleased
to say that tomorrow we will publish a consultation document on charges
in automatic enrolment pension schemes. We have waited to do that
because we wanted to see the Office of Fair Trading report, which was
published in September. It looked at the market and found that the
demand side of the workplace pensions market was one of the worst it
had ever encountered—that is almost verbatim what it
said.</hs_Para>

regulate the price of baked beans because the market works. People shop
around and buy a product they want, and they can choose a different one
if they do not like it. The market for workplace pensions is not like
that. The demand side of the model is very weak, because the people who
pay the charges, the scheme members, are not the same as the people who
choose the pension—the employer chooses the pension, but the
member pays the charges. Even though the employee has an incentive to
want a low-charge pension scheme, they are not the consumer. The
employer is the consumer. Employers might be oblivious to charges, they
might not care, or they might want to get rid of the hassle of choosing
a pension scheme and therefore choose what they are offered. In that
situation, the employee has a binary choice: stay in or get out. They
cannot shop around or negotiate the charges down. It is a
take-it-or-leave-it
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000285" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000285">It
is worse. Not only are employees automatically enrolled, and therefore
in by default, but their money is invested by default into a default
fund. Overwhelmingly, the money of the people I am talking about ends
up in default funds. They are double-defaulted—they are
defaulted into pension saving and the money is defaulted into default
investment funds. We absolutely must protect the consumer interests of
those individuals. Therefore, the consultation that opens tomorrow will
consider how far we can get with disclosure.</hs_Para>

tens of thousands of pension funds telling the pension regulator what
their charges are. That would not be great. If I am a scheme member who
has just been auto-enrolled or who has fairly passively remained in my
scheme, I will be passively put into a default pension fund, but
somebody somewhere—Brighton, for example—has a website
with a charge figure on it. That is not great and does not really help.
We need something better and tougher than
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000287" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000287">We
are therefore proposing a range of options on how far we can get with
better disclosure and transparency, and on an absolute charge cap. I
can tell the House that we will include in our consultation the option
of a 0.75% charge cap on workplace pension schemes. That is a tougher
charge cap than the Opposition have called for—they chose 1%.
Their suggestion of a 1% cap was either based on an exhaustive
investigation of the evidence and the data, or chosen because it was a
nice round number. It was one or the other. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=775?>believe we should consider going further. We know that not enough people
are saving for their retirement, and therefore that every penny they
get into their pension has to turn into as much pension as possible.

Webb:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. The consultation document
discusses what should be included in the charge cap. My instinct is to
prefer a comprehensive definition of charges. Clearly, we do not want
to cap annual management charges and find out that the industry has
cunningly managed to get its money back by some other route or a
disguised charge. We therefore discuss what should be
included.</hs_Para>

is to go for a broad measure. There is an issue with transaction
costs—we clearly want to know about them. Including transaction
costs in the cap could lead to a slightly odd situation. Towards the
end of the financial year, the fund and the trustees might believe that
conducting a transaction is the right thing to do for the benefit of
the pension fund. However, they might be unable to do that because the
transaction costs would take them over the annual limit. We would be
grateful for feedback on that and need to address those issues. One
reason why we are having a consultation rather than laying down a
definite answer is that we want insight on the fine detail, as my hon.
Friend says. The basic principle is that we are looking at ensuring
that 99p-plus of every £1 put into a pension goes into a
pension. I am grateful for his

should add that there has been a suite of activity on charges. To
remind the House, we announced a ban on consultancy charges earlier in
the year. Government new schedule 1 and Government new clause 1 give us
the power to put a set of powers to cap and regulate charges and
quality all in one place. That includes automatic enrolment schemes,
qualifying schemes and closed schemes. Lots of people have lots of
money tied up in closed schemes. Without those measures, we would not
necessarily have the powers we need to regulate the charges they pay.
In some ways, the charges that people in closed schemes are
paying—they are often old, high-charge schemes—are
worrying, because people are often not engaged with their pension
saving in a closed pension
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0001.htm#13102964000292">Prompted
by the OFT and working with the ABI, we are looking at legacy
schemes—schemes introduced before 2001. The average charges in
legacy schemes are 26% higher than charges in schemes sold after 2001.
This is a full-frontal assault on pension scheme charges. We have
banned consultancy charges; we are taking powers in the Bill to go
further for auto-enrolment schemes; and we are looking at legacy
schemes, charges and charge caps. We are taking effective action on
issues that previous Governments have only dabbled with. That is why I

proposals—obviously, they are flawed, but I acknowledge that
they raise important issues. New clause 9 would impose a trust-based
structure for all pension schemes, with independent trustees across the
board. But interestingly, the Office of Fair Trading’s project

One of the funny things about being the pensions Minister is that if I
go to a conference on pension funds and climate change, I have to get
briefed by the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills because
it does fiduciary stuff, and by the Department of Energy and Climate
Change because it does climate change. Rather than amend pension
legislation to deal with this little bit of the picture, we are trying
to take an holistic view. As the hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion

any case, we are already seeing consolidation. To give the House a
sense of scale, let us consider small and medium occupational
defined-contribution schemes for between 12 and 1,000 members. The
number of such schemes fell by more than a third in three
years—a dramatic fall—from 3,300 to 2,110. The number of
micro-schemes, with between two and 11 members, fell by a fifth over
the same period, from some 45,000 to 36,000. In a sense, the Opposition
amendments seek to force the pace on scale, but it is already happening
quite quickly. That is a welcome development, and once we implement our
measures on scheme quality—which, subject to consultation, may
include tough action on charges—there will be a seismic effect
on the pensions industry.</hs_Para>

cannot be used for auto-enrolment unless it delivers seriously low
charges, many small, sub-scale schemes will fall by the wayside. The
trends are already in that direction, and the measures we shall
implement will substantively accelerate that. Rather than presume that
scale is the right answer, we have to regulate the quality. If a small
scheme can demonstrate that it is, for example, tailored to the

great.</hs_Para>

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:19:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East touches on an important
issue, albeit again in an overly rigid way. Getting pension pots into a
good profile of retirement income is crucial, which is why we at the
Department for Work and Pensions are working 
<?notus-xml column=779?>with our colleagues at the Treasury on annuities and decumulation.
Decumulation is about more than annuities. That is not a snappy
soundbite, but in other words, turning a pension pot into a retirement
income has to be about the whole process of retirement, not just a
single event on a single day that fixes one’s retirement income
for perhaps 30 years.</hs_Para>

danger with the rigidity of new clause 11 is that it presumes a
backward-looking annuity model. Annuities in their current form were
designed for a world where people lived for 10 years with pensions and
then died. We now have a world where people might annuitise in their
early 60s, or want to stop contributing to their pension pot in their
early 60s, and live into their 90s. There are serious questions about
the suitability of annuities for everybody. For example, people with
big pension pots might want to look at a mixture of draw-down. They
might want to look at alternatives, deferral or a range of options. It
would be a backward step to hardwire into primary legislation that the
only good thing that can be done with a pension is to annuitise through
this particular model. We should give people new options at
decumulation, not hardwire them into the annuity model. Of course, even
an annuity broker may not necessarily guarantee that someone will get,
for example, an impaired life annuity or enhanced annuity for
disability or low life expectancy.</hs_Para>

pension pots into pension income, not a single product hardwired into a

industry, which was then privatised, and where some companies, such as
Jarvis Facilities, Relayfast and Fastline, went to the wall. We
sympathise with any worker whose firm goes to the wall, but I say to
the hon. Gentleman in absentia that the notion of protected persons in
this case was simply that the terms of the pension scheme of the
private employer would be as good as in the public sector. It was never
a guarantee against the insolvency of the sponsoring employer. All
private sector employees are covered by the Pension Protection Fund,
provided that their firm pays the PPF levy. That is how these workers
will get all or most, depending on their circumstances, of the pensions
they were expecting. It would be wrong to give special treatment to
that group when many other people work for firms that went to the wall

suggestion regarding a private sector employer going to the wall. The
promise was never, “You’ll get absolutely everything,
even if your firm goes bankrupt;” it was that the terms of the
pension would be as good as in the public sector. Clearly, in this case
people are working for a private sector firm and could, if they wish,
transfer their pension rights to somewhere else. They chose to keep
them with the sponsoring employer.</hs_Para>

that the money to pay for any shortfall in those pensions will come
from the general taxpayer. Somebody is paying for that shortfall and
many general taxpayers have no pension provision at all. If a private
company knows that the pension fund is completely insured by the
Government, that may influence its behaviour in a way we would not
want. If feels unfair to say, “If your private employer used to
be nationalised not only do you still have access to a very good
pension scheme, but it is absolutely protected, whereas if you worked
for any other private firm you are not protected.” I can

are market abuses in the annuity system. Is there any more we can do

closely to the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:30:35"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister. When one listens to him, particularly on pension charges, one
has to listen very closely, because—how shall I put this
politely?—there is a gap between the rhetoric and the reality. I
will analyse the extent to which there remains a gap. In one sense, he
has caught up with the questions that need to be asked about 
<?notus-xml column=782?>pension charges, but from the detail—or lack of detail—in
his announcements, it seems we are still a long way from getting

other matters first, however, the Minister says that auto-enrolment is
going “exceptionally well”. I think that that is
accurate, but I am sure he would agree that we have to be cautious,
given that it is very large employers that have enrolled and that the
percentage of savers’ income going into the new pension schemes
is very small—in many cases, it is hard to notice. We welcome
the developments, however, and pay tribute to him for taking forward
the previous Labour Government’s auto-enrolment scheme; there is
consensus, I think, on both sides of the House that auto-enrolment has
to work effectively. It is crucial that every single one of the 10
million people being auto-enrolled between 2012 and 2017 can be sure of
getting value for money from that pension scheme. The necessity of
value for money for all auto-enrolment schemes
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:32:32"></hs_TimeCode>is what drives
my

wish to say a little about why that matters so much and how the
Minister’s wind-up of the state pension interacts crucially with
auto-enrolment. Essentially, he has gone for a hard and fast wind-up of
the second state pension. No doubt, he will justify that move, and
there are reasons to think it is sensible, but if we are to have a
quick wind-up of the second state pension and a fast move to a
flat-rate state pension, the biggest losers from that
switch—this might be defensible, because there are always
winners and losers—are likely to be lower-paid workers in the
private sector who did well out of the redistribution accrual mechanism
in the second state pension. If someone was low paid in the private
sector, they accrued in a way that brought them closer to those on
higher incomes. In many cases, therefore, the same people now being
auto-enrolled will be the same people losing out from the hard and fast
wind-up of the second state pension, or losing out in the longer
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:34:11"></hs_TimeCode>. That makes
getting auto-enrolment right all the more important. The first thing he
should have done when he took office—I know he will have an
enormous in-tray—was work out how to ensure that every one of
the 10 million people enrolled got value for money. That is the context
of this debate.</hs_Para>

you will remember, Mr Speaker, Adrian Beecroft is a Tory donor who has
produced a report in the last 18 months arguing that red
tape and bureaucracy on small businesses are far too heavy and that
micro-employers should be removed from auto-enrolment. I know the
Minister does not support that and said the Government had no intention
of doing it—no one is suggesting he 
<?notus-xml column=783?>would do such an awful thing—but he will not be there for
eternity. Given his recent comments about God being a liberal, perhaps
he does intend to be around for eternity, but for those of us of a more
sceptical temper, I think we can say he will not be around for ever, so
it would be sensible to constrain a future Government, or even this
Government—anything could happen—who might be under
pressure from the Beecrofts of this world, in a way that is consonant

Minister said that amendment 53 did not even define a small and

clearly defines an SME as an enterprise with 50 or fewer employees.
That is a common definition of an SME. The broader point, however, is
exactly the one I have already expressed: we are trying to do him a
favour by protecting him from those within the coalition Government who
take a less enlightened view of the benefits of auto-enrolment. We
tabled the amendment in that spirit.</hs_Para>

clause 29 and the debate around schedule 16, the Minister raised the
Australian example. I was at the National Association of Pension Funds
last week, and I have even watched him in the video—I was hoping
he would entertain us with the song from “Les
Misérables”, but I will come to that when I deal with
costs and charges. He said that Australia is doing pot follows
member—the inference is that I often point to the benefits of
the Australian system—but that is not surprising, because
Australia has several hundred schemes, whereas we have 200,000, and
that is not including personal private pensions. To compare a system so
scaled with our system is to let one’s a priori views of the
world get in advance of the evidence, or to put it more simply: he is
comparing apples and pears. Australia has several hundred pension
schemes; we have 200,000, and that is a fundamental problem with
comparing our system. Australia is in a much better place in terms of
scale.</hs_Para>

Minister says that pot follows member will be simple and effective and
that we will regulate for quality, by which he means there will be
minimum standards—or at least he tells us there will be minimum
standards, but, guess what, that is also currently part of a
consultation. There is a broader theme to which I shall return; when
the Minister feels under pressure from the Labour agenda on private
pensions, he calls for consultation. He says that this and that will
happen but when we study the detail, we see that what he has called for
is a consultation. That is not the same as decisive
action.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000337" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000337">On
pot follows member, the problem is that the UK has a fragmented
pensions system; we have 200,000 pension schemes. We have—to put
it in a simple fashion—great variations in quality. The Minister
is being asked repeatedly by the pensions world how pot follows member
will work in those circumstances. It is again worth listening closely
to what he says, because he has not yet explained how it will work. He
has set out his plan and objective to get to pot follows member but not
how the mechanism will work. One of the reasons for that is that it is
very difficult to do. To go back to the Australian point, pot follows
member would be a sensible approach if we started from a very different
place, but we do not. We start from a very fragmented private pensions
system with a massive variation in quality.</hs_Para>

charges, the Minister does not actually know what is going on in the
pensions world. We had a very interesting conversation, or debate on
this in 
<?notus-xml column=784?>Committee. In arguing a point with me, he pointed to DWP evidence. It
turned out that the way in which he quoted that evidence was not
appropriate, but my point is not to criticise him for making a mistake,
which does happen; it is much broader. The DWP is forced to take
surveys of employers to try to find out what pension providers are
charging them. The Minister talks about evidence. Would not a much more
effective way to approach things be to have the costs and charges laid
out for everyone to see in the first place? Why has he not got on with
ensuring that costs and charges are disclosed? Instead, the DWP has to
take surveys of employers who, in many cases—as his own survey
evidenced—are not aware of what they are buying in terms of a
pension scheme.</hs_Para>

us to the broader issue of who buys pensions. The Minister
wants to move to pot follows member and says that there will
be quality criteria; these will be minimum quality criteria. But, as
things stand, he could not explain to the House all the costs and
charges that exist in a pension scheme. Neither the Government nor the
regulator gathers that evidence. That is a fundamental point about the
pensions market
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000340" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000340">Similarities
are often drawn between energy and pensions. One way in which they are
similar is that the vertical integration of pension
providers—the same as with energy
companies—means that it is very hard to crack where the costs
and charges lie. I put that point on the table. The Minister wants to
move to pot follows member but has not set out in detail the mechanism
and the IT by which he would do this. More widely, he is not able to
say at this stage what the costs and charges are in pension schemes. So
how can he be sure that no one will move from a superior to an inferior
scheme? He will say, and has said, that he will ensure that this
happens. Again, I do not doubt his good intentions, but he has not so
far delivered on costs and charges. More widely, if he does
deliver—as I am sure he has every intention of doing—the
amount of regulation that it will take to make a pot follows member
pension automatic transfer system work is enormous. That is why so many
stakeholders in pensions do not think it is a feasible way to proceed.
The Minister said that the Association of British Insurers supports it.
That is hardly surprising, because this is a system that will have the
least detriment to the ABI’s members.</hs_Para>

Minister feels that he is now catching up with the pension charges
debate; that is evident from his language and from the extent to which
he talks about the Labour agenda, which is quite striking for the
Report stage of a Bill. But he is still caught in the mindset of
“If only I can get the industry round the table, it will
deliver.” There is no evidence of delivery so far and no
evidence therefore that that will happen. The reason that there is no
evidence relates to a point made by my right hon. Friend the Leader of
the Opposition in his powerful 2013 conference speech, which still
reverberates around British politics. He asked, rightly, why would one
expect an industry to take the decisions necessary to reform a market
when it is not in its interests to do so. Why, indeed? I say to the
Minister that, on pot follows member, he has to look beyond the
ABI’s interests and look to the interests of the wider pensions
community and of the most important people, savers.</hs_Para>

mentioned the National Association of Pension Funds conference, where
he mentioned pot follows member. I am sure that he got a very warm
reception, because the national association is very clear not only that
pot follows member is not the best way to proceed, but that there is a
serious possibility of significant consumer detriment, which, in
everyday language, means rip-offs. The national association, which the
Minister so eloquently addressed the other week, is very clear on that.
Not only is the association clear that we should have no truck with pot
follows member, but it supports—the House will be surprised to
learn—aggregators.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000344" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000344">The
Minister sets out my approach to aggregators as being, “Labour
wants several aggregators, but how would they work?” He said
that aggregators stop individuals engaging with their pension, or make
that engagement impossible. He knows very well that the whole logic of
auto-enrolment, which Labour began and which he has followed through,
is that we have to use the power of inertia in pensions, because all
the evidence is that many people will find it difficult to engage with
pensions whatever the circumstances, given their complexity. Also, as
he must be all too aware, auto-enrolment involves employers buying
pensions, not the saver.</hs_Para>

that I would make more widely of the Minister is that he approaches the
pensions market as if it were a functioning market; functioning in the
sense that we can and do have a consumer who is engaged, informed and
sovereign, and a seller. The Minister knows that that is not the basis
on which auto-enrolment proceeds because it is the employer who buys
the pension. In other spheres, he has shown that he is fully aware that
there is a big problem in the pensions market, which develops from the
fact that the saver in many cases cannot be the sovereign—the
person who makes the decisions—first, because the employer buys
the pension and, secondly, because the pensions are so complex and
their annual statements so
opaque.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000346">In
those circumstances and with the Minister being aware of that, to claim
that the aggregators should be excluded and rejected on the basis that
they do not allow consumer engagement is a bit of a straw man. Let me
say a little about why I think aggregators are so important. This
relates to my other new clauses and I should iterate at this stage that
these new clauses must, if we are to develop a serious policy to
improve auto-enrolment outcomes, go together. For example, the Minister
talked about trustees and said that the OFT says that the key is the
quality of the trustees. He is of course right. My view, and that of
the Labour party, is that trustees, in scaling up the pensions system,
and aggregators go together to try to make a significant difference to
the 10 million people being automatically enrolled in
pensions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000347"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:50:00"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Debbie Abrahams" PimsId="5905" UID="13102964000637" xid="5905" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000637"><B>Debbie

myself am not. Musicals are not my thing. He quoted from the
innkeeper’s song, which I am certainly not going to sing. For
one thing, I do not know the words. He used the song as a basis to talk
about 2% here, 3% there and charges everywhere, and
presented that as the problem in the UK pensions market.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:54:12"></hs_TimeCode>That is very
different from what he was saying not long ago. It is just over a year
since he accused Labour of scaremongering about pension charges, but he
has moved a long way since then—rhetorically, if not perhaps
substantially. He talked about that ditty and made it clear that there
was a problem, but he still does not grasp the fact that pot follows
member is impossible because of the fragmentation in the pensions

<?notus-xml column=787?>to our new clause 9, which deals with trustees, and he quoted the
OFT’s view that the trustees would have to be good ones. He also
quoted someone from Australia who is over here at the moment, who had

proposals involve having trustees in every scheme, the scaling up of
the UK pensions industry to reduce the fragmentation born of 200,000
different schemes—it is the most fragmented private pension
system in the world—and the reform of the annuities market. Our
amendment (a) to new clause 1 proposes that all costs and charges
should be disclosed. Those measures need to be taken together as a
package, as a Labour Government would do, and they would provide a
starting point for tackling the fundamental problem in the UK pensions
industry.</hs_Para>

proposals would deal with the first problem, the system’s
fragmentation. Secondly, they would deal with the problem that, as
history tells us, pension savers are not the same engaged, informed
consumers as those who buy tins of beans. The Minister seems to have
undergone a damascene conversion on the merits and demerits of
comparing the pensions market to the tin of beans market, and I will
come back to that point. Savers are not informed and engaged in that
way.</hs_Para>

a pension is not like buying a tin of beans. The consumer does not
exert the same pressure. Someone buying a tin of beans might be given a
choice of five different kinds. With pensions, such a choice would not
be available to the saver anyway, because the employer buys the
product. But let us use the Minister’s metaphor and compare the
pensions market with the tin of beans market. First, if there were a
pensions market in a supermarket, the saver would not choose the
pension themselves; their employer would do so. That would be an odd
arrangement in the tin of beans market. Secondly, the buyer of beans
can taste the various kinds, from the cheaper ones to the more
expensive, and come to a judgment based on taste relative to cost. It
would be difficult for them to make a similar comparison with pensions;
historically, it has never happened. Thirdly, I return to the point
that it is the employer who makes the purchase of a pension.</hs_Para>

Minister has done something significant in the state pension sphere. He
and I have been exchanging views across the Dispatch Box for almost two
years now, and I say to him gently that he is still approaching the
private pensions market on the basis that it has the ability to
function like other markets, including the market for beans, even
though, as he looks at it more closely, he can see that there are big
problems. It cannot function like that. If we are to make it work
properly, we have to ensure that the people acting in the pension
saver’s interests are muscled, scaled and resourced.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102964000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000361">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:58:34"></hs_TimeCode>
is what our new clauses would achieve. They would enable the scaling up
of the pensions system, so that schemes would be able to get an
effective deal from providers. Let us be clear: the providers in the
pensions market have scale. In that sense, it is a bit like the energy
market. They are large-scale, efficient organisations. It is the people
saving into pensions who do not have scale, and that is because there
are 200,000 pension schemes. They do not have the necessary
representation because the smaller employers, in particular, who are
auto-enrolling their employees are not pension experts.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T13:59:18"></hs_TimeCode>I know that the
Minister is aware of those facts—we have discussed them a number
of times—and I urge him 
<?notus-xml column=788?>to think about how all that relates to restructuring the private
pensions system so that it takes cognisance of that reality. It is in
that area that he is not taking on what the Opposition are
saying.</hs_Para>

are clear that we need to move to an aggregator system, because
otherwise pot follows member will not work and because if we enable the
creation of aggregators, we have a chance to bring down charges in the
auto-enrolment market. We know that there are millions of stranded
pension pots, and the Minister rightly and repeatedly talks about them.
How do we use the stranded pots issue to generate some change in the
interests of pension savers, particularly the 10 million new savers
automatically being enrolled in pensions for the first time? How do we
do that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:00:37"></hs_TimeCode>? That is
what our new clauses wink

way of doing that is to use the power of the stranded pots as a lure
and say to providers, “If you want access to the new market and
to the billions of pounds locked in stranded pots, you can do so as
long as you meet quality, costs and charges standards as set down by
the Government and the regulator.” We could say to pension
providers in the AE market, “Yes, you can be approved as an
automatic transfer scheme aggregator, but only if you charge 50 basis
points, and fully disclose your transaction costs,” thus meeting
the criteria of the Labour new clauses dealing with independent
trustees and other requirements. That shows how to use the stranded
pots in the interests of the 10 million people who are being enrolled
into these pensions for the first time. The ABI does not agree with
that, and it is faithful to its position as an important industry
interest, but it represents big pension companies, whereas I think the
job of this House is to represent pension savers. That sets out the
rationale for our amendments and new
clauses.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000364"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Webb" PimsId="4546" UID="13102964000641" xid="625" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000641">Steve
Webb:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making a thoughtful
contribution, but what he seems to be saying is that if I have a small
amount of money, I can have a 50 basis points pension fund, but his
proposal for the charge cap for active members is 100 basis points or
1%. If I have a lot of money in pensions, I have to pay 1%, but if I go
off to an aggregator, it is 0.5%. Why is that a good
deal?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000365"><B><Member ContinuationText="Gregg McClymont" PimsId="5700" UID="13102964000642" xid="1040" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000642">Gregg
McClymont:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for that thoughtful
intervention. I am coming on to the issue of the charge cap and the
rate at which it will be set, so I shall take up the point when I
discuss our amendment (a) to new clause 1. He refers to small pots, but
that takes us into territory we have previously discussed about getting
aggregators to take them on. Why does he believe that only
small pots that are stranded should automatically be
transferred? My view is that all stranded pots should be liable for
automatic transfer. I am grateful for his intervention, because it
reminds me of something I intended to say. The Government’s
position on the pot follows member system appears to be supported only
by the Government, the Minister and the ABI. First, the only pots
liable for automatic transfer will be those for less than
£10,000, and secondly no pots that are stranded before the date
on which the legislation takes effect will count as stranded pots.
<I>[Interruption.] </I>The Minister shakes his head. I will give way to
him if I 
<?notus-xml column=789?>am wrong on that point. He does not want to intervene, so I shall
continue on the basis that what I am saying is
correct.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000366">This
is an important issue, because I am building a case that the Minister
does not realise how substantial the problems in the private pensions
market are. He continues to think it can be treated like better
functioning or well functioning dynamic markets. Actually, the market
is more like the one in energy. I say that because when, under the
Minister’s leadership, the Department for Work and Pensions
looked at how to consolidate pots, it gave as a reason against
aggregators the fact that they would disrupt the current market
structure.</hs_Para>

Minister talks about new clause 1 and the need to take very strong
action. Implicit but also explicit in what he says is that there are
really serious problems with this market. If that was not explicit in
what he said today, it was certainly explicit in his “Les
Miserables” ditty at the NAPF. He knows about these problems,
and he knows that we need significant change. We are going to be in a
position, however, whereby all currently stranded pots will continue to
be stranded.<I> </I>The Minister is shaking his head again. Does he
want to tell me that I am wrong? I am happy to accept it if I am wrong,
but on the basis of our Committee debates, I do not think that I am. Am
I wrong? The Minister will not stand up to say so, so I shall assume
that I am not and that he wants to keep the currently stranded pots
still stranded and will not take action to deal with the problem. He
also sets a £10,000 limit. Why? The answer is that he continues
to be unprepared to stand up to the vested interests in the pensions
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:06:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000368" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000368">The
Minister said several times that the ABI is doing this, and the ABI is
doing that. That is welcome; we like to see the industry engaged.
However, a time must come—and it is now—when the
Government must get on and make the changes necessary to reform the
pensions system. I put that on the record, and if he wishes to correct
me, he can. As I say, currently stranded pots will not be encompassed
by clause 29 and schedule 16, and no pot above
£10,000 will be considered to be a pot eligible for automatic
transfer. I think that says something significant—that he does
not understand the necessity for significant change in this
market.</hs_Para>

was struck by what the Minister said about decumulation. It proved my
point about his ability to talk but not necessarily to take any action,
or enough action. New clause 11 calls for an independent brokerage
service to guide those who annuitise on retirement through the process.
Its aim is to deal with the lack of competition which, according to the
NAPF and others, causes people to receive an average of 20% less in
their annuities than they would have received had they shopped around.
That returns me to a point with which I have been trying to persuade
the Minister to engage. Buying an annuity involves a huge decision
which a person will make only once in a lifetime, and which will affect
the rest of that person’s life. However, the process is
complicated, and because they find it hard to understand what they are
being told, most people currently default to the annuities that they

hon. Friend made a very good point. I think she, and indeed everyone
who listened to the Minister’s response to new clause 11, will
be wondering what he proposes in lieu of the new clause.
“Nothing” is an honest and fair assessment—or, at
least, “Nothing concrete or substantive.” Referring to
decumulation, the Minister said, “An awful lot needs
to be looked at. We need to go further, but we need a creative approach
rather than merely focusing on annuities.” I understand what he
meant, because there is an ongoing debate about annuities as a product,
but people out there, including our constituents, are annuitising every
day. I do not think that saying to those people, “We are
going to think about some creative solutions, we cannot tell
you what they are, and because we are going to do something creative,
we should not at this stage do something specific and concrete in order
to improve outcomes,” stands the test. How long will it be
before the Minister deals with this problem?</hs_Para>

know that annuities are a huge issue and that plenty of ideas are
flying around, but ours is a concrete, practical proposal to
improve annuity outcomes as things stand. I do not deny that the
Minister has done something pretty significant in respect of state
pensions, and I know that he must maintain a balance between pension
schemes, but is it really good enough for him to respond to us by
saying, “We need to do something—we need to go
further—but we need a creative approach rather than your
approach, which is focused on annuities”?</hs_Para>

more creative approach without explaining what that creative approach
will be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:14:59"></hs_TimeCode>. I know
that he has a great deal on his plate with state pension
reform—winding up the state second pension as quickly as he
intends to wind it up constitutes an incredibly big reform—but I
ask him to reflect on whether it is good enough to say to people who
have saved throughout their lives, and who are now receiving much less
than they could have received had they shopped around, “We
cannot support the Opposition’s new clause because although an
awful lot needs to be done and we need to go further, we need a more

“We have made efforts, but people are still not shopping

are given independent advice that will enable them to secure the best

that all the credit for auto-enrolment should go to Labour; in fact, I
have said a number of times that the Minister and the Government
deserve credit for taking it on. The Minister is simply wrong to say
that that is my “thesis”, as he put it. My thesis is that
the Minister has underestimated the scale of the problems in the

specific critique of the Minister’s approach is to do with
sequencing. Given his intentions and actions in respect of the state
second pension, he should have made sure that there is nothing in the
auto-enrolment market that could end up with any of the 10 million
savers who are going to be automatically enrolled getting less than
value for money. At one level the Minister does not disagree with that,
because he told the NAPF that we will look back at this period as
either one when something happened that was for the long-term good or
as one when the problems in the private pension market were not dealt
with. The Minister has been too slow to get on to this and, based on
what he has said today, he is still not taking the necessary action. He
is saying he might take action, but his words, which I will examine
shortly, reveal it is in fact the appearance of action without the
reality of action.</hs_Para>

me develop that argument with reference to new clause 1 and our
amendment (a).
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:21:04"></hs_TimeCode>The Minister
announced 
<?notus-xml column=793?>that there will be a consultation on a possible charge cap. We all knew
that was coming: the Minister trailed it extensively. What did the
Minister say about this consultation? First, it is important to note
that it is a consultation, which, of course, does not commit the
Government to doing anything. A consultation is not the same as
legislation. The Minister became more engaged as he was speaking, and
he finished by saying that this is a full-frontal assault on pension
charges. The problem is he also said, “We will look at how far
we can get.” A whole range of activity on charges has been
undertaken, but, when he lists them, it is clear that they are mostly
consultations. I give him credit on consultancy charges. The Minister
acted decisively on that, but he needs to take similarly decisive
action on the wider pension charges
problem<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000390" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000390">The
Minister’s language was instructive. He wanted to dress up a
consultation as action, but it is not action. He floated the
possibility that one consultation option will be a cap of 75 basis
points, but he did not say what the other options would be. Given my
knowledge over two years of the way the Minister proceeds, I doubt that
this will be a consultation with only one option, so will he tell us
what the various options for a charge cap will be? He is probably
giving the House only partial information by noting there will be one
option of 75 basis
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:29:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102964000391" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102964000391">So
the Minister announces a consultation, cherry-picks, for the benefit of
his statement this afternoon, some of the things that will be in it,
but no one in the House has yet seen the consultation and been able to
examine it. That suggests the Pensions Minister is under pressure to
get going on reforming the private pensions market, specifically in
terms of costs and charges. That was what one felt when
listening to the Minister. Not only did he spend a lot of time
rebutting Labour’s vision for private pensions, but he felt the
need to oversell what the Government are doing. I would say he felt
that need because he feels under pressure on this issue.
<I>[Interruption.] </I>The Minister suggests I am psychoanalysing him.

over a year ago, when Labour pointed out the problems with charges, the
Minister said we were scaremongering. However—to take us back to
the issue of the tin of beans, as I promised—the Minister said
in his statement that the pensions market is not like a tin of beans
and that is why we have to look at a charge cap, but he also said in
January this year, “I’m not sure a charge cap’s
the way to go because the pensions market is like a tin of
beans.” First, that suggests an obsession with tins of beans,
which one would never have expected of the Minister, but it also

when we talk about state pensions later. Specifically pertinent to the

Thatcher Government decided to encourage the taking out of personal

have transaction costs in the cap. I absolutely agree with that; I do
not know anyone who would say that transaction costs could be included
in the cap. However, we need to ensure that the transaction costs are

explain why. I am not surprised by the Minister’s response,
because it probably explains why he was reported as saying at the NAPF
conference that transparency “gets you virtually
nowhere”. I assume the basis for that view, which at first
glance appears odd, is that he takes the point that I have been making
throughout this debate that seeing the pensions market as one where the
saver is always is in charge or can always be in charge is simply
wrong. I just put that on the record, but now let me deal with his

I do not see any basis on which one can be against the full disclosure

costs. Secondly, 
<?notus-xml column=796?>if we had the disclosure of transaction costs, that would enable
everyone with an interest in ensuring good pension outcomes, including
the Government, to have the evidence at their fingertips to say to
interested parties, stakeholders and, in particular, pension companies
and fund managers, “That’s what you are charging?
That’s not on.” How can the Minister not want to have all
the evidence at his fingertips? He is taking a strange position. He
says that he is carrying out a consultation on charges. We know that is
a shift in his position, for the reasons I have set out and given his
previous comments, but he is still behind the curve because he does not
support the full disclosure of transaction costs—he certainly
will not support our amendment (a), which will make such disclosure a

That seems an obscure term, but I am talking about where someone saves
into a pension, their pension provider passes the pension savings to
fund managers—they are often in the same organisation, because,
as with the energy sector, there is a lot of vertical
integration—and then the savings are invested. There is no
comprehensive disclosure of all the costs that accrue in that process,

that transparency “gets you virtually nowhere”, but that

of disclosure. We hear that argument a lot across political debate. It
is not a foolish argument in some cases, but it is in this case,
because fund management is such an opaque business and, according to
the things we hear—without access to the facts we cannot know
for sure—the costs can be significant. Hon. Members should not

managers can over-churn pension fund savings. What do I mean by
“over-churn”? The incentives lie in commissions for
trading, and so rather than hold on to assets for the
long-term—what one might call the “Warren Buffett”
approach, which is a very successful long-term approach to investing
and is consonant with the long-term nature of pensions—fund
managers have a big interest in constantly trading, because that
generates commissions. That might be the case, or it might not. We
simply do not know, because those things are not disclosed. The
Minister trumpets new clause 1, but it does not include any disclosure

McClymont:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point. The
logic of moving to a system in which every scheme has independent
trustees flows from the fact that in the pensions market as it stands
the consumer who is a member of a scheme without trustees cannot have
their voice heard. What happens then? The interests of shareholders
over-dominate. In a market that functions effectively, of course, the
consumer can shop around, compare prices and if they buy something that
they do not like they can even buy something else. None of that is true
of the pensions market and that is why, in our view and given the
options available, reaching a situation in which every scheme has
trustees is the best way to try to ensure proper representation of
saver interests<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:43:20"></hs_TimeCode>.

the fact that the chance to take the necessary steps has today been

auto-enrolment is already well under way, but at what stage will we see
the action that is necessary? We will be in 2017 before we know it,
when everyone will be auto-enrolled, and if the Minister has continued
to consult rather than act we will be no further forward. The Minister
has taken action on consultancy charges—he can do it—and

for the Minister—and I do not complain about this—to

we tackled auto-enrolment, small pots, aggregators, charges, scale and
annuities. No doubt that would be enough to put many people off
listening to any more, but let me add my thoughts briefly on each in
turn. First, on auto-enrolment, the Minister outlined the success so
far—1.7 million people already enrolled and 90% of them staying
in. The hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East
said that he was cautious and that that percentage might not be
sustainable as we started enrolling those in smaller firms across the
country. He may well be right about that. The Minister will be acutely
aware of that, which is why he is right to tackle some of the detail
now, ahead of the smallest companies
enrolling.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000043">The
important thing in the section on auto-enrolment was the changes
outlined today—two opt-outs, for those who have already given
notice of leaving their employer and for those who would suffer
negative tax penalties because they had already accumulated more than
the maximum allowed for tax-free savings. The Minister confirmed that
there is absolutely no intention of excluding small and medium-sized
enterprises, the lifeblood of every Member’s constituency. That
is important, and he rightly summarised Labour’s amendment 53 as
unnecessary, unclear and
ineffectual.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000044">The

the pot follows member approach recommended by the coalition Government

constituents are affected. Those of us who have accumulated small pots
at different periods in our life know that it is extremely hard to keep
track of them and to have any idea of what our savings really are. The

Opposition approach is towards an aggregator, which is an uncomfortable
world where there is no choice and our savings pot is shunted off in a
Thomas the tank engine-like way to God knows where. We will not get
into allusions from the names of the engines in “Thomas the Tank
Engine”. That would be unfortunate and arguably inappropriate.
The important thing, as the 
<?notus-xml column=800?>Minister rightly said, is that we must not have small pots that follow
the member into a bad scheme. We must focus on all schemes being good.
That is why it is important to legislate for quality schemes, as the

is important that the practice which has grown up over time of people
being in schemes for less than two years and being bought out for a not

small pots and aggregators, we come to the rub of the
issue—charges. The Minister rightly observed that 1% compounded
over time amounts to a huge amount of money paid out in charges to fund
managers and administrators, and that it is important to follow the
recommendations of the Office of Fair Trading report, which noted that
pension savings is one of the worst sectors for charges, that the
demand side is weak and that there is the contradiction of the employer
choosing the manager, but the member effectively paying for that
choice.</hs_Para>

option of 0.7% is no doubt at the lower end of options out there. That
gives this Government and Members a chance to see what might be the
most practical options, bearing in mind always that we do not want to
limit the management of those funds to a handful of very large

sometimes a delicatessen tailoring their investment to what members

charges generally, I think I can summarise the shadow Minister’s
speech for Members and especially for those in the Gallery, whose
concentration may understandably have wandered during those 85 minutes.
There were four messages that he wanted to get out: first, highlight
the fact that the coalition will do nothing for living standards;
secondly, accuse the Government of sticking up for big business, not
small pensioners; thirdly, sound as if the Opposition are offering an
energy price freeze; and fourthly, do not give a precise figure. The
approach behind all that is not to let the facts get in the way of the
narrative. That, in about 12 seconds, broadly covers what
the shadow Minister said in 85 minutes on the issue of
charges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:57:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000053">The

hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East to the

simple slogan: consultation, not action. This, I thought, was a curious
approach by the shadow Minister. He earlier intimated that he is very
cautious about the implementation 
<?notus-xml column=801?>of auto-enrolment—the results might not be as good as they have
started out to be and it was too early to celebrate. He gave the
impression of being a very cautious driver, one who was unwilling to
take unnecessary risks and who wanted the Minister to make sure that he
keeps the car on the road.</hs_Para>

analogies were built into the hon. Gentleman’s approach, but

auto-enrolment had not been implemented. It is precisely why they did
not pursue universal credit. As the former Chancellor of the Exchequer,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:58:33"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Edinburgh South West (Mr Darling), admitted, it
was too difficult. It is precisely why the previous Government were

hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East today is to
try to take credit for his party for the idea of auto-enrolment, and
then to snipe at the detail offered by the Minister. The hon. Gentleman
coupled that with something close to an apology for the previous
Government not having done enough in the world of pensions, but it was
a little like the policemen on Plebgate recently—it was not a

matter. We are in a new world, as the Minister said, because we are
living longer and we need more options. There is more to annuities than
simply a need for more competition, choice and help, although that is
important and the code of conduct from the Association of British
Insurers is a promising start. I agree with the Minister, though, that
we should go further. At the heart of the matter is
transferability—being able to trade annuities at different
periods of life when different circumstances crop up and when there is
different pricing in the marketplace. What we certainly do not want is
a single product solution. I was lobbied heavily at the Conservative
party conference by an annuity provider who was keen to impress on me
the importance and relevance of their single product solution, but my

first query, which I think is important for Members across the House,

issue, as all families who have had to deal with tragedy will
understand, particularly when it comes to bereaved children.
Winston’s Wish is a charity headquartered in the constituency of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T15:04:55"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cheltenham (Martin Horwood), but it has a significant presence in

but one is that the tax status of bereavement support payment is
slightly unclear. I would be grateful if the Minister could say 
<?notus-xml column=803?>more about that and whether it will be tax-free, because that would be
hugely appreciated. Given that the trend of his proposals on
bereavement support payment is effectively to increase the amount of
money but have it paid for a shorter time, having that payment tax-free
would be hugely helpful for families affected. There is a second point
from Winston’s Wish that I want to raise with the Minister. I
understand that unmarried partners are currently ineligible for BSP, so

their pensions might be affected by changes to their pension schemes to

involved in, alongside the Department for Work and Pensions, but I
think that it would be right to express concern on behalf of some of
the pensioners involved. However, I understand that there is an
argument that both existing pensioners and current members of a pension

pension funds use the money paid into them every month to make
investments in shares of companies, bonds, properties and other assets,
which makes them enormously powerful players in shaping the economy,
especially as they have significant investments in fossil fuel
companies. However, if we want to keep climate change below dangerous
levels, we need pension funds to fund and support a low-carbon economy
by, for example, investing in clean technologies and low-carbon
infrastructure projects. Moreover, today’s report shows that the
UK pension funds have £3 trillion at risk from so-called
unusable fossil fuel investments—fossil fuels which, if we are
serious about keeping to our climate change commitments, we simply
cannot afford to burn. That is a huge threat to the incomes of future

modelled the implication of resource constraints for private pensions

likely to be worse than currently predicted because the industry is not

land. In the worst-case scenario, savers in the model of a
defined-contribution pension scheme were only half as well off, while
the defined-benefit pension scheme became

current regulatory regime is fragmented: both the Pensions Regulator

reluctant to look under the bonnet of schemes’ investment

has also paid little attention to the matter, seeing it as the
regulator’s responsibility. Both treat sustainability as at best
a sideshow and at worst an irrelevance. The amendment would

amendment 55 would amend schedule 16, which gives the Government powers
to introduce new quality standards for automatic enrolment schemes

Government have a responsibility to make sure that people’s
pensions cannot be transferred out of a good scheme into a bad scheme.
The Bill as drafted provides that the new quality standards may in
particular relate to governance and administration, which is welcome,
but it is equally important for policy makers to look under the bonnet
of schemes’ investment strategies, if they are to operate in the
best interests of pensioners. The amendment would, therefore, add a
third leg to the quality standards relating to the ability of the
scheme to generate sustainable investment returns. The detail of any
such standards could include reference to a scheme’s policy and
practice on things such as climate change risks, including natural

delivering on his warm words this morning. The new clause is not just
about fiduciary duty; it is about gathering data on the impact of

pensions and for a better understanding of the systemic risks posed by
high levels of exposure to fossil fuels and other carbon-intensive

necessary for everyone to annuitise as soon as they reach retirement

the last Government. That is not to say that there were not problems

of the debate at that time focused on restoring the earnings link
because, unlike now, earnings were outstripping prices. Everybody who
was campaigning on the issue focused on that. However, restoring the
earnings link and letting things move up gradually would not have
helped the many pensioners who had a very quick increase in their
income and well-being. Many of those people were women, because women
often end up being the poorest in retirement. Those people would tell
us very clearly how important that was for them. It is not
fair—indeed, it is quite wrong—to rewrite history and
suggest that it was not
helpful.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000110">As
I have said in previous debates, the fact that that expenditure was in

the Minister. We will discuss the single-tier pension in due course.
That expenditure is one of the underpinnings that has allowed him to
introduce the single-tier pension, apparently without increasing the
overall expenditure on state pensions. Indeed, it is predicted that the
overall expenditure will decrease in the long term. I hope that
everyone will accept that the Labour Government did a great amount of

Edinburgh—who said not only that the previous Government looked
at the possibility of a system like universal credit, but that the

anyone to suggest that the current Government have solved the problem
of universal credit. As we are seeing at the moment, all the
predictions made by those who have previous experience suggest that
such a system is proving extremely difficult, extremely slow, and no

benefits we have yet to see. One must therefore be cautious in
suggesting that the previous Government were wrong in not going ahead
with such a scheme. We will see what transpires over the next few years
although experience to date has not been all that healthy. I urge the
Minister to consider annuities in a great deal more detail, as they are
crucial for people’s retirement income and well-being during
those years of
retirement.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/A3C5D3E2112B887FA9E904ACE220780389CAEDF2" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 October 2013">Tuesday

Mulholland</B> (Leeds North West) (LD):</Member> I will keep my remarks
brief. Other Members wish to speak to amendments, so I will ensure I
give them time to do so. I will start with a few introductory comments
because I am aware that, with today’s short time scale, it is
unlikely that I will be able to make them on Third Reading. I pay
tribute to and praise the role played by my hon. Friend the Minister.
He has done an incredible job in taking through this hugely important,
historic and complex Bill on an issue that we all agree is of utmost
importance to our constituents and society. We can agree across the
House that there is no one more capable, knowledgeable or expert in
taking through this Bill, and as a Liberal Democrat I am proud that he
has played that role and that the Bill will receive its Third Reading
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000115">Equally,
I pay tribute to the expert and intelligent contributions made by
Members from across the House in Committee. This complicated matter
requires particular scrutiny, which it has received, and contributions
from right hon. and hon. Members have rightly reflected that. Having
said that, there is a need to redress the balance. Although scrutiny is
important, so far this section of today’s proceedings has missed
the point that this is an incredibly positive piece of legislation that
will make a huge difference to people who are looking forward to
retirement, and give them certainty about the level of income they can
expect. The Bill builds on things that the Government have already
established, including restoring the earnings link to the basic state
pension and introducing the triple lock guarantee. That guarantee has
helped increase the state pension by £12.50 a week since 2010,
and delivered the biggest increase in the state pension in
2010.</hs_Para>

this historic and important Bill will deliver the single-tier pension
to give a clearer, fairer pension to all and, crucially, a better
pension to women and the self-employed. In the context of the
amendments, it is equally important, as I sure the Minister would be
first to agree, to take forward the challenge of auto-enrolment and
ensure that private and occupational pensions are built in alongside
the historic and positive changes to the state pension.</hs_Para>

Mulholland:</Member></B> Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. May I remind the
House what the improvements to auto-enrolment will do, which has not
come out in the debate? Let us look at the figures. Some 1.6 million
people have signed up for auto-enrolment. Of course, the ability to opt
out remains, but rather than the expected one in three opting out, the
figure is only 10%. Many millions of people are not
currently saving for their retirement, but auto-enrolment will lead to
between 6 million and 9 million people saving for the first time by
2018. That is
crucial.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000124">It
is important to remember—this, too, has not been mentioned in
the debate—that, as well as employee contributions, there will
be support from employers and the Government. People aged 22 or over
who are earning more than £9,440 a year will be automatically
put into the pension scheme. Individuals who choose to save
4% of their income will benefit from an employer
contribution of 3% and tax relief of 1%. It is important to welcome and
emphasise that—it should be welcomed and emphasised by all hon.
Members.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000125">The
key debate is on charging. The Minister referred to the OFT report that
raised concerns about standards, particularly in legacy schemes. The
Government have rightly amended the Bill to take that into account. I
warmly welcome amendment 30 and his announcement of the consultation. I
believe the consultation should be welcomed and not
criticised.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000126">I

hon. Gentleman was slightly wrong, or he misplaced his emphasis, in his
suggestion that the Government are consulting rather than taking
action. He knows—his proposal shows this—that
consultation is a necessary precursor to legislation. It is important
in getting legislation right. Without daring to put words into the
mouth of the Minister, I think it is important to say that the
intention is clear—that there should be a charge cap and that
one will be introduced. The point of the consultation is not whether to
introduce one: it is to find out the best way to do so. We should be
clear about the subject of the
consultation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000129">I
have one question for the Minister, which he may be able to answer. The
announcement on the consultation is imminent, although it is not
happening as part of the Bill, so will we see him back at the Dispatch
Box soon to make it? He is clearly the right and proper person to make
the announcement, given his involvement in the Bill. I hope that he
will be back, perhaps even in the next 24 or 48 hours, to announce it,
and I and others look forward to welcoming that and the details that I
am sure he will wish to lay
out.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000130">Despite
this being a complicated subject in terms of the figures, the construct
of the Bill and the pension sector as a whole, we all know that in the
end this is about people’s future incomes and ensuring that they
have a reasonable standard of living in their retirement, as well as
more certainty in their retirement. The figures that the Minister
provided about the current impact of the 1.5% and 1% charges were
startling in showing just how much money people lose over the course of
saving for their pensions. That is why a cap is right.</hs_Para>

but we need to address, too, privatisations that are taking place now.
For example, the privatisation of Royal Mail took place only this

making representations on behalf of individuals affected. That is the
type of scenario we are dealing with. A number of private railway
companies—whether in the railways themselves or London

they became members of the new scheme. The debate was extensive. Few

months of debate in the House and negotiations between the Government
and the sector unions, members of the British Rail pension scheme who
were already pensioners or deferred pensioners were transferred to a
special pensions section and had their rights guaranteed by the Crown.
Their rights have never been put at risk and are not at risk, but that
is not true for members still employed in the industry who were
contributing at the point of privatisation. Their accrued rights were
transferred to the section of the railways pension scheme applicable to
their new employer, and a matching share of the 
<?notus-xml column=814?>assets from the British Rail pension scheme was also transferred to the
relevant section, but nothing was done in those debates and
negotiations, and eventually the orders, to protect their transferred

actively contributing members were also given the right to participate
in the new railways pension scheme on a basis that entitled them to
accrued rights for future service and which was no less favourable than
the basis of the former British Rail pension scheme. They have to
contribute to the scheme to accrue their rights, and so must their
employer, in the normal way. Active members are also protected if they
move involuntarily between railway employers. In law, they must be
permitted to transfer their accrued rights to their new
employer’s section of the railways pension scheme and be
permitted to accrue future pension rights on the same basis as
before.</hs_Para>

also applies to involuntary transfers. As one franchise moves between
companies, so do the pensions and the pension rights and
responsibilities. A member who moves employer of his or her own
volition retains the right to be a member of the pension scheme, but
the right to accrue future service rights on the same basis is lost. So
those protections were thought to be relatively robust at the time;
transferring from the old British Rail pension scheme into the new
scheme, and then, as the franchises moved and new employers took over
the staff, their rights would transfer as well.</hs_Para>

railways employer enters into administration, its
undertaking—the franchise—is usually transferred to
another employer and, again, what happens is that the employees working
for that employer are generally protected. Even when a company becomes
insolvent and employees are transferred to a new company, if there are
sufficient assets those are transferred and the employees are protected
again. The problem we now face as a result of the Jarvis incident is
what happens when an employer becomes insolvent and there are
insufficient assets. That is what happened with the Jarvis workers, who
were transferred to Babcock Rail or Volker Rail. Because the Jarvis
section of the railways pension scheme is not in a position to transfer
the accrued rights on a fully funded basis—because Jarvis never
had the assets—a pension transfer could not be made at all.
Instead, what the Jarvis workers now have to rely on is the pension
protection fund, which does not provide what they would have gained as
members of the full pension
scheme.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969000149" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000149">This
group of workers accepted the assurance of the Government on
privatisation that their pensions would be fully protected. They have
entered employment with a new employer and have paid their
contributions, and they expect the same pension as every other worker
around them in the industry. They are now faced with a pension that is
significantly less. I think that that is grotesquely unfair. It
certainly flies in the face of the promises that were given on the

the Railways Bill, a joint industry pension scheme for the railways.
This will be broadly on the basis set out in the consultation paper
‘Railway Pensions After Privatisation’ issued in January.
The governance and administration of the joint industry scheme will
continue to involve both the employers and employees in the industry.
We shall be discussing the detailed arrangements with interested
parties…Existing employees’ rights will be protected by
statutory orders made under the Railways Bill. The benefits offered to
employees must be no less favourable than those in the existing scheme.
There will be no penalties for involuntary breaks in employment. The

contributions made by employees…will continue subject to the

or increased
contributions.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13102969000154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0002.htm#13102969000154">Employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T15:49:29"></hs_TimeCode>

reassurance about pension arrangements in the privatised railway. The

MacGregor was an honourable man who believed that he was giving every
possible assurance that the existing pensions arrangements would be
protected. Are we now saying that, just because there is no specific
reference to insolvency in that statement, no such assurance was given
in relation to those rights? If we did that outside this place, we
would be accused of mis-selling a

with Network Rail over how it treated Jarvis, but that is a debate for
another time. It has been demonstrated that the statutory protection
that workers in the railway industry thought would guarantee
their pensions has proved to be illusory in the

employer, post-privatisation, but only to the extent that he or she had
had no choice as to the section of the railways pension scheme in which

another, the rights accrued after that move are not protected. This

made by the Government, and they should have been enshrined in the

people that privatisation could work, and to convince employees that
there would be a smooth privatisation process in which their pension
rights would be protected. Having made those promises, the Government
should honour them. It is the role of Parliament to hold the Government
to account and to ensure that they keep their word to the electorate.

do not necessarily think that the measure should be paid for by the

railway employers to meet the cost of providing the protection by
creating a mini-pension protection fund scheme, alongside the national

employers. They have made the profits from privatisation, and they
should share the liabilities that arise.

opposition to it, and immense fear among the work force about what
would happen to their jobs, their conditions of work and their rates of
pay. Pensions are also a critical issue for workers. Some people have
referred to them as deferred pay. That is true, but they also represent
a deferred sense of security in retirement and old age, and Members
should not underestimate the strength of feeling among people who wish
to protect their pensions. When privatisation was debated, it was
understandable that Ministers seeking a smooth passage for their
legislation wanted to reassure the workers in the industry that their
pensions would be protected. That is why such categorical assurances

because the previous Government, after 13 years, had not put pension
savers in a position in which they would get value for money in
workplace saving. Indeed, the hon. Gentleman suggested in his narrative
that all the evils of pensions happened in the preceding 18 years of
the Conservative Government. Again, by implication, Labour comes to
power in 1997 ready to put right the failures of the previous
Government; they have 13 years to have a go at it, yet the first job of
a new Liberal Democrat Minister appointed in 2010 is to sort out the

hon. Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East said that
pot follows member was not a good idea here because whereas there are
not many pension schemes in Australia this country has very large
numbers of them. He massively understates, however, the extent of
concentration and consolidation in the pensions markets. The Office of
Fair Trading has said that the four largest providers hold the majority
of schemes, assets and members. The four largest providers on their own
have 68% of the assets, 76% of the schemes and 61% of the members. The
hon. Gentleman believes that the vast number of schemes means that pot
follows member cannot possibly work because everybody is in a small
pension scheme; actually, the opposite is true. Most people are in big
pension schemes, which is why pot follows member works
perfectly well. Consolidation is already happening—I mentioned
the fall of a third in the number of medium-sized pension
schemes—and, moreover, when we implement measures
on scheme quality, which will include action on charges,
that will trigger substantially more consolidation. So the hon.
Gentleman is, in a sense, being backward-looking in referring to the
large number of tiny pension
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:10:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the hon. Gentleman is trying to portray a workplace pensions sector

model that the hon. Gentleman has embodied in his amendments and new

really good, so a silly little amount of money will automatically go to
a really good scheme, whereas in the case of large amounts, the quality
standard will be more relaxed. I understand that his party advocates a
1% charge cap, but he wants a 0.5% charge cap for the aggregator. That
would bring about bizarre circumstances in which people with serious
amounts of pensions money could pay 
<?notus-xml column=819?>1% charges, but people with small amounts in a scheme that
they never chose pay 0.5%. How is that coherent? I am happy to give way

says that that must happen in order for a scheme to qualify as an
auto-enrolment scheme. We consider his to be a backward-looking and
restrictive model. Let me give an example. What about pension schemes
that annuitise internally—which, in other words, provide the
annuity themselves? They may provide a guaranteed annuity rate, but in
the hon. Gentleman’s world people will still have to go off to
an annuity broker and shop around, rather than taking advantage of the
product that is in the scheme already. That is an example of where he
is trying to be over-prescriptive. <I>[Interruption.] </I>He says it is
all in my head; I am not quite sure what he is talking about. The point
is that we are trying to provide forward-looking provision for

aspect of the lack of coherence in the hon. Gentleman’s model of
aggregators is that if he envisages

amount going to aggregators would be between £7
billion and £10 billion. Over five years, therefore, between
£35 billion to £50 billion will go to these schemes. How
does that affect the market? What is his model? We have a small number
of what will become vast aggregator schemes. How does that relate to
the active schemes that people are members of? He is taking money out
of active schemes and putting it in aggregators; what does that do to
the cost structure for the people who are left behind? Bizarrely,
active members of a company pension will find that their costs go up if
all the deferred members move out and take their money with them. The
hon. Gentleman does not want to regulate the costs for the

matter for our Department. For example, if we place a 
<?notus-xml column=822?>cost on the energy employers through the abolition of the national
insurance rebate and if we exclude their employees because they are
protected persons, that has the potential to feed its way into energy
bills. Her party leader has a view on energy bills, as do we, but the
knock-on effect of a decision we take on energy bills has to be thought
through. The same applies in the transport sector, to which the hon.
Member for Hayes and Harlington referred. If railway and other
employers cannot pass on through the pension scheme the costs we are
imposing on them through the ending of the rebate, that will find its
way through into fare increases and to consumers. So we have to think
through a wide range of consequences of these decisions. That is why
this is taking a while, but I appreciate the need to get on with

as a result of the network intervention. We faced a specific issue that
could be dealt with very speedily; it does not have to await further
consultation with other industries. That does not mean that I do not

particular interest over time in this industry. My point is that his
argument about justice—his argument that pension protection
should mean not just the same terms and conditions, which was what it
did mean, but protection against insolvency—should apply equally
across other industries, and should not just apply to the rail
industry, if that is what he believes. When John MacGregor made the
promises that the hon. Gentleman quoted, he was saying that the terms
and conditions of the pension scheme would be the same with the
privatised employer as they were with the state employer. Subsequently,
a pension protection fund was created. Jarvis paid pension protection
fund levies and that is why the employees are in the pension protection
fund. The three privatised railway firms

privatised pensions would be protected. He said not that they would

hon. Member for Edinburgh East, who is not in her place, talked about
annuities. She seemed to think that requiring people to go to an
annuity broker was the answer to the problems and I think she missed
the point. We want to see a much wider range of options for people when
they want to turn their pension pot into a pension income. Rather than
putting into primary legislation a single model for a single product,
we must ensure that people have choices so that they can choose an
annuity, consider draw-down products or consider deferring and so that
they can try to ensure that they get the best value for money. I
certainly accept that the annuity market is not working as well as it
should.</hs_Para>

What happened with small pots, charge caps, decumulation and governance
had not been dealt with. The Opposition have spent the past however
many

Webb:</Member></B> Unlike the debate on the previous group, the debate
on this short group need not detain us too long. It relates to a
feature of the state pension credit system known as the assessed income
period. The basic idea was to avoid the need for people on pension
credit to keep reporting changes in their circumstance—the basis
was that older pensioners in particular have less frequent changes of
circumstance. The basic idea of the assessed income period was a
perfectly reasonable one but, unfortunately, it has not worked in
practice and has raised a lot of
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001303" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001303">To<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:48:57"></hs_TimeCode>
give an example, if someone in retirement inherits substantial wealth
from the generation above them, they can continue to get pension credit
for five years or even indefinitely, despite having very substantial
wealth. If someone retires, has an assessed income period and then
starts to draw a new stream of pension income, they can go on getting
pension credit despite the fact that their living standard is well
above the level of pension credit. We have given this a good go, and it
was a reasonable thing to try, but in practice it has created
anomalies, with payments to people who, if they were assessed on their
current circumstances, would not be entitled to
benefit.</hs_Para>

Government have taken the view that assessed income periods should not
be part of the system in the future, but we accept the need for a
transition period. The amendments propose that people who already have
open-ended AIPs, such as the oldest pensioners, will be able to
continue with them.</hs_Para>

given an intuitive flavour of the changes, but to be more precise, the
purpose of new clause 3 is to provide for the abolition of the assessed
income period in pension credit cases from April 2016, while new clause
4 will correct existing pension credit legislation to ensure that the
provision relating to indefinite AIPs for people over the age of 80
works as intended. The effect of new clause 3 will be to limit the
application of the legislation on AIPs to decisions that take effect
before 6 April 2016 so that from that date no new AIPs 
<?notus-xml column=839?>will be set. It will also ensure that AIPs set before 6 April
2016 will remain valid beyond that date, thereby transitionally
protecting the indefinite status of certain existing AIPs. The
amendments also provide for regulations to be made for the purpose of
phasing the termination, from 6 April 2016, of all AIPs of five years
or shorter in length that were set before that date. Amendment 13
concerns the commencement of the new clause and ensures that the
amendment will come into force on the day that Royal Assent is
obtained. I commend new clause 3 to the

Gilmore:</Member></B> One of the issues that has come up in the course
of all the debate about the single-tier pension is the decision that
the Government have taken to bring 
<?notus-xml column=841?>to an abrupt end to the provisions that previously existed for women in
particular—I shall talk primarily about women, although men
could be in this position—to be able to derive a pension or
years towards a pension from the contributions of their spouse. That
dates back to a different world. When the state pension system was set
up in the post-war period, there was an assumption that the standard
pattern for married people was that one person, normally the man, would
be the main breadwinner, and the woman would spend considerable periods
out of the labour force, and perhaps not even work at all after
marriage. Indeed, although they were about to go, there were still
marriage bars on certain types of employment, so time out of employment
was not just a question of choice; it was sometimes a question of
necessity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:05:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001327" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001327">Things
have changed and, although it can still be a necessity, for many women
the amount of time out of employment can be very short. The arrangement
in the original proposals was that a woman could receive a derived
pension from her husband’s contributions—currently
approximately 60% of the full state pension—or receive benefit
if she was widowed or divorced. For someone widowed after retirement
who was receiving only the 60% pension—sometimes referred to as
the married couples pension when both bits are put together—it
would be increased to a full single person’s pension, regardless
of whether she had made contributions during her working life. For
those who are divorced, there is currently provision in the system to
inherit and carry over a spouse’s contribution record if it is
better than one’s own. That can be beneficial to women, and some
men, in building up a pension
record<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:07:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001328" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001328">Other
changes that have taken place include crediting certain types of
contribution that are not entirely financial. As well as the credits
people receive during periods of unemployment when they are claiming
benefit, successive Governments have introduced credits for periods of
child care and for caring for other relatives, and that can make up
some gaps. There are still some people—a decreasing number,
without a doubt—who will end up in a position where they do not
build up sufficient contributions in their own right. If the right to
obtain these so-called derived benefits is taken away, there will be a
group of people, primarily women, who, post-2016 when the new
arrangements come in, will have less than they would have expected to
get before that date. They will be in a worse position than they would
have been previously, and that will have all sorts of
consequences.</hs_Para>

have reasonable expectations of the rules. Age UK gave an example of
someone who had specifically asked the Department for Work and Pensions
for advice on whether she should start making contributions relatively
late in her working life. She was told not to do so, because she would
not be able to work to receive nearly as much as she would be getting
in any event. That advice was given in good faith and at the time she
accepted it in good faith, but it is now too late for her to make up
the
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:08:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001330">The
Government estimate that there are 40,000 women in this position. I am
not sure whether there is certainty about that figure, because I do not
know whether a full survey has been carried out. However, 40,000 is not
a huge number. New clause 5 asks for a full review to 
<?notus-xml column=842?>ascertain how many women are in this position and what the cost would be
of allowing them to continue to benefit from derived rights for a

Gilmore:</Member></B> I do not know off the top of my head, which is
why I am asking for a review. We might be talking about 40,000 women
who clearly will not be getting a full pension, but certain of them
will have made some contributions; it is not that they will have no
contributions. The Work and Pensions Select Committee looked at this
and recommended transitional arrangements for those within 15 years of
the state pension age when the new arrangements came into force. It is
not for ever, it would not go on and on, with a very long tail; but it
would provide for those who quite reasonably made plans on the basis of
particular expectations.</hs_Para>

have heard two arguments from the Government. The first was a
generalisation about how the world had changed. Yes, of course it has
changed, and we are not talking about most or all women doing this for
ever. Just saying, “Well, the world’s changed”, is
not a good enough answer to the fact that some women will suffer
detriment if transitional arrangements are not put in place. The second
argument was that apparently—I am not sure any figures have been
offered up—an increasing number of these women were living
abroad. It conjured up images of women much younger than their husbands
and living abroad—I do not know whether the Minister had
Filipino brides in mind. Nevertheless, it cannot be beyond the
ingenuity of the DWP to ensure that people do not take undue advantage.
Like I said, these arrangements would not last for ever.</hs_Para>

are a variety of reasons why somebody might not have contributed. They
might have made a positive choice not to contribute or they might have
been doing voluntary or care work before credits were allowed or
without appreciating that they were allowed—we know that a lot
of people are eligible for carer’s credits who have not claimed
them. There are a variety of reasons. Others will have been in very
low-paid or short-hours part-time work and earning below the level of
contribution, and they might have concluded that it did not matter too
much because of the derived right.</hs_Para>

regulation. Regulation 4 of the Social Security Benefit (Persons
Abroad) Regulations 1975 (SI 1975/563) (deemed to have been made under
the 1992 Act) makes such an exception for retirement pensions. But
regulation 5 makes an exception to the exception. In the absence of
reciprocal treaty arrangements, persons ordinarily resident abroad
continue to be disqualified from receiving the annual
increases.”<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:14:18"></hs_TimeCode></hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13102969001338" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001338">The
House might expect that pensioners abroad who do not get the increases
are the exception; were the House to think that, it would be wrong.
Some 650,000 overseas pensioners get the increase, and they include
pensioners in countries such as the United States and Jamaica. More
than 500,000—it could be 530,000 or 570,000—do not. They
are predominantly in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa,
India and Pakistan, with Yemen and Japan being two others in the top

that.</hs_Para>

I was elected to this House, the then MP Julian Ridsdale had a debate
in 1972 answered by the Minister, Paul Dean, who said that these
matters were governed by reciprocal treaties and that the Government
were keen on having such treaties. If the Prime Minister today were to
invite various Government Departments to contribute to a whole of
Government review—which is what I would ask for—he would
find that the Foreign Office now says openly that it does not want
reciprocal agreements, in part because some of the old dominions and
Commonwealth countries provide increases to their pensioners in Britain
without us agreeing to do the same thing there. That does not strike me
as a good argument not to have reciprocal agreements; it strikes me as
a good argument for having them. Were he to ask for this review, the
Prime Minister would probably hear from the DWP, “Is this the
year when it is a priority to give increases to those who are not
resident in this country?”</hs_Para>

not quite say so—where regulations can be made that would allow
them to do it; the exception to the exception. I will spare the House
analysis of the provision in clause 18, which is too complicated even
for me to be able to put across in a way that anyone else would
understand. In clause 20, the Government are proposing
deliberately to continue the discrimination against some of our
overseas pensioners. There is no rhyme or reason. Being a member of the
Commonwealth does not bring someone in or put them out, although it is
what I call the old dominions who are affected.</hs_Para>

ask why we should do it now. The argument that Julian Ridsdale was
putting forward in 1972 was about a far smaller number of people. If my
right hon. Friend the Secretary of State were to say that 2% of our
pensioners are abroad, that is a dramatically higher proportion than in
1972, and it will grow. People who will earn their rights to pensions
in this country are a far more mobile population, both those coming
here and those going out. We know that, with the expansion 
<?notus-xml column=844?>of the EU, those countries with whom we would not have necessarily
claimed a very close connection over generations will come in. Without
wanting to stir up some of the popular newspapers, the new members of
the EU will not be excluded from getting increases in pensions, whether
their people come here and work and earn entitlement or whether people
who are resident in or nationals of our country go and live, for
example, in Bulgaria or Romania. They will get the increases. Those who
may have retired to South Africa shortly after the 1947 Pensions Act do
not.</hs_Para>

consistency. But that is not what the Minister is proposing. It might

changes in circumstances might require changes to be made in pension

John McGregor was right to say that such additional protection was
needed. He said that trustees would be consulted, that the House would

agree that there is a specific set of circumstances around these
pension schemes. I am certainly not saying that accruals and the terms
and conditions of a pension can never be changed in any circumstances,
but there is a specific set of politically charged circumstances to do
with the privatisation of these industries. Specific undertakings were
given to the members of those schemes to
encourage them to accept, if not actively support, the privatisation of
the industries in which they worked. I urge the Minister to tell us
this evening, if he can do so, whether he intends to use the power he
is giving himself in the Bill to honour the promises made to the
members of those schemes. If he will not do so, we will force a
Division to test the opinion of this House on amendment 37,
which would mean that the promises made to the 50,000 or so men and
women in those protected schemes were met.</hs_Para>

am conscious of the time and allowing the Minister appropriate time to
respond to the broader debate. I noted closely what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:40:07"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas) said about her new clause 6 and
her belief that the 700,000 or so women in the group born between 1951
and 1953 will not get the new state pension, because they are the last
pension cohort 
<?notus-xml column=850?>before the equalisation of the pension age, whereas men of precisely the
same age will get it. Let me put it in simple terms: if there were
twins, one male and one female, in that age cohort, the male twin would
get the new state pension in 2016 but the female twin would not, having
retired a little earlier. Such issues do emerge when we are involved in
pension reform. The Minister and I have gone back and forth on the
matter on a number of occasions, and I will not anticipate his
arguments because we have gone through them some time before. However,
we have to look at the issue in the context of a view that has grown up
among many women that this Government’s attitude to their
pension provision is not as generous as they believe it should
be.

considering the 2011 legislation, we had to deal with the issue of a
significant number of women having very little time to prepare for
retirement and short notice. They would have had to work for longer but
some of them would have had only five years to prepare for that. They
were five years from when they thought they would be retiring and then
found out that they might have to work for seven more years. I am
pleased that the Minister made a concession on that, although he did
not go as far as we wanted. That group of women—a slightly
different group from those we are dealing with here—who were
also approaching retirement, felt that they were being unfairly
treated. Not only did they feel, rightly, that they were being unfairly
treated, but we have also had to deal with the Minister’s
approach to auto-enrolment, which is excluding more than half a million
women—and rising—from the benefits of auto-enrolment,
because of the raising of the threshold for auto-enrolment in line with
the personal allowance. A general sense has developed that this

rights, usually those of women who expected to get their part of their
state pension through their husbands’ contributions. Those who
are nearing retirement would have no opportunity to meet the de minimis

new clause 13 delays introducing part 2 until the Secretary of State
has reported an assessment of the differential effects and impacts of
the pensionable age in England, Wales and Scotland. People are now
living longer and the better-off live longer than the worse-off, who
work more years and start working earlier. The latest evidence suggests
that the gap is widening and that is certainly the case as regards the
differences between England and Wales. Wales has the lowest gross value
added of the UK nations and regions. Welsh workers in general are less
able to save for their pensions, which means that many people in Wales
are reliant on the state pension. Life expectancy in Wales is also
lower than it is in
England<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:48:43"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
constituency, life expectancy is 78.3 years for men whereas in Dorset
it is 83 years. Wales also has the appalling legacy of large-scale
de-industrialisation and subsequent long-term worklessness. That means
that many people have broken employment records and a disproportionate
number might not qualify for a pension because of their lack of
contributions.</hs_Para>

Government have stated that they intend to review changes in life

encourage Ministers to ensure that the panel reviewing life expectancy
looks further and also considers Britain’s human geography of
low incomes, no incomes, long-term unemployment, sickness and
disability. That broader inequality must be addressed, as it will
certainly
persist.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001404" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001404"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Webb" PimsId="4546" UID="13102969003817" xid="625" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969003817">Steve

clause 5 was dealt with by the hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila
Gilmore) and touched on by her colleague, the Chair of the Work and
Pensions Committee, the hon. Member for Aberdeen South (Dame Anne
Begg). It addresses the position of the derived rights of people who
are shortly coming up to pension age and the fact that we are ending
the ability to derive pensions from a spouse. The spirit of the new
clause implies transitional protection, but we have included
comprehensive transitional protections in the system.</hs_Para>

particular, those who paid the married woman’s stamp and as a
result have a poor contribution record will, notwithstanding the fact
that we are ending derived rights, continue to be able to receive a 60%
spouse’s pension or a 100% widow’s pension, because that
was the basis of the deal that they did with the state. They signed the
married woman’s stamp, which said, “I’ll pay 
<?notus-xml column=853?>less NI, but I understand that when I reach state pension age
I’ll be able to get a pension based on my husband’s
contribution record.” We took the view that because that was the
basis of the deal, we could not change the rules. We have made sure
that the limited number of women in that position are
protected.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001407" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001407">The
issue is whether we should go further. It is worth bearing in mind that
to get a £66 pension, which is the derived pension for a married
woman, because of the rate of the single tier pension, such a woman
needs 16 or 17 years in the system. For someone who has
spent their life in this country, it is very difficult not to have
achieved that or
thereabouts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001408" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001408"><B><Member ContinuationText="Sheila Gilmore" PimsId="5534" UID="13102969003818" xid="1055" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969003818">Sheila

Webb:</Member></B> Indeed. The hon. Lady is right. Some women are in
that position, but a significant proportion of them have had very
limited contact with this country. This is the point that she touched
on. Derived rights arise to people who have never even been to the
country. They can get a 60% pension or a widow’s pension because
their spouse is part of the UK pension system. She is asking us to
keep, for another 15 years, an extraordinarily complex bit of the
system rolling into the new system. We are trying to deliver a simple
and effective new state pension system and we have already introduced
transitional protection for the most obvious group, the married
woman’s stamp pensioners, which we think needs to be protected.
We could have kept the whole of the old system rolling on for another
15 years, but that would have created enormous complexity when we are
trying to move to a simpler
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001410" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001410">Were
we to follow new clause 5 and the Select Committee’s
recommendation and choose 15 years as the cut-off, we could be as sure
as anything that we would be under judicial review for someone who was
16 years shy of the line. In other words, if we have a
cut-off date, we must have an objective basis for it, and we can find
no objective basis for choosing 15 years. I take the point made by the
hon. Member for Aberdeen South that because 10 years is the de minimis,
15 years is a bit more than 10. I get that, but so is 16 or
14.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001411" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001411">The
hon. Member for Edinburgh East said that someone some years ago was
told not to buy missing years and now it is too late. I stress that the
ability to buy missing years has been substantially relaxed by HMRC so
people can buy back as far as 2005-06 on relatively favourable terms.
Even by the end of the decade they will still be in a position to buy
back missing years. If they have spent the money and they do not have
it any more, they cannot do it, but that aside, the ability to buy back
missing years still exists. Although buying 10 years costs a lot of
money, very few people will be starting from zero. So to reach the
10-year de minimis would not necessarily be a huge outlay. Many will be
over that level already and for those who are not and who have been in
this country, the chance to buy one or two missing years will be
important.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001412" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001412">What

Amendment 1, which stands in his name and that of my hon. Friend the
Member for North Thanet (Sir Roger Gale), would delete clause 20. As
the Chair of the Select Committee pointed out, that would do nothing
for any of the overseas pensioners who have contacted us as their MPs;
it would only remove the freezing for single-tier pensioners. I am sure
that my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:54:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Worthing West (Sir Peter Bottomley) understands
that point, but I just want to be clear that if we voted for the

anomaly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969001415" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0003.htm#13102969001415">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:59:24"></hs_TimeCode>
a sense, the Chair of the Select Committee urged us to create that new
anomaly. She said that we cannot defend the old one and that we should
at least not carry on with it, but by doing that we would create a new
anomaly. It is not just about which side of the Niagara falls one
happens to live on, because single-tier pensioners would get indexation
but nobody else would. I think that we all know what would happen: we
would end up back in court. My hon. Friend the Member for Worthing West
referred<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:55:46"></hs_TimeCode>, quite
properly, to the extensive legal background to the issue, because it

West<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:55:34"></hs_TimeCode> referred to
the reply he received today from the Prime Minister—I am pleased
that he replied in advance of the debate—who stated that, having
reflected on their arguments, he did not feel that a further review was
appropriate at this point. Obviously, the context he referred to is the
£700 million cost of indexing those pensions.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:56:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Thanet said that they were not asking for that to be
backdated, but I speculate that as soon as we start indexing pensions
and stepping them back up to where they would have been, the next court
case will come when someone says, “Hang on a minute. Since you
froze my pension I have missed out on X amount of money, so I expect
that to be paid back as well.” These wedges have a knack of
having thin ends. The cost of addressing this, at £700 million a
year, is already substantial, but backdating would lead to far more
substantial costs, which is difficult to

it is not actually suggesting a solution. The complexity that the hon.

people all the information, because we could, although it is
complicated to put across; the problem is that nobody knows what their

her place, for its pre-legislative scrutiny of the draft Bill, or at
least the parts relating to the single-tier pension. We are grateful
for that input and made changes in the light of its recommendations,
including putting the start date in the Bill and setting the maximum

further some of the Committee’s recommendations as we have

reason for the Bill is that we have a state pension system still
grounded in the models of the second world war, a system where men went
out to work and women depended on men, and a system of mind-numbing
complexity that made it impossible for people to plan rationally for
their retirement. Each change by successive Governments has been made
with the best of intentions, but, grafted on to the previous lot of
changes, they left 
<?notus-xml column=867?>people with a system that nobody could hope to understand. That mattered
in its own right, but it matters particularly in a world of automatic
enrolment if we are to expect another 10 million people to save, in
some cases, relatively small amounts for their retirement. They have to
be able to do so confident that they will not see their hard-earned
savings means-tested away. That is why the single-tier state pension, a
single, simple decent state pension set above the level of the basic
means test, is such a fundamental reform.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has been supportive of this
principle from day one. I am grateful to him and to my colleagues in
the Department for the fact that the coalition has been able to
introduce this reform, which is long overdue and will, I believe, stand
the test of time. While we have had our differences with the
Opposition, I am grateful to them for their support of the principle of
the single-tier pension. We all want to see a pension system that is
not constantly chopped and changed, but stands the test of time. I
believe that the single-tier pension, subject to any further
refinements their lordships might wish to make, will indeed stand the
test of time and will provide a firm foundation for retirement
saving.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969002524" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969002524">The
Bill does not only deal with the single-tier pension. Part 2 brings
forward the increase in the state pension age to 67 and sets out a
process for dealing with these things in a more rational and measured
way. We envisage that as life expectancy increases, the majority of
that time will be added to working life, but a period will be added
also to retirement. It is a measured, balanced and systematic approach
that will allow people to plan for their retirement in a way that all
too often they cannot.</hs_Para>

stress that what we have put in place is a structure of reform that
will involve us actually spending slightly more over the coming years
on support for bereaved families, but there is a debate to be had about
how long support should last. For various reasons, going beyond a year
raises difficult issues. For example, a short-term benefit can be
disregarded for 
<?notus-xml column=868?>universal credit, whereas a long-term income replacement benefit almost
certainly would not be. By delivering the money in this way, therefore,
the lump sum is tax-free and the short-term payment is not counted
against people’s universal credit, whereas a long-term payment
would be, meaning that bereaved families might end up getting less
support were we to extend the period. So there are trade-offs and

pension is based on a 35-year contribution, 35 years buys someone a
£144 pension, so each year has been valued at a more generous
rate than the 30 years for the £110 basic pension. Under the new
system, nobody will lose out from the change because we compare
someone’s entitlement under the current system with their
entitlement under the new system, and their foundation amount going
forward is the higher of those two amounts. If the move to 35 years
prejudices any of my hon. Friend’s constituents, they will get
the figure they would have got under the current system, and if it

under the current system gets 30 30ths of £110, a basic pension.
Under our system, they get 30 35ths of £144, which is
more. The fact they have not got 35 years does not matter. They get a
bigger pension. It does depend on how much SERPS someone has, which is
why I say that some will get more. But no one will get less because our
starting point for the calculation is the better of the two numbers.
The move to 35 years for people already in the system cannot give them
less pension than they have already built up but does give them the

more.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969002537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969002537">The

has decided—with some justification on his part—that he
sees a hard and fast wind-up of the second state pension and the move
to a flat rate state pension as the best way to proceed. At the same

purpose and gives a firm foundation for auto-enrolment. That would be a

we reflect for a moment—usually Third Reading is a time to do
that—the Minister deserves credit for taking forward the
consensus created by the Turner commission, which, set up by the last
Government, had three important aspects in particular: to start dealing
with the issue of longevity; to start rebuilding the additional
pensions savings pillar that decisions of previous Conservative
Governments had damaged significantly; and to get a simpler state
pension. That is the context in which the Minister has proceeded with
his Bill and taking forward that consensus means that he deserves
significant

any Bill such as this, there will inevitably be kinks and things that
need to be sorted out, but there is a lack of balance in the Bill. The

happen in terms of the state pension. In terms of the other side of 
<?notus-xml column=870?>the equation—private pensions via automatic enrolment for the 10
million people who are currently going through that process—the
Minister says he has to do a lot of things, but a lot of them remain to
be done. The Minister is giving himself powers in various areas but
without specifying what he intends to do with those powers. I suggest
that while we can welcome the move to a flat rate state pension, there
will be more work for the House to do in terms of keeping the Minister
on the right track regarding how the private pension system interacts
in a coherent and comprehensive fashion with the flat rate state
pension.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969002543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969002543"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:44:27"></hs_TimeCode>

to have come round to Labour’s view on the need to take tough
action to cap pension charges. As I mentioned earlier today, it was
just over a year ago that he said that the Leader of the Opposition was
scaremongering when he drew attention to the problems in the pensions
market, yet we have heard the Minister using tough language today on
the need to sort out the market, and on having a consultation on a

have been dealt with effectively. However, questions remain about the
pensions market side of the equation and about additional pension
savings. Let us not forget that the new flat-rate state pension will
not provide most people with the kind of income they will need and
expect in retirement. The burden will therefore be on the new
auto-enrolment pensions to deliver the necessary additional income. We
believe that the Minister still needs to do a significant amount of

flaws in the EPPO proposal frame the context in which we must also
consider the Eurojust proposal. The reforms proposed to Eurojust would
involve deep connections with the EPPO, because the legal base for the
EPPO requires it to be created “from Eurojust”. The
Commission has sought to reflect that by creating operational,
management and administrative links between the two bodies. That
includes the exchange of data, including personal data; automatic
cross-checking of data held on each body’s IT system; and
Eurojust’s treating any request for support from the EPPO as if
it had been received from a national competent

the coalition programme says about preserving the integrity of our
criminal justice system when deciding whether to opt into a new justice

mandatory powers for national members—powers which would allow
it to require coercive measures at a national level. This House will
already be aware that we have expressed concerns about any such powers
being granted to Europol, the EU police agency, and our concerns hold
true in this regard too. The proposed text goes further in explicitly
requiring that those based in The Hague would be able to insist that
national authorities take investigative measures in certain
circumstances. That could, for example, include requiring them to issue
a search warrant in the UK. That would cut across the division of
responsibilities and separation of powers between police and
prosecutors in England and Wales and Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T18:55:32"></hs_TimeCode>. It also
fails to take into account the role of the independent judiciary in
ensuring that certain coercive measures are granted to police in
appropriate circumstances. Moreover, the proposals would conflict with
the role of the Lord Advocate in Scotland, who has the sole, ultimate

Brokenshire:</Member></B> Consultation has taken place with the
Scottish Government and with the devolved Administration in Northern
Ireland to keep them apprised of the examination of this measure and to
highlight the significant issues at stake. From the outset, this
Government have made clear their opposition to a European public
prosecutor’s office, for the reasons I have enunciated this
evening. I do not think that there is any surprise about the steps that
have been taken or, because of the fundamental nature of the objections
that I have highlighted, any fundamental objection to the proposals I
am setting out and to our seeking the House’s authorisation in

only rationale for the Eurojust proposal seems to be that in order for
an EPPO proposal to be brought forward the Commission had to take into
account the treaty requirement for it to be established “from
Eurojust”. Our law enforcement agencies and prosecutors already
work closely with Eurojust as it currently operates; this House will be
aware that we are part of the current agency. They value the support it
provides, but they must retain discretion to make decisions at a
national level. Indeed, the Government value the current Eurojust
arrangements, which support judicial co-operation arrangements, helping
to co-ordinate serious cross-border crime investigations and
prosecutions. The case of the murders in Annecy in France in early
September 2012 demonstrates the value of the current Eurojust
arrangements. The UK and French national desks at Eurojust were
instrumental in co-ordinating activity that led to a joint
investigation team, and in clarifying the legal and procedural options
in each country. That is why we are seeking to rejoin those
arrangements as part of the 2014 opt-out
decision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T19:01:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969002585" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969002585">We
also take seriously our commitment to tackling fraud against the
EU’s budget, but we believe that the most effective approach is
prevention, not the creation of a new EU prosecutor. The UK has a
zero-tolerance approach to all fraud, with robust management controls
and payment systems in place that seek to prevent incidences of EU
fraud. We have welcomed recently agreed changes to EU payment
procedures and the reform of OLAF, the EU’s anti-fraud office,
to improve the reporting systems and investigations. Once they are
fully in place they will support existing and future UK investigations
and
prosecutions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969002586" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969002586">The
Commission’s approach with the proposals under consideration
today is, therefore, unnecessary and, as I have set out, the content
raises substantial concerns. That leads us to conclude that we should
not participate in the new Eurojust proposal at the start of
negotiations. We will instead undertake to play an active role in
negotiations on both Eurojust and the EPPO, seeking amendments to the
Eurojust regulation to meet our needs while engaging in discussions on
the EPPO to protect against any attempt to bypass our non-participation
through the back door of Eurojust. At the end of negotiations, we will
thoroughly review the Eurojust final text and actively consider opting
in—in consultation with Parliament—on the basis of that
final assessment.</hs_Para>

the final text remained unacceptable and we were not able to
participate in it, there would obviously be risks for our longer-term
participation in Eurojust. Depending on what was finally agreed, an
assessment would need to be made as to whether we could remain within
the old arrangements, subject to the outcome of 
<?notus-xml column=877?>the separate work on the 2014 decision, or whether the institutions
would seek to eject us from Eurojust and we would need to seek
alternate co-operation arrangements. Given that we do not expect to
have sight of the final text much before the middle of 2015, it is hard
to speculate on the final outcome, particularly in the light of the
recent developments of the yellow card having been issued in relation
to the measure for the EPPO. What I can reiterate is that we will work
to get the text into a place where it is able to meet our significant
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102969002588" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969002588"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T19:05:00"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Sir Alan Beith" PimsId="3936" UID="13102969004909" xid="38" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102969004909">Sir

the House is discussing the two issues of European co-operation on
justice and home affairs: Eurojust and the European public
prosecutor’s office. If anyone is feeling a sense of
déjà-vu, that is because the House discussed the EPPO
this time last week. Indeed, there was a rare moment of unity when
those on both sides of the House agreed with the Government, the
previous Government and the European Scrutiny Committee that the
creation of the EPPO did not meet the test of subsidiarity and that the
UK should therefore opt out. In government, Labour secured an opt-out
from the EPPO and in opposition we support the Government in continuing
to use that opt-out. We have also heard that the yellow card has now
been issued.</hs_Para>

concern is so-called “annex 1” crimes such as drug
trafficking, human trafficking, terrorism and financial crimes. Those
are serious crimes that constantly evolve and adapt. Increasingly, they
cross borders and require co-operation between different jurisdictions.
The importance of Eurojust to the UK is underlined by the fact that
there have been 1,459 requests from EU member states for co-operation
with Britain through Eurojust since 2003, with 190 requests made in
2012 alone. It is therefore a little disconcerting to see the
Government playing the hokey cokey—we are in at the moment, but
now we are opting out although, in principle, we might be back in again

primary functions of Eurojust have been and will continue to be the
facilitation of co-operation between member states. Eurojust is
required to respond to any request from a member state and to
facilitate co-operation. That role means that Eurojust must inform
member states of investigations and prosecutions that are occurring in
a different member state but affect the member state; assist the
competent authorities of the member states in the co-ordination of
investigations and prosecutions; provide assistance to improve
co-operation between member states; co-operate and consult with the

appointed, will bear responsibility for ensuring that their member
states co-operate with Eurojust, including through legal assistance,
information exchanges, liaising with international bodies and assisting

Prosecutions in the UK of course require the consent of the Director of
Public Prosecutions, while investigation of most of the crimes listed
in annex 1 are the responsibility of the newly formed National Crime
Agency. Perhaps the Minister will explain what work is being done to
look at the possibility of drawing the national member from one of
those bodies and work on the basis of a memorandum of understanding to
ensure that the UK retains sovereignty over our systems while improving
cross-border co-operation. As has been mentioned, special arrangements

Britain’s interests not to be part of them—the creation
of the European public prosecutor is neither necessary nor, in the

second is that the mandatory powers that are given to national members

course, the arrangements throughout the United Kingdom are not uniform.

different from those in Scotland. In Scotland, the Lord Advocate and
the procurator fiscal can direct investigations. There is a clear
separation between investigation and prosecution in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland. Those differences need to be
respected. If we can respect those differences in the United Kingdom,

Dominic Raab</B> (Esher and Walton) (Con):</Member> This motion must be
considered in the context of the EU’s wider ambitions for a
single policy on justice and home affairs. As mentioned earlier, the EU
Justice Commissioner and vice-president, Viviane Reding, has a huge
stake in this matter, and in a far-reaching speech last month she spoke
about the considerable momentum towards developing a pan-European
criminal code and institutions, replete with a European justice
Minister—I dare say Ms Reding has a candidate in mind—and
with detailed monitoring and sanctioning powers at Commission level.
Those include new powers to uphold EU fundamental rights—a sort
of triplication of the human rights legal framework, bearing in mind
Strasbourg’s role in the Human Rights Act 1998 and UK
jurisdiction, and an expanded role for the European Court of Justice.
That is the clear ambition within the Commission and the broader EU.
With that in mind, this is also a critical juncture for Britain. We
remain poised to exercise our crime and policing opt-out under the
Lisbon treaty. It is therefore the right moment—an important
crossroads, perhaps—to think strategically about
Britain’s criminal justice co-operation in the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000019">On
the specifics of the motion, I fully support the Government’s
intention not to be part of the European public prosecutor’s
office. That initiative is obviously—transparently—a
preliminary stepping stone towards a much more far-reaching EU
prosecutor, and it must be nipped in the bud. Although it is limited,
at least on the surface, to countering fraud against the EU, under
current terms the EPPO would take powers away from Eurojust. It would
have the power to compel UK police to hand over evidence, and to order
UK prosecutors to take action. Through its relationship with Eurojust,
it could place wider burdens of co-operation on member states. The
scope of those obligations will, of course, be decided by the
Commission, and ultimately by the European Court. As the Minister has
said, we must stay out of such a measure. I welcome the
Government’s decision and the Minister’s clarity of
purpose and position.</hs_Para>

emphasise the positive and we should preserve and retain our national
criminal justice system. That system is steeped in a very different
tradition from the civil, continental tradition, and in a different set
of values. As hon. Members have already said, it is also steeped in a
different functional division of law enforcement powers that enshrines
a uniquely British conception of justice—one that is firm but
fair.</hs_Para>

regulation is a more finely balanced question. I worked in The Hague
and with Eurojust, which has done important work in recent years
serving as a college of co-operating national prosecutors. Personally,
as the Minister has said, I would prefer it to have continued down that
route and in its current form, but the new regulation gives the
Commission a seat on a new executive board and places a duty on
Eurojust to forge a special relationship with the EPPO. It also imposes
additional stronger duties of information sharing on member states,
including the UK if it signs
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000022">The
EU Select Committee has highlighted the new powers given to
representatives at Eurojust to bypass national authorities in order to
process requests for sharing information or evidence, and I pay tribute
to its excellent work. Again, all that would be interpreted and
enforced by the Commission and the European Court, 
<?notus-xml column=885?>while increasing our contribution to the EU budget. I note that the
Minister and the Government share those concerns and do not intend to
opt in at this time. However, they leave open the prospect of
“active consideration” of the case for opting in when the
final text is agreed.</hs_Para>

Opposition position on this matter is totally hopeless. They recognise
the defects in the regulation and accept the motion that the Government
have put before the House. They know the Government are actively
resisting the supranational elements and creeping supranational
character that some seek to impose on Eurojust, yet they criticise the
Government for not being in the negotiation now. Such negotiation
would, of course, mean that we were irreversibly tied in to the new
regime if it cannot be changed. That is utterly untenable and the kind
of thing one hears only from the Opposition.</hs_Para>

want to take this opportunity to ask more broadly what strategic
thinking has been done on our wider future justice and home affairs

other member states on renegotiating Britain’s wider
relationship with the EU in that critical area? It is right to assess
each regulation or measure case by case, on its individual merits and
substance, in a sober and pragmatic way—the Minister has done
that cogently this evening—but, at the same time, we need to

worry that we will drift into a disjointed, albeit bespoke,

grasp the nettle and spell out proactively, on the front foot, what
strategic JHA relationship we want, and why that will serve the
EU’s interest as well as the British national interest? In my
view, that means a British commitment to be a good operational partner,
with all the resources, know-how and expertise we bring to the game,
but without sacrificing democratic control over such a sensitive area
of national policy. It means saying to our European friends that our
co-operation within Eurojust will improve

fundamentally functionally different, but Frontex shows that countries
do not have to be formal members that have signed up in a formal way to
be active operational partners. We have heard that from the head of
Frontex. It is at least a starting point for evolving our relationship
with Eurojust and Europol. If, as I suspect, others within the
Commission and member states want to go down the federalising route,
that option should be clearly discussed now. We should be on the front

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000031">We

authority, or the salami-slicing of national democratic
authority—that is what we are seeing in the attempts to upgrade
Eurojust and Europol. Will there ever be a better moment to have that
candid but constructive conversation with our EU partners? I doubt it.
Government Members have a commitment to renegotiate our relationship
with the EU and to put the renegotiated deal to the British people in a
referendum. We know that the British people care. According to a ComRes
poll for Open Europe last year, repatriating UK control over crime and
policing ranks fourth on the public’s list of priorities for
renegotiation. That is very high compared with the other priorities
surveyed. We also know that there is significant scepticism among the
wider public at large on whether any politicians keep their promises on
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000032">The
Labour party is responsible for that haemorrhaging of trust. The
Government have a genuine chance to rebuild public trust. That ought to
start with the decisions we are taking now and over the next six months
on crime and policing, underscored by a two-pronged strategic approach
to our future JHA relationship with the EU—one that pledges the
full operational co-operation of a strategic ally but defends the
return of full democratic control, which the British people want and
expect.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/2FD097B4ED742CCF2A4BBE416BA53EB9391BD610" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 October 2013">Tuesday

part of two decades, the European Commission’s budget has not
received a positive statement of assurance from the European Court of
Auditors. A lot of money is wasted in maladministration, but a large
sum also disappears through fraud, which has caused consternation in
some circles for some time. People have, in the past, blown the whistle
on areas where money has been filtered away illegally. The problem goes
back to before 1999. Those of us who were involved in European affairs
back then will remember that the Jacques Santer Commission fell in 1999
because of a scandal involving a failure to chase down fraud, and the
ignoring of whistleblowers and internal fraud. When the Commission
fell, there was a marked panic in European circles and a committee of
independent experts was set up. That reported in March 1999 and again
in September 1999 after the European elections of that
year.</hs_Para>

there was an anti-fraud organisation in the European Commission called
UCLAF, which after 1999 morphed into a similar anti-fraud organisation
called OLAF. Its job was to chase down fraud, both internal and
external, and to protect the financial interests of communities in and
across the European Union. It was a simple transfer of powers from
UCLAF to OLAF—alas, several members of staff also made the
transfer—but OLAF did not really succeed in doing its job of
chasing fraud for some time. Indeed, it tended to chase whistleblowers
before it actually chased fraudsters who chose to defraud the European
Union.</hs_Para>

the fraud figures for the European Union kept climbing. Some say it was
as high as €500 million, although some would say it
was even more. The question for this debate is why the big leap from
having an anti-fraud office, which already has the powers to do the job
within the context of the existing treaties, to something that would
take a huge amount of powers away from member states? Why the huge
power-grab?</hs_Para>

proposal for a European public prosecutor’s office, the
Commission has also published a communication on its ideas for OLAF in
the future. It plans to table legislative proposals to alter the OLAF
regulation in due course. As it happens, the Council and the European
Parliament have only just agreed a revision to the 1999 OLAF
regulation, which has been more than 10 years in the making. A key aim
of that is to strengthen OLAF, the anti-fraud office of the European
Union, and its investigative capabilities, and also to provide greater
safeguards for those being investigated. The Commission’s
proposals for the European public prosecutor’s office, however,
would entail OLAF losing the powers to conduct investigations into
fraud against the EU budget and being limited to investigations on
other irregularities involving EU funds and misconduct or crimes
committed by EU personnel that do not have a financial impact. It is
gutting powers, which the European public prosecutor would use, from an
existing body, because it wants an EPP with more powers. It is the

We do not hold suspects for more than a fixed and limited time unless
charges are presented in open court. Under corpus juris, a person can
be held indefinitely. In our system, we believe we have the right to
face one’s accuser and see evidence. Under corpus juris, the
accuser may be anonymous and no right for the accused to see the
evidence exists. We like to be tried by lay magistrates in most cases,
have the right to trial of a jury of one’s peers and have an
adversarial model. That is not the case under corpus juris, where a
person is tried by professional judges, there is no right to trial by
jury and there is an inquisitorial model. We like an open court. It is
a closed court under corpus juris. We like the presumption of innocence

people have come forward with individual cases regarding the difference

Bulgarian nationals who allegedly worked to defraud an EU
agricultural and rural development fund scheme. Whereas the German
proceedings led to a conviction, the proceedings in Bulgaria ended in
acquittal—the current system led to different results in a
cross-border case. The argument for a European public prosecutor is
that it would have made a difference by ensuring consistency of
investigation and prosecution in those countries, changing the nature
of prosecution within a member state.</hs_Para>

example relates to cigarette smuggling from the Czech Republic into
Germany. The German criminal court used telephone tapping records
obtained by the Czech police as evidence to convict the suspect.
Although that evidence was obtained lawfully according to Czech law,
the defence lawyer argued that without a court order authorising the
telephone tapping, the evidence was inadmissible in the German court.
It comes to a certain point when one wonders whether a supranational
body such as the European public prosecutor could ask for the phone

a brief aside, if the House will indulge me, I think one can take back
the divergence between our legal system and that of the continent to
the Fourth Lateran Council and Innocent III’s view that it was
wrong for priests to stand and bless trial by combat. From that, our
different systems
developed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T19:50:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000048">On
the substance of the documents in front of us, the key is that the
Lisbon treaty provided that a European public prosecutor’s
office should be developed from Eurojust, which article 86(1) stated
could go ahead by enhanced co-operation. In coming forward with these
proposals, therefore, the Commission is starting from a very good
treaty base, from its point of view. Fortunately, however, we have an
equally good treaty base for rejecting it—our ability to opt in
or not.

raise the flag of concern about what this whole process is about, and I
urge the Government, regardless of the negotiations, not to opt in at

degree of competence being created for Eurojust is extremely wide and
is set out in annex 1 of the documents before us, which lists the forms
of serious crime that Eurojust is competent to deal with in accordance
with article 3(1). I will read the list out, as that has not yet been
done, because it is important to understand how all-encompassing the
list is: organised crime; terrorism; drug trafficking; money
laundering; corruption; crime against the financial interests of the
union; murder, grievous bodily injury, kidnapping, illegal restraint
and hostage taking; sexual abuse and sexual exploitation of women and
children, child pornography and solicitation of children for sexual
purposes; racism and xenophobia; organised robbery; motor vehicle
crime; swindling and fraud; racketeering and extortion; counterfeiting
and product piracy; forgery of administrative documents and trafficking
therein; forgery of money and means of payment; computer crime; insider
dealing and financial market manipulation; illegal immigrant smuggling;
trafficking in human beings; illicit trade in human organs and tissue;
illicit trafficking in hormonal substances and other growth promoters;
illicit trafficking in cultural goods, including antiquities and works
of art; illicit trafficking in arms, ammunition and explosives; illicit

<?notus-xml column=890?>trafficking in endangered animal species; illicit trafficking in
endangered plant species and varieties; environmental crime;
ship-source pollution; crime connected with nuclear and radioactive
substances; and genocide, crimes against humanity and war
crimes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T19:53:06"></hs_TimeCode>.
While<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T19:53:06"></hs_TimeCode> some of
those are undoubtedly extremely serious and have cross-border
connotations, others are essentially national crimes that are most
unlikely to have any international connotations. Tiresome though it
might be, if one’s car radio is stolen, it is hard to see how
that motor crime would have a particular effect on the good people of
Luxembourg.</hs_Para>

list goes on, because the proposed regulation coming from the EU allows
Eurojust to cover related criminal offences, so it has the ability to
go further than this already extensive list. I would argue that the
Eurojust proposal contains a very wide set of competences and that
Eurojust has significant power of its own. It can exercise its tasks at
the request of the competent authorities of member states or,
crucially, on its own initiative; it does not require a member state to
intervene to set the wheels in motion that would lead to investigations
taking
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000051" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000051">The
Commission sets out in its document that competent national authorities
shall respond without undue delay to Eurojust’s requests and
opinions made under article 4, which sets out the basis on which they
may make such requests. What is being proposed will give Eurojust a
very wide set of competences and an ability to demand responses. I am
well aware that the Government’s concern over the directive is
that there may be orders coming from member states to direct
investigations in the UK and that they believe that that would be
unsatisfactory. Eurojust itself does not get that direct power, but it
is not very far from it, because national authorities have to respond
without undue delay. Although they can cite operational reasons of an
unspecified kind as to why they will not provide co-operation, that
will be justiciable by the Court of Justice of the European Union. That
seems to me to be a very major extension of the competence of the
European Union into the criminal justice
field.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000052">On
the composition of Eurojust—I may have misunderstood
this—it is surprising that it is not composed according to the
ordinary rules of qualified majority voting, but by simple majority of
the members of the college. The members of the college will be one
representative of each member state, each of whom will have, according
to article 10, a single vote. It would mean that the UK, if we were to
opt in to this set of proposals, could be outvoted without even having
the benefit of the extra weighting to our vote. The college is set up
to maximise the power of the centre against the countries. The
proposals give enormously wide control to Eurojust even if the
Government’s queries on direct orders from other members and the
relationship with the European public prosecutor’s office are
answered. That is a fundamental step in reversing—you will be
horrified to hear, Madam Deputy Speaker— the differences that
developed in 1215 with the Fourth Lateran
Council.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13102977000053" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000053">7.56

Brokenshire:</Member></B> We have had a full and lively debate,
characterised in customary fashion by the contribution of my hon.
Friend the Member for North East Somerset (Jacob Rees-Mogg). He, like
others, set out a number of the significant concerns that are held not
only by the Government, but by Members across 
<?notus-xml column=891?>the House about the Commission’s proposals for a European public
prosecutor’s office and the construction of Eurojust.</hs_Para>

derives real benefits from its participation in the current Eurojust,
which is about practical co-operation; from collaboration; and from the
number of cases that have been assisted by the establishment of joint
investigation teams. But that does not mean that we should now opt in
to a new measure that is clearly so fundamentally flawed because of the
intrinsic link to the European public prosecutor’s office. Some
of these significant issues have been highlighted in the impact they
would have on our criminal justice
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000056">The
hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson) was critical
of the system of the block opt-out and of having to opt out and then
opt in before dealing with new EU measures such as those we are
debating this evening. This was precisely the structure that her
Government negotiated. If she is unhappy with this system, she needs to
look to herself and to her hon. Friends who were party to the
construction of the
mechanism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000057">The
hon. Lady highlighted and questioned the date of 21 November. I can say
very simply that that is the latest date on which the UK would be able
to exercise its opt in. It is three months from the publication of the
last language version of the relevant regulation, which is the time
period referred to. She also highlighted some concerns about
fundamental rights. I draw her attention to the explanatory memorandum,
which was signed by the Minister for Immigration on 7 August and sets
out the fundamental rights analysis. That will explain to her the
issues she
highlighted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102977000058" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000058"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T19:59:28"></hs_TimeCode>Questions
have been raised about the national member. Indeed, the hon. Lady asked
whether we should negotiate a better position for the national member,
and whether the Government would express their concern in respect of
Eurojust and the European public prosecutor’s office. She
mentioned the 10th anniversary of Eurojust. I was there and made those
very points at that time. Indeed, one of the first things that I said
at the first Justice and Home Affairs Council I attended following the
election of this Government was that we would not participate in the
European public prosecutor’s office. I can therefore assure her
that we have consistently made our views plain on the lack of a need
for a European public prosecutor’s office. We believe that there
are more practical ways of dealing with these issues.</hs_Para>

is one of the prime sites and locations for sporting
excellence—not just in London, but in this country. The first FA
cup finals were held at Crystal Palace and the national sports stadium
was built there. It got its name from the relocation of the original
building at Hyde park in the Great Exhibition of 1851. The building
that was placed on the Sydenham hill side of what was then called Penge
common was larger than the original that Joseph Paxton—later
Sir Joseph Paxton—designed for Hyde park. The
pictures make that clear. The construction in Hyde park was rather
mundane; it looked almost like an out-of-town shopping centre compared

hill is the highest point in Greater London, although when it was built
and opened in 1854 by Queen Victoria, there was no such thing as
Greater London. The fact that it is the highest point in the whole area
explains why, when it burned down on 30 November 1936, the
fire was alleged to have been seen—depending on which account
one reads and from where one was looking—from either five, six,
seven or eight counties.</hs_Para>

the Crystal Palace arrive, but two separate railway stations arrived

Crystal Palace moved to the area in 1854, and since the fire in 1936 it
has undergone a number of changes of identity. The motor-racing circuit
was very well used and highly thought of until the High Court ruled
that, even back then, it was too much for local people. The motor
racing died out in the early 1960s, although, as one who grew up in the
area, I remember it clearly. Most famously, there was the Concert Bowl.
During my dissolute youth, I attempted to go there to see Pink Floyd,
but I could not get a ticket. I had to stay outside in Crystal Palace
Park road and listen to the concert there. On the strength of that
experience, I went out and bought a copy of “Atom Heart
Mother”—but that is rather by the

then fast-forward to the days when the Greater London council had the
stewardship of the park and the site. Not much happened then. I suppose
that the most instrumental event of recent years took place in 1986,
when the GLC was abolished and the site was handed to Bromley council.
At the time, I was a member of the council of the London borough of
Lewisham. Crystal Palace is often exemplified as an area of Greater
London that has few parallels, in that five boroughs have boundaries
there within a space of 200 yards: Lewisham, Southwark, Lambeth,
Croydon and Bromley, which is where the Crystal Palace park is
now.</hs_Para>

everyone will know, the abolition of the GLC was seen as a highly
political issue by those on both sides of the argument. We suggested,
along with our colleagues in Southwark, Lambeth and Croydon, that the
park should be transferred to a trust encompassing all five boroughs.
It is not just a local park; it has a much greater resonance and a much
greater significance than that. However, our proposal was resisted, and
the park was handed lock, stock and barrel to Bromley
council.</hs_Para>

of metropolitan open land, so development on it without specific legal
approval would be extremely difficult, and that it why the current

1995, Bromley council established a working group to revitalise the
sports centre. In the late 1990s there was a bid for funds from the
single regeneration budget, principally involving a leisure facility, a
multiplex cinema. The bid collapsed. The Government called the plan in,
and then let it go. As some Members may recall, in 1999 Swampy and his
pals climbed trees and went underground in an attempt to prevent the
clearing of the site for the development, which was eventually dropped
in 2000. The multiplex proposal was
scrapped.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/391F9862CEB8E8D2566E6A22D03DB2AB259B33C5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="29 October 2013">Tuesday

London Development Agency then launched a formal consultation, and
appointed master planners for the park and its environs. The master
plan was submitted and went through various processes until 2008, when
it 
<?notus-xml column=896?>was approved by Bromley council. It was called in by the then Secretary
of State, and there was an inquiry which was eventually resolved in
favour of the plan. Although it was challenged in the High Court in
2011, the challenge was dismissed in 2012 and all appeals were
dismissed in April this year. In July this year, leaks or
releases—we can call them what we like, but these things never
happen accidentally—were made about a scheme involving the Mayor
of London, the London borough of Bromley and the ZhongRong Group. I am
sure not many people in Lewisham West and Penge or this House have
heard of the group. It has come forward with proposals to
rebuild—or replicate, perhaps—the original Crystal Palace
and to restore the gardens to the original standard that Sir Joseph
Paxton had in mind when he finished the relocation back in 1854. That
is an exciting proposal but it runs up against the Bromley London
Borough Council (Crystal Palace) Act 1990, which as things
stand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:15:58"></hs_TimeCode> forbids

Brunel, who designed the water towers at the original Crystal Palace at
Sydenham hill. Mr Ni’s ambition may well reflect the ambitious,

went to the launch of the scheme earlier this month, and the Mayor of
London, Boris Johnson, was there, playing his normal shy and retiring
role, and saying he would be happy to help if he possibly could, but he
must not be dragged too much into it. That is strange, because other
boroughs in our part of south-east London actually wanted Crystal
Palace park to remain the responsibility of what became the Greater
London authority. That was resisted by the Government before 1997, but
now we have the Mayor of London involving himself along with the London
borough of Bromley.</hs_Para>

special adviser to the Prince of Wales—I presume on

are clearly worthy people, but what is missing from the group and the
consultation is anybody local to Crystal Palace and the surrounding

The roads have no more space to accommodate anybody. Even though the
plan includes a 3,000-space underground car park to get people out of
the park, which is fine, how on earth are we going to move that number
of people in and out of the area at any given time?</hs_Para>

restored park would be a public space for all to enjoy, and
approximately 100 new jobs would be created there—that must be a
good thing. It would increase the number of visitors, the footfall in
the town centres and the expenditure there—that is another good
thing. Some 1,000 jobs would be associated with the construction, and a
further 1,000 associated with the operation of the palace and the other
activities to which ZhongRong is keen to ensure local people have
access.</hs_Para>

picture is very mixed. I am not one to look a gift horse in the mouth,
but it is entirely reasonable to check whether it has four legs and
some teeth. Given all the impact that this huge change is likely to
bring to our area, how do we assess whether it is in people’s
best interests? When the original Crystal Palace turned up on Sydenham
hill, it brought two new railway stations and railway connections with
it. The high-level station has now gone, following the demise of the
original Crystal Palace, and we are left with just Crystal Palace
station. It has strong links to London Bridge, Victoria, East Croydon
and all points south, and in recent years the East London line has been
put in, adding capacity. But things have changed; one of the first
things Mayor Johnson did on being elected in 2008, or whenever it was,
was to cancel the Tramlink extension to Crystal Palace from Beckenham.
We are now being told that 
<?notus-xml column=898?>everything possible will be done to improve transport links.
This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:24:23"></hs_TimeCode> scheme

considerable investment in transport in the area.</hs_Para>

am just sketching out the ground, as these are early days. People who
are for the scheme have contacted me, as have those who are against.
Some people are against things that they do not even know will come
into existence.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:24:23"></hs_TimeCode> timetable
for the development is as follows: by spring next year the design
competition should have concluded; by autumn next year, those involved
should be in a position to submit a planning application to the London
borough of Bromley; if that is on track, they should have approval by
autumn 2015; work should start on site in spring 2016; and we should
have completion in 2018—I am available for the opening if they
get that far.</hs_Para>

am delighted to see the Minister in his place. I want to ask three key
questions of the Government and I hope he can answer them. In view of
the likely scale of this development—I know that the design
competition is still to be decided—how can the London borough of
Bromley decide on a planning application which will clearly be in
breach of the 1990 Act? Surely the Act would need to be amended,
abolished or repealed before the council would be able to consider such
an application. It could not possibly give planning approval to
something that clearly breaks the law. Will the Government underwrite a
full consultation with all local groups, citizens and neighbouring
local authorities to ensure that all voices are heard so that we can
make the most informed decision about this once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity? This is a major departure from any previous planning
guidelines or outlines and from the master plan for the park, so can
the Minister assure me that if it were to move through all its stages
and be approved by the London borough of Bromley, the Government would
call it in for further inquiry and
deliberation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:25:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:25:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Lewisham West and Penge (Jim Dowd) for securing this debate on an
issue of such dramatic importance for his constituents. In the short
time left for my speech I want to make sure that I answer his
questions, but I must first say that he is right that the Crystal
Palace was one of those few iconic buildings. Even those of us who were
not alive while it stood know what it looked like and think that it
would be rather marvellous if this city had such a thing
again.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:25:43"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102977000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000105">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:25:58"></hs_TimeCode>
is, of course, tremendously exciting that somebody in the world thinks
it is possible, sensible and affordable to rebuild some version of the
building, although obviously in modern form. Nevertheless, as the hon.
Gentleman points out, the proposal is at a very early stage
and raises a huge number of complex issues for the developer
and, critically, for the community in which Crystal Palace
sits.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102977000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000106"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:26:18"></hs_TimeCode>The
first point to make is the one on which the hon. Gentleman concluded,
about the need for consultation. All planning applications are better
off if there is intense consultation at the earliest stage possible. A
planning application on the scale that this is likely to be can succeed
only if there has been consultation at every stage from the start,
binding in not only local elected 
<?notus-xml column=899?>officials but as many local people as possible in public meetings,
through exhibitions and through every form of consultation. I know that
that is well understood by the Mayor’s office and by the London
borough of Bromley, but the hon. Gentleman is quite right to emphasise
the need. The Government will be very clear that such a proposal will
have little chance of getting anywhere without consultation from the
start.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102977000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000107"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:27:10"></hs_TimeCode>Secondly,
the hon. Gentleman made a point about the effect on transport
infrastructure. Government policy is very clear that developments of
any kind must be sustainable and one of the ways in which this scheme
must be sustainable is by ensuring that the transport infrastructure is
able to support the level of activity and movement generated. A
development on this scale will have a dramatic effect on the transport
infrastructure and although of course the transport infrastructure in
that part of London is enviably good compared with that in some other
urban areas in the country, it nevertheless cannot cope with an
unlimited amount of additional demand. That will be an incredibly
important part of any planning application and of the consultation to
which we have just referred.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102977000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/debtext/131029-0004.htm#13102977000108"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T20:27:50"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
the hon. Gentleman asked how a planning application and the process of
granting permission could be reconciled with the legislative obstacles
he has identified. We have made it very clear to the Mayor of London
and the London borough of Bromley that we are happy to work with them
to try to resolve those legislative issues through whatever means
necessary, although we hope that what they require of this House will
be minimal. We remain ready to do that. It is sometimes possible to
give planning permission subject 
<?notus-xml column=900?>to conditions, but I agree that it is unusual and perhaps unprecedented
to give planning permission when one of the conditions is a change in
the law. I would imagine that he is probably right that any necessary
changes to legislation would need to be made in parallel with
consideration of the planning application. As he points out, however,
these are early days. We have not even seen an outline planning
application, so we do not necessarily need to know right now how we
will jump that hurdle if we get that far.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman is right that this is a tremendously exciting project
for his constituents, for London and for the country. It is right that
the London borough of Bromley and the Mayor have decided to embrace it
and to bring in very high-quality firms and individuals as advisers. It
is incredibly important that this is not an elite project and that it
is carried out by, for and with the support of the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents and all those who live close to that
dramatic landmark. We can all see the potential, but we can also see
some risks if there is any sense in which the project is visited upon a
community by others who think it is a grand idea but will not have to
live or work next to it.</hs_Para>

me say at the outset that, although I seek in  this debate to
highlight the particular issues and concerns  of those with
haemophilia who were infected with hepatitis C, I recognise,
of course, that the issues affect others beyond that group. Many
haemophiliacs received other infections, HIV in particular, and some
were dual-infected with HIV and hepatitis C. Others were multi-infected
by the range of other viruses to which they were exposed. Some
haemophiliacs were treated with blood taken from donors who later died
from CJD. Others did not have haemophilia, but were none the less
infected as a result of their NHS treatment. I am sure that some who
contribute to the debate later will refer to the experience of those
who have been affected in those other ways, and a number of points I
will make will have a broader relevance to those people’s
situations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102939000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102939000008">The
reason why I selected financial support for people with haemophilia
infected with hepatitis C as a topic for debate is simple: it reflects
the specific concerns of three of my constituents with whom I have been
campaigning on the issue for 16 years. They are Peter Mossman, Fred
Bates and Eleanor Bates, who is Fred’s wife. I pay tribute to
their determination and the single-minded way in which they have worked
with other members of the haemophilia community in pursuit of justice
and truth.</hs_Para>

essentials. Ministers will need to obtain and share more accurate data,
particularly to assess how many of those registered at stage 1 have
died and what the likely financial costs would be of a revised
arrangement between stages 1 and 2. That information is vital, but one
fund with the resources to make lump-sum and annual payments to all

the circumstances surrounding the death of the Northern Ireland

background to the case is clear. I have spoken to constituents of mine
who are victims. Some of my constituents live daily with these
illnesses through no fault of their own but rather as a result of the
Government’s inaction at a time when action was important. My

information as well as for the personal  
<?notus-xml column=202?>details that they have given me, although I do not intend to mention any

Archer inquiry investigated the fact that between the 1970s and late
1980s, 4,670 people with haemophilia were infected with hepatitis C
through treatment by the NHS that they loved and respected, which
ultimately, unfortunately, let them down. Of those, 1,243 people with
haemophilia were also exposed to HIV, as the right hon. Gentleman said.
Almost half of those infected with hepatitis C and almost three
quarters of those co-infected with HIV have since died and many have
tragically left families behind. When looking at the impact on the
individuals, we can never forget about the effect on their families;
many<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T09:50:20"></hs_TimeCode> individuals
have experienced poverty and discrimination as a result of their
infections. People, either through mistrust or lack of knowledge,
sometimes unfairly discriminate against those with infections. The

support and compensation to those affected and would ensure that steps
were taken to improve blood

previous Government argued that the reason why financial support was
not made available at comparable levels to those in the Republic of
Ireland, for example, was that the disaster affected the two countries
differently. I am unsure how that was worked out. Perhaps the disaster
was measured in numbers, but the disaster is the same to each
individual and each family. No-fault Government payment schemes were
established to provide support to those affected. The Archer inquiry,
which was non-statutory and funded from private donations, reported in
February 2009 on the Government’s response. Among its
recommendations was a call for reform of support for those affected in
line with the scheme used in the Republic of Ireland. If we had had in
Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom a scheme similar to
that of the Republic of Ireland, our constituents would have been much
more satisfied. What does the Minister think about the Republic of
Ireland’s scheme? Is it possible that we can try to match

the Government’s announcing on 10 January 2011 an increase in
payments to some of those infected with hepatitis C, what has been put
in place is not adequate to support people through their illnesses. The
Government’s scheme now has two stages, as outlined by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T09:51:43"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East. A first stage payment of
£20,000 is available to eligible people. Following that,
successful recipients of the first stage payment whose hepatitis C
infection has led to advanced liver disease can receive a second stage
payment of £50,000. Those who have received the second stage
payment are also entitled to additional annual payments of
£14,000, paid monthly or quarterly. The money may look good and
it sounds like a lot of support, but, as always, there is more than
meets the eye to the press release. As the saying goes, the devil is in
the detail, and that is clearly the case here. The Hepatitis C Trust
supplied an interesting briefing and is calling for a rethink of the
strategy and policy. The trust, with which I certainly agree, asks that
the first and second stage categories be removed. As a constituent of
mine said, the payment can never compensate for what has happened, but
it can offer support and help people to adjust to and live a life
affected by it.</hs_Para>

situation of people who are unable to work for long periods of time

down a job and receiving an income. Sufferers rely on help from family
and sometimes from other carers, and the fact that the annual sum
starts only when a person’s hepatitis C has caused cirrhosis

the crux of the
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T09:53:45"></hs_TimeCode>. The

Burt:</Member></B> My hon. Friend is right. Hanging over the issue,
particularly for those of us who were Ministers in successive
Governments, is a sense that not enough has been done. No blame can be
laid at the door of Back Benchers who have campaigned and done so much,
and in their respective ways, Governments have sought over time to do
something about the issue, but we are still here because of the
overwhelming sense that whatever has been attempted has just not been
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000005">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T09:59:49"></hs_TimeCode>
reason why I raised the matter on the Floor of the House with the Prime
Minister the other day was to capture that sense. Let me say more about
that, but I shall try to be
brief<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:00:59"></hs_TimeCode>. I had a
meeting with the then Minister with responsibility for public health,
my hon. Friend the Member for Broxtowe (Anna Soubry), a few months ago.
All of us have had meetings with the successive holders of that
ministerial role over time. The history is familiar to us, but there is
an overall sense that whatever has been tried—whatever honest
attempts Governments have made—has just not been
enough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:01:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000006">I
supported the inquiry by Lord Archer of Sandwell, and in 2010, I
seconded the early-day motion that called for the passage of the Bill
that Alf Morris had introduced in the Lords to put into effect the
recommendations of that inquiry. I was disappointed that those
provisions were not put fully into effect, although the incoming
Government made the changes mentioned by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:01:47"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East. We all welcomed that at the time,

are we making another attempt now? As has been made clear by the
presence here of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:02:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leigh (Andy Burnham), there is now a different attitude
towards uncovering past wrongs. The reason why I put the case so
clearly to the Prime Minister is that his record in dealing both with
the aftermath of the Hillsborough panel and with Bloody Sunday has
demonstrated that he is a Prime Minister who is using his position and
authority to right the wrongs of the past. Bearing in mind that he has
a constituent affected by the issue, we know that he has a personal
interest. That combination of circumstances perhaps means that the
person in place has the determination to right the wrongs of the past.
If information can be put together properly, something might therefore
be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000008">The
sense of closure that must be achieved is palpable to all of us with

has got wrong and what can we put right? The first point is that the

second point relates to accepting that something has gone wrong.
Undoubtedly, Ministers have said so and made that clear, but the
Government’s acceptance of something having gone wrong has not
been accompanied by the fullest disclosure of their full part. Even
when the previous Government responded to the Archer inquiry— 
<?notus-xml column=206?>they published their response on 20 May 2009—they still, in
relation to the release of documents on their website,
stated:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102960000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000143">“Further

2009, relevant papers were still being found and put in the public
domain. The Government added the
claim:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102960000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000144">“We

that is for other people to judge. All this is governed by a very real
sense that not enough has been
disclosed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:04:15"></hs_TimeCode>. The
current Penrose inquiry, which has been mentioned, may provide an
opportunity to revisit that

third point is that the process has been too divisive. Sufferers have
been inadvertently set against other, being asked, “What have
you got—hep C, or hep C and HIV, or some other
variant?” It should not be like that. Everyone has suffered
because they were all infected by the same process at the same time,
and efforts should not be made to divide
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000014">The
fourth point is that the premise has been  wrong: it just does
not work to use charity law to deliver support that ought to be the
Government’s responsibility. Efforts made over the years to put
matters right and make changes have not done the job. The premise needs
to be scrapped—it should not be there—and colleagues have
mentioned that the difficulties of separating stages 1 and 2
from hepatitis C only create new barriers and yet more unhappiness and
anguish<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:05:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000015">The
problem about the Macfarlane Trust, which deals with double-infected
patients, is that there is a conflict between whether it should act on

as possible and banging the drum for them. I sense that there is a
conflict, because the trust is not doing that, so it is not doing its

first of the main issues about financial support is the Caxton
Foundation application process. There is general dissatisfaction with
that organisation, which has been given responsibility for grants to
people with hepatitis C who have received stage 1 payments from the
Skipton Fund. The Caxton Foundation has given a number of assurances
that the application process will become less complex, less stressful
and quicker, but when we talk to the community, it says that the grant
application is not improving and that, in some cases, it is becoming
worse. I fully understand why many people feel that a grant-based body
is not what this community deserves, but until we have a different
approach, we must make the system work better for those for whom it was
set up.</hs_Para>

have some suggestions for the Minister to consider. First, we need a
clear list of what grants will be given for published on the website.
The lack of clear criteria means that people feel that they are often
begging.
Secondly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:10:36"></hs_TimeCode>, we
need a simpler application process. At present, people tell me that
they believe they have applied for something only later to find that
they have 
<?notus-xml column=208?>to fill in further forms. That feels like moving the goalposts mid-way
through an application process, and it is not
fair<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:10:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000027">Thirdly,
I want to see a clear statement on means-testing. At present, it is my
understanding that the Caxton Foundation is not having to means-test
most applications, and some payments, such as the winter fuel payment,
are paid to everyone. Why is the foundation asking applicants to
complete intrusive census forms, which ask for incredibly detailed
information about the circumstances of an individual or a
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:11:22"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000028">Fourthly,
we need decisions about applications to be reached in a timely fashion,
and a clear target should  be set. Possible further measures
could improve the efficiency and functioning of all the funds. Will the
Minister consider the staffing levels in the schemes, because there is
a restriction in place? There is also a need to look again at the
availability of financial resources. The Department could introduce
some support in kind. It could offer to second a public health doctor
to the funds, to complete an assessment of beneficiaries’ needs.
That has never been done, and it would be helpful. The Department might
also bring to bear its experience of procuring computer and telephone
systems. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:12:13"></hs_TimeCode>The

Minister three reasons why that argument does not hold up. First, the
distinction is not a clear one; there is no blood test. It is a matter
of progression, which is not easily determined. That issue is
exaggerated by the fact that it requires a liver biopsy to ascertain
the level of liver damage, and that, in itself, is potentially life
threatening.</hs_Para>

there is increased evidence that hepatitis C is more than a liver
disease. Other Members have already said that a range of symptoms have
been identified including fatigue, joint problems and mental health
issues. Thirdly, the fact that mortality rates are higher among stage 1
sufferers than stage 2 sufferers seems to be a compelling argument why
such an artificial distinction should not
hold<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:14:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000034">The
Contaminated Blood Campaign has committed many hours of research to get
to the bottom of the expert evidence. When Professor Brian Gazzard, who
is chair of the expert panel, was asked about the matter, he said that
they had never discussed the two-stage system; in fact, the experts
were expressly asked by the 
<?notus-xml column=209?>Department of Health not to discuss it. Charles Gore, the chief
executive of the Hepatitis C Trust, who was also one of the experts
used by the Department of Health, has stated that
the two-stage approach is an arbitrary system and that he knows of
people who suffer more in stage 1 than others do in stage 2. Will the
Minister set out—if she cannot do it now, perhaps she could
write to me—what the expert evidence is, so that we are clear
about how the decision was reached?</hs_Para>

discuss briefly. On the number of people who are affected, my right
hon. Friend the Member for Coatbridge, Chryston and Bellshill (Mr
Clarke) asked a parliamentary question about the number of Skipton
stage 1 beneficiaries, which is unknown. Will the Department of Health
take the necessary steps to identify how many state 1 sufferers are
still living? That could be done through contact information that is
still held by the Skipton Fund and/or through information now held on
census forms by the Caxton
Foundation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000036">On
hepatitis C and HIV, I absolutely agree with what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:15:44"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North East Bedfordshire (Alistair Burt) said about how we set
different parts of the community against one another. The list of
anomalies between those infected with hepatitis C and those with HIV
and their family members continues to grow. The imbalance of the system
now operated by the schemes is such that some family members will get
assistances and others will not. That area needs to be considered,
especially because HIV and its treatment have changed considerably over
the past 20 years. That needs to be recognised.</hs_Para>

warnings were given to the Department of Health in 1958 and yet, as

and contaminated blood earlier this year. It is no exaggeration to say
that it is the worst meeting I can remember in eight years of going to
such meetings. The previous Minister was completely unprepared in her
brief; she shared the all-party group’s concerns but had no
solutions whatever to address them. That meeting was attended by 20 MPs
and peers, with 20 others giving their apologies. The number of Members
who take part in the frequent debates on this issue shows the level of
concern among all parties about it.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Wythenshawe and Sale East has rightly framed this
debate in terms of contaminated blood and  
<?notus-xml column=212?>hepatitis C; understandably, the good briefing from the Haemophilia
Society has done the same. However, the briefing also refers to
co-infection with HIV.</hs_Para>

Minister looks at these issues, I urge her not to forget those who have
been infected, or co-infected, with HIV as a consequence of
contaminated blood products.
Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:25:58"></hs_TimeCode> the 1,252
people who have been infected with HIV in this way, 932 have died so
far. Among the 322 of those people who are still living, one of them is
my constituent, Andrew March, who was contaminated at the age of nine.
He is now 39, so his entire life has effectively been ruined. He has
been a staunch campaigner. He was the applicant in the judicial review
proceedings on this matter, and yet after 30 years he is still waiting
for any proper redress.</hs_Para>

feel strongly that this issue is the responsibility of Government, and
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:26:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Devon (Sir Nick Harvey) was also clear on that. To some
extent, the admission of liability is not the central question. The
previous Minister wrongly said that the reason why proper payments were
made in the Republic of Ireland was that there was an admission of
liability. In fact, payments were being made there before the admission
was made, as the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:26:51"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) pointed out very clearly, having a
clear knowledge of what happened; the hon. Gentleman  is not

issue.</hs_Para>

need to get tied up in those matters of liability, but personally I
would like an admission of responsibility from the Government, because,
for some of the reasons that have already been given, that much more
could have been done. In the 1970s and 1980s, there was a delay because
of a failure to see what medical knowledge was showing about
contamination. Even when that contamination was known, there was a
failure to treat products so that they were no longer
harmful.</hs_Para>

final point is about funding. Reference has already been made to the
Skipton Fund in relation to hepatitis C, but there are
similar problems with the Macfarlane Trust. I have been told that it is
effectively falling apart; that the review of its probity, of its
success, has been ignored; that there is very poor communication
between it and sufferers; and that it is underfunded.</hs_Para>

all that is that people die. People die because they are not getting
sufficient treatment or sufficient medication that they need to deal
with their conditions. HIV is a treatable condition, but for those who
have serious health problems it can still be fatal and that issue is
not being addressed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:28:27"></hs_TimeCode>In the short
term, I ask the Minister to look at both the lump sum and ongoing
support payments, but in the longer term what we need is a full and
final settlement.</hs_Para>

suspect that many Ministers, particularly junior Ministers, wonder how
much difference they have made on a lot of issues when they finally
leave their posts. However, I also suspect that this is one discrete

welcome the points raised by other right hon. and hon. Members on the
anomalies in financial support for those who contracted hepatitis C.
Indeed, those issues have affected one of my own constituents,
Mr Dennis, who was infected with hepatitis C in the 1980s
and has since been diagnosed with polyarthritis and, most recently,
with liver cancer. He has raised with me on a number of occasions the
lack of additional support for those with tertiary conditions such as
polyarthritis, as well as his difficulty in obtaining disability
benefits, for which previous assessments have been based on his
mobility rather than his ability to care for himself and to undertake
everyday tasks. Although polyarthritis affects only some 4% of chronic
hepatitis C sufferers, it has had a huge impact on Mr Dennis’s
quality of
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000041">There

upset and frustration. Yet I hear time and time again that that is the
daily frustrating experience of many beneficiaries. The experience is
that policies are created ad hoc with little
continuity or clarity, that intrusive and personal

This is not the first such debate I have sat through; as a member of
the Backbench Business Committee, I helped to allocate the Back-Bench
debate in 2010. I sat through that whole debate, so I came to this post
at least familiar with the strength of feeling on this issue and with
the way in which so many hon. Members have worked so hard over many

disappoint those hoping for new policy announcements. The debate has

<?notus-xml column=217?>more useful for me, listening to Members’ contributions, than it
will be for those listening to me. It has been incredibly helpful to
hear the many comments that have been made, and I will try to answer as
many as I can. If I do not have the knowledge or time to answer any
points, I undertake to write to hon. Members about them. Let me also
say straight away that I am more than happy to have the meetings that
have been asked for. I have some thoughts about how we can get the most

given me much to reflect on, but I would like to take some time to lay
out the current position. Everyone who has spoken has said they would
prefer us to be somewhere different, but it is relevant to lay out the
practical support that has been offered to date and where successive
Governments have got to. Indeed, the presence of a former Secretary of
State at the beginning of the debate rather underlined the fact that
successive Governments have struggled to achieve a final resolution. I
very much welcome the cross-party tone of the debate and the shadow
Minister’s commitment to work with the Government.</hs_Para>

Government are fully committed to supporting affected haemophilia
patients, by ensuring that haemophilia and hepatology services in the

assistance. There is the prospect of some good new treatments for
hepatitis C, with fewer side effects than the current treatment and
less of an impact on day-to-day life. We all welcome that, but I
recognise that although these new therapies may treat the infection,
they may not alleviate all the associated health effects. For many of
those affected by hepatitis C, there is a continuing need for
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:46:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000071">In
January 2011, my right hon. Friend the Member for South Cambridgeshire
(Mr Lansley), then the Secretary of State for Health, informed the
House that we would provide additional support for those affected. It
is important to remember that that support was available to not just
haemophilia patients, but any patient infected with HIV or hepatitis C

many who have spoken this morning are seeking a longer-term resolution,
let me quickly go through the additional practical support that the
Government have put in place. We linked the annual payment for HIV
awarded by the previous Government to inflation, so it does not lessen
in value. We introduced a similar payment for those most seriously
affected by hepatitis C, and we increased the value of the lump sum for
that group to £50,000. I very much hear the concerns some
Members expressed about the divisiveness of separating different
groups, but the lump sum for that group was nevertheless increased
substantially.</hs_Para>

discretionary payment mechanism was also introduced to meet specific
financial needs for all those infected with, or affected by, hepatitis
C. None of those affected 
<?notus-xml column=218?>now have to pay for their prescriptions. In addition, £300,000
has been made available over a three-year period to provide counselling
services to those affected by hepatitis C. All those payments are

pick up the point about the exemption regarding employment and support
allowance, one of my predecessors made representations in that regard.

combination of fixed and discretionary payments was previously decided
on as the best way of ensuring greater financial certainty for people
facing the most severe consequences from infection. The idea was that
it would retain a degree of flexibility so that assistance could be
tailored to an individual’s personal situation, and the debate
has clearly shown how different the situations of hon. Members’
constituents are.</hs_Para>

put in place could also complement the other support people might
receive, such as through the benefits system. The flexibility that gave
was thought to be important, because an individual’s needs vary
significantly. However, I know there is concern among haemophilia
patients and others infected with hepatitis C that there is
insufficient support—this has been the focus of much of the
comment today—for those who have developed chronic infection,

scientific and clinical advice that the Department received during the

of possible consequences of hepatitis C infection appears to
be wide-ranging, and, in many cases, causal association has not been

then Minister with responsibility for public health,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T10:50:28"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend

evidence, so Department of Health officials have commissioned a
systematic review of the scientific and clinical evidence on the
natural history of hepatitis C. That will report in autumn
2014. I shall raise with officials the question whether that could be
brought forward. An earlier report could be useful in the light of
other

very large number work in very small businesses, or work at home, and
are therefore the kind of people who make a big usage of our local post

problem is some dispute about the figures for losses or profits made by
local branches. The Holloway branch, which is in my constituency,
opposite the Odeon on Holloway road, at the end of Tufnell Park
road—sometimes known as Tufnell Park post office—is a
very busy building, and queues frequently come out of the door on to
the street. Bizarrely, the Post Office claims that that branch loses
money, which is hard to see when the building is completely full the
whole time. The Post Office also claimed that the only way in which a
post office could be retained on Holloway road—the Holloway post
office—is if it is franchised out to someone else. In other
words, it would become the rear counter of a supermarket, a WH Smith or
someone else. There are, however, no WH Smith branches anywhere in the
whole borough, so it is hard to see how it might want to be involved.
Inevitably, that would mean fewer postal facilities, fewer staff
available, even longer queues and much more business lost by the Post
Office<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T11:05:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000107">I
have a constant frustration on meeting with the Post Office: a lack of
imagination and ambition for the development of the post office
network. It seems to have an agenda of closing down branches and
diminishing the network, and there is the looming threat—in five
year’s time—of what happens if the contract with Royal
Mail is not renewed. I hope that the Minister, despite the
Government’s default position that the Post Office is nothing to
do with them—that it is someone else’s
responsibility—will say that she or the Secretary of State is

take the example of Holloway post office, as I said, it is a popular,
successful and busy local branch. At the moment, it has seven full-time
and seven part-time people working there, alongside two managers. They
are paid according to the terms and conditions agreed nationally
between the CWU and the Post Office. The local staff do a good
job—they are very knowledgeable and popular with the local
community. When we have had demonstrations outside the post office, the
number of customers who come up to say thank you to the demonstrators
for supporting their local post
office<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T11:07:22"></hs_TimeCode> is

happens to the staff during the franchising process? They lose their
jobs, or they get moved somewhere else. The Post Office keeps telling
us that everything is okay and that all the staff have been moved to
another, remaining Crown post office somewhere else. That seems to me
to be a circle to nowhere, a descent from one Crown office to another,
until there is none left and the staff have no choice but to go and
work for a franchisee. The franchisees, however, pay staff much less
than the Post Office. I have reports of some cases in which they are
paying the minimum wage, or slightly above, for what is extremely
skilled work at handling a variety of different transactions that the
Post Office staff already do well. One can only form the impression
that what is really happening is a race to the bottom—losing
jobs, losing facilities and ending up with a post office counter at the

post offices and ask the Minister for confirmation about them. First,
the Crown post office at Archway—as far as I am aware, the
freehold of the land is in the hands of the Post Office, although that
remains to be confirmed—is a popular, effective and good local
post office. It does not seem to be in a radically different position
from the other three Crown post offices in the borough. We have had
confirmation that that post office is secure in the immediate future. I
should be grateful if the Minister confirmed that and that there is no
threat whatever to the Archway post
office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000114">Secondly,
the Finsbury Park post office, which is about 100 metres outside the
Islington boundary in the borough of Hackney but clearly affects many
people living in Islington, is incredibly busy, and we are all worried
that it could be at risk in the closure and franchising programme. In
short, we are speaking on behalf of the people of Islington who want to
use, enjoy and support Crown post offices. I wish the Post Office would
show the same determination by providing good-quality local services
with dedicated staff who are paid at the proper rate to deliver those

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T11:10:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Islington North (Jeremy Corbyn) for securing this
debate, which is important for Islington. I am delighted, Mr Dobbin, to

has been happening to our post offices in Islington is a sorry story,
and I shall start with the Almeida street site. It is a large site in
the heart of my constituency. It is bounded on one side by Upper
street, and surrounded by Moon street, Milner place and Gibson square.
It is a very large development area. The Post Office somehow managed to
sell the site without securing a proper site for another post office.
It kept the post office on Upper street, but is only renting it back.
The post office does not have disabled access and its remaining time on
that site is limited. It is a Victorian building; it has been there for
ever; it is in the heart of my patch; and it seems that it will just
go. That is the first
problem.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000117">The
post office on the Upper street site needs to move. We accept and
understand that, but the question is, where will it move to? The other
big Crown post 
<?notus-xml column=225?>office in my constituency, which borders my hon. Friend’s
constituency, is the Highbury Corner site. As hon. Members have heard,
it is only temporary, so the council offered £2 million and a
site for a Crown post office across the road. In its wisdom, Post
Office turned that offer down. Having sold off one site and not secured
another, and having turned down £2 million that the council had
offered, it is telling us that it does not know where to move to or
what it can
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000118">We
are told that the post office can move to a site opposite the garage on
Upper street by the town hall. I have said several times that one
reason why it needs to move is the lack of disabled access at the Upper
street site. Yet, I understand that on the site that it is moving to
the door is of limited size because it is in a conservation area. It
will not be able to have double doors that open electronically, which
is the ideal for any new site, particularly when it serves a large
disabled and elderly population, as it does. Thankfully, people today
do not have ordinary wheelchairs; they have electronic wheelchairs and
can get about. I have grave doubts about disabled access at the new
site, which the post office is moving to, not least because of the lack
of disabled access now, and I wonder whether there will be disabled
access for everyone or only some people. If the Post Office expects
someone in an electronic wheelchair to push open a door, it is on
another planet; it will not
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000119">There
has been one bad decision on the Almeida site and another on the
Highbury Corner one. In addition, the council has not given up. It is
saying, “Okay, you have refused our £2 million; we are
now in a time of austerity and the £2 million has been spent
elsewhere. But guess what? We are prepared to give you anther
£750,000 for another site at Highbury Corner.” The
gauntlet is down, but the Post Office will not accept that offer
either. The council has also said. “In the meantime, if you are
trying to build another post office, we can provide you with
accommodation.” The council has offered accommodation near empty
council buildings on Upper street, but the Post Office does not seem to
want to move there either. How much more can it try to destroy its
business than it has done over the past five or 10 years in Islington?
If I sound fed up, Mr Dobbin, you should hear what my constituents have
to
say.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000120">The
situation is not hopeless. Some post offices work perfectly well. I
fought hard to save Essex road post office, as some of the
Minister’s officials know, and we secured its future. It has
been refurbished and has just reopened with extended hours, five
counters and disabled access. It will do very well and it is exactly
the sort of post office we want. If that can be done in one corner of
my constituency, why can it not be done in its backbone, where we need
a Crown post office that will function
properly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102960000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000121">My
last complaint—I have more, but I am being selective—is
that even if a new Crown post office is opened opposite the garage,
whether it has disabled access is a moot point, and there will be only
seven counters. There are seven counters at the current post office in
Upper street and at Highbury Corner. The Post Office intends to try to
put a quart into a pint pot with the same number of counters at Upper
street. People already queue outside in the rain at both Highbury
Corner and Upper street post offices. People do not go to the post
office because they do not have 45 minutes to queue. The Post Office is
cutting off its nose to spite 
<?notus-xml column=226?>our face. It must get a grip and show some leadership and vision. It
must move on and build a proper Crown post office on Upper street that
is worthy of the people of

the real issues and worries that constituents feel when changes are

sustainable future. We all know that there is heightened local concern
following the previous closure programmes in 2003 and 2008. That
certainly affected my constituency, and those of both hon. Members,
where four and seven branches respectively closed in Islington North

ensuring that we improve the service that we offer to customers by
addressing some of the issues that both hon. Members have raised, such
as the size of queues and the time people must spend in them. As the
hon. Lady rightly said, people do not have 45 minutes to stand in a
queue at a post office. That is why some of the changes we are making,
including longer opening hours, should help to put the Post Office on a
much firmer and more sustainable footing. That will enable people to go
to the post office at a time that suits them, and spreading the points
at which people may go to the post office will have an impact on
queuing

Swinson:</Member></B> Obviously, all operational matters are for
discussion between Post Office Ltd and the relevant unions, but longer
opening hours are welcome and could be implemented in the existing
Crown post office network. With the post office local and the post
office main models, longer opening hours are being rolled out in the
rest—and, by far, the bulk—of the network. The investment
that is being put into those branches is being used to secure longer
opening hours as part of an overall new negotiation and deal with those
sub-postmasters. They will receive investment and a new way of working
with their branch, but the quid pro quo for that has to be that the
opening hours are enhanced, which has an additional customer
benefit.</hs_Para>

know that customer satisfaction statistics for the new post offices
that have been opened show that customer satisfaction is significantly
increased. The hon. Lady mentioned the newly refurbished post office in
Essex road, which she opened just last Friday. I am sure that she
found—as I have, when I have opened post offices in my
constituency and have been to others around the country—that the
feedback from customers shows that they are incredibly welcome. What
often happens is that a post office, which perhaps was dark,
cramped-looking and not fit for the 21st century, is taken and turned
into something that is much more akin to modern shopping and retail
environments, and it will therefore attract more customers and be more
successful.</hs_Para>

Swinson:</Member></B> Obviously, the post office network is complex,
with a wide range of outlets across the country. In working out the
best locations for all those post offices, Post Office Ltd has to take
into account a wide range of factors. The post office that the hon.
Lady recently opened in Essex road is under a different kind of model
of ownership from those at Highbury and on Upper street, which are part
of the Crown network. The Essex road post office, which has become a
main office, is obviously not part of the Crown network.</hs_Para>

customers would be blissfully unaware of the different structures of
different parts of the network. However, of the some 11,800 branches
that exist now, about 370 are part of the Crown post office network and
therefore directly operated by the Post Office. The vast majority of
post offices are run as sub-post offices either through franchise
agreements, such as through multiple chains—WH Smith has been
mentioned, but there are many convenience store multiples—and
also by many individual, independent sub-postmasters who run their own
post offices in their communities, effectively, as their small
businesses. Trying to manage such a diverse network brings its own
challenges.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102960000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102960000131">In
particular, I want to turn to some challenges facing the Crown part of
the network. Numerically, about 370 post offices out of 11,800 is a
small part of the network, but none the less, it has been responsible
for a significant proportion of the network’s losses in recent
years. Of the post offices that we are discussing today, those on
Holloway road, Highbury corner and further down Upper street are in the
Crown network. In the last full financial year, that part of the
network sustained losses of £37 million, which is a third of the
overall losses for the whole network. Those 370 branches are, by and
large, in busy town and city centre locations, and that situation is
unfortunately not sustainable. Ultimately, any retailer that was losing
significant money on branches in such prime locations would be looking
seriously at how to cut costs to ensure that that part of its network
and operations were, at the very least, breaking
even.</hs_Para>

not have that figure in front of me, but I will endeavour to find that
information out from Post Office Ltd and ensure that it is forthcoming
to her, if that is possible within the bounds of commercial
confidentiality. However, the overall picture for the Post Office in
terms of revenue is that it is not possible to continue operating a
Crown network that has the kind of losses that have been sustained over
many years. That is why we are transforming the Crown part of the
network with £1.34 billion of Government investment
until 2015. We also want to ensure that we put the Post Office on a
firm footing and eliminate the losses in the Crown network by 2015.
That is only fair to the taxpayer, who is also providing significant
subsidy, and it is also about good commercial practice.</hs_Para>

the service where it exists, so it is looking for franchise partners to

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T11:28:21"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Islington South and Finsbury talked about disabled access issues
for the existing—and very beautiful—old Victorian
building in Upper street. Looking to merge those Crown services into a
new, much more purpose-built facility elsewhere on Upper street and
between the two—about 420 metres from one post office and 150
metres from the other—should provide much better customer
service.</hs_Para>

highlight, however, that that is currently subject to a 12-week
consultation, which opened earlier this month and closes on 27
December. I urge any relevant constituents or people who are interested
to respond to the consultation. The fact that the lease for the
building on Upper street runs out in March 2014 is relevant, because
clearly, we want to ensure continuity of service provision. I
understand that the council has made offers, but there is an issue
about when some of those offers have been forthcoming. The information
that I have shows that that has happened incredibly recently, and
clearly, plans need to be put in place to ensure that the provision is
ongoing.</hs_Para>

hope that people respond to the consultation and that customers in
Islington have a new opportunity for better services from the Crown
network, as well as from the other modernised part of it, such as in
Essex road, where the change has clearly been shown to be very
positive—actually, I think that I visited Essex road post office
some years ago. I hope that my comments have been helpful to both hon.

deterrent that this country now has would not have been possible
without the efforts of 20,000 servicemen during the 1950s and 1960s at
nuclear tests in the south Pacific and Australia. The science at the
time was not well understood. Precautions, therefore, were primitive
and inadequate, and they often failed to protect individuals from the
effects of blast, heat and ionising radiation. Many test veterans
believe that their health was adversely affected by their service. That
view has been substantiated by scientific research undertaken
relatively recently by Professor Rowland in New Zealand. That work was
peer-reviewed and accepted by the then New Zealand
Government.</hs_Para>

at least five survivors and families of survivors from that time in my

would be distributed on the basis of need and not entitlement, which is
terribly important to understand. That is what differentiates this fund
from other recognition or compensation elsewhere. There is often an
automatic entitlement to compensation in other nuclear test countries
if veterans can prove that they were there at the tests and have
suffered ill health. The US is an example, as is Canada, and even the
Isle of Man. I shall come on to the point in a minute that we are near
the bottom of what I would call the international table of decency, in

veterans, in relation not only to nuclear tests, but to reductions in

million benevolent fund; I think that the suggestion is a practical one
on the basis of need. These veterans made a major contribution to
understanding the effects of nuclear war. That is very important, and
to do that they often sacrificed their health, and they are still
suffering for it today. I find it very strange that, in this country,
we always have continual battles to get recognition for veterans. Some
years ago, it was about getting recognition for the merchant navy
during the war. I do not know what it is about this country, but we
seem to be falling behind everybody else in recognising the
contribution that people have made on our behalf. I hope that we do not
make the same mistakes with the veterans of Afghanistan in
future.</hs_Para>

Baron:</Member></B> Having served myself, I sympathise with what the
hon. Gentleman says and I understand the campaigns that he mentions.
This is one of the key points that we wish to make about the benevolent
fund: if we look at other countries—I shall come on to this very
briefly—and compare how they treat their test veterans, we rank
very near the bottom. However, I suggest to the Minister—this is
where there has been confusion in the MOD before—that the
payment should be ex gratia; in other words, there would be no
admission of liability. There has been some confusion within the MOD
that the BNTVA, as an organisation, has been involved in litigation
through the courts, when that has not been the case. If we look at
other countries that have made ex gratia payments, we see that the case
being made very much stacks up. There would be no admission of guilt or
liability, but it would put right an
injustice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:37:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

is important to reinforce that point. The campaign organised by the
BNTVA, other hon. Members and I has been very much focused on
Parliament and not on taking this issue through the
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:38:00"></hs_TimeCode>. Perhaps
I should also add that the BNTVA has put in a submission to the medal
review led by Sir John Holmes, and it is waiting 
<?notus-xml column=232?>for the outcome of Sir John’s deliberations. However, that is
separate from the campaign that we are discussing today.</hs_Para>

return to both interventions, in a way, and to the point about how
other countries treat their test veterans. It is clear, when looking at
the comparisons, that we rank towards the bottom of what I would call
the international table of decency. Let us take the US for example. Our
campaign is about recognition, and all that people have to prove for
compensation there is that they were present at a nuclear
test—one is sufficient—and there they have a list of more
than 100 illnesses. They do not have to provide a causal link between
the two. Providing that someone can prove those two things, they will
automatically get compensation—£47,000 for the first
illness and £47,000 for any secondary attributable illness as a
bonus. No causal link between service and illness is required; payment
is simply automatic. That is in addition to the fact that veterans in
the US have access to free health care.</hs_Para>

there in large numbers, and Canada pays some £15,000 to each
veteran, in addition to war pensions, and enjoys a health care system
like the NHS—free at the point of use. Closer to home, the Isle
of Man, which has been supportive of our campaign, makes an ex gratia
payment of £8,000 to any resident test veteran, and 17 such

stress that our proposals are different from the comparisons that I
have just listed, because the £25 million would be
distributed on the basis of need, not entitlement. That is why it is
important to stress the ex gratia nature of the payment. There is no

would be there to help veterans and their descendants who need help
with their care and treatment. The fact that someone is a veteran does

afield again. I remind her that in the 1990s this country made an ex

compensation for having undertaken tests in Australia. It was the
equivalent sum of money, and if it is good enough for Australia, I do

seven years after leaving service, the burden of proof is on the

another, the system is time consuming and complicated for these elderly
veterans, even when successful. The perception is that they are still

system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:44:45"></hs_TimeCode>. As if to

new post, may I urge her to reconsider our campaign? After all, the
Government have a very good record of recognising just causes and
righting past wrongs—mesothelioma and thalidomide victims are

discussing this issue with test veterans has been their dedication to
duty for their country, but also the fact that they have less concern
about their own well-being and more concern about their descendants.
That is an important point for the Minister to take on
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102965000026">We
should never forget, either, that it was a unique service by these
veterans in many respects. The science was unknown and the risks were
unquantifiable, but the cost to the veterans and their descendants was
very severe indeed. Official recognition—I stress that we are
talking about recognition, not compensation, as I hope that I have made
clear in relation to the second phase of our campaign—of this
unique service and contribution to our defence is therefore only right.
If the Government continue to fail to recognise that, they fail not
only our veterans but their descendents, and they fail to lift the veil
of shame that almost uniquely hangs over this country. The time for
action is now. Warm words are no longer
enough.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13102965000208" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0001.htm#13102965000208">2.48

recognise the vital job that all our armed forces do and that all our
veterans have done for us and the country, including the nuclear test
veterans. I recognise the unique nature of their service. I regret the
worry and uncertainty that they have experienced in the years since
their service. Whatever the facts, it is highly regrettable that we
have ended up in the situation that we are in today. It is clear from
the comments made that there is a lot of good will and a desire to see
an outcome, but there is also frustration that it has not been

was delighted to meet representatives from the British Nuclear Test
Veterans Association earlier this year in Brighton. I am grateful to
those from the group who took the time to host a reception and
exhibition there. The art exhibition “Shadow of the Bomb”
is extremely powerful and helps to convey the spectrum of emotion and
feelings with which the test veterans and, indeed, their families live.
It helped me to understand that the fear of what might happen, what
might have happened and the fear of the unknown can, in a different
way, have debilitating effects on some veterans, almost as great as a
physical illness. That is also true for their children and
grandchildren. We can all appreciate that those are horrible doubts and
fears to have to carry around. We have to
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T14:53:29"></hs_TimeCode>spend only a
short time speaking to the veterans to get a sense of deep uneasiness
about their experiences. One image that stuck in my mind was of those
carrying out the tests being covered from head to foot in protective
clothing, while the serving personnel, as the veterans were then, went
about their work just in shorts.</hs_Para>

events took place in the 1950s, and just as they do now, service
personnel signed up and did what was asked of them, without question
and with 100% commitment. They did so alongside individuals carrying
out their national service, who had not volunteered to be there, but
they did what was asked of them with just as much commitment. Another
difference between then and today is that there is far more scrutiny
today of what we ask our service personnel to do and how they are
treated, as shown by the recent discussions on whether human rights
laws and the concept of negligence should apply to service personnel on
operations and in what

have changed markedly since the 1950s, when there was far less external
scrutiny of the treatment of our forces and probably less awareness on
the part of the serving personnel themselves about whether what they
were being asked to do was unreasonable. We would now, rightly, find
troubling the prospect of the deliberate testing of radiation on people

appreciate that the reins on the public purse are tightly held at the
moment, but could the Minister look at whether it is possible to
allocate money from the LIBOR fund, because that money is already set
aside, to kick-start a benevolent fund? There are many demands on the
fund and applications to it have been made, but it would be an obvious
source of money that could be released quickly and easily. Nothing will

scheme in France demands a greater burden of proof of a link to
service. If I may say so, it would do, because it was introduced only
in 2009. As a result, we believe only one award has been made in

<?notus-xml column=240?>a link to service is raised on the basis of reliable evidence. However,
in fact, nuclear test veterans in Australia face a tougher test, which
is set out in the legislation. For example, for cancer of the bladder,
veterans must have received a cumulative dose of at least 100 mSv of
ionising radiation a number of years before clinical onset, while there

that any veteran who believes they have suffered ill health due to

Where there is reliable evidence that disablement is due to service, a
war pension is awarded, with the benefit of reasonable doubt always
given to the claimant. Nuclear test veterans are no different, and war
pensions are paid to claimants for disorders accepted in principle as
being caused by radiation, where the evidence raises a reasonable doubt
of service-related radiation exposure. In addition, awards are made
automatically to nuclear test veterans who developed certain leukaemias
within 25 years of participating in the tests. For some, therefore,
there is an automatic entitlement, which is absolutely right. Again,
that begins to move us up that so-called league table, if, as some

contribute to the total cost of rehabilitating the test sites in
Australia. Payments were made in instalments, the last being made in

this area now sell or invest for the future, knowing that there is
possibly a 30-year time limit, after which the defences will not be

from the outside it looks as if the Lancashire coast is being dealt
with in separate sections. Fleetwood, quite rightly, gets £65
million; the sea wall there needs attending to. If anyone sees that sea
wall, they will know that it is like the Berlin wall. The poor
residents need something that might look better and might do a better
job. However, just along the coast, there is another village called
Pilling, where I have regular meetings. Again, that is a lowland area,
next to Thurnham, where there are also concerns about flooding and land
drainage. Yet at the Pilling meetings, there is no mention of what is
happening next door in Thurnham. That might be because Thurnham comes
under Lancaster district council and Pilling comes under Wyre district
council. Nevertheless, it seems a bit odd, because my understanding of
water is that when it comes through the dykes or over or through the
sea defences, it does not worry whether it is flooding Pilling or
Thurnham, which are next to each other.</hs_Para>

question that I have for the Minister has already been asked by people

because of different council boundaries? Do we need to consider a

bureaucratic—but at least it involved local landowners, on a

although we are practical in Lancashire, we can think outside the box.
If the Environment Agency is going to hold the line and if the
Government are going to supply the money to keep the sea defences going
for 30 years and then make a decision—we have not discussed this
with the parish council, although it has been talked about in the area
generally—could there be a special levy in the area as part of
the parish rate, which could go into a fund to be invested for
30 years? We wanted to describe it as a sinking fund, but

the levy was £25 a year, let us say, with 500
residents paying it, in 30 years there would be more than
£300,000 before interest. Any parish or group of residents would
be in a very strong position, whoever the Government were in 30
years’ time. If they had a body of money to contribute, it would

a Member of Parliament representing a coastal constituency, I know
exactly what the hon. Gentleman is talking about in terms of
discussions on managing the coastline for the future. I represent,
among many other communities, the village of Boscastle, where, as the
hon. Gentleman might remember, there was a horrendous flood in 2004,
which also affected communities in Crackington Haven and Canworthy
Water. The issues of flooding are foremost in my mind both as a
constituency MP and as a Minister with new responsibilities, which I am
trying to carry out to the best of my

hon. Gentleman will be aware—in fact, he pointed to
this—of the national scale of the challenge that we face on
flood management. In England, one in six properties is at risk of
flooding. By area, 11% of the country benefits from flood defences,
including some of our most important commercial and economic centres.
This includes 1.3 million hectares of agricultural land—a point
that the hon. Gentleman made. The majority of the most versatile and
productive farmland in England is in flood risk areas. The soil is
often productive because it is in a river catchment, and it is very
fertile, but it is intrinsically vulnerable to
flooding<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:17:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000128">Flood
management supports the Government’s primary objective to
deliver economic growth and build a stronger economy, and it remains a
top priority for the Department. The Secretary of State and my
predecessor have both been very clear about that commitment. Proof of
our commitment to flood management can be seen in the announcement this
summer on long-term capital settlement to improve flood management
infrastructure. This announcement set out a record level of capital
investment of more than £2.3 billion in the six years to
2021<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:17:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000129">However,
we are not only increasing capital expenditure; we are providing an
above-inflation increase of £5 million for the Environment
Agency’s flood maintenance work in 2015-16. That is very
important for schemes such as the hon. Gentleman’s, which have
been there for some time, and we need to maintain them for the next few
decades. As he has outlined, there is a potential plan, but we cannot
guarantee that beyond 30 years. That is not to say that we will walk
away after 30 years, but we will come back to such issues as I continue
my speech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:18:31"></hs_TimeCode>.
Although we have made significant commitments, I know that the hon.
Gentleman is aware of the need to contain public expenditure. Central
Government funding is simply not sufficient to pay for everything that
would be worth while to some degree in flood management. As a result,
there will continue to be stiff competition for Government funding, and
we must ensure that we get the best value for money for the
taxpayers’
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:18:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000130">The
Environment Agency’s capital programme currently provides an
average of at least £8 of benefits in damages avoided for every
pound invested in construction of defences. However, the benefits
realised are in fact even greater. Once the capital has been spent on
construction, the routine maintenance of those defences can provide 
<?notus-xml column=250?>an even higher rate of return. The agency estimates an average
benefit-cost ratio of 14 to 1 for its asset maintenance
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:19:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000131">It
is no longer the case that the Government fund only the cream of
projects with the very best benefit-cost ratios, while leaving other
worthwhile projects with nothing. In 2011, we introduced partnership
funding to ensure that a fair portion of DEFRA funding can be made
available for any worthwhile improvement
scheme.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:19:59"></hs_TimeCode> That
inevitably means that not all Government-funded schemes are fully
funded. The new approach ensures that investment in flood management is
not constrained by what the Government alone can afford, thereby
increasing certainty and transparency on the level of DEFRA funding for
projects, leveraging further investment towards worthwhile projects,
allowing greater local ownership and choice, and encouraging more
cost-effective solutions. That is just the approach that the hon.
Gentleman’s constituents are keen to

far, partnership funding has brought forward up to £148 million
in external funding over the four years to 2015, compared with
£13 million during the previous three years. That huge increase
in match funding is helping those projects, which were perhaps slightly
less attractive initially, into
development<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:20:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000133">Early
indications suggest that up to 25% more schemes will go ahead in the
coming years than if project costs were met by central Government
alone. That is relevant to the hon. Gentleman’s case because a
partnership approach is clearly needed to manage the flood risk in such
areas. The work of the Environment Agency and other risk-management
authorities in the shoreline management plan has highlighted that
issue. Further hydraulic modelling and more detailed economic appraisal
commissioned by the agency has clarified the fact that the most
effective option is not managed realignment but maintaining the
existing line of defences for as long as it is feasible to do so. We
are then back to the cost of doing that beyond the 30-year
period<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:21:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000134">The
defences will eventually need to be rebuilt. They can be patched for
only so long, and it seems unlikely that central Government funding
will be able to meet the full cost of those projects. The Environment
Agency has told me that it estimates that the defences will need to be
rebuilt at the end of that period. In the meantime, I understand that
the agency’s recommended policy is to continue to maintain the
defences, subject to the availability of
funding.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000135">I
have already explained the priority the Government place on flood
management and the resources they have secured to demonstrate that
commitment. However, I cannot tell the hon. Gentleman what the funding
situation will be in 30 years’ time. I have highlighted the
competition that already exists for that funding. The geography of the
area means that, although the maintenance and renewal of the defences
is economic, the case for investment to improve the defences may not be
so great as in some other areas, including areas elsewhere in his
constituency that, as he points out, are about to receive significant
investment. In such situations, the community cannot assume that the
taxpayer will guarantee the full cost of maintaining and improving the
defences, so there will need to be a partnership. Any local
arrangements that reduce the cost of maintaining and improving the
defences, or raise contributions from other sources, will help to

hon. Gentleman has highlighted a number of solutions suggested by the
community. His first question was on why areas are considered
separately. Bluntly, it is because there are different risks in
different areas. Some flood risks are linked to river catchments, and
some are connected to topography and its interaction with the sea, so
there are a number of solutions for different areas. Cost-benefit
ratios have to be considered in relation to the number of families and
homes at risk. All of those things are considered alongside each other,
so they are not held entirely in isolation. We have to consider
individual
schemes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:23:19"></hs_TimeCode>. In

criminal justice agencies in the centre—the police, probation,
Crown Prosecution Service and youth offending teams—is an
important part of its approach, but there is more. Crucial support
services—dealing with, for example, drugs, debt, financial
problems generally, victim and witness support and antisocial
behaviour—all working together are critical, as is vital family
support. It is a uniquely holistic service.</hs_Para>

centre has been privileged to be served by two outstanding judges with
their colleagues—his honour Judge Fletcher, and from December
2012, Judge Clancy. The writing has been on the wall for some time,
before the Government’s hasty consultation on closure, which
took place in six rushed weeks over the summer recess. The answer to my
parliamentary question about the issue on 9 September showed that the
centre’s fate was sealed, and the Government have now announced
that it is to close.</hs_Para>

reasoning on which the closure is based fails in two fundamental
respects. The Government’s key argument is that the cost of the
centre does not justify its continuation.
First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:58:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:00:36"></hs_TimeCode>,
the Government’s claim that it has failed to  
<?notus-xml column=254?>address crime successfully is deeply flawed. Crime rates in north
Liverpool, which is the area covered by the centre, fell by 7.2%
between 2005 and 2010—much more than elsewhere in Liverpool, and
much more than elsewhere across the country. It must be remembered that
the centre hears a high proportion of serious crimes. Some 88.1% of
cases involve violence against the person, while the national average
for cases of that sort is 47.8%. That makes its success even more
notable. Its important work in addressing antisocial behaviour—a
demand of the local community to address that—is simply ignored
in the assessment. That work is vital to the community, yet it does not
feature in the judgment on the centre’s future.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102965000155" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000155">Secondly, and
inexplicably, there has been no assessment of the centre’s key
aim of conducting preventive work and supporting the community through
its inter-agency approach. That failure is incomprehensible, as
prevention of crime and supporting the community was a major objective
of the centre from the very beginning. Its outstanding work on victim
and witness support has resulted in, for example, a 90% to 100%
successful conviction rate in cases of domestic violence. However, that
outstanding work has been ignored, and I understand that with the
centre’s closure, the person who has been doing that
work—someone who has received national awards for their
success—will cease doing
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:58:50"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T16:59:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000156" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000156"><Member ContinuationText="Steve Rotheram" PimsId="5632" UID="13102965000261" xid="1123" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000261"><B>Steve

decision to close the centre was an important one, based on the hard
truth that the local drop in work load and the high cost of running
what is a single courtroom centre have made it untenable. Following the
public consultation on the centre’s future, I announced in a
written ministerial statement last week the decision to close the
centre. Currently, it is planned that the last sitting day will be
Friday 28 March 2014. To keep the centre running would cost almost
£1 million a year, and there is no evidence that that would be
money well spent in terms of the results that it achieves compared with
other
courts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:05:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000172">My

lightly. He did so after a detailed analysis of the centre’s
work and of all the points raised in the consultation responses. The
consultation did not identify any single operational or efficiency
reason why the centre should not
close<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:06:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000173" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000173">I
stress that we are committed to continuing to provide court users in
north Liverpool with effective access to justice, while seeking ways to
do so at a lower cost and alongside our efforts to improve the
efficiency of the justice system as a whole. In transferring the
majority of the centre’s work load to Sefton magistrates court,
we have been clear that the principles of the centre will be maintained
and at a court that has modern facilities and a reputation for
innovation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:06:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000174">The
North Liverpool community justice centre was established in 2005 as a
court and community resource, with criminal justice agencies co-located
with other third sector services in a dedicated building. The centre
serves an area with a population of about 60,000 people in the north
end of the city of
Liverpool<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:07:14"></hs_TimeCode>. The
original intention was to provide an intensive approach to the crimes
affecting the community at a very local level for both adult and youth
cases. When it was launched in 2005, the centre’s objectives
included the provision of community justice in a deprived area of
Merseyside and, through that, a material reduction in reoffending
levels through the adoption of innovative approaches to the handling of
offenders and very close cross-agency working with both public and
third sector
organisations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:07:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000175">There
is no doubt that the centre rapidly built a good reputation, both
locally and internationally, for developing a new approach to
court-based problem solving for offenders. However, following an
evaluation published in 2012, it is equally clear that the success of
the centre in terms of results was at best mixed. There was no
empirical evidence to show that the centre was any more successful at
reducing reoffending levels than a mainstream magistrates
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:08:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

and given the financial climate, the then ministerial team questioned
the value for taxpayers’ money that the centre provided and
concluded that it should continue as a court for up to two years, but
with a view to increasing its work load and remit. That was vital when
the centre’s own catchment area work load was falling
significantly, in line with that of other magistrates courts. The
increase in work load has been achieved only to a limited extent, with
the transfer of mental health cases from a wider catchment area to the
centre. As a result, the number of cases heard at the centre has
increased during the past six
months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:09:02"></hs_TimeCode>. For the
12-month period to March of this year, the centre’s courtroom
utilisation rate stood at 55%. Between April and July of this year,
that increased to an average of 71% through the hearing of mental
health cases. However, despite that increase, the actual work load in
volume terms remains relatively
low.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000177"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:09:28"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Rotheram" PimsId="5632" UID="13102965000269" xid="1123" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000269">Steve

Vara:</Member></B> As I shall come on to say, Sefton magistrates court
offers a number of the services that are provided at the centre.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:10:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Liverpool, Riverside referred to various co-located agencies, and I
assure her that Sefton magistrates court has probation services, a
citizens advice bureau and victim and witness support services, among
others. The services that are being provided are to be relocated 1.8
miles away to another centre, which will provide the same level of
service. I will refer later to the extent that any difference is
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000181" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000181">As
I was saying, despite the increase in utilisation, the work load in
volume terms remains relatively low and would continue so as a single
courtroom site. For example, since April the centre has dealt with an
average of 168 cases a month, which compares unfavourably with Sefton
magistrates court, where the majority of cases will go. Over the same
period, Sefton dealt with 467 cases a month. Due to the limited cell
capacity at the centre, it is not feasible to transfer in any more
custody work to increase
utilisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:11:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000182">A
key driver in the decision to close the centre was the fact that there
are real limitations to the volume of cases it can deal with as a
single courtroom site, and it is three times more expensive than other
courts. Furthermore, it is not more successful at reducing reoffending
than cheaper courts, so it simply cannot be seen to represent good
value for
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:11:52"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102965000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000183"><B><Member ContinuationText="Steve Rotheram" PimsId="5632" UID="13102965000271" xid="1123" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/halltext/131029h0002.htm#13102965000271">Steve
Rotheram:</Member></B> The Minister claims that the centre is not more
successful, but that is not the information that has been provided to
us—I will get the report and dig the relevant section out. The
Deputy Prime Minister, who talked about prisons being “colleges
of crime”, and the Prime Minister, who talked about a
“rehabilitation revolution”, should have been looking at
the centre as a model to take to other areas. What will it cost the 
<?notus-xml column=258?>Exchequer to send the prolific reoffenders that the centre deals with
properly back to prison, because they will no longer be benefiting from

outcome of the consultation is to proceed with plans for closure of the

points about work load and courtroom utilisation, plus the high running
costs of the centre, were set out in the initial consultation document
and in the consultation response document published last week.
Moreover, the criminal justice agencies have reduced the number of
people based at the centre, in line with the decrease in work and to
meet their changing operational needs. For example, the Crown
Prosecution Service has reduced its presence significantly and is now
supporting the centre’s cases in the same way as it would in a
mainstream court, as opposed to providing dedicated prosecutors and
service levels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-29T17:14:27"></hs_TimeCode>,

court’s problem-solving approach is built on the principles of

the other agencies were decreasing the support that they were giving.
That is not to say that that may continue at Sefton, but I assure her
that as we speak, other co-located agencies are present there, which I
hope will continue to deliver services. However, it would be wrong for
me to give a promise based on the declining number of people at the

The Electoral Commission has today published its statutory assessment
of the referendum question contained in the European Union (Referendum)
Bill ('the Bill'), which was introduced to the House of Commons as a
Private Members Bill by the hon. Member for Stockton South (James
Wharton) on 19 June
2013.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000029" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000029">The
Commission has a statutory obligation under section 104 of the
Political Parties, Elections and Referendum Act (PPERA) 2000 to
consider the wording of the question in any referendum Bill that is
introduced to the UK Parliament and to publish a statement on its views
on the intelligibility of that question. The question currently
contained in the Bill is: 'Do you think that the United Kingdom should
be a member of the European
Union?'</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000030">When
assessing a referendum question, the Commission's assessment guidelines
say that the question should be clear and simple. It should be easy to
understand, to the point and not ambiguous. The Commission has a
well-established process for making this assessment, which includes
undertaking public opinion research through focus groups and one-to-one
interviews, writing to interested individuals and groups to ask their
views and seeking advice from experts on plain language and
accessibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000031" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000031">Having
completed this process, the Commission has concluded that the wording
of the proposed question itself is brief, uses straightforward
language, and is easy to understand and answer. However they also
found  it could be improved, in particular to reduce the
risk  of misunderstanding or ambiguity about the current 
<?notus-xml column=37?>membership status of the UK within the EU. It therefore recommends that
the question should be amended to make it more direct and to the point,
and to improve clarity and
understanding.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000032">The
Commission's consultation, analysis and research with the public has
not, however, identified a single preferred wording for the question.
Because of the complexity of the issues covered by this referendum
question, its research suggests that currently, in the context of a
referendum on the UK's membership of the EU, a question using 'Yes'
and' No' as response options would not be able to fully resolve those
issues. The Commission's recommendations therefore highlight an
important decision for Parliament, as to whether to retain or move away
from the UK’s recent experience of referendum questions using
'Yes' and 'No'
responses.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000033">If
Parliament wishes to retain the use of 'Yes' and 'No' as response
options, then the Commission recommends that the referendum question
should be amended to: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the
European
Union?'</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000034">However,
the Commission's research suggests that some people will perceive
either positive or negative associations with the phrase 'remain a
member of the European Union', although there was no evidence that this
wording resulted in research participants changing their voting
preference in any way. If Parliament decides not to retain a referendum
question which uses 'Yes' and 'No' as response options, having taken
into account the risk of a perception of bias which might be associated
with that approach, then the Commission recommends amending the
question to: 'Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European
Union or leave the European Union?' with 'Remain a member of the
European Union' and 'Leave the European Union' as response
options.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000035">This
alternative version of the referendum question wording was also tested
in its research with the public and was considered the most neutral of
the questions tested. However, the Commission did not explore the
impact of variations to the specific wording of the question and
responses, nor did it receive views from would-be referendum campaign
organisations about this approach. If Parliament amended the Bill in
this way, the Commission would therefore need to undertake a further
assessment of the intelligibility of the proposed wording, which it
would do as quickly as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000036">The
Bill also makes provision for a Welsh version of the referendum
question to be included on the ballot paper, although a Welsh
translation of the question was not included in the Bill as introduced.
Following a request from the hon. Member for Stockton South, and in
line with its Welsh Language Scheme, the Commission has also tested as
part of its assessment process a translation of the question included
in the Bill in Welsh. It is recommending that if the version of the
question included on the ballot paper in Welsh is the amended yes/no
question, it should be: 'A ddylai'r Deyrnas Unedig ddal i fod yn aelod
o'r Undeb Ewropeaidd?' If Parliament decides not to retain the 'Yes'
and 'No' question and the question included in the ballot paper in
Welsh is the alternative question recommended, then it should be:
“A ddylai'r Deyrnas Unedig bara i fod yn aelod o'r Undeb
Ewropeaidd neu adael yr Undeb Ewropeaidd? Should the United Kingdom
remain a member of the European Union or leave the European
Union?”</hs_Para>

total of 3,180 people and organisations completed the online survey and
a number of organisations sent written representations. In summary,
some 91% of respondents considered that maximum penalties should be
increased. 83% thought there should be an increase for injury to an
assistance dog or a person, 69% for the death of an assistance dog, and
76% for the death of a
person.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102961000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/wmstext/131029m0001.htm#13102961000041">In
coming to a decision on new maximum penalties for dog attacks, we have
taken into account the responses to the consultation and the need for
maximum penalties to be proportionate to the offence. We have also
compared the current maximum penalty with the maximum penalties for
other offences. The maximum penalty of causing death by dangerous
driving is 14 years’ imprisonment and the maximum penalty for
causing actual bodily harm is 5 years’ imprisonment. Anyone who
deliberately sets their dog on a person and kills them—in effect
using their dog as a weapon—could be charged with murder or
manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The
Government propose, therefore, to increase the maximum penalties for
aggravated offences under section 3 of the 1991 Act in England and

repairing fencing to their property to prevent the dog escaping, and

Brokenshire</Member></B><I> [holding answer 24 October 2013]:</I> The
UK meets all the requirements of the Framework Decision through
existing domestic law. We have no specific criminal offences of
publicly condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide;
crimes against humanity; war crimes; and crimes against peace when
carried out in a manner likely to incite to violence or hatred (as
referred to in Article 1 (1) (c) and (d) of the Framework Decision).
Any conduct that seeks to incite violence or hatred however is likely
to amount to an offence under existing incitement to hatred legislation
in the
UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102980000536" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/text/131029w0001.htm#13102980000536">As
the UK has opted out of this measure, there is no likelihood that the
UK will need to legislate further around Article 1. It is important to
note that on 1 December 2014 the UK will have the power to
change legislation on this matter in our Parliament. At the moment,
there is currently no intention to change provisions of UK
law.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102980000022" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/text/131029w0001.htm#13102980000022">Firearms:

back to life, revitalising high streets and providing much-needed
homes. We have also confirmed our intention to amend the Community
Infrastructure Levy Regulations to make it easier to bring vacant shops
and other town centre units back into use without becoming liable for
the levy. These changes will help town centre landlords make better use
of their empty properties, get more start-up businesses set up in the

recognises the important role of airports across the UK in providing
air connectivity and their vital contribution to regional economic
growth. We support making best use of airports such as Liverpool John
Lennon, subject to the appropriate management of local environmental
impacts. The independent Airports Commission's remit requires it to
maintain a UK-wide perspective in proposing how the UK should maintain
its position as Europe's most important aviation hub. The Government's
“UK Aviation Forecasts”, published in January 2013,
predict that passenger numbers at the airport will increase from 4.5

Goodwill:</Member></B> The non-compliant road tank vehicles were
manufactured by GRW Engineering (Pty) Ltd based in South Africa. The
quality of the welding and the hatches on top of the tank fall short of
the required standards and the bottom off-take nozzles need to be
re-fitted. The nature of these problems means that in day-to-day use,
these tankers present a low risk as evidenced by many years of safe
operation. The defects have been assessed to determine whether the
tankers could withstand a roll-over incident. Our preliminary finding
is that they may be more likely to rupture than a fully compliant
tanker. However, even a compliant tanker will not be able to withstand
a severe accident. These vehicles have been on the road for up to seven
years without incident and they would not be allowed to continue in
service if they presented an immediate
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102984000922" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131029/text/131029w0002.htm#13102984000922">The
tanks were inspected and certified by Bureau Veritas (South Africa), a
body that the UK competent authority has never appointed to undertake
those functions. Bureau Veritas (UK)'s appointment has been severely
restricted in scope but has not been withdrawn so that it can assist
with the re-certification of the GRW manufactured road tank vehicles
and service the needs of its existing customers. Its appointment is
kept under
review.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-29?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_29_PT_1/FD0FD4301569A98D356AC0D4D6C651FB3310F570" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="29 October 2013">Tuesday

Nevertheless, while many of the components for smart meters are likely
to be manufactured overseas, we expect factories in the UK to receive
substantial new orders to do the final assembly and technical
configuration for many millions of smart meters needed for the roll-out
of smart meters in Great Britain. To this end, the Government welcomed

phonics materials and training has been extended until October 2013. We
have made £2 million available to recruit 400 master teachers in

Lamb:</Member></B> European medicines legislation permits medicines to
contain colours that are authorised for use in food. The European Food
Safety Authority is re-evaluating authorised food additives and any
change in the list of permitted additives will apply to medicines.
Existing European guidance on the use of colours in medicines states
that synthetic colouring agents should not be used in medicines for
paediatric use when only intended for aesthetic purposes. Although the
amount of colouring agents used in medicines is small in comparison
with foods, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency,
which is responsible for the authorisation of medicines for the United
Kingdom market, strongly encourages companies to avoid the addition of
colouring agents in paediatric medicines. This approach is supported by
new European guidance on paediatric medicines coming into force on 15
February 2014 which also makes clear that use of any colouring agent
must be justified.</hs_Para>

improving Alliance interoperability. For example, we are: leading five
of NATO's Smart Defence projects, which are open to Allies and Partners
(Maritime Surveillance; Counter Rocket, Artillery and Mortar fire;
Immersive Training Environments; Theatre Opening Capability; and
Defensive Aids Suite); participating in NATO's Connected Forces
Initiative, which, through exercises such as Live Exercise 2015 to
which the UK has committed significant forces, will practice Alliance
interoperability; continuing to participate in the NATO Response Force,
as we have done throughout 2013, which drives Allied and, where
appropriate, Partner interoperability; putting a greater emphasis on
NATO's defence planning outcomes; using NATO doctrine as our general
default position; and continuing to make a significant contribution to
NATO standardisation activities, an important cornerstone of
interoperability. The UK is also engaged in other initiatives that will
have interoperability benefits, including: the UK-inspired Northern
Group which brings 12 northern European Allies and Partners together;
the UK's emerging Joint Expeditionary Force concept which envisages our
forces training and operating with a small group of close nations; and
the UK/France Combined Joint Expeditionary Force being developed under
the Lancaster House
