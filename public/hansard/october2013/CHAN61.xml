because the fact is that on our energy bills is £112 of green

necessary to encourage renewable energy and what is necessary to go on
winning overseas investment into the UK, but how we can bear down on
people’s bills. It simply is the politics of the conman to
pretend that you can freeze prices when you are not in control of
global energy prices. The proper approach is to look at what is driving

right hon. Lady asked whether INEOS should have got around the table.
Throughout the dispute, I have personally been asking both sides to get
around the table. At one stage, INEOS was not prepared to go to ACAS. I
personally spoke to INEOS and persuaded it to go to ACAS, which it then
did, and I regret that those ACAS talks were not successful at avoiding
the situation that we have arrived at

right hon. Lady asked about the contingency plans that we put in place.
We have been working for a significant time to ensure that there were
contingency plans, should the disruption become any worse. As she 
<?notus-xml column=305?>knows, the refinery is currently closed down, but fuel is coming through
the refinery—refined fuel is being loaded from ships into the
plant and then on to racks to go into tankers. That is a part of our
contingency plans, but they are much more detailed and granular than
that. They go into minute detail about how we would ensure that
fuel—heating oil, road fuel and aviation fuel—is supplied
throughout Scotland, which is why I can say confidently that the people
of Scotland may be reassured that we will keep fuel going through that
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T12:40:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102348000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0001.htm#13102348000194">Finally,
the right hon. Lady asked about the review of refineries, and we expect
to have that—probably—by the end of the year. It is very
detailed and has been under way for some time. She will understand that
there has been a big switch in the way in which motorists use
fuel—away from petrol to diesel—but most refineries in
the UK produce petrol rather than diesel. We import a huge amount of
diesel, and that is one of a number of issues being considered in that
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102348000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0001.htm#13102348000195"><Member ContinuationText="Sir Malcolm Bruce" PimsId="2343" UID="13102348000392" xid="75" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0001.htm#13102348000392"><B>Sir

looking for the right approach to maintain the refinery capacity that
the UK needs. We have already seen—I think it was two years
ago—a refinery at Teesside closing, and recently there was the
situation at Coryton. Refineries in the UK and throughout Europe are
under severe pressure; their margins are very narrow and there are

that—the switch from petrol to diesel—but there are

that everyone in the House recognises the importance of the Grangemouth

there will be huge hole in the Scottish economy and the loss of the
refining capacity would have a serious implication for the UK. Does the
Secretary of State agree that two things are necessary? First, the
Government and the Scottish Government should do everything that they
can to try to persuade the employers to start negotiating again. It
would be a 
<?notus-xml column=307?>tragedy if we were to lose the plant as a result of it falling victim to
rhetoric that looks more like the 1970s than the industrial relations
we would expect today. Secondly, if that is not successful and INEOS is
determined to walk away, what steps will the Government and the
Scottish Government take together to try to find an alternative?

will be talking to Unite today, not just to tell it about the

Let us see what comes from those talks. Should they not be successful,
and should INEOS decide to walk away, of course we will be very much
involved in trying to find a future. The Scottish Government have a key
role for the petrochemicals plant in particular, and we will work with
them on that. A lot will depend on the process that the INEOS
management at the petrochemicals plant decides to follow. It says that
it will talk to liquidators, but it has other options, so we will be in
close contact with it as it develops those options. There may be
alternatives with INEOS’s involvement. Whatever happens, we will

potential for a tanker drivers’ dispute. I got very involved in
thinking about energy security with respect to transport fuels. The
Department has set up a unit that was not there before. When we talk
about energy security, we normally mean the security of the electricity
supply, but actually the issue is much wider than that. I have
personally given a lot more focus to that than previously, particularly
in respect of what the hon. Gentleman mentions—not just for
Scotland, but for the whole UK. The review of refinery capacity is part
of that, but only part; we have to look at a number of issues to make

that would be unwise. However, large complexes are needed to refine

unlikely to have such capital. Whether the hon. Gentleman or I like it

is Joe Chamberlain, founder of the first civic university with an
emphasis on business, who in November 1873, almost exactly 140 years
ago, accepted the nomination for mayor of Birmingham and began the
two-and-a-half year term of office that has been widely acclaimed as
the most outstanding mayoralty in English history. He municipalised
gas, which he allowed to make profits that would be ploughed back into
the city; municipalised water, which, as a public health good, was not
allowed to make a profit; initiated a massive housing programme; and,
together with George Dixon and others, established the principle of
free education in the city. He did so in two and a half years. We would
still be running pilot studies or requesting permission from
Westminster to do anything.</hs_Para>

most centrally controlled developed country in western Europe and,

year’s report by Lord Heseltine, “No stone unturned in
pursuit of growth”, made a powerful case for decentralising
economic powers. He looked at the various regional contributions to UK
gross value added over the last 30 years; it makes depressing reading.
In England, in London and the south-east, contributions have steadily
increased; in the east of England and the  
<?notus-xml column=315?>south-west they have remained roughly level; and in all the other
regions to the north of that line they have continued to decline.
Allowing the south to overheat and the midlands and the north to be
drained of energy is bad for the whole country. Central Government talk

Under-Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, the hon.
Member for Great Yarmouth (Brandon Lewis), who is on the Front Bench,
did not challenge that figure when I raised it earlier this week.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T13:14:07"></hs_TimeCode> Local
Government Association calculates that in the current Parliament local
government’s core funding will fall by 43%, and by 2020 there
will be a £15.6 billion funding gap. The future looks worse for
our core cities. For 2013-14, the difference is negligible, but for
2014-15 there is a forecast fall of 5% compared with a 3.4% fall
nationwide.</hs_Para>

Birmingham came to the Jubilee Room to show what the city has to offer:
food, music, ideas, energy and diversity. By the way, we still make
things in Birmingham. However, the future could look pretty bleak.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T13:15:08"></hs_TimeCode> a phone-in
from local residents conducted that morning, the three areas they said
they wanted local government to address were better transport, the
creation of jobs, and better regional co-operation. None of those
things can be done in a framework of short-term, unco-ordinated funding
cuts. Over the past three years, our spending power in Birmingham has
declined by 13% compared with a national average of 9.3%. There is
something not right when every man, woman and child in Birmingham has
had £149 taken from the money given by the Government, while
people in prosperous Wokingham in Berkshire lost just £19 a
head. That cannot be fair. Birmingham has calculated that from 2011 to
2017 it would need to find savings of £825
million—£210 million more than expected. Cuts of that
magnitude threaten the future viability of local government. At
present, only a third of Birmingham’s £1.3 billion budget
is controllable. The predicted shortfalls 
<?notus-xml column=316?>suggest that we will have a cut of two thirds in that one controllable
third of the budget.</hs_Para>

why are things so bad in Birmingham? First, cuts nationwide to local
authorities average £74 per person, while in Birmingham the
figure is £149. Secondly, there is a colossal revenue shortfall
created by keeping council tax rises artificially low for five
successive years—1.9% during the Tory years and
frozen for past two years. Thirdly, two thirds of the city’s
funding comes directly from central Government rather than taxation and
other sources—a much higher proportion than in most local
authorities.</hs_Para>

this Bill is not asking for money or putting a case of rural versus
urban; it is asking for a commission to be set up that addresses the
currently broken model for financing and running local government in
general, and our big cities in particular. The commission should be
guided by three principles. First, it must recognise the need for
financial stability and sustainability; money needs to be distributed
in a way that recognises the real needs and responsibilities
of our cities. Secondly, money raised in our cities should stay in
cities, releasing them to drive the growth and prosperity we will all
share. Thirdly, checks and balances should be provided to prevent any
one Government from unsettling the funding structure on a political
whim.</hs_Para>

referred at the outset to the Shankill bomb and the innocent people

his accomplice Sean Kelly was seriously injured. When convicted of this
heinous crime, Sean Kelly was given nine life sentences—one life
sentence for each life he had destroyed—yet under the early
release scheme that formed part of the Belfast agreement, Kelly was
released after serving just seven years in prison. That is less than
one year for each life that he destroyed that day on the Shankill

Michelle Williamson, whose father and mother were murdered by Sean

victims in just the same way as the nine innocent people who died that
day on the Shankill road are defined as victims is an outrage. It is an
affront to decency and the rule of law, and it is something that this
Parliament should act to change. For the sake of the nine innocent

speeches that were made on that day, most notably by the Sinn Fein
Member of the Legislative Assembly, Gerry Kelly, were undoubtedly
interpreted as a glorification of terrorism, and rightly so. Mr Kelly
was convicted of trying to blow up the Old Bailey in London in March
1973. In his speech, he asserted that his actions were not acts of
terrorism. I ask every Member of this House the following question: if
a gang that includes Mr Kelly plants a bomb outside a courthouse in a
public place and that bomb explodes, killing one person and injuring
more than 200 people, is that an act of terrorism or something else? My
understanding is that that is an act of terrorism as defined by the law
of the United Kingdom and international law.

second principle I want to be clear about is that there must be no
amnesty for the perpetrators of terrorist violence. Thirdly, as I have
already stated at length, the definition of a victim of the troubles in
Northern Ireland should exclude those who were killed or injured as a
result of engaging in an act of terrorism, or convicted of a
terrorist-related offence. We hope that that will be taken forward
either in this House, or through the Haass process. Fourthly, the
glorification of terrorism should not be facilitated or allowed, and if
the law needs to be strengthened in that regard, it should be
strengthened. This is a free country and a democracy, and we are proud
of freedom of speech, but there are times when we have to step in and
say that what people say and how they behave is irresponsible,
provocative and should
stop.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000069">The
Democratic Unionist party is strongly opposed to the establishment of
any kind of one-sided and unbalanced inquiry process. Any evidentiary
process such as a truth commission will inevitably focus on the state,
because the paramilitary organisations did not keep records or
documents and, as I have stated, are unlikely to tell the truth. Such a
process would create an unfair narrative of the past, in which the true
perpetrators of the vast majority of the deaths and
injuries—more than 90%—will seek to legitimise their
actions. They would not be held to account or held responsible for what
they have
done.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000070">The
needs of the victims and survivors must be met as far as possible.
Their loss and circumstances should be treated with respect and
sensitivity. They deserve and need proper recognition. Victims should
have the opportunity to tell their story without it having to be
intertwined with the voices of the perpetrators. Innocent victims
should be remembered through a significant act of remembrance and
commemoration, and, potentially, through a significant regional
memorial in Northern Ireland. That could take the form of a memorial
garden to the innocent victims of
terrorism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000071">In
conclusion, the narrative of the past should reflect core values,
including that terrorism was and is wrong, and that it is not a
legitimate method of obtaining a political or other objective. The
narrative must clearly reflect the fact that approximately 90% of the
deaths were the result of terrorist actions, and that the majority of
those were by republican groups, so we are very clear that we condemn
murder on all
sides.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000072">All
hon. Members have a responsibility to address the issues relating to
our troubled past. The Government have a responsibility—I hope
the Secretary of State tells us what role the Government will
play—and the process cannot be down to the political parties in
Northern Ireland. Equally, the Irish Government have a responsibility.
Some of the atrocities were committed in the Irish Republic; some were
committed by those acting from the territory of the Irish Republic. The
Irish Government have questions to answer about the arming of the IRA
in the early days of the troubles, their extradition policy, and their
failure at times to co-operate fully with the RUC
in a way that would have brought to justice those responsible for
terrorist actions in Northern Ireland. The Irish Government therefore
have a role and a responsibility in the
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000073">Finally,
I pay tribute to those who have served this country and protected the
community, whether they were in the Royal Ulster Constabulary or, as it
is today, 
<?notus-xml column=325?>the Police Service of Northern Ireland; in the armed forces and the
regiments that came faithfully to Northern Ireland to serve and protect
the community, some of whom are current Members of the House; or in the

Regiment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000074">It
is worth reminding the House that the RUC was awarded the George cross
by Her Majesty the Queen, as a recognition of the collective courage
and dedication to duty of all who served in the RUC and accepted the
danger and stress it brought to them and their families. The Ulster
Defence Regiment and the Royal Irish Regiment were awarded the
conspicuous gallantry cross by Her Majesty the Queen in recognition of
their valour and sacrifice over the years in Northern Ireland. It pains
me when I hear nationalist parties attacking the RUC, the UDR and the
Royal Irish Regiment in the way they do—without any balance in
their approach to the service that those men and women provided in
protecting the
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000075">I

the right hon. Gentleman reminded the House, and as we heard in Prime
Minister’s questions, the debate coincides with the anniversary
of one of the most appalling atrocities of Northern
Ireland’s past: the Shankill bomb, which had the tragic
consequences set out by the right hon. Gentleman. In the days following
the attack, my predecessor as Secretary of State for Northern Ireland,
my noble Friend Lord Mayhew, spoke in the House of the revulsion that
people felt at such a hideous and atrocious attack on people going
about their business on that Saturday morning 20 years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000078">I
echo those sentiments today, and repeat the long-standing position of
this and previous Governments that politically motivated violence, from
wherever it came, was never justified. The Government will not condone
attempts to glorify or legitimise acts of terrorism. We will never
treat the men and women of the police and the Army who acted with such
courage and self-sacrifice in upholding the rule of law as equivalent
to those who used terrorism to try to further their political
ends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000079">My

over the ensuing years, that dialogue did go forward, beginning with
the 1993 Downing street declaration and continuing with the 1998
Belfast agreement and its successors, and the basis was found for the
relative peace and stability that Northern Ireland enjoys
today.</hs_Para>

years on from the Shankill bomb, Northern Ireland has its own
inclusive, devolved Administration. Whatever the imperfections of the
devolved institutions, they are a vast improvement on what went before.
Relations within these islands—both between north and south, and
between London and Dublin—have never been stronger, with both
Governments determined to work closely together on the economic and
other challenges our two countries face. The main paramilitary
campaigns that led to more than 3,500 lost lives and such widespread
and tragic suffering, which we have heard about this afternoon, have
come to an end. Lethal though they are, the people who continue to seek
to pursue their aims through violence are small in number and enjoy
almost no public support
whatever.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000082">The
transformation that has taken place over the past 15 years is a great
testimony to the leadership and courage shown by so many of Northern
Ireland’s political leaders, a number of whom are in the
Chamber. It also vividly demonstrates the power of dialogue as a means
of dealing with problems that were previously viewed as intractable.
Yet, for all the progress, there is no doubt that the legacy of the
past continues to cast a shadow and have an impact on today’s
Northern Ireland. I see that whenever I meet victims of terrorism, as I
did, for example, in Castlederg just a few weeks ago. I also see it
when I meet those who believe that the unjustified actions of the state
robbed them of their loved ones. All of them have highly personal tales
of tragedy, and it is impossible not to be moved by their
stories.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000083">It
is therefore not surprising that there are calls from a number of
quarters in Northern Ireland for a mechanism or process to be initiated
to deal with the past and grapple with the questions outlined today by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T13:58:27"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Lagan Valley. I agree with him that, in taking forward that
process, we must put the needs of victims at its heart. He is right to
look at the options that involve enabling victims to tell their
stories, so that the facts of what happened to them are on record and
never
forgotten.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000084" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000084">Numerous
attempts have been made in the 15 years since the 1998 agreement to
come up with a so-called overarching process on the past. In 2008, the
previous Government established the consultative group on the past
under the chairmanship of Lord Eames and Denis Bradley. On coming to
office, my predecessor as Secretary of State published a summary of the
responses to Eames-Bradley and embarked on an extensive round of
meetings with Northern Ireland’s political parties, victims
groups and other interested bodies. Since becoming Secretary of State
just over a year ago, I have had wide-ranging discussions on the
subject both within Northern Ireland and with the Irish
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000085">However,
so far, none of the initiatives by either the previous Government or
the current one has succeeded in establishing a consensus on how best
to take things forward. That is certainly not to say that nothing is
happening on the past—far from it. As well as a host of local
and oral history projects and the tireless work by the voluntary sector
in supporting victims, there are initiatives such as the CAIN archive
at the university of Ulster, the renowned collection at the Linen Hall
library, and thousands of hours of historical footage held by the BBC
and Ulster Television. In fact, given the wealth of archive material
available, Northern Ireland’s troubles are probably one of the
most comprehensively recorded and documented periods in
history<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:00:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

our part, the Government are committed to accelerating the release of
state papers, so we are moving from the 30-year rule to a 20-year rule,
although this will always have to be done in a way that is sensitive
to the article 2 rights of all parties and to national
security considerations. We are working with the Irish Government on
the decade of centenaries that is now under way. Both Governments want
to use the forthcoming anniversaries to promote mutual respect and
understanding between different traditions, and to prevent them from
being exploited by those intent on causing division and conflict. We
continue to support the work being done in the devolved sphere, for
example by the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland, the Historical
Enquiries Team and the Victims’ Commissioner. The Government
have been fully prepared to apologise where the state has failed to
uphold the highest standards of conduct. That has been done in the
cases of Claudy, Patrick Finucane and, of course, Bloody Sunday, where
the Prime Minister acknowledged to the House in the frankest of terms
that what happened that day in Londonderry in 1972 was
“unjustified and
unjustifiable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:01:31"></hs_TimeCode>.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000087">There
is no doubt that some want a broader initiative, a so-called
“overarching” process, and they have asked the Government
to deliver it. I understand that, and of course the UK Government are
prepared to play their part in dealing with legacy issues, but I am
also very clear that we do not own the past. The reality is that for
any process to succeed it must command a substantial consensus among
the Northern Ireland political parties and across the wider
community.</hs_Para>

Government strongly welcome the initiative by the five parties in the
Northern Ireland Executive to begin to take local ownership of this
issue through the establishment of the Richard Haass working group on
flags, emblems, parades and the past. While not formally part of this
group, the Government are fully engaged with it. I and my officials
have had a number of meetings and discussions with Dr Haass and his
team, and I am seeing him again next week. Last Thursday, Dr Haass had
talks in Downing street where he met the Prime Minister and the Deputy
Prime Minister, who gave their full backing to the crucial task that Dr
Haass has undertaken. It is clear that the Haass talks are
dealing with some of Northern Ireland’s most difficult and
long-standing fault lines and there is no guarantee
of
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:02:47"></hs_TimeCode>, but I
believe that there is a genuine willingness on the part of Northern
Ireland’s political leadership to make progress. From my
discussions with Dr Haass, I believe that there is no better person to
help achieve that. With 12 months of protests and tensions around flags
and parades, it is essential that progress is
made<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102350000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102350000089">While
the focus of today’s short debate is about dealing with the
past, it is also important that we do not lose sight of the overriding
need to build a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland. That is
particularly true on the economy and on building a shared society that
is no longer blighted by the sectarian divisions that have caused so
much damage over the years, both areas on which the Government are
working very closely with the Executive. As I have made clear, progress
cannot await the outcome of the Haass talks; it is vital that momentum
is maintained<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:03:39"></hs_TimeCode>.
On the economy, there are now clear signs that, like the rest of the

growing,

is much more that needs to be done, which is why the Government and the
Executive are pressing ahead with implementing the economic package we
signed in Downing street in June, and on which we jointly published an

I attended a highly successful international investment conference at
Titanic Belfast, where senior business figures from across the world

last week when the First Minister of Northern Ireland broke new ground

Irrespective of the many continued challenges, we have a shared

no mistake: on the whole, Northern Ireland is on the up. Most recently,
we saw the successful investment conference in Belfast, and in 2013
alone, Northern Ireland has hosted some of the most important global
political, cultural and sporting events. The G8 summit was held in the
beautiful surroundings of Lough Erne, while the 10-day world police and
fire games, the third-largest sporting event in the world, which
attracted competitors and supporters from around the globe, was hosted
in Belfast for the first time. Moreover, Derry-Londonderry was
designated the UK’s inaugural city of
culture<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:13:23"></hs_TimeCode>.

that remarkable progress, however, significant challenges remain and we
cannot afford to be complacent. The disgraceful scenes of rioting that
we witnessed over flags in the early part of the year and over parades
in the summer, and the terrible murders of two weeks ago, are a
reminder that deep wounds still exist and that the legacy of the past
continues to afflict communities in Northern Ireland. In that context,
it is important that we pay tribute to the courageous work of the men
and women of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, who do such an
important job on the front
line.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000067">As

violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:14:08"></hs_TimeCode> can
never be condoned. It is unacceptable and should be condemned by
politicians from all parties and all community leaders. We have
welcomed the all-party Haass talks as a crucial opportunity to address
the contentious issues of flags, parades and the past. It is essential
that these talks lead to meaningful progress and action that has the
confidence of the vast 
<?notus-xml column=331?>majority in all communities. That will require not only courageous and
visionary political leadership from Northern Irish politicians, but the
active and consistent engagement of the UK and Irish Governments. It
therefore remains a source of serious concern that too many people in
Northern Ireland feel that the present UK Government are insufficiently
engaged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:14:57"></hs_TimeCode>.
Engagement is essential, given the need for recognition of the
responsibility the UK Government have for their role in the troubles

financial and legislative implications that, ultimately, will require
their support.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:20:00"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Lagan Valley said, any process must put victims and their
families centre stage, while recognising that they will have different
views and needs—I have learned that during my first couple of
weeks in the role. One of the most powerful meetings I had during my
visit to Belfast was with representatives of the families of victims
who disappeared during the troubles—they have been described as
“the disappeared”. As a result of the peace process, the
families I met have had their loved ones returned and have been able to
lay them to rest. They told me of not only their pain and trauma, but
their desire not to pursue further action against those responsible.
However, I am acutely aware that some families have still not
experienced similar closure and that others may feel very differently
about those responsible. I intend to meet and hear directly from
victims and survivors from all backgrounds, as well as from their
families and those who care for them. Their stories deserve to be heard

the potential to be the breeding ground for extremists, and for
perpetual conflict and instability. Although those issues are primarily
the responsibility of the Northern Ireland Executive, the UK Government

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:27:15"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson), who has been a friend of mine
for many years, for the way in which he introduced the debate. I think
that the whole House will have found it extremely moving and very sad
when he read out the names, ages and family connections of those
murdered 20 years ago today—it really reminds us of what a
terrible time in Northern Ireland we have seen. I would like to add my
sympathies and condolences to all those who survived that attack and
lived with the pain of it—it is unimaginable what they went
through then and what they are still going through.</hs_Para>

last year, I visited Enniskillen with
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:27:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Vauxhall (Kate Hoey) for the 25-year anniversary commemoration of
another terrible atrocity. I was in Dundalk the day the bomb went off
at Omagh and have since visited Omagh three times. I have also met the
families in relation to the events at Kingsmill and Ballymurphy, and
the Finucane murder. Terrible though those atrocities were, it is worth
remembering that they all took place some time ago and since then
enormous progress has been made in Northern Ireland—it is very
important to remember that. We have seen Her Majesty the Queen pay an
outstanding, historic visit to not only the Republic of Ireland, but to
Northern Ireland, when she shook hands
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:28:53"></hs_TimeCode> Martin
McGuinness and many other people. We have also seen power sharing and
several important events in Northern Ireland which have been referred
to already: for example, the G8 meeting was held there and Londonderry
is the city of culture. There are many tourism opportunities in
Northern Ireland, such as Giant’s causeway and the Titanic
centre—there are very many reasons to go to Northern Ireland. We
have seen so many changes, even just over the years I have been going
there.</hs_Para>

is also right to say that challenges remain, however. There is
unfinished business in Northern Ireland and sadly it is still, in some
ways, a divided society. For example, there are more peace walls there
now than there were 10 years ago, which cannot be a good thing. There
are still dissidents attempting to murder members of the security
forces and, over the summer and during the flag protests at the end of
last year, we saw so-called loyalists throwing bricks at police
officers. That simply cannot be right.</hs_Para>

has been done, but this debate is about dealing with the past. How do
we deal with the past? Can we ever do it successfully? There has been a
call for an inquiry to be held into the Omagh atrocity, and there are
powerful arguments for doing so, but there are also people who do not
want such an inquiry because it would bring back the pain and rake over
the past. It would risk prolonging the pain.</hs_Para>

the only way to deal with the past is to build a better future. Since
2010, the Select Committee, which I have the honour of chairing, has
been concentrating on the future. For example, it has been inquiring
into and making recommendations on economic matters such as corporation
tax and air passenger duty—which we shall discuss in a short
while—in an attempt to cement the peace that has been achieved
by building a better economy, and by giving people greater
opportunities and allowing them to feel that the peace process has been
worth while for them. This is about building a Province that is very
different for present and future generations from what it was in the
past.</hs_Para>

issue that the Committee cannot look into in any detail, because it is
devolved, is that of education and schooling. I believe, however, that
we need to make more progress on integrated education. We need to bring
children together at the age of four, rather than separating them and
allowing them to live separate lives. We need to show them that there
is no difference between a Catholic and a Protestant, and that what
differentiates us is the way we behave rather than the labels that are

was right in the sense that we should learn from past mistakes, either
as individuals or collectively as a community, in order to ensure that
they are not passed down to be repeated by a further generation.
Perhaps because of the immediacy of the troubles in Northern Ireland,
however, we have not yet reached the stage where we can describe the
past as another country or as something foreign; it is not. There are
tens of thousands of people, including hundreds of my own constituents,
who live with the trauma caused by past events. They have lost loved
ones—fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, husbands,
wives—to the conflict, and that legacy of hurt is enduring,
despite the progress made over the last decade or
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:41:01"></hs_TimeCode>. We owe it to
our fellow citizens to ensure that they are at the heart of the
transformation process that our society is undertaking. They cannot be
left
behind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:41:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000112">In
every sphere of life, people see things from different perspectives. If
we ask two people to describe an event they both witnessed, we will
often get two very different descriptions of it. If we did not, there
would be no need for football commentators or current affairs
television shows. This is especially the case in historical debate and
discussion.</hs_Para>

the premier of the People’s Republic of China, whose name I will
not try to pronounce, was asked about the impact of the French
revolution, he famously declared that it was “too early to
say”—some 200 years after the event. We were tasked with
addressing issues that happened within the living memory of most people
in Northern Ireland. History is, and always will be, a contested field,
and there will never be any agreed interpretation of historical events.
This is the case in every society. In that regard, Northern Ireland is
no different.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102356000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000114">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:42:39"></hs_TimeCode>
there are differences of emphasis and differences of approach to the
interpretation of past events that occurred in Northern Ireland, I
believe it essential to establish a basic framework of first
principles. Truth is not a relative concept; it exists independently of
historical visions or approaches. Without the establishment and
widespread acceptance of such truth, we cannot 
<?notus-xml column=338?>adequately hope to address the legacy of pain and suffering that still
exist in our society as a consequence of past events.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102356000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000115"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:43:10"></hs_TimeCode>The
first and most obvious statement of truth is that not everyone in
Northern Ireland is a victim. There are some who would seek to claim
that every single person in our country is a victim. That is an
insidious concept for two reasons. First, it diminishes the genuine
suffering and pain of those who were directly affected by the actions
of terrorists during the troubles. Secondly, it elevates those who
engaged in criminal acts to equal status with those whose suffering
they caused in the first place. Terrorists of whatever variety or hue
do not exist on the same moral plane as those whom they terrorised.
They cannot ever enjoy such
standing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:43:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000116">Secondly,
although general attitudes in society shape people’s outlook and
perspective, we must accept that people are ultimately individuals and
that, as such, they must be responsible for their individual actions.
Society, even one as divided and conflict-riven as Northern Ireland
was, did not make people engage in murder or other such crimes. While
we are not all victims, we are also not all collectively responsible
for the actions of terrorists. No one made Sean Kelly and Thomas Begley
plant a bomb on the Shankill road that murdered nine innocent people,
as we have already heard, and ultimately cost Mr Begley his own life.
That applies to any other atrocity carried out by either side of the
community in Northern Ireland. To latch on to the concept of society
and to use it to justify such barbaric acts is a measure designed only
to placate the conscience of evil people and to lay the blame for their
actions at the door of the huge majority of the citizens of Northern
Ireland. That is much like a wife-beater saying that his unfortunate
spouse made him do it. For terrorists to blame society is a lazy
get-out clause, with no moral basis at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000117">The
third principle we must adhere to is that those who engaged in armed
insurrection against the state are in no position to demand the
recovery of openness and truth from anyone while they lie about what
they did. We have reached the absurd point in Northern Ireland today
where the President of Sinn Fein would seek to deny he ever was a
member of the Provisional IRA, yet would then with a straight face
demand truth and honesty from the state. People cannot lie through
their teeth while at the same time demanding truth. It is time that
Sinn Fein grew up and accepted the fact that they will never—I
say never—be allowed to rewrite the history of Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:46:26"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:46:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000118">You
will be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the intensive talks process
involving Dr Richard Haass is currently under way in the Province. I
suspect that of all the challenges he faces, dealing with the legacy of
the past will be the greatest, but I believe it is essential that we do
so in a way that is victim-centred and founded on principles that are
rooted in justice, honesty and the
truth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:47:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13102356000429" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000429">2.47

hon. Member for Bury South (Mr Lewis) on his new post as
shadow Front-Bench spokesman on

for a very long time, but only because it would help him to gain a
better understanding of what happens in Northern Ireland. I have been a
member of the Northern Ireland Select Committee for the last
three years, and I certainly think I have a better understanding now
than I did beforehand. Let me also pay tribute to the previous Minister
of State in the Northern Ireland Office, who has now gone to the
Department for Work and Pensions. He was incredibly helpful to me and
did a very good job. I know that his successor, the former Defence
Minister, will do an equally good job.</hs_Para>

I have said, I have been a member of the Northern Ireland Select

maimed. I attended a number of meetings with such families and I was
particularly struck by our meeting with the victims of
Kingsmill—a horrendous story. While visiting Northern Ireland, I
took the opportunity to look at some of the paperwork from historic
inquests. Reading some of these accounts of what happened—there
were lots of them—was incredibly moving.</hs_Para>

day after day, to do their duty. Risk is something that we normally do
not have to deal with, but the courage of people in the Royal Ulster

Northern Ireland was quite
breathtaking.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000123"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:49:42"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Oliver Colvile" PimsId="5610" UID="13102356000513" xid="1110" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000513">Oliver

riots in Northern Ireland were one of the main stories during the
summer, along with the flags issue. I welcome Dr Haass’s efforts
to find solutions, because I found the riots quite
appalling. On 12 July last year I visited Belfast and saw the loyalist
parade that was taking place. I learned a great deal from all that. I
witnessed some of the marching at first hand, and observed that a
number of Roman Catholics and nationalists found it difficult to

we are to find a solution to the past, we must recognise that Northern
Ireland now has a devolved Assembly with its own responsibilities. One
of the problems

difficulty of ensuring that she does not tread too much on what the

key issue is the feeling among some of those aged between 16 and 24
that they are not really involved in the peace process. They do not
understand it, and they do not have a sense of engagement with it. They
are the NEETs—those who are not in education, employment or
training. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:52:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), who is an
excellent chairman of the Northern Ireland Affairs Committee, made a
serious point about the importance of improving education and skills,
and it is in that connection that I have argued in the Committee that
it is time for a review of the progress made following the Belfast
agreement, or Good Friday agreement. I hope that Dr Haass will conduct
such a review, because it is the only way in which we shall be able to
reach come conclusions in regard to what else may
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:52:34"></hs_TimeCode>. Before I
was elected to the House, I ran a small public relations company which
advised developers on how to obtain help with public consultation. I
think there is a very big job to be done—the job of engaging
with small, deprived communities in order to understand what they are
up to. We need to think about the likely impact on those
youngsters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000129">Another
key issue is the need to rebalance the Northern Irish economy. A good
70% to 80% of people still work in the public sector, and I am sure
that they do an extremely good job, but I think that unless more people
in the private sector invest in the economy, things will be very
difficult. It is important for us to create opportunities and jobs if
we can possibly do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:53:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000130">We
must retain our commitment to striving for peace. I strongly support
the peace campaign, and also the work done by both Tony Blair and, more
importantly, John Major, who kicked off the whole peace process. Before
I became a member of the Select Committee, I was very much aware of
what was going on in South Africa, where there was the Truth and
Reconciliation Commission. That would not work in this instance,
because many people would feel intimidated by the idea of becoming
involved in such a process, and would fear for their own
futures.</hs_Para>

name of a local play park that the council had named after an IRA
hunger striker 10 years earlier. Our councillors genuinely believed
that if the name were allowed to remain, a line would be drawn in the
sand and no other public spaces would be similarly named in future. In
local terms, perhaps, that was a
pragmatic<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T14:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>
decision—it was, perhaps, understandable in terms of local
government. Our representatives acted entirely in good faith. They
reassured me, one and all, that it was neither in their thinking nor
was it their intention to cause hurt or distress to anyone. I want now

found wanting in generosity or determination to bring about a
comprehensive agreement that will be an example to divided communities

and Belfast traders would breathe a huge sigh of relief, if the
loyalist flag protesters called off their planned demonstrations in the
city in the run-up to Christmas and if the Orange Order agreed to call
a halt to its continuing irresponsible protests at Ardoyne, which are
resulting in a policing operation that the PSNI estimates is costing

it casts a long shadow in Northern Ireland. By far the best and most
coherent blueprint for tackling the past is the report of Lord Eames

Bradley carried out an immense amount of work, publishing a report that
ran to almost 200 pages and carried more than 30 main recommendations.

that that is one of the reasons why there have been so many
piecemeal attempts to try to get on top of the past. In some
ways, I think that Northern Ireland has succeeded. When compared with
the situation of only a few years ago, the recent progress has been
substantial, but the complexity of Northern Ireland, its past and the
troubles cannot be resolved easily or simply, because otherwise that
would have happened many years ago under the previous Government.

view is that that reason was used as an excuse to shelve the whole

the one hand, I am optimistic about the Haass initiative, which I think

pretty sure that not everyone will agree with all of them, as the day

diffuse and too incomplete to provide a comprehensive picture of all
the violations and abuses that occurred during the decades of political

my relatives and my relatives’ friends from both sides of the

there is often a lack of understanding and appreciation, and a sense of
“more evil was done to us than to you”. As someone

observation is that both sides in their own way are right and both
sides in their own way are wrong. That is the tragedy, and that is why
I tread delicately but sincerely. I treat with profound seriousness the
shadow role on Northern Ireland that I have in my party. I profoundly

I pay tribute to the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The RUC and the
security services had an incredibly difficult role, but they played an
incredibly important part in ultimately defeating terrorism. The Royal
Ulster Constabulary was not perfect in every way and the security
services were not perfect. Mistakes were made and a tiny proportion of
people clearly worked in the shadows, but overall, without the bravery
of the RUC and the security services, Northern Ireland would have lost
to terrorism, and that would have been wrong. Both my uncle and my
grandfather were in the RUC, and my uncle survived a couple of
assassination attempts. That demonstrates the importance of this debate
and the importance of Northern Ireland, because while my uncle and
grandfather were Catholic, the paradox is that, on the one hand, the
IRA tried to blow them up a couple of times and, on the other hand, a
section of the Loyalists would not trust them as far as they could
throw them. That sums up the challenges facing us in Northern

over the years, alongside the RUC/RUCR, GC, USC, UDR and RIR, did so
with valour and distinction. They rightly deserve our deep gratitude,
having faced gangsters and thugs who reigned over 30 years of terror on
a law-abiding population. We must never forget the sacrifice of our
security forces and their bravery. We must also never forget the
sacrifice of their families—mothers and fathers, sons and

deep sense of loss still felt in the hearts of many innocent victims of
violence across our Province today is raw, and no one except those who
have walked this dark and lonely path can understand the pain. But this
anguish has been made worse by the coat-trailing exercises of the
republican movement, and Sinn Fein in particular, over recent months.
The leader of my party has on many occasions gone out on a limb,
seeking to reach the hand of friendship to nationalists and republicans
in an effort to build a stronger community spirit and give the
generations to come a better future and a prosperous Province of which
we can all be proud. But, sadly, many Sinn Fein representatives just
cannot leave their failed past, while others pretend they
have—that is, of course, until the mask slips. Yes, some
politicians speak piously of a shared future, but in reality the proof
is that they cannot bear to see Orange feet walk the Queen’s
highway. They cannot even share a road in Belfast or Portadown for a
few minutes to allow a small contingent of Orangemen to walk home after
a day when Protestants celebrate their culture. The reality is that

Mr Robinson sought to build a peaceful future, Sinn Fein
representatives such as Gerry Kelly defied the law by hanging on to
police Land Rovers in north Belfast, and on another occasion, they
celebrated the escape from the Maze prison, in which a prison officer
was murdered. Sinn Fein coat-trailed through Castlederg and north
Belfast, lauding as heroes those who blew themselves up with their own
bombs, leaving a trail of innocent blood across the Province. Today
people gather to remember the slaughter of the innocent on the
Shankill, but no world attention will be focused on this event of

reality, the authorities here on the mainland, as well as international
Governments, have granted favoured status to those who murdered and
maimed, while the law-abiding people of Northern Ireland were left to
suffer and then told simply to move on. The Prime Minister made an
apology to the families in Londonderry. The media spent hours of air
time propagating one single event in the history of our Province just
as if no one else had endured any injustice over the years of turmoil
and trouble. No apology has been given to the law-abiding Unionist
majority for the years they were

kowtowed to, and wined and dined, Adams and McGuinness. Over the years,
I have wept and comforted many families of innocent victims, and I
carry in my heart deep wounds because of what the IRA has done.

IRA were terrorists, formed as an organisation with the aim of removing
the British from Northern Ireland and bringing about the unification of
Ireland by force. They were doomed to fail, not because the Governments
of the day stood up for the rights of the people, but because tens of
thousands of ordinary people were determined to remain part of the
United Kingdom and exercised their democratic right accordingly. Do not
forget that Ministers from the Fianna Fail governing party in the Irish
Republic diverted funds intended as emergency aid illegally to import
weapons directly for the provos. Surely it is time for an unreserved
apology from the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic for the actions
of a former Government who helped to spawn and support IRA terrorist
gangs. An apology from the Irish Republic’s Government would go
some distance to assure the Unionist community that the pain of
innocent victims of terror has been recognised. How long we will have

just war, but through bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, punishment
beatings of civilians, torture, extortion, robberies, racketeering and

concessions. Those who were involved in terrorism should be called
terrorists and must not be granted a similar status to those they
terrorised, irrespective of what part of the community they come from.

work. It should not just be left to the Pat Finucane Centre or somebody
else who happens to have had the reports shared with them. That is
something that we, as a Parliament, should take more responsibility
for. The truth about many of those deaths and murders is coming out now
in different ways, but the fact is that here in this House untruths
were told about many of those deaths and murders. The claims of my
colleagues Seamus Mallon, John Hume, Joe Hendron and Eddie McGrady
about the dirty war, and our concerns about intelligence not being
properly shared or used, about people not being apprehended and about
collusion, were all denied. But the truth shone through in the
De Silva report on the Finucane murder and it will shine
through in the book I mentioned as well.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Belfast South said, some of the victims were
targeted by loyalist gangs, which included some members who served
concurrently in the security forces. Those victims were targeted not
because they were involved in the IRA or anything else, but because
they were obviously seen as uppity Fenians—they had been
associated with the civil rights movement, were involved in the SDLP,
were buying property and developing businesses, so they were put down.
It is clear that the people specifically targeted in their homes and
cars came into that class. Others, of course—including members
of the security forces themselves—were more randomly
targeted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0002.htm#13102356000189">Other

remember that some of those lost their lives in attacks that could have
been prevented had intelligence been shared and acted on. However,

recently attended Irish Fest in Milwaukee, USA, where I highlighted the
other side to the history that many of Irish descent and many of Ulster
descent had learnt from the propaganda and an often slanted media view.
Americans and those from mainland USA watch films like “The
Devil’s Own”, which have a degree of artistic licence
that I fear greatly rewrites history. These and other stories make it
seem as though 302 RUC men and women—men and women with the
George Cross—were not human beings with families and lives but
simply moving “legitimate target” signs; or make it 
<?notus-xml column=353?>seem as though 30 prison officers and 763 armed forces members were
simply numbers on a score sheet, not people whose spouses and children
still feel the devastating loss to this day.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T15:40:23"></hs_TimeCode> histories
and films would glibly portray a prison break as a great lark and not
take into account the lives that were destroyed by the loss of a father
and husband. One of those was my constituent Mr Ferris, and other
people were shot and injured as a result of that escape. Never
portrayed in a film is a scene where a busy fish shop is bombed with no
warning on a busy Saturday, killing one terrorist and nine people,
including two children, and injuring 57 other people. Nor do we see
depicted the unveiling of a plaque in memory of this terrorist, yet
that is the legacy that we are dealing with in Northern Ireland today,

that that distinction is absolutely clear. The security forces
endeavoured to contain the paramilitaries that carried out so many
atrocities, whether they were republican or loyalist organisations.

political considerations. We always knew that the decoded message was,

scepticism about public inquiries as a means to deal with the past. In
particular, it simply is not possible for each of those 3,500 victims
to have their own public inquiry, which means that those we have are
uneven and can divide opinion.

Home Secretary would have gone there, and it would have been equally
nice and appropriate had she gone to Northern Ireland and said to the
Chief Constable and the Justice Minister, “We support you all

kept in close touch with the Chief Constable and the Justice

her that I was the first very publicly to condemn the violence and the
attacks on police officers, which were absolutely unacceptable. I will

hon. Friend the Member for Tewkesbury (Mr Robertson), the
Chairman of the Select Committee, was right to focus on the future.
Like other hon. Members, he expressed concern about the parading system
and the violence we have seen. He was right to emphasise that hundreds
of parades take place in Northern Ireland every year that are entirely
peaceful, but it is important to point out that not only were the
attacks we saw on police officers unacceptable, but they do huge
economic damage to Northern Ireland because of their impact around the
world. That is an important reason why I hope we will see a resolution
of the current situation in north Belfast. It is a concern to have a
protest camp and nightly parades so close to a very volatile interface,
and I hope that local conversations can take place to try to find a way
to resolve the situation.</hs_Para>

retained it have done so at a lower level than here in the United

Although this tax is regarded by some as a tax on the rich and
therefore a progressive tax, it is not: it is a flat-rate tax and
therefore it is a regressive tax. Many of those who are hit are
travelling on holidays or to see their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:39:21"></hs_TimeCode>, and
they save up for that even though many of them are on low incomes.
Indeed, 45% of those who are hit by it would be regarded as
being on medium or below-medium incomes, yet they 
<?notus-xml column=368?>pay the same tax as those earning more than £80,000. Leaving
aside the impact on growth, on exports and on industry, the regressive
nature of the tax makes it an unfair tax, and that is another reason

Wilson:</Member></B> I have dealt with the issue in Northern Ireland,
so I shall deal with that as a general issue for the United Kingdom
economy as a whole. Let us look at the Government’s present
objectives. We wish to achieve economic growth. We have heard the
Chancellor on many occasions in the House argue that growth cannot be
achieved simply by injecting more public funds into the economy,
although some of us would query whether a particular type of injection,
especially in infrastructure, would not have benefits.</hs_Para>

that aside, the Government’s main thrust is that, if industry in
the United Kingdom became more productive and more export-orientated
and sold goods abroad, we would be able to achieve economic growth. Yet
if there is one tax militating against export-orientated growth, it is
this tax. Businesses currently pay about £500 million per year
in air passenger duty. That, according to all the reports
that have been done, influences the willingness and the ability of
businesses to go overseas to look for suppliers, markets, investment
and opportunities, and the frequency with which they do so. Therefore,
air passenger duty has a deflationary effect and reduces the incentive
for businesses to do what the Government want them to do. It therefore
impacts on the ability of firms to increase their markets, increase
their productivity and bring in investment, which can create further
competition and help to increase the health of the
economy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:42:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:43:18"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Lagan Valley (Mr Donaldson) that APD
must be seen in the context of an overall strategy. However, as has
been pointed out by a number of Members, there are airports other than
Heathrow and Gatwick which are capable of taking long-haul flights.
Having those direct long-haul flights or even short-haul flights to
other destinations would help many regional economies significantly,
and there is excess capacity there. We should not always think in terms
of only the main hub airports when we are talking about the
industry’s
capacity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000305" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102356000305">Studies
have been done on the impact of removing air passenger duty and a
report by PricewaterhouseCoopers went to the Chancellor. All economic
models can be challenged. As an economist, I used to tell youngsters
when I was teaching them in school that the model is only as good as
the assumptions put into it, and those may change before the model has
been run for sufficient time. We always have to be careful about
economic modelling, and I am sure that the Minister will make the same
point. The model used by the consultants took cautious views about
elasticity of demand for tourism and elasticity of fiscal changes. It
used a model that is used by the Treasury to measure the impact of
policy changes. When the Chancellor comes to the House with Budget
policies and tells us that behavioural changes will lead to this or
that, he uses exactly the same kind of models that were used in this
report. The outcome was that to remove air passenger duty altogether
would lead to GDP growth in the first year of 0.45%, and in the next
two years of 0.3%. During those three years, £16
billion would be added to GDP and there would be 60,000 jobs, an
increase in exports of 5% and an increase in inward investment of
6%.</hs_Para>

people asked me for money, I would ask where it was to come from. If
they wanted me to spend money on this, I would ask where we would spend
less. If they wanted taxes on business reduced, I would ask where we
were to get the money from. There must always be a counterbalance, but
the good thing about this proposal is that it is fiscally neutral. If
anything, given its impact on exports, investment and growth, the
£4 billion that would be lost by 2016-17 would be more than
compensated for by the increase in tax revenues and the reduction in
benefit payments. That is most unusual for any fiscal change. The
reasons for it are, first, that the level of taxation is so high in the
UK compared with elsewhere that there would be a positive impact.
Secondly, there is the importance of transport. This is borne out not
just by the model but by the Department for Transport. The importance
of transport to the economy is such that there is a huge multiplier
effect. Lastly, because of the connectivity that this gives to other
markets, there would be a positive
impact.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102356000307">The
coalition Government promised to look at a replacement for air
passenger duty and said that the revenue raised—they did not say
that more would be raised—would be used to offset income tax
changes. If 
<?notus-xml column=370?>the Government changed the method of taxation for air travel, they did
not see that money as going into the general pot, either to reduce
borrowing or to facilitate spending on other Departments, but as
something that would be given away anyway to taxpayers. Therefore, as
far as how we pay for it is concerned, all the work that has been done
indicates that it should be revenue-neutral. However, I
assume—perhaps I am just being naive—that if the
Government had made a promise that the revenue from taxing air travel
would be given in income taxes and that had been factored in already,
they did not actually need it for their fiscal reduction plans

believe that there is a big orange globe up in the sky that has
influenced the Earth’s climate for billions of years and will
continue to do so and that the impact humans have on that is very
limited. We should certainly not be strangling our economy in order to
try to change the climate, especially when countries around the world
that emit far more CO<Sub>2</Sub> than we ever will do not give two

long-haul flights not knowing what the final bill would be, but we did
so in the knowledge that, regardless of what the bill would be, it was
a very significant issue for the Northern Ireland economy—I can
say that now because the bill has been settled, but if I had said it
earlier Treasury Ministers might have thought, “Oh well, we can
stick the arm in as far as we like.” It was one of our top
priorities. Indeed, many people argued at the time that it was all
about tourism, but it was not; it was essentially about the investment
strategy that had been set out for Northern Ireland and the need for
connectively with one of the main markets from which we attract inward
investment. All the indications we had from investors show that ease of
travel was very important, whether for their managers into Northern

to be a review of green taxes, semi-green taxes, pale green taxes,
taxes that used to be green but are no longer, or whatever, and given
that this issue should be revenue-neutral yet fit in with the
Government strategy of export-led growth, I trust that APD will be
given serious consideration in the review of fiscal
policy.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/808AFD6D90C9DD48C44260E95B67A46C576784A7" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="23 October 2013">Wednesday

Deputy Speaker, it is a real pleasure to speak in this debate,
particularly given that you are in the Chair. It does not seem that

is a pleasure to respond to the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy
Wilson). I thank him for raising the issues, which relate to the two
greatest challenges facing the Government and Britain
today—rebuilding 
<?notus-xml column=372?>the British economy and restoring the public finances. The House well
knows the state of both challenges when the Government came into
office. The economy was still reeling from the impact of the recent
banking crisis and Britain had the largest fiscal deficit in our
peacetime
history.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000322" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102356000322">The
hon. Gentleman started talking about zealousness, particularly in
respect of green taxes. I thought he was going to talk about
zealousness in tackling the fiscal deficit, although I am not sure that
I heard that from him. The Government have had to face up to those
challenges and take tough choices. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor
committed to tackling our budget deficit and getting our national debt
under control. Fixing the public finances is vital to maintain
confidence in Britain and the stability that is an essential condition
of growth, as the hon. Gentleman mentioned, and recovery.</hs_Para>

months, the statistics on gross domestic product, employment, business
investment and consumer confidence have all shown that our efforts are
beginning to bear fruit. The process of recovery is, of course, far
from complete, but, building on the stable foundations that the
Government put in place, the economy is now healing. I am sure that the
whole House welcomes the signs of recovery so far and looks forward to
seeing them continue.</hs_Para>

particular, I am sure that the hon. Gentleman will join me in welcoming
the recent good economic news from Northern Ireland. This year,
Northern Ireland’s exports have risen by 4% in the second
quarter of the year and in September they rose at the fastest rate in
nearly six years. September also saw the third consecutive month of
grown in Northern Ireland’s GDP, with activity rising in the
manufacturing, retail and services sectors. It also saw the third
consecutive month of rising private sector employment, while total jobs
have grown by more than 5,000 over the course of the year. That has
kept unemployment in Northern Ireland well below the UK average and the
fourth lowest of the 12 UK regions.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T16:59:46"></hs_TimeCode>Just as Northern
Ireland makes a key contribution to the UK economy overall, growth and
recovery in Northern Ireland are making a key contribution to the

strong transport links is a key part of building our economic recovery.
The Government are therefore bringing forward record investment in
transport infrastructure, which the hon. Gentleman mentioned, to ensure
the connectivity of all parts of the United Kingdom, including Northern
Ireland. That is why in this year’s spending review we announced
a £20 million fund to improve air connectivity between London
and the rest of the United Kingdom. Where the case is made for a public
service obligation, the Government will use this fund to support
regional air links. Northern Ireland will be able to bid for that
support. This would build on existing support for the Northern Irish
economy—for example, the additional £94 million of
capital spending power for the Northern Ireland Executive announced in
this year’s Budget and the action plan set out in the Northern
Ireland economic pact published this
June<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:00:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000326" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102356000326">Ensuring
sound public finances is indispensable to economic recovery. With
forecast revenues of £2.9 billion in 2013-14, air passenger

although I do not think the hon. Lady will be surprised if I said that
I know more about air passenger duty today than I did this time last

2001; in fact, in the past year it has borrowed £120 billion.

will increase GDP and tax revenues. With that body of evidence behind

will take 2.7 million people out of income tax altogether. In Northern
Ireland, since 2010 the rising personal allowance has already taken
75,000 people out of tax. In recognition of the impact of persistently
high pump prices, the fuel duty increase that was planned for

international, and virtually all domestic, flights. Finally, as I have
already said, despite the fiscal challenges, the Government have

me turn to the report on APD published earlier this year by
PricewaterhouseCoopers and to which today’s motion refers. The
report claims that abolishing APD would give such a boost to the wider
economy that it would make other tax receipts increase by enough to
offset the loss of APD revenue—the £3 billion I referred
to a moment ago. The report’s conclusions, however, are based on
economic models that rely on a series of significant assumptions. In

Government have reviewed the report, its modelling and the underlying
assumptions carefully. We do not agree with the assumptions needed to
justify the claim that abolishing APD would be revenue neutral overall,
and, in our view, abolishing APD would have a significantly smaller
impact on UK economic activity than PWC has estimated. There would
therefore be a smaller increase in other taxes than PWC predicted, with
overall tax revenues falling as a result. We also note that under some
of the less optimistic assumptions that PWC considered in its report,
its models predicted a net loss of revenue in the longer term. As I
have said, any revenue loss would either need to be made good by
increased revenues from other sources, or would need to be compensated
for by further reductions in public spending.</hs_Para>

the Government’s statistical analysis and assessment of APD. I

alone supports 7,800 jobs across the north-east region, with 3,200 on
site, and more than £250 million of UK exports were shipped
through the airport in the last year—facts that speak for
themselves. It is therefore little wonder that the Government’s

announced at Budget 2010 and then again at Budget 2011, the Government

covered several areas, including private jets, different tax bands,
premium economy flights, flights from regional airports and the
possible devolution of APD. The consultation paper raised the concern
that the existing four-band structure was damaging UK competitiveness
and contained several anomalies, such as the higher rate on Caribbean
flights than on flights to destinations in the USA, about which several

paper set out two options: returning to the pre-2009 structure of two
tax bands and a different rate between two classes of travel; and
combining the two higher bands for flights over 4,000 miles to create a
three-band structure and retaining different rates between different
classes of travel—an option, however, that would not have
resolved the Caribbean concern. The consultation also raised the
prospect of a lower rate of APD for flights from regional airports and
the question of whether APD should remain a UK-wide tax or be
devolved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102356000391" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102356000391">The

interested parties that took considerable time and effort to respond in

they confirmed in December 2011 that they did not propose to make any

Ireland Affairs Committee report, which urged the abolition of APD on
flights to and from airports in Northern Ireland owing to the specific
problem faced there—direct competition from airports in the
Republic and its lower rates of APD. In order to maintain the
transatlantic route from Belfast to Newark, the Chancellor announced in
September 2011 that the APD rate on long-haul flights using airports in
Northern Ireland would be cut, because Continental Airlines had,
unsustainably, been paying the APD itself at a cost of some £3.2
million a year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:33:55"></hs_TimeCode>.

Government should carry out an objective analysis of policies such as
differential rates of APD; the Government should conduct a 12-month
trial on an APD holiday for new services operating out of airports not
in the south-east; and the Government should not further devolve APD at
this stage, as it may have negative impacts, for example, in the north

conclusion, despite various promises of action on this issue, we have
seen anything but. The reforms in Northern Ireland addressed the very
specific situation in that part of the UK, but this issue affects the
whole of our country. After three years of a flatlining economy, and
with households up and down the country in the midst of a cost of
living crisis, the Government’s complete lack of direction on
APD has been extremely unhelpful at a time when family purse strings
have been tightened and businesses have been crying out for support.
The lack of certainty on this issue from the Government simply risks
investment decisions being delayed and future development being
jeopardised, which, crucially, puts jobs at risk, too. This just is not
good enough, but it is what we have come to

Kwarteng:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman shows an admirable grasp of
our recent economic history; he is absolutely right. From 2001 to
today, we have consistently run a deficit. Conservative Members have
always been struck by the fact that, although the economy was actually
growing during the first six of those years, between 2001 and 2007, the
Government of the time saw fit to run a deficit in every one of those
years. The present Government inherited a deficit of £160
billion—12% of our gross domestic product—and
the fact that it has now been reduced by a third represents a
remarkable success. It now stands at somewhere between
£110 billion and £115 billion, depending on
how the figure is calculated.

the context of deficit reduction, any Government would be reluctant to
abolish air passenger duty in a peremptory way, as it brings in more
than £3 billion a year. We all recognise that the deficit is a
real thing—it is an ongoing annual sum that we have to
close—and the £3 billion a year raised by APD makes a
real contribution to its reduction.</hs_Para>

fully understand all the supply-side arguments. I understand that, if
we were to abolish the tax, we could perhaps reap economic rewards at
some future date. However, those who promote reducing or abolishing it
must tell us how they would replace that revenue from day one. Where
would they find the £3 billion that APD currently brings in?
Conservative Members are familiar with general tax-cutting arguments.
One could argue for the abolition of most taxes on the basis that that
would stimulate growth, and that the money would be recouped in the
long run through increased tax revenues. However, we have to face the
fact of a real deficit, which is something that Opposition Members
never seem to acknowledge in their speeches.</hs_Para>

her appointment as Economic Secretary. She cited the fact
that our corporation tax rates are extremely competitive.
The rate of 20% is among the lowest, if not the lowest, in the OECD. In
that context, general taxation on companies and business has been
reduced, and we are seeing flickerings of growth—we expect
encouraging growth figures at the end of this week. In the round, we
can therefore say that the Government’s policy is
working. The deficit reduction is happening and growth is
beginning to return to Britain. Now is not the time to slacken the
deficit reduction plan, so I fully understand why APD is necessary: to

welcome that, in a way, but the Government should bear in mind the
downside: in the meantime, the policy is damaging Scotland’s
economy, as well as the economies of other areas under centralised
Westminster control. I am sure that an independent Scotland would run

I suggested, we do not have taxes that are designed for Scotland, and
if ever something crystallised that point, it is the issue of APD.
Scotland is being fleeced by APD. It is estimated that, in each of the
four years between 2012 and 2016, 2.1 million fewer passengers will go
through Scottish airports as a result of it. APD is a demand-management
tax. Heathrow and other London airports benefited from preferential
treatment by successive UK Governments for decades because bilateral
air agreements with a host of other countries stipulated that London
airports must be
used<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:50:43"></hs_TimeCode>. That
policy has come back to haunt those Governments. There is now a
shortage of runways in the south-east of England, because the hub that
was put in place cannot cope with the demand that was deliberately
created, and the solution has been this congestion tax of the skies to
slow traffic into Heathrow and other London
airports<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T17:51:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

some ways, the Government’s demand-management tool has indeed
been successful. The London airports are nearing full capacity, and APD
has succeeded in controlling the pressing demand that has resulted from
the lack of runways in London. However, London is losing passengers and
commerce to other parts of the current United Kingdom, such as
Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England. The solution is
surely to devolve the policy and leave it in the hands of those who
could manage it better because they are closer to the problem. Those
who are distant from it advance all sorts of odd arguments, as we have

the Scottish airport that has been most affected by APD, lost 14% of
its traffic in 2012, and just the other week it had to be nationalised
by the Scottish Government because the alternatives were unfortunately
unthinkable. The Scottish Government feel that Scotland is a
high-quality aviation market. It has a record of establishing
successive intercontinental air routes with high load factors,
including business-class traffic. They believe that there is
considerable potential for improving Scotland’s international
air connections, but the UK Government’s punitive APD rates are
seriously hampering that process. York Aviation has pointed out that
APD rates have rocketed since 2007, with short-haul travellers being
hit by a rise of about 160%. The price paid by a family of four
travelling to Spain has increased from £20 to £52 since
2007, and the price that they would pay to travel to the United States
has increased from £80 to £268—a shocking
rise.</hs_Para>

estimates that 148,000 trips and £77 million in visit
expenditure could be lost over the next three years and that by 2016
APD will cost the Scottish economy up to £210 million a year in
lost tourism.
One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:11:56"></hs_TimeCode> of the
difficulties with this debate is that there is an awful lot of

using all these statistics, but unfortunately they have to be repeated.

it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000053"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:10:38"></hs_TimeCode>This

want to address air passenger duty in the context of the UK
Government’s broader tourism and transport strategies. When it
comes to tourism policy, it really is a tale of two Governments. Last
week the Irish Government announced in their budget that they will be
retaining a 9% rate of VAT for the tourism sector and entirely
scrapping their air passenger tax. The UK Government, however, have
presented us with the highest airport taxes in the world and raised VAT
to 20%, with no dispensation for the tourism industry.
Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:13:17"></hs_TimeCode> I
commend the Irish Government and hope that those measures bring more
visitors across the island, this clearly puts businesses in the north
of Ireland at a huge disadvantage.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:13:17"></hs_TimeCode> UK
Government urgently need to look at introducing similar measures,
particularly in Northern Ireland, to enable our businesses to compete
on a fair footing with businesses in the rest of Ireland. I hope that
this debate will spur them on to do just that.</hs_Para>

rate of APD in the UK is the highest in the world and has risen by over
300% over the past five years. We in Northern Ireland are particularly
vulnerable to that excessive duty owing to our reliance on air travel,
which is dictated by our location, as has already been referred to in
the debate. The rate is choking growth in the sector by having a severe
impact on visitor numbers and is hurting our whole economy, especially
those businesses that rely on exporting
goods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:14:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000058" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000058">The
motion refers to the recent PricewaterhouseCoopers report, which
contends that lowering APD would be, at worst, budget neutral and would
almost certainly boost growth and create jobs. Such evidence supports
the measures taken by the Irish Government to get rid of their
equivalent duty rate, and I find it hard to see why the UK Chancellor
cannot respond with similar measures to support the UK
economy—or at least, as suggested by the Transport Committee,
commission research into the matter. Perhaps the Exchequer Secretary
will deal with that issue in his response.</hs_Para>

Chancellor would point to the devolution to the Assembly of long-haul
APD, which was particularly welcome. However, domestic flights make up
the vast bulk of flights out of Belfast International and Belfast City
airports. There is also the slightly bizarre situation in which flights
to London, Manchester and Glasgow are taxed at a higher rate than those
to Newark, New
Jersey.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000060">Another
point that should be emphasised is that the APD cut for long-haul
flights was not some generous Treasury handout, but has to be paid out
of the Northern Ireland block grant; as a former Minister for Finance,
the hon. Member for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson) will know all about
that. It was the decision of the Northern Ireland Executive to
prioritise growth and tourist numbers by cutting the tax and we in
Northern Ireland should be given a similar dispensation over the
short-haul rate. Our geographical location makes us especially
vulnerable to the pressures exerted by a high rate of APD, as someone
going to or from Europe or further afield will often need to make two
journeys.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000061">We
cannot ignore the wider context of our tourism industry. I have called
here for a similar cut in VAT for businesses. Cutting both would mean
much for tourism, which is one of Northern Ireland’s principal
economic drivers, along with agriculture and fisheries; our
manufacturing sector is now smaller. I have no doubt that the measure
will involve assessing transport and infrastructure on a north-south
basis in the island. That will require a maturity, on the part of all
those who have spoken today, in harnessing the power that an all-island
economy will release. For too long, our approach has been dominated by
physical and psychological borders that do not exist in the mind of
most people.</hs_Para>

reason for speaking this afternoon is to discuss the business of air

let us turn to the charge sheet that the House is presented with this
afternoon and the motion, which calls for air passenger duty to be
scrapped. The first charge is that it is a green tax, but, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:19:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Antrim said, it was not introduced and justified on that
basis. However, he explained that even if it were, that would be no
reason for not getting rid of it. This country, the western world and
the whole world face a challenge in increasing energy efficiency and
reducing the carbon footprint. Although that would not be a reason for
introducing APD, it is worth bearing it in mind that we need to send a
signal that rail travel, car-sharing and other forms of
energy-efficient transport are to be
encouraged<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:20:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000068">The
second charge is that the tax is regressive. The data in the ONS
publication “The Effects of Taxes and Benefits on Household
Income, 2011/12”, which I commend to colleagues, make it clear
that it is not regressive; in fact, it is no more so than VAT. I think
we would all love to get rid of that too—certainly colleagues in
the House today would love it; we would like to get rid of most
taxes—but we are not in a position where we can afford that
luxury<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:20:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000069">The
third charge, interestingly, is that the tax is disproportionate. In
fact, the Government have limited the rise in APD to inflation in the
period 2010-11 to 2013-14, and in this year’s Budget they
ensured that the rate will remain constant in real terms. This
afternoon I looked online and found an air ticket to Berlin for
£80, £13 of which is APD. That does not seem to be a
prohibitive level of tax that will put people
off<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:20:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

need for competitive corporation tax rates and income tax rates; surely
APD is a tax and we need to be competitive on that too. We have the
highest APD in Europe. Of the 27 countries in the European Union, only
six charge APD, and the Republic of Ireland is going to reduce it to
zero in April next year. Should my hon. Friend not bear it in mind that

Freeman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. He must have
spotted my notes, because my very next point is that we need to view
this in the wider context of business and tax competitiveness. I hugely
welcome the fact that the Government have committed to reduce
corporation tax from 28% to 23% and, in due course, to 20%, meaning we
are constantly cited as one of the top three in the G8 on tax
competitiveness, as stated in the 2012 KPMG global survey. That is a
strong signal to global businesses that we are open for business, and
it supports my hon. Friend’s point that we need to view this in
the context of wider support for businesses and tax
competitiveness<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:22:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

charge is that the tax is bad for Northern Ireland. In this respect, I
have some sympathy with the case made by colleagues from the Province.
The fact that the Republic has cut APD creates a particularly difficult
situation in Northern Ireland. The Minister said, encouragingly, that
the Northern Ireland economy is not showing signs of suffering as a
result, with very high growth and new jobs being created. That is a
testament to the creativity and entrepreneurialism of the people of
Northern Ireland. The changes made to the tax in November 2011, which
reduced long-haul rates to the same as those for short-haul, and the
devolution of the matter to the Assembly are important and welcome
measures. However, I have a lot of sympathy with the argument that
locally, given the situation in the Republic, there is a particular
problem that the Government will need to look
at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:23:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000073" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000073">The
truth—an inconvenient truth, to borrow a phrase—consists
of three points. As a generation, a Parliament and a Government, we
face, and have to deal with, the most massive crisis in our public
finances. We inherited from the previous Government £1.2
trillion of debt—£5,000 for every man, woman and child in
the country. Debt interest alone is now the fourth biggest item of
Government expenditure, and it is set to rise, if the coalition has not
acted, to £76 billion a year in interest payments. We have a
structural crisis in the public finances—in pensions, in
welfare, in health and in debt interest.</hs_Para>

very best efforts of the Government to contain the crisis and make sure
that they do not trigger a downward spiral in public confidence in the
economy, we still face a huge challenge to restore our public finances.
We do not have money to spare. There is no such thing as a free tax
cut; the closest thing is a tax cut on wealth creation. That is why I
support the steps that the Treasury has taken on corporation tax to put
in place a competitive tax environment for our businesses and why, in
particular, I support a new deal for start-up businesses—the
people who are at the coal face of creating new jobs. The truth is that
APD is not a tax on business creation; it is a tax on air travel, which
is not the same
thing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000075"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:24:41"></hs_TimeCode>Finally,
this tax raises £2.8 billion a year, and that figure is set to
rise to £3.8 billion in 2016. That is a significant amount of
money. Interestingly, it is nearly the same amount as that which the
Government have given away in a fuel duty cut, which has caused huge
reductions in income at the Exchequer and has a relatively low impact
on people’s pockets. Abolishing APD would have a small impact on
GDP and hard-working families, but it would lead to a major £4
billion cut in our deficit credibility. I hope Ministers resist

International airport has noted in similar terms that APD has been held
up as a barrier to airlines that might otherwise have shown interest in
operating services in Northern Ireland, thereby limiting market
opportunity and creating competitive disadvantage for operators. A 2011
report by PricewaterhouseCoopers, entitled “Helping Economic
Take Off”, looked at Northern Ireland’s geographical
location, which makes us unique in both a UK and EU context. We are the
most westerly part of the European Union and the only region of the 
<?notus-xml column=401?>UK separated by water, yet we share a land frontier with another member
state. We have to travel and we have to trade, and air connectivity is
the essential springboard from which future economic growth will be
launched. The report, however, found that the continued imposition of
APD would serve as a significant deterrent to further investment by
existing or new carriers in existing or new air

has already been said in today’s debate about the Netherlands
experience. The Dutch Government introduced an aviation tax in 2008 for
passengers departing from Dutch airports. The Dutch air passenger duty
proved controversial from the outset and decreasing passenger numbers,
combined with the global economic crisis, led the Dutch Government to
subsequently abolish it on 1 January 2010. Belgian plans for a ticket
tax were not implemented for similar reasons and a Danish tax was
withdrawn due to adverse economic impact. In January 2013, the German
Government announced that they would freeze their air passenger tax,
while the German Transport Minister has publicly stated that he would
like the tax to be abolished completely. Will our Government not listen
to what is happening across the rest of Europe? Surely those decisions
are being made in the light of economic circumstances.</hs_Para>

example, that since 2010, the price of an economy ticket for a
short-haul flight—such tickets apply to the majority of
passenger flights—has risen from £12 to £13. It is
worth pointing out that that is an increase of £1. He also
raised concerns about the impact of APD on Scotland, but the most

reiterate that APD must adhere to international rules on aviation
tax—a point that she acknowledged—specifically the
Chicago convention. The capital city convention in APD ensures that the
duty complies with the rules. She asked why we could not reform the
bands. We could move to having two bands, and we did examine that as
part of the 2011 consultation, but no banding structure can be entirely
free of anomalies, and a revenue-neutral move to two bands would
require an increase in APD for about 90% of passengers, including those

implication if the tax were devolved to Scotland and then abolished,
because the cost of that would have to be found from the block grant.
We have not estimated what that would be, but such a decision would
have consequences to comply with EU state aid rules. It is also worth
pointing out that we would need to take into account any market
distortions that would be created and that the cost would have to take
into account any lost revenue for neighbouring English airports, for
example. That is not an insignificant
point<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0003.htm#13102368000132">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-23T18:56:34"></hs_TimeCode>

I have made clear, APD makes a crucial contribution to tackling our
fiscal challenges. The tax raises nearly £3 billion in annual
revenue. Contrary to the claims of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report,
which has been cited frequently, scrapping APD would not be costless;
it would result in a significant loss to the Exchequer. Unless we were
to give up on our fiscal goals—my hon. Friends have been
absolutely right to highlight the need for us to maintain discipline on
reducing the deficit—the lost revenue would therefore need to be
found elsewhere, either by increasing other taxes or by further
reducing our public spending. In the course of the debate, I have heard
few realistic proposals as to how that could be done. Not only would
scrapping APD create substantial costs to the Exchequer, but the
benefits of such a step would be small compared with those of the
policies that the Government have already put in place.</hs_Para>

been made for a statement on the recent developments concerning the
Arctic 30? I am sure that many of us will be pleased to hear tonight
that the charges against them have been downgraded from piracy to
hooliganism. Some are related to, or friends of, Members, and one is a
constituent of the Prime Minister, as my right hon. Friend has said. Is

know, that is not strictly a point of order. The matter of statements
is something the Government themselves determine and I have no
knowledge of that, but she has had the opportunity to raise her point

deterioration in her health. She was then incarcerated with young
offenders in Cheadle, 103 miles from her home. Her mother, coping with
a five-year-old son and a job in the NHS, spent nine hours travelling
to have just one hour with her daughter. For the rest of the time she

further, often to Hull, and their families struggling to be near them,

right hon. Member for Kingston upon Hull West and Hessle (Alan Johnson)
on securing the debate. It brings back happy memories of the times when
I used to shadow him in his previous job as Secretary of State. He
raises an incredibly important issue. Let me say right at the start
that I would be very happy to meet him, together with his constituent
and NHS England. Having read the brief and listened to him, I am
conscious that there is some confusion about the number of children
involved, the acuity of their condition and so forth. I want to get to
the bottom of that and understand exactly what is going on to ensure
that we get the right facilities available for children in his part of
the

right hon. Gentleman talked in his introduction about the reduction in
the number of in-patient mental health beds. That, of course, is a
trend that has been going on for the past two decades, under his
Government and this Government, and rightly so. There has been a
substantial shift towards early intervention and care in the community,
rather than institutional care. However, there is still a long way to
go. Too many people with mental health issues stay too long in
in-patient beds, which tend not to be a therapeutic environment, much
as we would want them to be. On the whole, however, the trend has been
in the right direction, as the right hon. Gentleman would probably
agree.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000487" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0004.htm#13102368000487">The
right hon. Gentleman also mentioned the data issue. I completely agree.
Mental health issues have been a data-free zone. He talked about the
loss of one particular data set, but in the mental health sector we
struggle in an absence of data and of understanding of the evidence
about what interventions work effectively. That has to be addressed and
it is being
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000488" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0004.htm#13102368000488">The
right hon. Gentleman mentioned what I said about the institutional
bias. There is absolutely an institutional bias against mental health
issues. One example is the 18-week wait for treatment for physical
health conditions, which his Government introduced—rightly so,
because people were waiting for far too long. But people with mental
health conditions were left out. No one with such conditions has any
understanding of when they should be seen; there is no access standard.
There is no requirement for someone with an eating disorder, which can
kill, to be admitted for care and treatment within a defined period. I
am determined to end that because such provisions drive where the money
goes in the
NHS.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000489" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0004.htm#13102368000489">The
right hon. Gentleman mentioned that, as a result of decisions of
commissioners around the country, funding for mental health conditions
has gone down 
<?notus-xml column=413?>whereas that for physical health conditions has gone up. That is because
of how money works in the NHS. We have to end that institutional bias.

that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102368000490" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/debtext/131023-0004.htm#13102368000490">I

children and young people with mental health problems is incredibly
serious and it is a priority for the Government. We want to achieve
parity of esteem between physical and mental health, which should be
regarded as just as important as each other. Historically, that has not

that such children should be in the right facility with the right care

Bryant</B> (Rhondda) (Lab):</Member> I should start by making a slight
correction to my own title for the debate, because this incident did
not happen “in” the Russian Federation—a point
that I shall come on
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000007">I
shall say first what I am not saying in the debate. I am not saying
that Greenpeace activists should have immunity from prosecution
wherever they engage in their activities in the world. I am not calling
for impunity for people when they take on such activities and, indeed,
I do not think that Greenpeace would, either. Part of civil
disobedience is that people expect that at some point they will face
the criminal law, and I do not think that anybody resiles from that or
wants to hide from it.</hs_Para>

saying that Greenpeace is right in its assertions on polar drilling or
what the Russians should or should not be doing in the Arctic. I
personally have  a set of concerns about whether it is possible
to drill in heavily icy water—whether it would be possible to
clear up a spill—but that is not my argument today at all. I am
also not saying anything about the criminal justice system in the
Russian Federation, respect for human rights in the Russian Federation
or its membership of the Council of Europe and its adherence to the
European convention on human rights, although I have said many things
on all those matters on many other occasions. That is not the issue
before us
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000009">Let
me run through the facts. The first is that, on  18 September,
several Greenpeace activists attempted to climb a Russian oil rig owned
by Gazprom, the state operator—they had also done that the
previous year—so as to be able to hang a great big banner
proclaiming their views on drilling in the Arctic. The Prirazlomnaya
rig has been there for some time, and Greenpeace has been running a
campaign against its presence there. Not immediately but 24 hours
later, FSB—the federal security service—operatives,
presumably on the command of the Russian state, stormed the Greenpeace
ship and seized it, along with the captain and all the crew members,
the activists and the two journalists who were on board, and took them
all off to
Murmansk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000010">The
28 activists and two journalists were subsequently charged with piracy,
which in Russian state law carries a term of imprisonment of up to 15
years. Every one of them was refused bail and, as I am sure right hon.
and hon. Members—I note that this debate is very well
attended—will know, there are six British people involved. They
are Phil Ball, who is a Greenpeace activist and a constituent of the
Prime Minister; Kieron Bryan, who is a freelance videographer and a
constituent of my right hon. and learned Friend the Member for
Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), who is sitting on my right; 
<?notus-xml column=78?>Frank Hewetson, a Greenpeace activist; Alex Harris; Anthony Perrett; and
Iain Rogers, who was the second engineer on the Greenpeace
ship.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000011">I
think there are some very significant problems with the actions of the
Russian authorities. The first is that, as I said, the ship was not
seized in the Russian Federation. It was not in Russian Federation
state waters. It was in international waters. I know that Russia has
sought to declare a 3-nautical mile exclusive economic zone around the
rig, but I believe that is not within international law. Quite
explicitly, article 60.5 of the United Nations convention on the law of
the sea specifies, I believe, that that 3-nautical mile exclusion zone
is illegal. But even if it is legal, that does not give the Russian
authorities the right to operate in the way that they did, using the
level of force that they did, 24 hours after the demonstration on the
rig had ended, let alone to seize a ship that is flagged under the
Dutch authorities, which is why the Dutch authorities have now made a
claim on the ship. Therefore, I think there are significant areas in
which, even against their own Russian law, the Russian authorities have
not operated
correctly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000012">There
is also the matter of the charges that have been brought against the
activists. They have been charged with piracy. This country takes
piracy extremely seriously. The situation off Somalia has seen the
British Navy and British troops engaged in a European effort to root
out the significant problems there, and British people have been seized
by pirates, so we do not take piracy lightly at all. But even President
Putin says that it is completely obvious that the activists are not
pirates. I am quoting his direct words. He said
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102346000174" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000174">“it’s

Fedotov, the chair of the presidential human rights council, which
advises the President on human rights issues in Russia, has also said
that they should not be prosecuted for
piracy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000014">I
believe there is a very good reason why these people should not be
prosecuted for piracy. It is not only that we undermine the law on
piracy around the world and the efforts to tackle piracy if we call
people pirates when they are not in any sense pirates. It is also that
we have only to look at the United Nations convention on the law of the
sea, which says specifically in article
101:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102346000175" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000175">“Piracy

key element in that is “for private ends”. That does not
mean prosecuting a campaign. It means “for personal, private,
financial or monetary gain”. There is no allegation that that is
the situation in this case. For that matter, the article says that
there has to be an illegal act “of violence or

detention.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000016"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robert Buckland" PimsId="5596" UID="13102346000209" xid="1193" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000209"><B>Mr

I was about to say next, because I was going to move on to the next bit
of article 101. He has made the point for me, and I know that many
other right hon. and hon. Members want to speak, so I will not bother
to labour the point, but even within Russian law—many countries
have specific laws in relation to how the United Nations convention
should be interpreted into their own law—I cannot see how it

thus far, I think, has alleged that Greenpeace was seeking to seize the
rig. Nobody has said so. For that matter, nobody has yet maintained
that the rig—this goes back to what the hon. Member for South

therefore find it inconceivable, either within Russian law or within
international law, that they should be prosecuted in this
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000022">That
brings me to what has happened since the activists were seized and
taken to Murmansk, which is not a particularly hospitable region for
people to be imprisoned in—I think all right hon. and hon.
Members understand that—and is a considerable distance from most
consular support. That has brought up a series of questions, which I
hope the Minister will be able to answer later, but I do have concerns
about the conditions in which each of the activists has been held. I
think it bizarre that bail has been denied in every single instance. It
feels as if proper criminal justice procedures have not been followed.
Frequently, if not invariably, the activists have been held in solitary
confinement, and I cannot conceive why that would be necessary. It is
not because I am a socialist, although perhaps it
helps—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.]</I> I am sorry to have lost all
the Conservatives in the room, and half the Liberal Democrats. I
believe that the worst thing we can do to a human being is put them in
solitary confinement, because we are by nature social beings. To deny
someone the opportunity to engage with anybody, even somebody who
cannot speak the same language, is a cruel act, which is why I have
concerns about how people are being
treated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000023">It
is clear to me that consular access has not been as easy as it should
have been under all the conventions to which the Russian Federation is
a signatory. There has been uncertain access to lawyers and translators
of the individuals’ choosing. That access is important in
international legal situations, because someone might be given a
lawyer, but it might be one who has no intention of prosecuting the
case in the interests of the detained person. I hope that the Minister
can reply on the issues of consular access and support. Being in a
country where one does not speak the language is particularly solitary.
When Greenpeace activists engage in such activities elsewhere in the
world, nobody expects everything to be roses, but basic levels of
treatment are expected in international law.</hs_Para>

irritating people who want to make a point? That is the challenge for
the international community, and for every country that seeks to be a
democracy and prosper in the modern world. That is why the eyes of the

Geoffrey Cox</B> (Torridge and West Devon) (Con):</Member> I
congratulate the hon. Member for Rhondda (Chris Bryant) on his speech
and on securing the debate and I applaud the approach with which he
commenced. It does not help those who are currently incarcerated in
Murmansk to insult or offend their custodians. What we must do—I
apprehend it was the approach intended by the hon. Gentleman—is
to appeal to the Russian authorities, to His Excellency the Russian
ambassador, who I know is taking an interest in the
proceedings 
<?notus-xml column=82?>this morning, and to the President of Russia. I hope that speakers in
the House today will base their appeal not only upon an analysis of
what occurred that day and during those days in which the Arctic
Sunrise was pursued and seized, but upon the compelling,
compassionate grounds, which are represented in part by the attendance
of the families of some of those who are in custody today.</hs_Para>

constituency, I have the families of Alexandra Harris and Kieron Bryan.
Both families are suffering the inevitable shocking anxiety and anguish
of knowing that those whom they love are isolated and segregated in a
faraway place and accused of something that they are convinced, as I
am, they did not do, and they are anxiously awaiting their return. It
is in that spirit that I hope those who are listening, particularly the
Russian ambassador, will interpret all the remarks that we make this
morning.</hs_Para>

is 29. He was a videographer on the Arctic Sunrise. He was nominated
for an award. He is a talented, young and idealistic man. He was not
there  to break the law; he was on board the ship merely to
record what happened and to keep a record. Alex Harris is 27—my
own daughter’s age—and was on board as a digital
communications officer, in charge of the Twitter account. She was fresh
from joining Greenpeace in Sydney, and has been a volunteer in
Vietnamese orphanages. She is, again, an idealistic young person who
was not there to break the law—far from it—and to whom
the idea of illegal violence would have been anathema, as it would to
Kieron
Bryan.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000041">We
all in this country can be proud of such young people. They were not
intending to threaten the Russian state. They were intending to make a
point about drilling in the Arctic. We all know, as the hon. Member for
Rhondda has said, that drilling in Arctic conditions is a dangerous,
arduous task, and it is inevitable that there will be sensitivities
among those whose task it is to protect such installations, but those
sensitivities should not lead to disproportionate reactions. I agree
entirely with the hon. Gentleman, but, on reflection, I hope that the
Russian ambassador, the President and the authorities currently
conducting the proceedings in Murmansk will reflect that there is an
important principle of law:
proportionality.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000042">Proportionality
must be applied in all circumstances to all the actions of a sovereign
state and its court system. The actions currently being taken against
Alex Harris, Kieron Bryan and others who are under the custody of the
Russian authorities is not proportionate.

the hon. Member for Rhondda said, article 101 of the UN convention on
the law of the sea interdicts illegal acts of violence for private ends
on the high seas. The hon. Gentleman is completely right. Even if there
was an illegal act of violence, which is doubtful, in the mere
ascension of the rig with the intention of placing a banner upon it, it
cannot be said that it was for private ends in the ordinary sense in
which international lawyers mean it. Private ends must mean some form
of deliberate attempt to secure a gain. In such circumstances, I would
urge the Russian authorities to reflect on whether the charge of piracy
is proportionate.</hs_Para>

Gentleman has said, to charge those young idealistic
people—whose interest is not in violence but in peace, and,
while some may think it misguided, is in preservation and creation, not
destruction—with piracy 
<?notus-xml column=83?>is to bring into disrepute the very law that prohibits it. That is why I
urge the Russian authorities, His Excellency the ambassador, who is
listening to this debate, and those who may be listening in Russia
itself to feel that the proportionality of their actions is under
severe
question.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000045">There
is another point that the hon. Gentleman did not mention: the United
Nations convention prohibits actions of this type only on the high
seas. The fact is that the oil rig was within the territorial waters of
Russia, and any act against it would not necessarily be an act under
the UN convention, and that is not prohibited by the UN convention. The
Arctic Sunrise was three nautical miles from the oil rig at the
time—plainly, as the hon. Gentleman said, in international
waters. In such circumstances, the exercise of power under the
convention is questionable at least.</hs_Para>

not wish to dwell upon the steps that were taken by the Russian
authorities and whether or not they were lawful. I wish to dwell upon
the plight of the individuals themselves. In the grim conditions of the
Murmansk jail in which they reside are two young people whose families
I represent. Kieron Bryan is a constituent of the right hon. and
learned Member for Camberwell and Peckham (Ms Harman), who will speak
eloquently on his behalf, but I hope she will forgive me if I say that
I feel a powerful connection to the families of both Alexandra Harris
and Kieron Bryan. They are Devonshire people from the area of Torridge
that I have the privilege to represent. Alexandra Harris was brought up
in a farming family of generations. She went to Dolton and then Great
Torrington school. She attended that school with a constituent who
works for me in my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000047">Kieron
Bryan was brought up in Shebbear, a great village in Torridge that I
know well, so I feel particularly close to those two young people at
this particular time. I urge the Russian authorities to understand that
those two people, as well as all their colleagues at the time, were not
there in any destructive, illegal or lawbreaking spirit. It is ironic
that they are incarcerated in Murmansk, the port to which many convoys
sailed through the Atlantic to bring to the Russians succour in a time
of great need. I ask the President of Russia, the Russian ambassador
and the Russian authorities to think again. The human reality of
Alexandra Harris’s, Kieron Bryan’s and others’
plight is brought home, as the hon. Gentleman said, by the letter that
Alexandra’s mother published only recently and which she has

believe that we need to drill for oil; it is important that we do so. I
would like to get away from relying on fossil fuels—we all know
that—but when we produce and use oil, there is a tremendous
burden on us to ensure that we do so as environmentally safely as
possible. It is incumbent on us all to make sure that every possible
measure is taken to ensure that oil is drilled safely and that measures
are taken to protect the unique and fragile environment of such areas.
Greenpeace, as the hon. Member for Rhondda said, might be a pain at
times, but it highlights vital issues. That is why their members were
on the Russian oil rig, and accusing them of piracy is absurd and
wrong.</hs_Para>

why Greenpeace was highlighting Russian oil-drilling techniques. The
director of Greenpeace, John Sauven, claims that half the
world’s oil spills occur in Russia. He estimated that some 30
million barrels of oil a year are spilt there—six times the 4.9
million barrels thought to have been spilled in the gulf of Mexico.
Considering the environment and what Greenpeace was highlighting, that
is the issue. For me, that is, in a way, also the injustice of what has
happened.</hs_Para>

thought process behind boarding the rig was clearly to highlight the
actions in the Arctic, not to carry out an act of piracy, which is an
absurd accusation. Certainly, the fact that the entire ship was seized
and everyone on board arrested, including two journalists, shows that
the response is less to do with their actions and more to do with the
Russian Government making a statement—or, as some suspect,
trying to hide the truth. I make those comments as well because I think
it is important to do
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000053">That
statement has been made and the world is in no doubt as to the current
stance of the Russians. It is past time that the people were released.
That is why it is right and proper to highlight the issue in
Westminster today. The six UK residents who have been arrested and
held—not, according to media outlets, in the most pleasant of
conditions, as the two previous speakers have mentioned—are an
indication of Russia’s stance. The way in which they have been
treated in prison demands that a message is sent from this place,
making it clear that we want our citizens released along with the other
people on that boat. It is absurd to hold off a trial until November.
To deny bail to such people and to hold them, on trumped-up charges,
far from their families and from access to loved ones is cruel and must
be
stopped.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000054">Europe

tactful in what he said about Russia, and he did not mention some of
the other significant human rights cases, such as those of Mikhail

disproportionate treatment meted out to members of Pussy Riot. I
understand his reasons for being tactful, but there is an issue for
Russia to take notice of: its reputation for human rights abuses, and
the damage being done in that regard, is significant and cumulative. It

Those protests were met, in large part, with good humour, even though
they were probably more significant security breaches in one sense than
anything that the Arctic 30 have done in the waters close to Russia.
However, they were met with good humour and a proportionate response by
the authorities. People were arrested, but they were not charged as
terrorists. It was understood that they were peaceful political

Member for Rhondda was absolutely right to draw attention to the United
Nations convention on the law of the sea. Article 101 has two
fundamental aspects to its definition of piracy. The first is use of
violence, and the other is, as he quite rightly pointed out, the fact
that it is done for private means. Piracy is a criminally violent act,
and that, as even President Putin clearly said, is quite clearly not
what the Arctic 30 were involved in.</hs_Para>

environmental issue in addition to a human rights one. That is, after
all, what Greenpeace was seeking to highlight. As we turn to more and
more novel means of extracting fossil fuels, and go into more and more
extreme environments in our pursuit of them, we are taking higher and
higher risks with the environment. The lessons from the gulf of Mexico
are clear, and there are lessons to be learned not only by Russia, but
by this and other western countries, about novel means of extracting
fossil fuels. My comments are therefore not directed solely at Russia.
If the Arctic 30—certainly those placed under arrest—have
inspired future generations of environmental activists to highlight
such issues, and if they have helped to generate a debate about the
risks of more extreme extraction of fossil fuels, their action will not
have been in vain.</hs_Para>

appropriate to prosecute these people for the act of piracy. There
seemed to be great reluctance, as there was in other cases, to
contemplate any kind of sanctions against Russia for its actions. There
was the rather significant inclusion of the Secretary of State for
Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs in lobbying the Russian Government,

is bringing unprecedented risks to the area and to us all in terms of
climate change. The activists are playing a key role in letting the

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released its latest report on
the science of climate change. Scientists are more certain than ever
that human activity, mainly the burning of fossil fuels, is driving a
powerful underlying trend of rising global temperatures. The IPCC
report also underlines the need for substantial and sustained
reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to limit climate change. For the
first time, it talks about the need for a global carbon
budget—the amount of carbon that it is safe to release into the
atmosphere. That view echoes recent reports from organisations such as
Carbon Tracker. There is a stark choice. If we want to avoid
catastrophic climate change, we need to leave at least two thirds of
existing fossil fuel reserves in the ground, unburned. It does not
matter whether we are talking about Arctic oil, tar sands from Canada
or Madagascar, or shale gas from Sussex; we just need to leave
unconventional fossil fuels in the ground.</hs_Para>

about the treatment of our constituents in the hands of the Russian

changes to the Arctic could have the most deleterious and terrible

Archipelago”, so we know that Russian treatment of prisoners,
whether the charges against them were justified or not, is surely one
of the blackest stories in the history of humankind. I am amazed that
Russia, which seems to want to go back to the old, desperate and surely
discredited tradition, seems to want to replicate it yet again, so soon
after we have seen it take a major step forward in international
affairs by being so central and essential in ensuring that the
inspectors were allowed into Syria, and the chemical weapons will be
destroyed and brought out. Far from arguing on the level of Russia
suddenly discovering a compassionate nature, we should argue with
Russia that that is really good public relations for it.</hs_Para>

somewhat paradoxical, in that it is clearly a very proud nation and yet
sometimes it feels that it is not given sufficient credit for its

Russia’s fault, and on many occasions it could be argued that it

not given sufficient credit for being great, but actions such as
charging these activists with piracy tend to push Russia even further

least two months’ pre-trial detention and possible prison
sentences of up to 15 years. Other speakers have spoken of concern
about the conditions in which they are held. Some are held in solitary

that if his brother went to Murmansk to visit him he would be
questioned at length and would not necessarily have the right

drilling in the Arctic is deeply contentious and it is right that we

The Arctic is warming twice as fast as anywhere else on the planet.
Last September, the extent of the ice cap was at a record low and the
Environmental Audit Committee advised in its excellent report that we
need to re-examine the risk of a summer collapse. It also warned that a
number of tipping points are approaching “with potentially
disastrous consequences”. The tragic irony is that melting of
the ice caps provides greater opportunities for oil and gas
exploration, which will then further accelerate climate
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102346000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102346000139">The

Our consular officials attended 
<?notus-xml column=99?>the preliminary court hearings for all British nationals between 26 and

nationals regularly, and our officials were present during the appeal

particular legal representative. We take up with the Russian
authorities any concerns about prison conditions and access to
appropriate medical treatment, as well as other concerns that detainees
may have. Our latest information is that some of the detainees are
sharing cells and others are in a cell on their own. We have raised any
concerns expressed to us by the detainees with the prison authorities.

Mann</B> (Bassetlaw) (Lab):</Member> It gives me pleasure, or a level
of pleasure, to introduce this debate on policing in Bassetlaw.
However, that pleasure is tempered by what I have to say about the
crisis in policing that is beginning to unveil itself in Bassetlaw.
Other parts of the country are suffering a similar crisis, and they
will continue to suffer it in the future.</hs_Para>

ago, I spent time with the police. I went around on the beat at night,
at weekends and in the daytime, and I sampled the work of the local
police. One sergeant told me, “The way we police in
Nottinghamshire is that we know the criminals.” That approach
raises two questions. First, if we know the criminals, why are they at
large? Secondly, and more seriously, if “we know the
criminals” has been the culture in the Nottinghamshire police
over the years, what about the crimes that were not just undetected but
unreported, because they were not known to be crimes at the
time?</hs_Para>

very real examples are historic sex and child abuse, along with
domestic violence. Those problems were not recognised as existing, but
in the aftermath of the publicity about Savile and others, case after
case was raised in my constituency surgeries. I heard an extraordinary
number of historic allegations. It is not for me to judge whether they
are true, but, on the balance of probabilities, if a lot of people come
forward with entirely unconnected allegations, confident that something
will happen, some, if not all, of those allegations must be true. If a
constituent comes to me with such allegations or other serious
allegations, I take the approach, as I am sure other Members do, that
we should take a rational approach and ensure that our
constituent’s voice is heard.</hs_Para>

claim to know the criminals, there is a problem in the culture. I have
challenged the approach of the Nottinghamshire police directly on many
issues, including in the House, but that culture did begin to be
seriously turned around. However, in turning around culture, working
practices, attitudes and approaches, there is a huge imperative to
ensure that specialism is built up. Yet, in Nottinghamshire, and
specifically in my constituency, the wrong kind of cuts are taking
place. This debate is not the place to discuss Government economic
policy, so I will not go into that, save to say that I have suggested
more than 30 alternative cuts that could be made in different areas,
but not in policing, because the cuts to policing are the wrong kind of
cuts.</hs_Para>

three years, the 999 service has been in crisis. However, those wishing
to make cuts in Bassetlaw forget the nature of the people of Bassetlaw.
We are not averse to standing up and defending our 999 services. When
the fire service proposed closing Retford fire station at nights, there
was a huge public campaign in 2011. That resulted in not only the
reversal of the decision, but a decision to build a brand-new fire
station and the shifting of fire training to Retford. We stood up for
our public service.</hs_Para>

ambulance service decided to close our ambulance stations, we did not
stand by and have some intellectual argument; the people of Bassetlaw
put in more than 90% of the submissions to the consultation, 
<?notus-xml column=103?>as we did with the fire service proposals, and the decision was
reversed. When the hospital tried to close accident and emergency
services, our response was, “No, that will not happen.”
Last week, the Secretary of State for Health cited Bassetlaw hospital,
with its new, seven-day A and E working, as the model for the rest of
the country. Yet, in the past three years, the A and E has been under
direct threat of overnight closure and a reduction in emergency
services.</hs_Para>

true of the proposals for the police: we will not accept the
prioritisation of the police being reduced to such a level that we lose
a critical service. Let me give two precise reasons why. First—I
cannot go into much detail, but I will on another occasion, if I am
given the opportunity—disaster management planning is in chaos.
Mine is one of the areas most at risk, with motorways, the east coast
main line, airports and power stations. Disaster management is no
longer properly planned. Should there be a major disaster in my area,
there will be problems with ambulances and fire engines, given what we
have seen already, and so it is with the police. The police cannot
respond to a major disaster if they are not working at the time, and
there are many times of the week when whole swathes of Bassetlaw are
denuded of police.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102351000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000011">The second
problem—we have not seen many of these closures yet, but there
will be more—is the closing of custody suites and police cells.
At some stage, there will doubtless be an attempt to close the courts
too. What does that mean? Let me give the bare statistics, because they
are astonishing. Every local police officer tells me that the police do
not make many arrests, because there is nowhere to put the person who
has been arrested. If officers make an arrest, they have to take that
person miles to Mansfield, which takes police officers off the job,
leaving no police officers in Bassetlaw.</hs_Para>

public order offences have collapsed in Bassetlaw—they are going
off the scale. Clearly, peace and harmony have broken out overnight on
the streets of Bassetlaw! No, they have not. The police simply cannot
arrest people, because they have nowhere to put the brawlers, the
drunks and the fighters on a Friday and a Saturday night; they have to
take them to Mansfield and Nottingham.</hs_Para>

however, is booming, and the figures are going up. Why? Because there
are no police on the streets deterring the petty, casual repeat
offenders from stealing from shops, but people in the shops still have
the integrity to report shoplifting. Frankly, people are not bothering
to report shed break-ins and such things, because they never get the
police to come. Someone attempted to break into my office last week and
I am still waiting for the police to attend. What they say in my area
is, “If that happens to the local MP”—and I expect
no special privilege—“what on earth will they do for the
rest of us?”</hs_Para>

Nottinghamshire has lost 314 police full-time equivalents—gone.
That is on top of the back office people who have gone; and my area
takes the brunt of it. The police must concentrate on Nottingham, where
there have been a record number, relative to population, of murders in
the past decade. Of course, they need a strong and permanent presence
there and I would not deny them that. It is a higher police priority
than 
<?notus-xml column=104?>Bassetlaw, which is right, fair and proper; but we become the poor
cousins, so that there are times when there are no police, or when the
few who are there are so stretched that they cannot do the
job.</hs_Para>

police can name the streets in my constituency where they have lost
control, and the criminals who run those streets because policing has
reached such a low level. Those people are not being arrested for the
minor offences that it would be easy to arrest them for, which would
nip in the bud their attempts to bully and intimidate the
community.</hs_Para>

what is happening alongside that, with the specialist police. For
example, there is a wholesale failure to investigate historic sex abuse
cases properly. There are plenty of examples, and it would be unfair
and improper to list them, with the possibility of revealing
identities; but that is the other side of the coin, and it affects my
constituency
dramatically.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000017"><Member ContinuationText="Keith Vaz" PimsId="4426" UID="13102351000217" xid="614" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000217"><B>Keith

Mann:</Member></B> In my view the jury is out. One of the cases that I
have told the police about, on six occasions, has never been
prosecuted; but I am certain from the detailed evidence that I have
given on six separate occasions, with different witnesses and different
forms of evidence, that we have plenty of cases that fall between the
national and the local. The problem is that if there are not resources
and expertise in the local police force they do not produce the
evidence for what, in fact—in the case that I have cited six
times to them—is, for my area, very major crime with all sorts
of criminal add-ons. Again, I cannot give details, because that would
probably identify the person or persons involved. That shows, however,
the problem that exists, and the dilemma for the Nottinghamshire police
force.</hs_Para>

duty as a Minister of the Crown to stop the situation that means my
constituency gets a second-class service compared with other places. It
is not an acceptable solution to bring in G4S, with some mobile canteen
operation to sling people into, and to privatise the making of arrests
in Bassetlaw—as if that is appropriate compared with a well
funded professional police resource, with police cells in the police
station. On the streets they say—they will be singing it in
Bassetlaw—“G4S, you’re having a

good enough for my constituents. It is not good enough to close our
police cells. It is not good enough that the number of public order
offences is going down because local police say they cannot arrest
people because cells are not available; and that shoplifting rates are
rocketing because there are not police on the streets and
Nottinghamshire has been denuded of them. Of course, as I have always
argued, Nottinghamshire has, relatively speaking, never had a proper
police funding formula; but within that situation the good people of
Bassetlaw are being let down. We are not prepared to accept

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department (James
Brokenshire):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Bassetlaw

is always a firm and passionate advocate for his constituents, as he
has shown today, even if I may disagree in several respects with the

crime rate remains too high, but the reality is that it is falling, and
has fallen. Recorded crime has dropped yet again, by more than 10%,
under the present Government, and the recent crime survey reports that
crime has more than halved since its peak in 1995. In Bassetlaw
recorded crime fell by 4% in the 12 months from June 2012 to June 2013
and it is down 6% in the Nottinghamshire force area over the same
period.</hs_Para>

important, positive news, and shows that police are rising to the
challenge of making savings while cutting crime and providing a better
service to the public. England and Wales are safer than they have been
for decades. However, I agree that the crime rate remains too high.
That is why we will continue with measures that keep pace with the
changing nature of crime and improve our ability to combat emerging
issues. That is why the landscape that we have established is
important—to make it possible to respond to those emerging
challenges.</hs_Para>

the National Crime Agency was launched, to deal with the most serious
national-level crimes. Just as importantly, it is intended to be a
centre of expertise on dealing with specialist crimes such as
cybercrime and organised crime, and to use its skills and capabilities
to work with the regional organised crime units to provide linkage
between the national, the regional and the local. The Government have
put that landscape in place to ensure that the right skills are in the
right places, and that some of the issues that have been confronted
before—the gaps where regional or local criminality meets
national capability—are more effectively joined
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000027">I

<?notus-xml column=106?>the points made by the hon. Member for Bassetlaw this morning can be
directed at the PCC and the local police, because we have put in place
that direct reform of the landscape, central to which has been giving
people a direct say in how their communities are policed. The election
of police and crime commissioners represented the most significant
democratic reform to policing in decades, giving the public a voice at
the highest level, holding forces to account and helping to restore
trust.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000028">Importantly,
PCCs are best placed to understand the needs of victims in their
communities and to work with the police to cut crime. Indeed, the
commissioner in Nottinghamshire is working closely with the chief
constable to find innovative solutions to deliver better and
financially sustainable policing to the people of Nottinghamshire. They
are looking at ways to increase police visibility and the number of

the police will still have the resources to do their important work.
What matters is how officers are deployed, not necessarily how many
there are. All forces need to look at how front-line services are
delivered, so that the quality of service provided is maintained and
improved. Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary has made it
clear that there is no simple link between officer numbers and crime
levels, between numbers and the visibility of police in the community,
or between numbers and the quality of service provided. Budgets are
falling, but forces are prioritising front-line delivery and crime
continues to
fall.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000032">The
police and crime commissioner is looking at ways to increase police
visibility in Nottinghamshire; his work has seen an increase in the
number of PCSOs, and there are also ambitious plans to do with the
recruitment of special constables, which I strongly endorse. Those are
examples of how PCCs can work together with their chief constable to
deliver real impacts in the communities that they serve. Moreover, PCCs
will become stronger as people become more used to their existence and
see their effect

hon. Gentleman made some sweeping comments on the ability to cope with
major disasters. There is, however, detailed planning, led by the
Cabinet Office, with exercises and other steps escalating from the
local and regional all the way up to Cobra and the national-level
response that can be triggered. There is just such a detailed
approach—the risks are analysed and assessment is made of
whether the right capabilities are in the right place to deal with
them. Indeed, joint working is taking place between the police, the
ambulance service and the fire service to ensure a strong response to
serious terrorist incidents, to take one specific example.</hs_Para>

it is right for the Government to continue to reflect on the important
role that PCCs have in ensuring good, solid emergency response in their
local areas. The hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware of the
recommendations contained in the Knight review, which looked at whether
police and crime commissioners should have a more direct role in the
context of the fire service. The Government are considering
that—we are examining the recommendation from the Knight report,
to see whether it would be appropriate, and we will be providing a
formal response in due
course.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000035">It
is also important to stress that we have scrapped targets for the
police and done away with the myriad types of meaningless and
counterproductive box-ticking that the police were subject to for far
too long. The Government announced a reducing bureaucracy package in
2012, seeking to save up to 4.5 million officer hours
nationally—the equivalent of more than 2,100 additional officers
on the beat. A programme of work is being developed, with the aim of
further freeing up police time in a context of diminishing resources,
so it is about how best to use technology and process
modernisation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000036" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000036">We
are working towards transformational change, which will be recognised
on the front line. The approach of scrapping targets, therefore, is
important, as is the use of technology and the work to do with better
co-ordination and commissioning of services between forces. Rather than
wrapping the police up in bureaucracy, we are driving increased
transparency and accountability. Our reforms are making the police more
responsive to the public. Thus, the police.uk website—of which
the hon. Gentleman is no doubt aware—has had more than 600
million hits since its launch in January 2011. On average, the site
receives more than 300,000 hits per day. It strengthens accountability,
as well as the information available to the public, so that they can
hold policing in their area to
account.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000037">Another
of our reforms is the College of Policing, which is about driving up
standards and developing policing as a profession among officers of all
ranks. That is central to a new focus on evidence-based
policing—distilling and identifying what works in fighting crime
and spreading it throughout all 43 forces. The College of Policing will
devise a code of ethics to be issued to 
<?notus-xml column=108?>every officer, which will equip the police with the leadership skills at
every level to ensure that it is followed. Good leadership, like
anything else, is born of hard work and professionalism. Leadership can
and must be taught, in particular when the ramifications of police
decision making can mean the difference between life and
death.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000038"><B><Member ContinuationText="John Mann" PimsId="1674" UID="13102351000222" xid="407" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000222">John

determines such local priorities and what works well in the context of

to support neighbourhood and front-line policing are in the right

is no denying that Buckinghamshire county council is one of the most
affluent in the south-east, but a high proportion of Cressex students
and their families experience levels of disadvantage equal to those in
northern cities. Nearly half of Cressex students live on estates that
are among the most economically disadvantaged in England, with areas of
entrenched poverty and low skills. The proportion of families with
experience of higher education is below the national average and the
proportion of children living in overcrowded households exceeds the
national average. More than half of students have been eligible for
free school meals in the past six years and are entitled to the pupil
premium.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000056">Although

democratic control, equality and solidarity. Such terms are perhaps
vexed for Conservatives, but separated from state power, they actually
just represent values and ideals that any fully 
<?notus-xml column=112?>formed human being should support. That, to me, explains the defiant
spirit of autonomy that I found. Those values are being used by the
Cressex school to engage with the community around it, and they are
values transforming the lives and prospects of individuals whom we
cannot allow to fall into neglect. Those people must be supported with

course, a school should certainly comply with that. When I look at
“Democratic Member Control”, I start thinking that the
Government need to act, because it seems to me that across the whole
suite of policy areas in education, the Government need to ensure that
when parents, staff and others in the community are engaged in a
school, they have the opportunity for their democratic control to be
meaningful. The next principle is “Member Economic
Participation”—although I paid £1 to become a
member of Cressex co-operative, it does not seem to me, unless an
Opposition Member would like to correct me, that anyone is immediately
leaping to suggest that there should be economic participation in
schools. However, “Autonomy and Independence”—what
a marvellous idea, which seems to go directly to the heart of the

Munn</B> (Sheffield, Heeley) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> Thank you, I think,
Mr Hollobone. It is a delight to take part in the debate. Of course, I
must start by congratulating the hon. Member for Wycombe (Steve Baker)
not just on having secured the debate and established such good
cross-party support for it, but on his speech. He spoke very eloquently
of the reasons why some of us in this room have been co-operators for
many a decade, not just many a year. I warmly welcome him to the cause
of co-operation. It is everything he says it is and should be spread
more widely, not least in our schools. I have always been proud to be a
Labour Member of Parliament, but I am more proud to be a Labour and
Co-operative Member of Parliament. Some of my colleagues also bear that
title. Other Labour Members do not stand as Labour and Co-operative,
but are members of the Co-operative party. It is a set of principles
and a vision that are widely shared.</hs_Para>

repeat what the values are, as the hon. Gentleman has done justice to
that. I shall simply say that I wholeheartedly agree with him that the
values of co-operation could not be more appropriate for schools. This
is about having all parts of the community—not just the teachers
and parents, but people from the community and pupils—involved
in the schools. It is about helping them to understand what it means to
take on responsibility for themselves, helping them to understand that
they have a role in the school and embedding the school firmly where it
is—in its local
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000098" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000098">We
heard the excellent example from the hon. Gentleman of the school in
his constituency that has done so much to persuade him of the values of
co-operation, but that is happening up and down our country. We are
talking about values such as business and enterprise, and values that
are enabling young people to think about going into the world of work,
but in a different way—not a competitive way that is unhelpful,
but one that focuses on the benefits of
co-operation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000099" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000099">Real
strength and depth is emerging in parts of the country, including the
south-west, my own beloved Yorkshire and Humberside and the north-west,
which I am sure we will hear from. Of course, Cornwall, which I am sure
the hon. Member for Truro and Falmouth (Sarah Newton) will speak about
in due course, is looking to become the first county in the country in
which the majority of schools work together mutually to pool resources
in co-operative ways. This revolution in structures and governance is
gaining momentum, and we should all be supporting it. That is why I
want the Government to take more seriously the proposals that I made
back in April this year in my ten-minute rule
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000100">I
support choice in education, but there are barriers that should be
removed to allow more schools to follow the successful model of
co-operation. As the hon. Member for Wycombe said, the legal forms
currently available are industrial and provident societies and
co-operative and community benefit societies. There is no specific
provision in relevant Acts for co-operative schools, so although they
have done well so far and they exist, they are having to work around
the existing structures and legislation. They have been helped
enormously in that by the relevant parts of the co-operative movement,
Co-operatives UK and the Schools Co-operative Society, but that is not
enough. We want this to go
further.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000101">I
am an optimist: I believe that one clause could deal with the issue. Of
course, it would be a powerful clause. I have a draft of the Bill that
I put forward, and would be delighted to pass it to the Minister later.
It suggests that we allow Education Acts to be amended to include the
legal forms that I just mentioned and ensure a level playing field with
other school structures. Of course, I know that any legislation has to
stand up to proper scrutiny. I would warmly welcome the Government
looking at what I have proposed and coming to a view on whether it is
the right way forward. I would like to press the Minister on taking
that
forward.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000102"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Sheerman" PimsId="663" UID="13102351000240" xid="531" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000240">Mr

Munn:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend. That is a very good point
and will, I hope, add strength to what we would
like to see. When I put forward my Bill in April, the hon. Member for
West Suffolk (Matthew Hancock), who is now the Minister for Skills and
Enterprise, was on the ministerial Bench and was kind enough to speak
to me afterwards and to indicate that he thought that this was
something that Government should be looking at. Unfortunately, my
letter to him either got lost in his office or disappeared somewhere
when there was a transfer of responsibilities, but I would be grateful
if the Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for
Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson), could take back with him a commitment
to come back to me and to the hon. Member for Wycombe on the
Government’s view on this issue.</hs_Para>

that legislation as simple as the measure that I have
described—a simple amendment allowing the Education Acts to be
amended to recognise these forms of school—could enable us to
move forward relatively quickly and, as the hon. Gentleman said, would
firmly put action behind the warm words that we have heard about
co-operatives from the Prime Minister and other members of the
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0001.htm#13102351000105">However,
I have not limited myself to just one clause in my ten-minute rule
Bill, because that would mean that part of the change that is needed
would be missed out. My second clause focuses on nursery schools, to
which the hon. Member for Wycombe referred. Labour Members have to hold
their hands up; the Education and Inspections Act 2006, passed by the
previous Government, did not allow nursery schools to become school
trusts, and so prevented them from becoming co-operatives. We need
legislation to change that. It is important because co-operatives, by
their nature, are based in a geographical area that serves a group of
people, otherwise known as the local community. The idea that a
co-operative trust could be a school from nursery through to secondary
level, and perhaps through to further education—those are other
potential areas for the development of co-operatives that I will not
deal with today—is powerful. Allowing it to happen is relatively
simple, and we should do it.</hs_Para>

Brennan:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a strong point. About two
years ago, I visited Upper Shirley high school in Southampton, which is
part of a co-operative trust with an all-through arrangement that
includes a local FE college. There is also a co-operative trust in
Tiverton in Devon. If the Government were able to look at the issues
with nursery schools, that could be a powerful force to promote such
all-through co-operative development
trusts.</hs_Para>

Munn:</Member></B> I entirely agree and am grateful for the example.
The important aspect is that parents obviously first become involved
with schools as institutions at nursery. They are often more likely to
be present in the building, because they bring their children there,
and possibly take part in parents’ groups, so if they were
introduced to the values of co-operation at that point, they would see
it as a normal way to get involved in their child’s education
and schooling throughout the age
groups.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000108">One
of the most powerful aspects of Sure Start, which the previous
Government introduced, was that, in a non-threatening, non-stigmatising
way, parents from 
<?notus-xml column=118?>all parts of society were made to feel welcome entering the building
where their children were being supported in their education. I know
from my constituency and my experience working in social services that
many young parents who have had not good experiences in school do not
like to cross the threshold, because doing so brings back bad memories.
It is enormously powerful to involve, from that early point, the values
of co-operation and support, and to say not only, “Come in,
because your child is here,” but “Come in and have your
say. We are all equal; all have equal membership.” From the
first, it creates a different relationship between the parents and the
people providing the education and support for children. The Minister
should look closely at that second change.</hs_Para>

Sheerman:</Member></B> My hon. Friend and I are both Co-operative
Members, and she knows that I have set up a few co-operatives myself.
Does she agree that being a co-operative is not a panacea? On this sad
day of the demise of the Co-operative bank as an independent
co-operative, it would be wrong of us, as Co-operative Members, not to
put on the record that sometimes people get into co-operatives for
reasons of venality, and that through incompetence things can go wrong.
Full involvement in a co-operative is needed to stop that happening.
Today is a sad day for many co-operators.</hs_Para>

glad that is on the record. I would like to offer two points of
comfort. First, given the way in which the credit markets were
manipulated by central banks over the past few years—Members
know that is one of my favourite subjects—no bank was likely to
escape, so I am not surprised that the Co-operative bank was one that
did not. Secondly, although we may be small in number, our spirit for
co-operation is that of tigers. Co-operation’s moment has come.
It will be victorious, and in future the co-operative movement will
surge away.</hs_Para>

Co-operative schools do not act in isolation. I commend to her the work

with its local nurseries and primary schools. It feeds them, as equal

to a conclusion, Mr Hollobone. There is wide support for the changes,
which the Government now need to action. The NASUWT, a trade union
active in many schools, is supportive of the model. It creates, as has
been discussed, a basis on which people come together as equal parts to
run schools, try to achieve excellence and work in their communities.
Everybody should see co-operation as fundamental to education. It
should be part of the process, and is what will help all our children
and young people to do their best. I thank all the co-operative
movement: the Co-operative party, which produced an excellent briefing,
and drafted the clauses for, and supported me in introducing, the
ten-minute rule Bill; and the Schools Co-operative Society, which has
been enormously important in ensuring that the schools that have taken
on the model are supported, and that growth is achievable in a way that

start by talking about some of the shifts that we have seen in
education in recent years and conclude by talking about some of the
ways in which the co-operative movement may be able to contribute to
and shape that story, rather than merely being subject 
<?notus-xml column=120?>to it. We have already discussed several excellent co-operative schools
across the country. Cressex, to which the hon. Member for Wycombe

co-operative
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000120">In
Luton South we do not have a co-operative school, but we are keen to
have one. Co-operative schools, and co-operative education in general,
empower local people to take responsibility for the education that they
best understand. Co-operative education avoids many of the traps
inherent in the fragmentation of education that has occurred in recent
years, particularly when it comes to the dispersal of power, which is
abused in the education system more often than we tend to
admit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000121">In
the past 10 or 20 years, under successive Governments, control and
responsibility for education has shifted from local authorities to
individual schools. As many Opposition Members have argued in recent
years, however, I believe that under the coalition Government we have
seen an expression not of localism but of centralism. In other words,
the Secretary of State has been given direct responsibility over
individual schools. In Luton, we have real issues around community
cohesion, we are a good size to allow democratic control to be
exercised across all our schools, and schools working in partnership
are a key part of where we hope to be in future and the kind of
community that we seek to shape. Many of the Government’s
choices and decisions have, therefore, been unfortunate for our
attempts to pursue our
ends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000122">Whatever
we feel about the shift, under either of the previous two Governments,
towards more individual schools taking responsibility, taking ownership
and taking governance, the change has happened. We see that in the
statistics on the adoption of the academy and free school models.
Co-operative education provides a powerful mechanism for harnessing
some of the positives of that shift, such as the exercise of leadership
and good teaching quality, which we understand to be most crucial for
raising standards in schools and the provision of
education.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000123" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000123"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Sheerman" PimsId="663" UID="13102351000253" xid="531" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000253">Mr

not take place, without sidestepping effective governance? That is

my own experience of mixed provision of education, public interest
units can sometimes run schools autonomously, which can be good for
local authorities. In Luton, two of our high schools became academies
under the previous Government’s academies programme, which was
designed for schools that were struggling to keep up with others. A
further education provider came in and ran those schools. There has
been, and continues to be, a strand of scepticism and concern in the
community 
<?notus-xml column=121?>when schools are taken over, which we must acknowledge, but the
education provider had a trusted relationship with
the local authority and was able to step in and improve
results.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000126">A
free school has opened in the centre of my constituency. It seemed
bizarre to me that the only way in which we could get the basic primary
school allocation of places was to bar the local authority from running
the school, but we had to find a way to get that allocation, because
there is a massive push on places. We found an arm’s-length
council body to run the free school. It was a good example of how to
use the existing system and to link it back into the community, and I
believe that it is a really positive
development.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000127">In
the mix of those different models, I believe that the co-operative

encourage local authorities and others to adopt the co-operative model

harness leadership is not usually to parachute it in from
outside—sometimes that has to be done if a  
<?notus-xml column=122?>school has failed the community consistently over a period of time,
which usually comes down to school leadership—but to empower
members of the community who, day in and day out, serve young people
and families to get on and lead. That goes right to the heart of how
the co-operative governance model works. Those are not simply
structures; they are values. It is not about looking to see how we
could design an over-engineered, so-called democratic arrangement. It
is about saying that certain values of the co-operative movement, in

extremely
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000135">In

the transition into academies or other types of governance, and the
results of that, has been questioned. That has happened in Basildon,

advantage of the co-operative movement is not just the structure, but
the ethos. However, the structure is a key factor: the idea that all of
us with an interest in education locally can shape it locally and
question the authority that is exercised, instead of constantly looking
up and across to centralised power in Whitehall and Westminster, or to
the immediate leadership of the school. In that way, the co-operative
model can present a powerful, positive argument for allowing schools
and communities to exercise their own power.</hs_Para>

to grow up in a comprehensive system, with local democratic
accountability through voting for and selecting councillors, portfolio
holders and leaders, because the link with the community was not
broken. Co-operative schools go right to the heart of that issue, and

democratic control, in which the people who care most passionately
about education—the parents, children, teachers, school leaders

power.</hs_Para>

speaking to people in local authorities that there is still some
misunderstanding about what a co-operative is. That should not surprise
us, because we sometimes encounter the same degree of misunderstanding
in Parliament, and such things may be difficult for people to get their
head around. However, if we are to have genuine choice and to move away
from one-size-fits-all comprehensive education, which I have talked
about already, it is important to put all the options on the table, and

teaching, great leadership and the values underpinning a school and
education system. It is interesting that the process that has been
going on, which is a quiet revolution in the system—and people
talked about a revolution in the debate—has received hardly any
media coverage. Yes, the Government have a flagship policy for free
schools, but there are far more co-operative schools than free schools.
No one would think that from reading the papers and following the news.
Certainly, a lot more Department for Education staff are devoted to
free schools than to co-operatives. There are more than 100, are there
not? I did not realise there were that many left in the Department. It

relation to actual delivery and policy, it would be good to see more
resources within the Department being devoted to co-operative schools,
since the Secretary of State has made it so clear that he is powerfully
in favour of their development. That is important because it provides a
bulwark against what some people fear—that the current upheaval
in the structure of the schools system could lead to the idea that the
Secretary of State has entertained from time to time: a system of
taxpayer-funded, profit-making schools. That idea was tried in Sweden

system was a model. The Secretary of State was infatuated with Swedish
models, but he does not talk about them much any more. Sweden had
profit-making free schools, but what happened was perhaps predictable.
There are two ways to make a profit: increase revenue or cut costs. Of
course, there are limited opportunities for taxpayer-funded schools to
increase revenue. In Sweden, once hedge funds and the like invested in
the schools, it led to the cutting of costs.</hs_Para>

is no requirement for qualified teachers, an obvious way to cut costs
is to employ people who do not have to be paid qualified teacher rates.
As a result, some of the schools went bust, with consequences for the
education of the children, and also with the consequence ultimately
that the legislation was overturned and a requirement was reintroduced
for qualified teachers in the schools. There were no real educational
or co-operative values underpinning the schools, which left them as the
prey of hedge fund managers and the like. <I>[Interruption.] </I>If

economic participation. We know—we discussed it

assure hon. Members that the Government are wholeheartedly supportive
of the role that school partnerships and co-operation play in achieving
our shared goal of a high-performing and self-improving education
system. As my hon. Friend said, we are in danger of fierce agreement.
Politics is not always as black and white as people think it is. Shared
values can surface, and this is one such occasion. There is an
underlying cause to which we all want to contribute, which is ensuring
that every child, whatever their start in life, gets the best possible
chance to reach their full potential, as the hon. Member for Cardiff

increase in performance for all schools involved in that partnership,
even—this should be noted—for high-performing schools
that support weaker schools. As Dr Chris Tomlinson, the phenomenally
successful executive principal of the Harris academy Greenwich, Harris
academy Chafford Hundred and the primary attached to that in the Harris
federation of schools,
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102351000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000205">“Working

my hon. Friend the Member for Wycombe has set out, one of the
interesting things about the example of Cressex community school is
that it is a maintained school in partnership with a successful
converter academy and an independent school, among other partners. That
is exactly the sort of partnership that we are developing through our
academies programme and in other education reforms.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13102351000168" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000168">We should,
and do, cherish the values of co-operative trust schools, in particular
the importance of shared responsibility for problems and for designing
solutions, and the importance of those involved in a child’s
learning having a stake in that learning. As we have heard, since the
Education and Inspections Act 2006, which introduced trust school
status—the hon. Member for Denton and Reddish reminded us that
the first was in his constituency—we have seen a steady and
increased pace of such schools being set up. Their number is up from
188 in September 2011, as we have heard, to more than 700 by the end of
this year. That in itself demonstrates that the permissive nature of
the establishment of such 
<?notus-xml column=128?>schools is doing nothing to prevent schools from starting to form trusts
and relationships. Cornwall is perhaps the most acute example of where
that is happening right across a
county.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000169">The
co-operative trust model is one of many that can facilitate effective
partnership working. In an increasingly diverse education system, many
different models are emerging, which is increasing choice for parents,
which we want to see more of, as well as increasing support for
schools. We now have academy chains, where schools formally work
together, often sharing governance and leadership while benefiting from
the autonomy of academy status.</hs_Para>

sponsored academies, with more and more outstanding schools now
formally sponsoring weaker schools so as to bring about improvement.
Six such sponsored academies are co-operative trust academies. We also
have federations, where maintained schools formally share governance
and expertise. There is also the sharing of head teachers and senior
leadership teams; teaching schools; national or local leaders of
education; the independent and state schools partnership; and other
formal partnerships, such as the Bradford partnership, a not-for-profit
organisation consisting of schools from that city working together to
improve outcomes for young
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000171" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000171">In
that eclectic mix of different models, it will come as no surprise to
hon. Members that the Government’s view is that academy status
is effective in driving improvement and collaboration. That status is
now enjoyed by close to 3,400 schools in England. We believe that
teachers and head teachers, not politicians and bureaucrats, should
control schools and have more power over how they are run in the best
interests of students. With well over half of secondary schools now
being academies, and primary schools joining the programme at an
increasing rate, research has found that more than a quarter of
academies have seen their relationship with other schools improve since
they became academies.</hs_Para>

is clear that the freedom that academies have has led to an increase in
standards, and that the highest-performing institutions are helping to
improve the weakest. As Mary Speakman, head teacher of Altrincham

need extra support is increasing, and to note the increasing number of
co-operative schools choosing academy status and becoming co-operative
academies. I do not think that the schools have to live in isolation
from one another. They share many of the values that, as has been

While I do not wish to argue about party, it seems to me that the

in relationships, which is all moving in the direction of
co-operatives. I am grateful to the Minister for his approach to the

juncture, I should perhaps talk about the ten-minute rule Bill
introduced back in April by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley. Some
of its provisions related to the status of industrial provident

the hon. Lady will know, by virtue of having brought in the Bill, some
elements of the 2006 Act preclude nurseries from inclusion in such
co-operative trust arrangements. We are currently consulting on
measures to make it easier for schools to extend their age range
downwards—for example, from five to 11 for primary schools, to
three to 11—so nursery classes in those schools would be able to
adopt co-operative ideals. I anticipate that she will understand that
some nurseries will therefore still exist outside the extended school
system and that it is not possible for them to be
trusts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000184">I

assistance to have a meeting with her and my hon. Friend the Member for

the need for legislation and, as my hon. Friend the Member for Luton

unaware.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000186"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Timpson" PimsId="5321" UID="13102351000278" xid="581" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000278">Mr
Timpson:</Member></B> I am glad that we have managed to come to another
co-operative consensus in this debate. Given the steep rise in the
number of co-operative trusts in England, it is important to look
seriously at their impact and where they fit into our attempts to
establish the most effective education for all our children. As the
hon. Lady rightly points out, much of that involves good joint working
relationships that should provide incentives for schools to develop
higher educational standards.</hs_Para>

several other advantages. The biggest contribution to school leadership
development lies in providing the rich and varied opportunities that
will lead to the innovation and responsibility that we want schools to
show. Collaborative working can, therefore, provide a broader base for
developing leaders, and a greater opportunity for leaders to learn from
one another. As I have seen in my constituency, it gives such leaders a
greater experience of not only what is going on in their schools, but
in surrounding ones and at different levels or key
stages.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000188">Working
more closely together increases the scope for shared learning and
continuous professional development, and helps to improve the capacity
of small schools—another important point made by my hon. Friend
the Member for Wycombe—by creating a greater pool of resources
and expertise that can be shared more flexibly between schools. School
leaders tell us that they can recruit and retain the best staff by
providing them with professional challenge and support in working with
other
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000189">One
major advantage of shared arrangements has been the improvement in the
governance of weaker schools. It is typical for governing bodies of
sponsored chains to be supported in their monitoring role not only by
training, but by receiving data that are collated and presented to main
boards and local governors in a standard format. The format will
normally report on progress against targets and previous performance,
comparisons with national benchmarks and the performance of other
academies in the
chain.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000190">Another
advantage is that central costs can be shared across more schools,
giving them greater purchasing power in partnership than they would
have as stand-alone schools. They can also benefit from economies of
scale and from the pooling of resources. The use of shared business
management as a resource across schools has been shown to lead to
improved efficiencies and the more effective use of resources across
schools. Collaborative working also opens up new opportunities to adapt
the primary and secondary curriculums to meet local needs, and it
allows schools to put in place stronger academic transition procedures
between different phases of
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000191">The
hon. Member for Huddersfield (Mr Sheerman) raised the issue of the
Treasury’s proposed tax changes. Obviously I need to look
carefully at that to establish 
<?notus-xml column=132?>exactly whether they will play out as he suggested. On ensuring that we
have a crisper, clearer legislative framework, that builds on the
matters raised by the hon. Member for Sheffield, Heeley. Whatever we do
in education, we must ensure that it raises standards and that it is
sustainable, which is another reason it is important to look at the
impact of co-operative trusts on our educational
system.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000192">We
have managed to transcend a partisan debate, mainly because, as I said
at the outset, we have many shared values that do not always have an
opportunity to rise to the surface in political debate or in our
efforts to make our wider political points as we think is most
effective. We do not, however, have anything to fear from
co-operatives. Whatever side of the political spectrum we are on, we
should embrace the values they
offer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000193">The
debate has been an opportunity to celebrate the success and the growing
involvement of the co-operative movement in our schools, and to
acknowledge that at its core are values that we all hold dear, wherever
we sit on the political spectrum—a commitment to social justice
and moral purpose, a combined spirit of autonomy, a deep desire to help
ensure that children and young people across our communities, but
especially in the most challenging areas, get every opportunity to make
the most of their education and, wrapping around those values, strong
community roots that bind in a joint sense of responsibility and,
perhaps most importantly, of caring for others. We all have some
compassionate bones in our body, and such values have risen to the
surface today, which is a testament to the fact that  the
co-operative movement does much to enrich our communities, as it does
more and more within our
schools.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102351000194" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102351000194">I

hugely value the co-operative movement’s work in our schools. We
want to learn more about the effect that it is having, what it is
achieving and how it can do more in the future. As my hon. Friend the
Member for Wycombe said, many schools are still deciding and choosing,
as are parents, what sort of schools they want their children to be in.

continue to push for higher educational standards in whatever form, and

course the UK’s leading armed forces charity. It provides
practical, emotional and financial support to all members of the
British armed forces, past and present, and their families. Secondly,
it actively campaigns to improve lives, and it safeguards the military
covenant between the nation and its armed forces. By the bye, I am
pleased that the Government have published that covenant, setting out
the relationship between the nation, the state and the armed forces. It
recognises that the whole nation has a moral obligation to members of
the armed forces and to their families, and it establishes how they can
expect to be treated. Community covenants are also being signed across
the country, bringing military and civilian communities
together.</hs_Para>

Its aim is to make the legion more visible, more relevant and more

it is more terrible to lose a supportive and friendly establishment for
many legion members who depend on it. It provides a warm drop-in for
those who want it. Every table is neatly decorated with tinsel or
flowers, depending on the season, and it provides a fuller space when
that is wanted as well. Thirdly, it is the kind of community hall that
already has 500 bookings for next year. I would be interested to know
of any community venue that can rival that. In fact, now I

relevant and more accessible, then it should listen and be visible in
the Norwich community, and work constructively with local volunteers.
We are all behind the legion and its wonderful volunteers, and we do

earlier that I would return to the topic of the year ahead. As you
know, Mr Hollobone, 2014 will mark a momentous milestone in
British history—100 years since the outbreak of world war one.
The centenary offers a special opportunity to commemorate not the war
and the bloodshed, but the dedicated men and women who sacrificed so
much to protect the United Kingdom. It also presents a very important
chance to 
<?notus-xml column=136?>educate a new generation of young people about the war, to ensure that
the lessons of that extraordinary time are not lost.</hs_Para>

Minister will no doubt remind us, the Prime Minister has laid out the
Government’s plans to mark the centenary. He has announced that
support will be available for projects and initiatives, large and
small, in local communities across the UK, in the form of Heritage
Lottery Fund grants. I hope to work with councils, heritage groups and
charities such as the Royal British Legion to mark the centenary
locally. It is a matter of shame, I am afraid to say, that the Labour
administration at Norfolk county council has rejected that idea,
telling me that it has a rather full diary at the moment. It would be a
matter of sadness, and downright discourteous to veterans and serving
members of the armed forces, if the Labour administration at county
hall did not have the time, inclination or gumption to do this job
properly.</hs_Para>

express, perhaps, their interest in the work of the legion, and for the
Minister perhaps to tell us a little more not only about the
commemoration plans but about the way that he works incredibly hard in
his brief to support charities. Perhaps he can suggest further ways in
which the Royal British Legion can do its job and be supported strongly

Remembrance day—in my area, we lay one on the Saturday and one
on the Sunday; I will also lay one at a former Air Force base on the
Monday—we genuinely remember, respect and honour the people who

British Legion in his constituency, I must also take the opportunity to
place on record my recognition of the incredible work done in the
“third North”, which is my constituency of Ruislip,
Northwood and Pinner, in particular the work of the legion’s

has opened my eyes to some other work that the Royal British Legion is
doing that I was not aware of—work that is frankly magnificent.
For example, there was the recent opening of its centre for blast
injury studies at Imperial college London, which is the first
collaboration of its kind in the United Kingdom and where civilian
engineers and scientists work alongside military doctors to reduce the
effect of roadside bombs and improvised explosive devices. The legion
has also teamed up with Help for Heroes to officially open the Phoenix
House recovery centre in Yorkshire, where injured and sick service
personnel from across north England and Scotland can recover and access
key services. The legion is an enormously important institution, and I
am sure, Mr Hollobone, that it does wonderful work in Kettering
too.</hs_Para>

specific issue of the Jubilee hall in Norwich, I quite understand the
passion underpinning that project; I have similar situations in my
constituency. My hon. Friend the Member for Norwich North will know
that it is not for the Government to intervene in  a
charity’s decisions, however unpopular they are, but  I
am absolutely sure that the Royal British Legion  will listen
very carefully to this debate and will have heard her message about the
community’s desire to save Jubilee hall.</hs_Para>

will also know that the Government are very keen to support this kind
of community-led response. She mentioned the Localism Act 2011. That
Act introduced the community right to bid, which, as she said, allows
communities and parish councils to nominate buildings or land for
listing by the local authority as an asset of community value.
Exploring this option—asking the local authority to list the
hall as an asset of community value, in line with the Act—seems
eminently sensible.</hs_Para>

Friend may or may not be aware of is that, at a time when there is not
a lot of money around, significant funding is being made available to
support communities that want to take over buildings and assets. In
June, I was proud to hear the Prime Minister announce a quarter of a
billion pounds of funding at an event at the G8, which will be
dedicated over the next 10 years by Big Society Capital and the Big
Lottery Fund, to help communities own local assets, such as pubs,
shops, community centres and sports facilities. More details of that
programme will be announced shortly.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend also asked me to talk a little about the commemoration
plans to mark the centenary of the outbreak of the first world war,
which all the speakers today have talked passionately about. They will
know that the first world war was a period of almost unparalleled
importance in our country’s history. I am proud to say that the
Government are taking a strong lead in commemorating the centenary in a
way that I hope is appropriate. The centenary will not only focus on
military history but on the social and cultural changes that the war
brought about, telling not just soldiers’ stories but those of
men and women on the home front. We should remember that there were
almost 900,000 deaths of British service personnel during the first
world war, so it is entirely appropriate that remembrance lies at the
heart of the
commemoration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000039">We
are working hard to encourage public interest and engagement, showing
why the first world war still matters in the 21st century and is
relevant to people today—including myself—through their
family histories. My hon. Friend will know that the Department for
Culture, Media and Sport is the co-ordinating Department, but several
Departments are working together to deliver what I hope will be a
strong, diverse and inclusive programme. There is strong support from
bodies such as the Imperial War museum, the Commonwealth War Graves
Commission, the BBC and the Heritage Lottery Fund, all of which have a
big role to play in securing public engagement and all of which are
represented in the programme’s governance structure.</hs_Para>

£53 million of funded activity across a range of undertakings,
including a major capital project at the Imperial War museum, Heritage
Lottery Fund grants for community projects and moneys for other 
<?notus-xml column=139?>cultural activity. For example, the first world war centenary
battlefield tours project is offering students and teachers from every
state-funded secondary school in England the opportunity to visit
battlefields and other notable sites and to take part in remembrance
ceremonies on the western front. That will be an enormously powerful
experience for them. The tours start in spring next year and will run
until 2019. Schools, including those in Norfolk, have been piloting the
scheme, with pupils visiting battlefields at Ypres and the Somme. More
than 1,000 schools have already registered for the tours from next
spring, which is well ahead of the planned target. As my hon. Friend
the Member for Ilford North said so powerfully, the bravery and
suffering of the heroic men and women who gave their lives so

never be forgotten.</hs_Para>

the Government recognise the massive contribution that is made by our
servicemen and women. The words trip easily enough, but it is important

asking them to do dangerous jobs in places such as Afghanistan and

Bilateral investment treaties have generally been seen as benign,
technical instruments, but developments in their use in the past 10
years or so have raised doubts about their benign character. Those
doubts certainly arise in the case of the UK-Colombia bilateral

reaching the view that Occidental broke Ecuadorian law when selling its

ask the Minister to take the opportunity presented by the forthcoming
ratification, and indeed by other negotiations for new investment

have three areas of concern about the current use of bilateral
investment treaties that I think make a review necessary. First, it is
not clear that the human rights impact of such treaties is in line with
the UK Government’s policy. That is a particularly pressing
concern in the case of Colombia, where the human rights situation is so
precarious, particularly in relation to workers’ rights and land
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000054">According
to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Colombia has
the largest number of internally displaced people in the world after
Sudan—there were 5.7 million internally displaced people in
Colombia by the end of the 2012—largely due to land-grabbing
around mineral and resource-rich sites. Colombia has enacted a land
restitution law to restore more than 2 million hectares of
land to people from whom it had been wrongly taken, but that
restoration has not yet taken place. Human Rights Watch reported last
month that only one family have to date had their land
returned.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000055">There
is serious concern that a bilateral investment treaty could make the
implementation of land reform even more difficult; it could trigger
demands from foreign investors for compensation if, for example, cases
were brought forward in which land occupied by an investor that had
previously been appropriated from someone else and then sold to the
investor was restored to its original and rightful owners. Such
processes could potentially scupper the prospects for land restitution,
which is widely recognised as key to Colombia’s future
stability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000056"><Member ContinuationText="Lisa Nandy" PimsId="5612" UID="13102352000084" xid="1169" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000084"><B>Lisa
Nandy</B> (Wigan) (Lab):</Member> I am grateful to my right hon. Friend
for giving way, for the powerful case he is making and for bringing
this debate to the House. The recent UK action plan on business and
human rights was strongly welcomed because of some of the difficulties
that he raises, but it is unfortunately silent on remedy and redress
for victims of such abuses. Indeed, recent legislation has restricted
the ability of victims of actions by UK companies overseas to access
justice through the UK courts. Does he agree that it is essential that
we build on the momentum that the Government and others have created to
ensure adequate redress when bilateral investment treaties are
breached, and that otherwise we risk undermining the host
country’s ability to meet its international human rights
obligations? Would he also welcome a response from the Minister on
that, either today or at a later date?</hs_Para>

the consortium comprising Christian Aid, the Catholic Fund for Overseas
Development, Oxfam and others, is particularly worried about the
potential threat to land restitution. The UK-Colombia treaty risks
making it impossible for Colombia to restore land that has been stolen
from its previous owners, thereby potentially restricting the
implementation of future peace agreements with the guerrillas and
limiting reparations to victims of human rights violations. Land
injustices have been at the centre of the long-running conflict in
Colombia, as the Minister knows. I gather that a treaty with Ethiopia
is likely to come up next, which raises a similar set of issues on land
and rights, so there is a pressing case for carrying out a policy
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000059">My

is welcome reassurance. The review that I am suggesting would enable
the Government to make good on that commitment in the specific context
of bilateral investment
treaties.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000061">Secondly,
there is a worry that investment rules in bilateral investment treaties
could restrict the ability of Governments to set policies in the
interests of their public. The investor-state dispute settlement
mechanism allows foreign firms to sue Governments when and if they feel
that their interests have been violated by a new law or policy. That is
a pretty big limitation on the right of citizens to elect a Government
to change the policy of the preceding
Government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000062">I
am chair of the trustees of Traidcraft, the fair trade organisation,
which has drawn the issue to my attention—I declare that
interest, although the role is unpaid. I share that concern about the
restriction on the ability of developing country Governments to pursue
policies that have worked elsewhere—such as land reform or
requiring investors to give preference to local
suppliers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000063">The
concern, however, does not apply only in developing countries. The US
tobacco firm, Philip Morris, is suing Uruguay and Australia over their
anti-smoking laws. The company argues that warning labels on cigarette
packs or plain packaging prevent it from displaying its trade mark
effectively, causing a loss in market share. The threat of legal action
against the UK under a bilateral investment treaty might be a factor in
thinking about the introduction of plain packaging proposals here, so
developing countries are certainly not the only ones in the frame. The
US company Lone Pine Resources Inc. is demanding US $250 million in
compensation from Canada for introducing a moratorium on fracking,
because of environmental risk concerns. Corporations have used
investor-state settlement provisions to challenge environmental, land
use, energy and other laws.</hs_Para>

worried that such claims bypass domestic courts and are heard in
private—behind closed doors—in tribunals made up of three
arbitrators, behind closed doors at the International Centre for
Settlement of Investor Disputes. My hon. Friend the Member for Wigan
reminded the House that any such decision is extremely difficult to
change. In some instances, the existence of the cases is barely known
at all; even when they are known, the reasons for decisions or the
level of awards by a tribunal are not always
disclosed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000065">There
is concern that the system has led to bad decisions, which is
particularly important given that an arbitration tribunal can make
unlimited monetary awards. In 2012, dispute settlement compensations
awarded to corporations ranged from US $2 million to, in the Ecuadorean
case that I mentioned, nearly $1.8 billion; lots of pending claims
total billions of US dollars. Disputes between multinational companies
and Colombia under the UK-Colombia treaty would be confidential and
heard by the international tribunal, despite the growing recognition
worldwide, not least on the part of the UK Government, that
transparency is vital to democratic processes, good governance and the
rule of law.</hs_Para>

there is at least a question mark about whether the treaties do, in
fact, succeed in attracting additional foreign investment into
signatory countries. A number of studies suggest no significant
correlation between a country’s level of foreign direct
investment—we all want to increase such levels in developing
countries—and the decision to adopt treaties that include those
broad investor
protections.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102352000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102352000067">I
hope, therefore, that the Government will review their policy on
bilateral investment treaties, in view of the lack of transparency, the
use of the investor-state dispute settlement mechanism, the imbalance
of rights and responsibilities, and the potential to undermine human
rights in countries where investment is taking place. I am grateful to
the Minister for his readiness to respond. I accept that part of the
responsibility on the subject rests with the Department for Business,
Innovation and Skills, but the Foreign and Commonwealth Office clearly
has a key role as well. I look forward to what he has to say in

Government’s aim in developing bilateral investment treaties is
to provide a high level of protection for companies from one country
that invest in the other country. In particular, we aim to ensure that
British

general, the UK Government believe that such treaties have a positive
impact, protecting investors against unfair expropriation and
mistreatment, and encouraging investment. As the right hon. Gentleman
said, however, bilateral investment treaties need to strike the right
balance between providing protection for investors and giving
Governments the space that they need to regulate in the public
interest. The UK aims to achieve that balance in its treaties and, now
that competence for foreign direct investment has transferred to the
European Union, in treaties concluded by the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102353000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102353000004">To
begin addressing some of the comments and questions of the right hon.
Gentleman, increasing transparency in governance at home and
internationally is a priority for the Government. Next week, I am
pleased to say, we will be hosting the Open Government Partnership
summit here in London, and that will be a key theme. We have also
pushed for greater openness in investment arbitration, and I am pleased
that new UN rules on transparency will enter into force next year. The
hon. Member for Wigan (Lisa Nandy) made an intervention about redress
in particular, but we will write to her with a fuller
answer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102353000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102353000005">In
response to the related concern about giving  away privileges
to distant tribunals, while the system is clearly not
perfect—hence, for example, our work on
transparency—overall we see such tribunals as positive. They
have long been a feature of the international system and are considered
generally to provide a dependable way for investors to achieve justice,
where it cannot be achieved through the domestic legal system of the
country in which they have invested. The tribunals are, therefore,
important to guaranteeing investors’ rights and to preserving
stable investment climates, which, in turn, help to encourage economic
development. Without access to an international tribunal, such benefits
would be lost. Furthermore, if we did not have tribunals, what should
replace them? The right hon. Gentleman did not answer that question in
his speech—I am happy to accept an intervention, should he wish
to make
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102353000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102353000006">The
right hon. Gentleman asked whether the Government intend to review
their policy on investment protection. As I have mentioned, competence
for foreign direct investment has now transferred to the EU. Since that
transfer in 2009, the UK has not negotiated any new treaties. It
retains the right to do so, but it has no immediate plans to negotiate
new treaties. It does not, therefore, make sense for the UK to launch a
full-scale review of our policy on such matters at present. That said,
I reassure him that, in ongoing EU negotiations, we are pushing hard to
achieve that important balance—guaranteeing fair treatment for
investors, without an adverse impact on Governments’ rights to
regulate in the public interest. That is also a principle that we will
apply in any new treaties that the UK
negotiates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102353000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/halltext/131023h0002.htm#13102353000007">Our
intention is to place before Parliament shortly a ratification
instrument that will bring the UK-Colombia bilateral investment treaty

appropriate time and will be able to explain exactly, if I cannot. It

ratified. I believe that it is a positive move. It will cover all
existing British investments in Colombia, which currently total

too long honest drivers have been bearing the cost—through
higher insurance premiums—of fraudulent and exaggerated whiplash
claims. The Association of British Insurers indicates that 7% of all
motor claims were fraudulent, and that dishonest personal motor
insurance frauds worth £441 million were detected by the
industry in 2011. The Government want to tackle that abuse to help
drive down the cost of living and deliver a system that hard-working,
law-abiding people can have confidence

reforms I announce today form part of a series of changes to the
justice system introduced by the Ministry of Justice, such as the
reform of “no win, no fee” arrangements and a ban on
referral fees paid between lawyers, insurers, claims firms, garages and
others, which are removing incentives for excessive litigation and
tackling the culture of claims. New figures from the Ministry of
Justice’s claims management regulation unit also published
today, show that the number of claims firms in the personal injury
market has gone down by more than 1,000 following the law changes, from
a peak of 2,553 in December 2011 to 1,485 last
month.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102349000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/wmstext/131023m0001.htm#13102349000115">We
now propose to implement our consultation proposal to introduce an
independent medical panel scheme, to establish a new and more robust
system of medical reporting and scrutiny of whiplash claims. These
measures received a good degree of support from those who responded to
the consultation. Our reforms will mean that exaggerated and fraudulent
whiplash claims are deterred and challenged while the genuinely
injured, backed up by good-quality medical evidence, get the help and
compensation they
deserve.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102349000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/wmstext/131023m0001.htm#13102349000116">We
are currently working on the detail of the independent medical panel
scheme. We will have further discussions with all sides, including
insurers and claimant representatives, and within Government, before we
bring forward our final proposals. I am grateful to representatives
from all sides of the industry for their constructive proposals in this
area, which we are considering. I am clear that the final scheme will
need to be not only effective but proportionate and sustainable, with
any costs not falling on the public
purse.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102349000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/wmstext/131023m0001.htm#13102349000117">We
also want to work with all sides to tackle those practices which can
contribute to the inflated number of whiplash claims. For example, we
want insurers to 
<?notus-xml column=19?>end the practice of making offers to settle claims without requiring
medical evidence. We also want insurers to share more of their data on
suspected fraudulent or exaggerated claims with claimant lawyers, and
we want claimant lawyers to carry out more effective checks on their
potential clients before taking on
claims.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13102349000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/wmstext/131023m0001.htm#13102349000118">On
the consultation option to increase the small claims track threshold
for personal injury claims, the Government have carefully considered
all responses. We believe that there are good arguments for increasing
this threshold to £5,000 for all road traffic accidents to raise
incentives to challenge fraudulent or exaggerated insurance claims. At
the same time, we have listened to the views of the Transport Committee
and others that now may not be the right time to raise the small claims
limit because of the risks that it may deter access to justice for the
genuinely injured and encourage the growth of those disreputable claims
firms which so damage the industry. At this stage, we have decided to
defer any increase to the small claims threshold until we can determine
the impact of our wider reforms on motor insurance premiums and better

Someone is considered to be in relative low-income if they live in a
household whose income is below 60% of median income for all
households. Median income is the income of the household in the middle
of the income distribution. Household income is equivalised, which
means that income is adjusted for the size and composition of the
household; and household income is also deflated, which means that
income is adjusted for changes in
inflation.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13102363000752" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0001.htm#13102363000752">3.
In Household Below Average Income, a household is defined as a single
person or group of people living at the same address as their only or
main residence, who either share one meal together or share the living
accommodation. This differs from a benefit unit (family), which is
defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any
dependent children. From January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners
and cohabitees) are also included in the same benefit unit. A household
will consist of one or more benefit
units.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13102363000753" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0001.htm#13102363000753">4. BHC
refers to income before housing costs have been deducted; while AHC
refers to income after housing costs have been deducted. Housing costs
include; rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, community water
charges and council water charges; mortgage interest payments;
structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and
service
charges.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13102363000754" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0001.htm#13102363000754">5.

Someone is considered to be in relative low-income if they live in a
household whose income is below 60% of median income for all
households. Median income is the income of the household in the middle
of the income distribution. Household income is equivalised, which
means that income is adjusted for the size and composition of the
household; and household income is also deflated, which means that
income is adjusted for changes in
inflation.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13102363000759" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0001.htm#13102363000759">3.
In Household Below Average income, a household is defined as a single
person or group of people living at the same address as their only or
main residence, who either share one meal together or share the living
accommodation. This differs from a benefit unit (family), which is
defined as a single adult or a married or cohabiting couple, plus any
dependent children. From January 2006 same-sex partners (civil partners
and cohabitees) are also included in the same benefit unit. A household
will consist of one or more benefit
units.</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13102363000760" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0001.htm#13102363000760">4. BHC
refers to income before housing costs have been deducted; while AHC
refers to income after housing costs have been deducted. Housing costs
include; rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, community water
charges and council water charges; mortgage interest payments;
structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and

Baker:</Member></B> The Scrap Metal Dealers Act 2013 commenced on 1
October 2013. This new legislation will help tighten the net around
rogue dealers who flout the rules and wilfully purchase stolen metal.
This is through a properly funded licensing scheme that supports
legitimate businesses. In addition, banning the use of cash to purchase
scrap metal, which came into effect on 3 December 2012, and funding for
a national metal theft taskforce, have helped to reduce the market for
stolen metal, making it much less profitable for thieves to steal metal
from churches, war memorials, rail and energy
networks.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-23?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_23_PT_1/A94A9975494DE82D84BECC21EF887D4BFC468CA2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="23 October 2013">Wednesday

reforms to date of the Bus Service Operators Grant (BSOG), which
devolve the funding to local authorities in respect of the services
they choose to support, will give those authorities more say over how
that funding is prioritised. We have continued to invest in local bus

equipment installed on them, bought through the urgent operational

considered. We are reviewing which of these vehicles we might retain in
service once they are no longer required on operations in Afghanistan.
A range of factors, including requirement,

structure and the Department's armoured vehicle programme. Until that

Fallon:</Member></B> Drawing on a recent study from the university of
Texas, the potential greenhouse gas emissions from a shale gas well in
the UK would likely be between 745 to 865 tonnes carbon dioxide
equivalent per year. The largest proportion of these emissions is
likely to be as methane. It is unrealistic at present to estimate the 
<?notus-xml column=200?>total emissions in the UK from shale gas operations as
it is not possible to predict the number of shale
gas production wells likely to be developed. However, the proportion of
the UK greenhouse gas emissions, resulting from shale gas extraction,
is likely to be a very minor part of the total UK emissions of the
basket of six greenhouse gases covered by the Kyoto Protocol, which is
provisionally estimated to be 571.6 million tonnes carbon dioxide
equivalent in 2012. The UK's emissions are 1.3% of total global
greenhouse gas emissions, so the direct global warming effect of shale
gas operations in the UK is likely to be very miniscule. To put these
numbers into context, the US estimated their greenhouse gas emissions
in 2011, resulting from shale gas extraction, to be less than 0.25% of
their total greenhouse gas
emissions.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102371000044" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0002.htm#13102371000044">Nuclear

promote inter-faith and religious tolerance in Burma, however the
Department is working with a range of partners, including faith-based
organisations, to support peace and reconciliation. Through the British
embassy's small grants programme, the UK is funding an initiative in
Northern Shan state to promote a better understanding of different
religions and respect for human rights. The UK Government encourages
the Burmese Government to do all that it can to reduce inter-communal
tensions.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102377000034" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0002.htm#13102377000034">Syria</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13102377000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0002.htm#13102377000282"><B><Member PimsId="455" UID="13102377000357" xid="512" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131023/text/131023w0002.htm#13102377000357">Andrew

neighbouring countries have fled Syria since the start of 2013. The UN
predicts there will be over 1 million refugees in Lebanon alone by the
end of the year—roughly a two-fold increase since July. This is
putting neighbouring countries are under increasing pressure and we
recognise their generosity in keeping their borders open. It is
