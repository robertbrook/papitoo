people would describe the current recruitment target as challenging and

important point. At the moment, the armed forces recruit about 8% of
their strength from women, who make up about 50% of the target age
group population, and just 3% of their strength from black and ethnic
minority communities, which will make up about 24% of the target age
group population by 2020. We have to do better in those areas, and one
of the challenges that we have set for the armed forces, and for the
Army in particular, is for them to work out how they can pitch an offer
that is more attractive to female and black and ethnic minority
recruits, and specifically how they can use female recruits more
effectively within Future Force

Hammond:</Member></B> The reconfiguration of the Army, including the
changing role of reservists and the changing structure of the Army, are
not simply about trying to recruit reservists to replace disbanded
infantry battalions. Most of the reservists we recruit will be
specialists, rather than having a light infantry role. The White Paper
that I published earlier this year set out a plan to reverse the
long-term decline of the Army Reserve, redefining its role and setting
out details of improved equipment, training, terms and conditions.
Under the plan, we will grow the Army Reserve to a trained strength of
30,000 by 2018. I can also tell the House that, although it is still
early days, a snapshot of data for the recruiting campaign that started
on 16 September is quite positive. We received 1,576 applications to
join the Army Reserve during the first four weeks of the campaign, and
380 were received last week. It is very early days, but those early
signs are quite

publishing that memo so that we can all see what it actually said. Is
not the problem one of credibility? The Government cannot get their
figures right. Just today, we learned that the cost of new aircraft
carriers has increased by £800 million to £6.2 billion.
That is after the £100 million wasted last year on reversing the
decision on fighter jets. A few months ago, the Defence Secretary told
us he had balanced the books at the MOD, and then just a few weeks ago
we were told that there was an £1.8 billion underspend. How can
the British public have confidence that the Government will meet their
target for recruitment to the reserves when they have got so much else

have served. I am also pleased to assure him of our intention that
Yeovilton will remain a royal naval air station with,
additionally, 1 Regiment Army Air Corps based there as a lodger

course I will let my hon. Friend know, but Merryfield will continue as
a satellite to Yeovilton. He is right to say that the colour, as it
were, of many of those working in Yeovilton will change—it will
become more khaki—and that means Salisbury plain training areas
will be used rather more. I reassure my hon. Friend that that probably
means that his constituents are unlikely to be disturbed by too much
low flying, which I know is a concern from time to time to a number of

it will significantly improve the support available to members of the
armed Forces who wish to buy their own home. Forces Help to Buy will
offer the men and women of our armed forces a deposit loan of
50% of their annual salary, up to a maximum of £25,000. The
loans will be interest-free and repaid over an affordable 10-year
period. As well as that additional funding, there will be tailored
advice on financial and housing matters. Of course, service personnel

Parliament will be deeply concerned about the Home Secretary’s
statement. Obviously, all hon. Members want the police and the Security
Service to have all possible help to apprehend Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed
as soon as possible. The Home Secretary says that Mr Mohamed
poses no direct threat, even though he is widely reported in the media
to have attended terror training camps, procured weapons and planned
attacks. He has walked away from a terror suspect order in a very
simple disguise, and the Home Secretary has no idea where he is. He is
the second man in 10 months who has absconded while subject to a TPIM.
There were only 10 such men to begin with, and two have now gone: one
in a black cab and one in a disguise. The Opposition called for
controls to be tightened, for the legislation to be revisited and for
lessons to be learned. None of that has happened. The Home Secretary
has done nothing.</hs_Para>

since the Home Secretary got rid of relocation orders and control

London. The Home Secretary’s decision brought him back and he,
too, has disappeared. Her policies brought those two terror suspects

control orders prevented absconds is not true. Even if we wanted to go
back to the days of control orders, we would not be able to do so. The

given them new powers. In April this year, in a written statement, I
explained how we would use the royal prerogative to remove passports
from British nationals whom we want to prevent from travelling abroad
to take part in extremist activity, terrorism training or other
fighting. That power has already been used on several occasions since
it was introduced. As for foreign nationals, the Immigration Bill will

I commend the Security Service in this regard. A number of individuals
were prosecuted earlier this year for terrorism-related offences
relating to significant plots. This shows the very good work that the
police and the Security Service do on a daily basis to keep the public

free to make that choice for themselves. There will be circumstances in
which it is appropriate to require somebody to remove a face covering:
that could be in court, as we have seen in a number of instances; it
could be at the border, for security purposes; and individual
institutions such as schools should make their own policy in relation
to dress that they consider appropriate in their institution. I

Speaker:</Member></B> I am very grateful to the hon. Lady for her point
of order. I am well aware of that £2.6 million fund, about which
I was speaking in Edinburgh on Friday. If memory serves me correctly,
the fund is a follow-through from the recommendations of the
Speaker’s Conference which concluded in February 2010. The
matter is indeed of the utmost importance, so I am disappointed if she
has received less than substantive responses. The general principle
here, as the Deputy Leader of the House, who is on the Treasury Bench,
will know, is that ministerial replies to questions should be both
timely and substantive. If they are heavily delayed, that is a
discourtesy. If they are “insubstantive” or
insubstantial, whether delayed or not, that is not serving the House.
Members look for a response that is as comprehensive as possible and
informative. If the hon. Lady has not achieved that so far, I hope that
the Deputy Leader of the House may be willing, in Parliament’s
interest, to assist her in her endeavours. If she has to go through the
Table Office again to probe further, I do not think she will require
any additional encouragement from
me.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/5D7AA9416BF8768416B6404870227FACD40CF5EF" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 November 2013">Monday

around to see what taxes are available, it is clear that some very
difficult decisions have to be made. Labour Members chose to go for
employers’ national insurance contributions; perhaps they
considered that that option was less visible to the general public than
some of the others. However, the consequences would have been higher
unemployment, and this Government were not prepared to face

aligned to what my hon. Friend has just pointed out: a scheme that was,
essentially, quite targeted and required businesses to
apply—even though we worked hard to try to make the application
process as simple as possible—simply meant that fewer businesses

new proposal, no application process is needed as such. Businesses will
receive the benefit of the employment allowance simply by using
up-to-date payroll, and the introduction of real-time information makes
that much easier to apply. We believe that this is a much-improved
policy. It contrasts with the employers’ NICs holiday, because
that was a targeted regime. It also contrasts both with the policy
advocated by Labour in its five-point plan, which was even more
targeted, and with the policy we heard about yesterday on the living
wage. Complicated, temporary schemes requiring applications are likely
to have disappointing levels of take-up, whereas permanent schemes
automated through the payroll system will, we believe, apply much

national insurance holiday was a flagship policy of the
Government’s first Budget, which is why they are so desperate to
forget that it happened. They created a scheme that ran from 6
September 2010 until 5 September 2013 and applied to new businesses
only. They were eligible only if they were created after 22 June 2010.
Under that scheme, new businesses would not have to pay the first
£5,000 in national insurance for each of their first 10
employees during the first year of the business. Greater London, the
south-east and the eastern region were all excluded from the scheme.
The Government said that 400,000 businesses and some 800,000 employees
would benefit from the national insurance holiday, at a cost of
£940 million over the three years of the scheme. In their impact
assessment, the Government confidently predicted that the average
benefit per business would be about £2,000, but by the end of
the three years of the national insurance holiday in September this
year, the scheme was shown to have been a comprehensive
failure.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311044000370" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#1311044000370">In
the end, only 25,000 businesses received NICS relief—that is
375,000 fewer businesses being helped than the Government originally
claimed. It was always highly unlikely to have ever been worth the
maximum £50,000 to a new start-up business. To get the maximum
relief available, the new businesses would have had to take on 10
people with salaries of up to £40,000, which does not exactly
fit the pattern of how new start-ups behave and the sorts of choices
that they make in their first year of

the £940 million set aside to pay for the scheme, only
£60 million was ultimately paid out, a paltry 6% of the amount
originally intended. To put that in context, the Government spent
£12 million on the administration of the scheme. We repeatedly
warned that the scheme was not working, that it was not helping
businesses as intended and that the Government should reform it, expand
it, review it or bring forward a new one, but they refused to

is not as though the Minister could not see the failure unfolding
before his eyes. Take-up of the national insurance holiday was never
anything other than dismal. In the first year of the scheme, there was

2012, there was only one month when the total number of successful
applications was more than 1,000—that was in May 2012, when

simply did not know what was available. This problem must not be
repeated. This is particularly important when it comes to publicising
the scheme to charities and amateur sports clubs, to which it now also
applies. They are more likely to be unaware of what is available, and
the Government should have a clear publicity strategy, subject to
review, if take-up is, for whatever reason, lower than
expected.</hs_Para>

the second issue, the current HMRC interpretation of the existing tax
rules has meant that individuals who are members of an LLP are taxed as

have benefited from a self-employed status and the resulting loss of
employment taxes payable. It is time for the use of LLPs as a way to
disguise employment status and avoid employment taxes to stop. We note

vital that the employment allowance gives businesses the support they

the Government clung to the national insurance holiday scheme, and
almost another year has been wasted as they have failed to take
immediate action, instead introducing the employment allowance only

that 90% of the money involved will go to companies with fewer than 50
employees. That represents real help for small businesses up and down

is certainly true that people and businesses respond to financial
incentives, and it is no wonder that national insurance is sometimes
called a jobs tax, because it can be a disincentive to employing
people. It raises the bar to employing people and, given the importance
of creating jobs in our economy, it is great to see that bar coming
down. The Federation of Small Businesses has stated that the Bill will
affect not only jobs; investment will also increase, as will the pay of
the staff. I warmly welcome the FSB’s conclusion.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:15:54"></hs_TimeCode>Let us contrast
these measures with the previous Government’s proposed 1%
increase for employers and employees in April 2011. The independent
Centre for Economics and Business Research said that that measure would
have taken 57,000 jobs out of our economy—proving the
point that national insurance can indeed be a big incentive either to
employ people or fire them.</hs_Para>

a number of them live in my constituency, and many have had great
difficulty with the intermediary companies that employ them. The
confused nature of the national insurance arrangements can cause them
personal issues when they start to claim pensions, for example, so I
welcome the simplifying measures and look forward to the remaining
measures required to give offshore oil and gas workers the right status
in our economy.</hs_Para>

issue that is subject to repeated predictions is jobs. The number of
new private sector jobs is constantly being put at about 1.4 million,
but, interestingly, in January 2011 the Government were already saying
that 500,000 jobs had been created. It is clear to anyone that even if
those figures are accurate, and even if factors such as the
re-categorisation of jobs into different sectors are taken into
account, the pace of job creation is not quite as dramatic or as

was intended to create jobs. The fascinating aspect of that was the
very low take-up. If all those new employers had set up new companies

numerous people were desperate to start up new businesses and to take
on employees<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>. In
December 2012, there were only 20,365 applicants for the scheme. The

is not surprising that the Minister was reluctant to respond to
interventions from his own Back Benchers and to say what he thought
might be the outcome of his current proposals, because he knows how
poor earlier predictions have been. It is not just in respect of the
national insurance holiday that predictions have been wildly at odds
with the reality. For example, the youth contract, which involved
offering money to employers to take on people aged between 18 and 25,
was apparently going to be one of the major answers to youth
unemployment. It was designed, we were told, to help 53,000 young
people per year. However, in the first year of its operation it helped
only 4,690. That was another not very successful policy that we had
been asked to believe would help people in an important
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:29:11"></hs_TimeCode>. In that
context, I think it significant that only last week the Work and
Pensions Committee heard from the CBI that it would have liked to see
extra money for training, rather than cash incentives for employers to
take on young people. Perhaps the Government should listen to what
people think would help create jobs.</hs_Para>

for Fiscal Studies has pointed out that the current proposals do not
guarantee any additional jobs and that this is simply a tax cut. A tax
cut may be beneficial and may bring about more jobs, but in itself it
will not necessarily do so. Again, I would point to the previous
record. The IFS says we do not know whether this proposal will have any
effect on job creation as it will not be piloted and will be almost
impossible to evaluate, and that we will therefore be unlikely to know
whether it will be money well spent. We must bear in mind the previous
history, which I have mentioned, of two schemes that both failed to
help create employment, and we must ask the Government to monitor and
evaluate this new proposal as much as they can if they are going to
introduce it.</hs_Para>

Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:33:08"></hs_TimeCode> must
realise that the creation of jobs is extremely important for many parts
of this country. Many Government members and Back Benchers have
expressed pleasure at the reductions in unemployment in their own
constituencies, which is all very well, but unemployment levels in many
parts of the country are still extremely high. What is even more
important for many people is the lack of quality jobs and the fact that
they often cannot work the number of hours they want to. We currently
have the highest recorded level of people working part time
who want to work more hours. That means people have low incomes and are
often dependent on top-ups from Government benefits.</hs_Para>

reason is that 
<?notus-xml column=56?>people in part-time, low-income jobs on zero-hour

jobs that are out there are often ones that leave people with a

ask the Government to indicate the likely take-up of this
scheme—reluctant though they are to do—and to accept that
their previous measures in this field have not been successful. Three
years on, their initiatives have simply not been successful, and we see
the results in the state of our economy today. Of course it is good
that growth is beginning to return, but such low-level growth after
such a long time can hardly be hailed as a success. If we want to argue
about whose predictions were right, perhaps, at best, we have to say
that nobody’s were. The Government’s predictions on
coming to power in 2010 were certainly not borne out, and people have
been suffering the results of that in the past three

James</B> (Stourbridge) (Con):</Member> Before I come to my main points
about this Bill, which I support, I would just like to follow on from
the speech of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T17:33:26"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) and talk about the big picture for
a few minutes. One can quibble about the benefits or otherwise of this
scheme or that one, but the Government’s economic policies and
interventions have contributed to Britain becoming the fastest-growing
country in the western world. Survey after survey confirms the figures,
which are extremely optimistic about this economy. I sometimes think
the Treasury team is, with characteristic self-effacement, almost
cautious in putting forward the record of this Government in full
technicolour, so I would like to take up that role this
afternoon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000023">The
Bill is a straightforward and simple measure, top-slicing £2,000
off every company’s employer national insurance bill. As such,
it will provide significant help to small businesses. I have 5,200
small and medium-sized enterprises in my constituency, and I welcome
this measure on behalf of them all. We have heard the quotes from
various organisations representing small businesses, social enterprises
and so on welcoming the measure. The fact that it has such independent
support ought to speak for itself.</hs_Para>

also wish to draw attention to the ambitious sole trader. The SMEs will
have their employer insurance bills cut, but we also need to consider
the small sole trader who is ambitious and wants one day to grow his or
her business, just as I did. When I started my business in the 1980s,
it consisted just of my business partner and me—everyone else
who helped was begged, stolen or borrowed. I well remember the agony of
the decision to appoint the first paid member of staff. One knows that
one has to do it at some point if one wants to grow the business, but
the responsibility that comes from knowing that someone walking through
the door is then dependent for their livelihood on the success of
one’s business really makes one stop and think. Anything that
makes that decision easier, as this Bill does, has to be
welcomed.</hs_Para>

wish to talk about a young woman in my constituency, Amy Fairley, who
has a passion for flowers. She worked in a florist’s shop until
about six month ago, when she was made redundant. She decided to follow
her passion and dream by setting up her own florist’s shop. She
did 
<?notus-xml column=57?>that with help from the new enterprise allowance scheme—another
good scheme—and a Prince’s Trust grant and the mentorship
that the Prince’s Trust also provides. I helped her to open her
wonderful florist’s shop on Coventry street in Stourbridge three
weeks ago. As a Prince’s Trust mentor for four years before I
was elected, I have had similar experience and I was always reluctant
to advise on taking on that first member of staff, because of the cost
and the risk. One wonders whether the member of staff will be needed
all the time, although, of course, they could be taken on part-time.
The Bill will mitigate that caution.</hs_Para>

also wish to make the point that the Bill is part of a package of
measures designed to help employment and small businesses. The reforms
to employment law are also crucial, because this is not just about the
cost of taking someone on; it is also about the fear that if the wrong
person is appointed, the business is in for a huge headache. The
Government’s doubling of the qualifying period before people can
make unfair dismissal claims to two years is a huge advantage, as is
the fact that they are making settlement agreements easier, obviating
the need for employment tribunals, which are expensive in many cases. I
know from my work as a Parliamentary Private Secretary to Lord Green
that the Government have invested hugely in UK Trade &amp; Investment

aspect of Government support for the small businesses that are crucial
to employment and many of the new jobs that have been created has been

expenditure cuts that this country really needed. The hon. Lady is
quite right that the Government were driven to put up VAT, but the
important point is that in getting a grip on the public finances we had
a rough ratio. Spending cuts delivered approximately two thirds of what

return to the impact of the Bill on improving wage rates, let us
consider the record of the coalition in government. We are in the
process of raising the personal allowance to £10,000. I shall
return to that point. We are targeting and simplifying tax credits and
other benefits. We have introduced a benefit cap, making work pay. With
this Bill, we are introducing an employment allowance, which will
provide greater opportunity for us to improve wage rates. The living
wage is a crucial issue that Members on both sides of the House should
embrace. We should all endeavour to find ways to improve wages for
those who are unskilled or on low pay. For many decades, real wages for
people who are unskilled have been stagnant, or rising at a very low
rate. One benefit of the introduction of higher wages is the potential
that many businesses will see for higher productivity. Most
importantly, if very small businesses are able to pay higher wages,
there is reduced staff turnover. That is particularly important where
there is low pay across a profession.</hs_Para>

businesses to take up a new Government scheme, but a one-off policy is
precisely what the Leader of the Opposition will propose tomorrow as

us consider what happens when a married person who works 40 hours a
week, has two teenage children, and earns the minimum wage, which is
£6.31, moves to the living wage, which today went up to
£7.65. I am using the numbers for outside London, because I
represent Bedford, which is outside London. The employee’s gross
pay would increase from £13,125 to £15,912—an
increase of 21%. After the changes to their tax, national insurance and
tax credits, their net take-home pay, which is what matters to them,
increases from £15,067 to £16,483—a 
<?notus-xml column=61?>welcome increase, but an increase of only 9%. That is the impact on the
family of the change from the minimum wage to the living
wage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000055">Looking
at the cost to the employer, there is an increase in salary of
£2,787, and an increase in the employer’s national
insurance contributions of £385; that is essentially a 23%
increase in the cost of employing that person. Then there is the impact
on the Exchequer. It benefits from an increase in income tax of
£557, and an increase in the employee national insurance
contribution of £335. The reduction in the payment of tax
credits benefits the Exchequer by £479, and the increase in
employer national insurance benefits it by £385. The Exchequer
ends up increasing its tax take by 32%. The change from the minimum
wage to the living wage means a modest but welcome increase for the
employee, has a high cost for the employer, and brings a substantial
benefit, on my calculations, for the Exchequer.</hs_Para>

context, let me say this about the Government’s use of the
employment allowance to give something back to our hard-pressed
employers and small businesses: £2,000 is a start, but we have
found a tool here, if we have the courage to use it, that we can use to
encourage—not compel—our private sector employers to
accept a living wage. Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs could
act as a compliance officer for those who seek to pay the living wage,
as it does for the minimum wage. We could pay back some of the
significant gain to the Exchequer that my simple calculation has
brought up, though I am sure that there are more complicated numbers
out there. There is a useful tool here, and this is a small start. Let
us have the courage to see how we can improve living conditions and
wages for our low-paid workers, and use the Bill as the start of a
better future for all of
us.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/9C228EAAF917497A45D1B5ECA36FA532C10C5807" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 November 2013">Monday

cutting Labour’s deficit, the Government have secured record low
interest rates for hard-working families and small businesses across
the country. From April 2015, corporation tax will be cut to
20%—the lowest in the G20. As a result of the
Government’s policies, the UK recently topped KPMG’s list
of the most competitive countries in which to do business, beating
Switzerland, the USA and France for the first time ever.
This hard work is getting results. The latest figures from the
Office for National Statistics showed strong growth of 0.8% for the
third quarter of 2013. That proves that the only way to create real
prosperity and to raise living standards is not through quick-fix
gimmicks but through straightforward solutions: backing businesses to
create growth, cutting taxes to boost growth, and supporting
hard-working

the country fell deeper into debt and slipped down the international

very badly wrong on the economy as well. They said we would lose 1
million jobs. Instead, we have seen the creation of 1 million

taking out two regulations before one regulation is brought in;
ensuring that 25% of all procurement goes to small businesses; taking
away pre-qualification questionnaires; increasing the annual investment
allowance from £25,000 to £250,000; cutting corporation
tax; investing in apprenticeships; creating 27,000 business mentors;
and introducing the regional growth fund and the local enterprise

is not to say that we are perfect. The Government have a very strong
record, but I would pose them a few questions. We are doing so many
good things that we often fail to communicate them in as coherent and
focused a way as possible and in a way that is easiest for small
businesses. I encourage the Minister, who is coming turbo-charged into
her new job, to consider the role of HMRC. The Government communicate
more through HMRC than any other arm of Government. How can we use it

urge the Government and my party to start differentiating ourselves not
just from the Labour party, but from our coalition partners, with a
small business Bill to show that we need to do even more to take small
businesses out of the regulation quagmire they find themselves in. I
remember sitting through the debate on the Government’s
employment changes—colleagues have already discussed
them—which were very simple and straightforward.
Employers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:10:49"></hs_TimeCode> will
have two years before they have to decide whether they want to keep an
employee. Settlement agreements will at least allow an employer to
offer an employee a deal when things are not working out. There will
also be tribunal charges, not for people who cannot afford
it—before Opposition Members intervene—but for most
employees, who will have to pay a fee before taking an employer to
tribunal. All of
those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T18:10:49"></hs_TimeCode> really
good changes—every single one of them—were opposed by the

find the formalised application processes, let alone the working
practices, of large firms restrictive. Established companies may tend
to value the ability to adhere to existing processes and systems above
the creativity, dynamism and individual flair that smaller businesses
help to stimulate. Doing more to encourage the smallest firms to take

a boost it will be for more of the growing army of the self-employed to

number of self-employed people with no employees has increased, but the
number of self-employed people with a small number of employees has not
kept pace, and that is what the Bill seeks to address. In the past, the
focus has been more on encouraging people to start up a business and
less on taking the next step to becoming micro-employers. The Bill is
an opportunity to further liberate the self-employed from barriers to

qualifications or, indeed, their ethnic background. This is what the
Federation of Small Businesses calls the “entrepreneurial
pipeline” to what Professor Mark Hart calls “growth
gazelles”. We need to encourage more growth gazelles.
Essentially, this is about everyday entrepreneurs, street-level small
businesses and office-share operators giving people a chance to work.
Analysis by the FSB suggests that 74% of those who become self-employed
and who have employees come from the self-employed who had no employee,
and that a further 13% come from employees who had been working in
micro-businesses. Clearly, there will be a multiplier effect once we
get this right and start moving in the right

Government are absolutely right to introduce the new employment
allowance. Slashing the cost of national insurance and taking many
employees out of it completely will encourage more of the self-employed
to become employers. However, this is not—and nor should it
be—the only measure to increase the number of first-time
employers. The Bill must be viewed in concert with the new enterprise
allowance—for which Levi Roots is an ambassador for the
Government—which seeks to encourage the longer-term unemployed
into self-employment. The three-year moratorium on new regulations for
small businesses is another important step in the right direction. I

Lord Young says, it is vital that the psychological barriers are broken
down so that they do not stifle the ambition that is latent in the
marketplace. If we are to create an aspiration nation, the road to
running one’s own business must be a clearly signposted fast
lane, not the last Labour Government’s minefield of forms, box
ticking and regulations. Their approach reminded me of a sign that I

the scheme creatively. I also say to the Minister that we must not

listened to them in designing the scheme is fanciful. After the deficit

Economic Secretary to the Treasury (Nicky Morgan):</Member></B> This
has been a wide-ranging debate and I am grateful to have heard all the
thoughtful contributions that have been made. It is noticeable that we
heard seven contributions from this side, but only one from Opposition
Back Benchers—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> I welcome the
Opposition’s support for the Bill, but as the shadow Minister
said, the Bill is wide ranging, and Opposition Members could have
talked about businesses, employment and the living wage. They have not
taken the opportunity to do so and clearly had nothing to say about the
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000157" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000157">Before
I respond to the points raised by hon. Members, it is worth reiterating
the four key points of the Bill. First, from next April, all
businesses, charities and community amateur sports clubs will benefit.
They will receive a £2,000 employment allowance every year to
set against their employer national insurance contributions liability.
This is a measure specifically set out to support jobs. If I run a
small firm employing four members of staff on the average private
sector wage, I would see my national insurance contributions bill cut
by more than a fifth. If I start a brand-new business and want to give 
<?notus-xml column=77?>up to 10 18 to 20-year-olds their first chance of full-time employment,
paying the minimum wage, I would pay no national insurance
contributions at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000158" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000158">We
have previously had time-limited allowances targeted at some
businesses, but this is a universal allowance that will help all
businesses. It is easy to understand and administer and, most
importantly, it will make it easier for businesses in all our
constituencies to create jobs. I am sure that that is something that
all hon. Members want to
see.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000159" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000159">Secondly,
as well as making it easier for employers to take on staff, the Bill
will make it harder for companies to avoid taxes. It will give effect
to the general anti-abuse rule, or GAAR, for NICs. As such, it is
indicative of the Government’s intention to take a robust line
in tackling all forms of tax avoidance. Thirdly, it will allow the
Treasury to make regulations to bring in a certification scheme for the
oil and gas industry when someone other than the deemed employer for
national insurance is undertaking those duties on their behalf. This is
part of the Government’s wider measure to address schemes
involving employers setting up outside the UK and providing workers to
the UK in order to avoid paying employment
taxes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000160" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000160">Finally,
the Bill will make changes to tackle disguised employment and to
address the tax issue arising from the UK implementation of the
alternative investment fund managers directive, which the Exchequer
Secretary described in some detail earlier. The importance of those
last three measures should not be underestimated. With the associated
tax changes they will contribute towards raising £265 million
for the Exchequer in the 2014-15 tax
year.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000161" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000161">As
I have said, we heard some excellent contributions to the debate. I am
sorry to say that the Labour contributions did not extend to any great
insight into the Labour party policy on support for businesses. First,
Opposition Members tried to take credit for this Bill, if hon. Members
can imagine such a thing. The shadow Chief Secretary said that we
should say sorry. If sorry is the hardest word, we have never heard it
from the Labour party, which left us—as my hon. Friend the
Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley) said—with the legacy of a
huge deficit and enormous debt that we are having to pay off. This
Government are having to make the tough
choices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000162" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000162">The
hon. Member for Birmingham, Ladywood (Shabana Mahmood) was wrong about
the Labour party’s national insurance contributions scheme,
because it would have applied only to small businesses. Our scheme will
apply to all businesses. She also said that administration of the
previous scheme cost £12 million. In fact, the estimated
administration costs from the start of the national insurance
contributions scheme that finished in September were
£770,000—nowhere near millions of pounds. There was tight
control on its
administration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000163">We
will not take a history lesson from the Opposition about the regional
national insurance contributions holiday. My hon. Friend the Exchequer
Secretary made it clear at the start of the debate that this was a
temporary, targeted measure that helped 26,000 businesses and created
90,000 jobs. That is 90,000 people who have employment as a result of
that scheme. That is something that we should be proud of, while
recognising that there is scope for a new scheme, and that is what the
Bill will introduce.</hs_Para>

the Opposition had 13 years to introduce it, but they failed to do so.
They can pick holes in the scheme as much as they want, but the point
is that this Government have taken the tough decisions. The rule will
act as a deterrent to those tempted to engage in abusive avoidance
schemes. It will take time to bed in, and we will keep it under
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000165">In
answer to the specific questions asked by the hon. Member for Newcastle
upon Tyne North (Catherine McKinnell), the GAAR is expected to raise
some £235 million over the next five years and it
will also protect revenue that would otherwise be lost. We are
confident that the GAAR will change the avoidance landscape as its
impact starts to be recognised. The hon. Lady also asked about the Bill
not being published in draft, but she then said that we had taken a
long time to get round to making the Bill happen. She cannot have it
both ways, although that is a position the Labour party always likes to
be
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000166">The
employment allowance will be introduced from 6 April next
year. If we had had time for formal consultation, it would have delayed
the implementation date, which is something that none of us wants to
see. However, I can tell the hon. Lady that HMRC has held discussions
with various stakeholders over the summer on the detailed
implementation of the employment allowance, and those discussions have
helped to inform the design of the new
system.</hs_Para>

Morgan:</Member></B> Perhaps I should repeat my comments. This
Government should get enormous credit for introducing a GAAR in the
first place. The last Government had 13 years to introduce one and
failed to do so. The important point about the panel is that it is
independent. It was recommended by Graham Aaronson, and its members are
independent from the Government. The gentleman in question has
resigned. It is an important safeguard in the operation of the system
that the panel’s independence is
maintained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110416000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0002.htm#13110416000169">I

on this side of the House. My hon. Friend the Member for Stourbridge

also talked about the huge step of taking on the responsibility for

hon. Friend the Member for Redcar (Ian Swales) was right to say the

hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) found it strange that
we were looking at the Labour party’s national insurance policy.
First, her party wants to be the next Government, so it should not be a
surprise that we scrutinise its policies. Secondly, we are still having
to deal with the legacy of the previous Government. All the tough
decisions we take are framed by having to deal with that legacy. I
should, however, congratulate her on being the only Labour Back Bencher
to speak in the debate. She asked whether the employment allowance
would create jobs. The Federation of Small Businesses expects 29% of
small businesses to use it to boost staff wages, 28% to use it to
employ additional staff and 24% to use it to invest in
resources—it is welcomed by business organisations. It is
estimated that 90% of businesses that employ people will take up the
employment allowance. I am sure the hon. Lady will welcome businesses
in her constituency taking up the employment allowance.</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller) asked whether tax
credits had been factored into the system. We do not believe that tax
credits have been factored into this calculation, but the Office for
Budget Responsibility considers the net impact of all Government
policies on the economy. This policy has been subject to that scrutiny
and I am sure we can discuss any further questions he has. He made a
thoughtful contribution on the price of labour and the affordability of
the living wage. I am sure that that is something we want to consider
further. He is right to say that the employment allowance is a small
but important start along the road of getting more people into
employment. He was right about the encouragement of welfare dependency
by the previous Government. By 2010, nine out of 10 families with
children were reliant on the state. We want to make work pay. For
example, our policy of raising the income tax threshold is all about
ensuring that work pays and that people keep more of their earnings so
they can spend them in a way that is right for them and their

areas receive 50% more support per head than rural areas, despite
higher costs in rural service delivery. May it please the House to note
that the Select Committee that I have the honour to chair has recently

part of the glue that keeps our society together and enables people to
function and get on with their daily lives. Doctors, though, would be
the first to admit that they are not omniscient—well, some of
them would. Their work depends upon the work of many others in the
health care sector—in particular, the work of laboratory and
radiography technicians who provide the evidential base for diagnosis
and treatment. The quality of patient outcomes will always depend on
the quality of diagnostic services because a diagnosis delayed is a
treatment delayed, and an incorrect diagnosis is potentially
fatal.</hs_Para>

the GP realised that it was possible inadvertently to apply that same
action to all the other test results returned on that list. Pathology
results that required urgent action could be accidentally archived
owing to an error in the TDL reporting system. Critical patient test
results could be missed altogether or inappropriately

final issue I wish to raise with the Minister is that of the National
Clinical Assessment Service. In many respects, this could merit an
Adjournment debate all of its own. NCAS was established to undertake
performance assessments of GPs and clinicians when primary care or
hospital trusts had expressed concern that their clinical results or
statistics appeared to have been outside normal parameters. There are
more than 1,000 referrals a year, and in the vast majority of cases
NCAS will assist simply by advising the trust in order to return the
clinicians to safe and effective practice. However, in 50 or
60 cases each year an extraordinarily detailed and intensive process of
assessment and remediation is required. Only about 60% of those who
undergo that process make it back into safe and effective practice,
while 40% never return to work in the NHS. NCAS is therefore
one of the key guardians of patient
safety<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:46:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110423000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#13110423000005">In
2010, it became clear that NCAS would be restructured as part of the
reconfiguration of the NHS. Its budget was cut by 20%, and it was told
that it would have to become self-funding by 2013. In 2012, Deloitte
was asked to conduct a review of the service, but it is due to publish
its report only on 14 November, 10 days from now. In April this year,
NCAS was joined to the NHS Litigation Authority, which has since

Before I correct some of the assertions he has made, I want to
highlight the fact that the diagnostic services in England, and 
<?notus-xml column=94?>especially in Brent, are in rather robust health
under this Government. Average waiting times for a diagnostic test
remain low and stable, despite the NHS carrying out over 2 million more
key tests a year since May 2010. The percentage of patients waiting six
weeks or more at the end of June and July 2013 was 0.9% of the total
number of waits. We can therefore see that the number of diagnostic
tests is increasing, the availability of diagnostic services to
patients has improved under this Government, and very few patients are
waiting in excess of six weeks for the services
provided<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:53:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110423000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#13110423000017">Latest
provisional data from the diagnostic imaging dataset show that almost
32 million imaging tests were reported in England in the 12 months from
June 2012 to May 2013. Diagnostics have a key part to play in
reducing premature mortality, particularly as NHS England estimates
that over 1 billion diagnostics tests are carried out within the NHS
every year.
Access<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:54:32"></hs_TimeCode> to safe
and high-quality diagnostic services, such as endoscopy, genetics, and
imaging, is critical to all clinical pathways. They underpin over 80%

is worth reminding the hon. Gentleman that the previous Government
introduced, and championed the role of, the private sector. I
believe we are all Blairites in this Chamber, in that we all believe in
respect of publicly funded care that where the provider—be it
the NHS, a private provider or a local charity or voluntary sector
organisation—gives high-quality patient care, that has to be a
good thing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:55:14"></hs_TimeCode>
because it improves the quality of care. It is also important to
highlight that the previous Government introduced private sector
providers into the NHS to reduce waiting times for operations, which
were unacceptably high at that time. I think we would all agree that it
was a good thing that waiting times were reduced so patients
no longer had to wait unacceptably long times for treatment they so

first independent sector treatment centres were opened in October 2003,

previous Government made in commissioning private sector services, to
make sure there was a level playing field. There is no competition on
price, as the hon. Gentleman asserted; there is only competition on
quality in NHS services. It is important that any provider of NHS
services and care to patients does so in an integrated way that
delivers joined-up and integrated care based primarily in the
community. Providing early diagnosis and early treatment and improving
diagnostic services is a key part of
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110423000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#13110423000021">The
big challenge that faces the whole of the NHS and the health and care
sector is the fact that many people are living longer, and often with
multiple medical conditions like diabetes, dementia and heart disease.
The challenge is to make sure that we treat them with dignity and
respect. We must also make sure that when we can diagnose a problem or
illness early, we do so. That is why we are very proud to have
increased the amount of early diagnosis and the number of diagnostic
tests available in our NHS. The remaining challenge is to make sure we
continue improving early diagnosis in Brent, London and throughout the
country.</hs_Para>

know that when disease is diagnosed early, patients have a better
chance of a good outcome. One-year survival for kidney and bladder
cancers is as high as between 92% and 97%. At a late stage, however, it
drops to between just 25% and 34%. The clinical case for early
diagnosis and the investment we are making in diagnostic services is
very clear,

course, apart from the clinical benefits of early diagnosis, there are
other benefits. When people are ill, they want to know as soon as

me deal with the issues the hon. Gentleman raised about the
commissioning of services. Since the beginning of April 2013, clinical
commissioning groups have been responsible for commissioning many
health care services to meet the requirements of their population. In
doing so, CCGs need to ensure that diagnostic services are considered
fit for purpose and reflect the needs of the local people as part of
their process for commissioning clinical pathways. Local clinicians are
best placed to understand the needs of their local population and
commission the diagnostic services they
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T19:58:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110423000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#13110423000025">Local
clinicians are commissioning in a way that is increasingly effective in
diagnostics and elsewhere, so more choice in diagnostic services is
essential. Many patients who require diagnosis—perhaps an
ultrasound scan—will be working, and traditionally some of the
NHS diagnostic models have not embraced seven-day working. We know that
it is much easier for working people to access NHS services in the
evening or at weekends. Therefore, bringing providers that supply
greater choice for patients into the NHS makes it much more likely that
patients will receive appropriate services at the right time and in a
convenient way. It also increases patient compliance, not only with
treatments, but with making sure they have their scans and diagnostics
in a timely
manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-04T20:00:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-04?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_04_PT_1/0643F66F486C5D42D2A8F43409327B946CA8440F" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="4 November 2013">Monday

Gardiner:</Member></B> The Minister rightly says that clinicians are
best placed to make clinical judgments about their patients’
needs, and there is no dispute between us on that. My concern is that
in a case such as that of TDL the clinicians understood the clinical
need but clearly did not have the expertise to ensure: that the
contract was properly engaged in; that it was risk-assessed in the
first place; that it was properly monitored; and that it was executed
in a manner that was going to ensure the proper relationship between
the practitioner and the tests that were being done. Similarly, on the
courier service, they had the clinical evidence right, saying that
refrigeration was needed, but when it came to putting the contract in
place there was no such
refrigeration.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110423000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#13110423000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Poulter" PimsId="5522" UID="13110423000050" xid="1024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/debtext/131104-0003.htm#13110423000050">Dr
Poulter:</Member></B> I hope that the hon. Gentleman will forgive me
for saying that many of the contracts to which he is alluding were put
in place under the old arrangements, before this Government’s
reforms, which have delivered clinical leadership. Many of these
contracts were negotiated under the powers put in place under the
previous Government, whereby people without clinical experience often
negotiated the contracts and so did not always understand what the
important clinical factors 
<?notus-xml column=96?>were. He rightly raised the point about potassium and the refrigeration
of biochemical samples. It is important that we preserve the integrity
of all samples collected. Of course, a clinician, a biochemist or
someone with clinical experience would understand that, whereas someone
who is commissioning services without that background might not. We saw
that happen far too often with primary care trusts. The
clinical input under the new arrangements will put us in a much better
place to commission services in the future. Many clinical commissioning
groups have been saddled with those old arrangements and so are having
to enforce arrangements and contracts that they did not directly
negotiate. We hope that when the contracts come up for renegotiation
that problem will be put right, thanks to the reforms that we have
introduced. They will lead to clinical leadership at CCGs, so that
doctors and nurses are in charge of negotiations, rather than people
who have not necessarily had the relevant clinical experience and do
not have the knowledge to understand what the contract they are
commissioning is about.

wish to reassure the hon. Gentleman that not just any old health care
provider can deliver diagnostic services. By law, health care providers
must register with the Care Quality Commission to carry out diagnostic
services. That helps to ensure that patients receive only high-quality
care, because the CQC, to which the Government are granting greater
independence and strengthened powers to intervene where there are
quality of care concerns, is the organisation that will be able to
intercede if there are concerns about the quality of any health care
service which may affect patient care. Service providers must be
registered with the CQC and they must prove that they can meet strict
quality criteria. That regulated activity includes a wide range of
procedures related to diagnostics, screening and physiological
measurement, including all diagnostic procedures involving the use of
any form of radiation, including X-ray, ultrasound or magnetic
resonance imaging. Regulated activities are listed in schedule 1 of the

wrong in his constituency and in the wider NHS things went wrong, very
tragically, at Mid Staffordshire. We need to learn from those mistakes
and ensure that they are put right in future, whether they are in the
commissioning process—clinically led commissioning should put us
in a much better place in that regard—or in the care that is
provided to patients. We need to ensure that all hospitals, as well as
other health care providers and care sector providers, step up to the
plate, recognise that patient safety must always be paramount and
ensure that the lessons that need to be learned from the Francis report
are learned. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will report

believe—with further recommendations that will, I hope, reassure
the hon. Gentleman.</hs_Para>

conclusion, let me turn specifically to diagnostic services in Brent. I
am aware that the hon. Gentleman has recently asked questions about
referral processes for diagnostic services provided in his
constituency. As he knows, the contracts for those services were
originally 
<?notus-xml column=98?>let by the then PCT under arrangements encouraged by the policies of the
previous Government and are managed by the North and East London
commissioning support unit on behalf of the CCGs. The London NHS
Diagnostic Service, provided by InHealth, offers GPs and other health
care professionals direct access to high-quality diagnostic and imaging
scans and tests throughout London delivered from a range of sites,
including mobile, fixed and community-based facilities.</hs_Para>

hope that it reassures the hon. Gentleman to hear that between
September 2010 and August 2011, 2,397,018 diagnostic tests were carried
out in London but more recently, between September 2012 and August
2013, there was an increase of about 300,000 to 2,651,560. That shows
that the service in London is in robust health and is being used to
facilitate scans and other procedures to diagnose many more patients
today than two to three years ago.</hs_Para>

understand that the hon. Gentleman has been in communication with local
commissioners and that the relevant NHS England area team has advised
him that GP practices do not receive any referral payment when patients
are referred to the London NHS Diagnostic Service provided by InHealth.
I know that that is an area of concern to him and he was possibly
suggesting that there might be some cosy internal relationship among
local health care services to the detriment of patients. I can reassure
him that that is certainly not the case. GPs make clinical decisions on
the basis not of financial bribes, but of what is best for their
patients. I hope that he will be reassured by the answer he has
received from the commissioners and I do not think that it is in any
way likely that GPs or other health care professionals will act in a
way that is outside the best interests of their patients. It has always
been my experience that front-line health care professionals, with very
few exceptions, act with openness and integrity and always advocate for
their patients’ needs. I hope he will be reassured by
that.</hs_Para>

Inspectorate (EAS) which is currently situated within BIS, will move to
HM Revenue and Customs’ national minimum wage (NMW) team. They
will form a new HMRC team and will focus mainly on enforcing
non-payment of national minimum wage in the recruitment sector. By
increasing HMRC’s NMW team we will ensure that the most

conducted several dangerous manoeuvres near the British vessels. At one
point a minor collision occurred between the guardia civil vessel and
one of the defence police boats. There was no damage to either vessel,

inland waterways in the UK is subject to excise duty at the full rate
while fuel for other purposes, such as heating, is subject to the
rebated rate of duty. Many of these craft have a single fuel supply for
propulsion and heating. For this reason, HMRC allows rebated oil such
as red diesel to be used provided that an amount equal to the rebate is
paid on the proportion of fuel to be used to propel the
boat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110431000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/text/131104w0001.htm#13110431000062">Purchasers

Fire Sector Federation and the sector more generally. They make an
interesting proposal; however I do not think such a Commission should
be appointed by the Government. Rather any drive for transformation
must be owned by fire and rescue authorities themselves, which is why
in the spending round, the Government announced £30 million
towards the upfront costs of transforming fire and rescue services,
acting on the opportunities identified by the Knight Review. And a
further £45 million capital fund for to encourage greater

Plan' refers to countering seasonality. Their coastal and seaside towns
thematic marketing campaigns will run early in the season to capture
the pre-summer period, and case studies are being developed to
encourage late season/low season events for resorts to help reduce the
impact of seasonality. Messaging regarding seaside holidays also
focuses on participation in activities so that holidays can be less
weather- or

Goodwill:</Member></B> Typically, variable mandatory speed limits are
set by an automated system in response to changes in the speed and flow
of traffic, although the Highways Agency can set them manually if
needed. Variable speed limits are used to control traffic at times of

safety reasons. They are also used to ensure the safety of road workers

Agency operators can also manually set signs and signals. To do this
they must select an appropriate reason within the technology system,
which will 
<?notus-xml column=44?>automatically assign an appropriate speed for that incident. For
example, an unconfirmed incident would generate 50 mph in all lanes but
a lane closure would generate 40 mph speeds in the adjacent lanes to

Green:</Member></B> The Government is making a full
assessment of the EU victims' directive prior to its implementation
date in November 2015. The Government wrote to the Reducing Regulation
Committee in November 2012 with an early transposition plan. A full
impact assessment and transposition table will be completed closer to
the implementation date. The directive will be transposed in line with
domestic policy aims through changes to national law through secondary
legislation and statutory codes. This includes transposing part of the
directive in the new Victims' Code. Further information about how the
directive is reflected in the new Victims' Code can be found in the
accompanying impact assessment and Government response

responsible for the costs involved in transporting a prisoner from
prison to the point of departure from the UK. All other costs including
airfares and escort costs are normally the responsibility of the state
to which the prisoner is transferred. However, where transfer would
otherwise not take place it is occasionally more cost-effective for the
United Kingdom to pay in order to reduce the cost of ongoing detention
in the UK. Pursuant to my answer of 17 October 2013, <I>Official

the costs associated with three transfers. These were Ghana (2010),

Poulter:</Member></B> The Medical Research Council held a workshop on
brain donation on 14 October 2013. The workshop aimed to address and
make progress in a number of areas. In particular this meeting agreed
that simply encouraging people to sign up as brain donors was no longer
desirable and instead there is a need to approach people whose health
and disease are carefully characterised during life about donation.
These people are often part of existing population or disease focused
cohorts. In order to maximise the progress researchers using brain
tissue can make, they need to know all of this clinical information
about the person who donated brain tissue to best understand what
co-existing diseases the person had. This helps with diagnosis and is
essential for delivery of real molecular pathology insights into
disease.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1311057000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131104/text/131104w0003.htm#1311057000102">The
NHS Organ Donor Register exists to record people's agreement to use
their organs and tissue for transplantation after their death.
Currently, brain donation is not included as an option on the register,
and donors of brain tissue for research purposes are not routinely
asked about organ donation more broadly; the NHS Organ Donor Register
and brain banks fulfil different purposes. In addition, in view of the
existing capacity for dealing with brain donations, and the fact that
the new strategy of the UK Brain Banks Network is to focus on
individuals who are well characterised in life, linkage between the NHS
Organ Donor Register and brain donation schemes is not viewed as the
major challenge for brain donation in the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

economic recession on the mental wellbeing of the population. The

Subjective Well-being Data from the Annual Population Survey, April to
September 2011” presents initial estimates of subjective
well-being from six months of the Annual Population Survey (APS)

questions about wellbeing and the results of this can be found in,

infant death syndrome, on the death certificate. Unascertained infant
deaths are deaths where code R99, other ill-defined and unspecified
causes of mortality, was the only code on the death certificate.
Unexplained infant deaths are the sum of sudden infant deaths and
unascertained infant
deaths.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>2</Sup>

disposable incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes
earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income
from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other
sources. Income tax payments, national insurance contributions, council

considered to be in relative low-income if they live in a household
whose income is below 60% of median income for all households. Median
income is the income of the household in the middle of the income
distribution. Household income is equivalised, which means that income
is adjusted for the size and composition of the household; and
household income is also deflated, which means that income is adjusted
for changes in
inflation.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">5. In HBAI, a
household is defined as a single person or group of people living at
the same address as their only or main residence, who either share one
meal together or share the living accommodation. This differs from a
benefit unit (family), which is defined as a single adult or a married
or cohabiting couple, plus any dependent children. From January 2006
same-sex partners (civil partners and cohabitees) are also included in
the same benefit unit. A household will consist of one or more benefit
units.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">6. BHC refers to
income before housing costs have been deducted; while AHC refers to
income after housing costs have been deducted. Housing costs include;
rent (gross of housing benefit); water rates, community water charges
and council water charges; mortgage interest payments; structural
insurance premiums (for owner occupiers); ground rent and service
charges.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">7. Figures have
