about the increasing trend of big money in British politics, which
seeks to influence the outcome of political contests through groups
that are not political parties, those very same groups would campaign
after the next general election, saying that we should do something
about that trend. At the general election, non-party political funds
doubled to £3 million. We have seen what happens when that gets
out of control. Just look across the Atlantic at the United States:
super-PACs—political action committees; the increasing
polarisation of politics; and people outside the democratic political
process, non-political parties, trying to influence the outcome of
elections. We will maintain the rules, as they have existed since 2000,
on whether groups are regulated as third party campaign groups. All we
are saying is that non-party political parties that want to act like a
political party should be asked to fill in the same paperwork as a
political

Under the current rules, a well-funded third party campaign group
seeking to influence the democratic outcome in a constituency or
constituencies could spend more money than a political party. That,
surely, cannot be right. The Labour party, which is run by a third
party campaign group, the trade unions, does not think it is a problem
if political parties are influenced by third party campaign groups that
might have political designs. Nothing in the Bill would stop Make
Poverty History spending millions on its campaign. Nothing would stop
the Green Alliance grading us all on our green promises—nothing

think that the use of those central databases, particularly the DWP
database, combined with what we do with other databases, should raise
the overall figure of automatic enrolment when that finally happens. As
he also knows, we have done a considerable amount to ensure that there
is a two-year roll-over period, so that people who do not automatically
register before the next general election will still have an
opportunity to do so, while door-to-door information will be provided
to people so that they will know how the new system works. We have put
as many belt-and-braces provisions in place as possible, therefore, to
ensure that the maximum number of people are on the new IER

that there is an underlying problem. We have lots of people on the
social rented sector waiting list. There are 1.8 million households on
the waiting list and about 1.5 million bedrooms in the social rented
sector are not being used. We need somehow to make sure that those
people who do not have homes are better matched with available homes.
At the same time we have many families living in very overcrowded
conditions. Those are the problems: those are the imbalances of the
system that we are trying to straighten out. I accept that that leads
to some hard cases. They need to be treated fairly and
compassionately.</hs_Para>

the performance of the

between areas in the way in which cases are referred. The
fourth action entails looking at the independent domestic violence
adviser network and making sure that it is performing consistently

which were not referred to the police are being examined closely to see
why. Sixthly, the Crown Prosecution Service is going to give further

has been made, in both the proportion of cases that are prosecuted and
the conviction rates achieved. The hon. Lady is absolutely right that
we need a cross-governmental strategy, which we have in the action plan

Certainly, the question of the time limit will be looked at by my right

although it is right to say that if we have a new time limit there will
always be the risk that it will also be exceeded in some cases. It is

are essentially three elements to housing in this country:
owner-occupation, housing provided by local authorities or housing
associations, and the private rented sector. I will take them in turn.
Owner-occupation has been the cornerstone of the housing policies of
successive Governments for a long time. However, the rate of
owner-occupation is steadily and steeply in decline, to the extent that
it is well below the high point of 70%. There is every sign that it
will continue to drop over the decades, as mortgages become more
expensive and more difficult to secure for people on average incomes or
below, despite the Government’s home-ownership
objectives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T12:37:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000245">The
second area is council housing and housing association properties.
Council housing provides good quality, secure accommodation, but it is
in desperately short supply, particularly in London and the south-east.
I am the first to admit that the solution to our housing problems lies
in the much more rapid development of much more council housing all
over the country. That would provide a good quality way out of housing
desperation for many people. I hope that that policy is increasingly
accepted and
developed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000246">Although<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T12:38:35"></hs_TimeCode>
I recognise that housing associations were founded to bring in good
quality housing on a similar basis to council housing, I am becoming
increasingly concerned about their behaviour and conduct. Increasingly,
they act like housing companies, not social landlords, and see
themselves as being in the property market, rather than in the
provision of housing for people who are in desperate need. That area is
in need of tight
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T12:38:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000247">The
third area is the private rented sector, which has traditionally been
very small in this country. It has now started to rise rapidly.
Nationally, it makes up 17% of the housing stock. That is predicted to
rise to 22% by 2025. It is an extremely different story in some parts
of the country. In the borough of Islington, which I am happy to

housing stock across the borough and is declining fast. Social
housing—housing association and council housing—is about
40% of the stock and rising, as the local authority, to its great
credit, manages to undertake some building programmes to ensure that
people have a decent roof over their head. However, the private rented

to pay any price that is offered and do not particularly care about it.
There are also those on middle incomes—young, professional
people who move into London and pay an extraordinarily high proportion
of what ought to be a decent wage on private rents. Then there are
people on very low incomes who cannot get anywhere near the housing
ladder but cannot get anywhere near getting a council property either.

establish local authority run, fair-rent regulation authorities, the
first of which would cover the whole of Greater London. We would start

Minister of State, Home Department (Norman Baker):</Member></B> I will
be brief because, as Members will recall, clause 104 introduces a new
offence of forced marriage. The new offence is an important part of our
efforts to stamp out that appalling practice, and will send a clear
message that it will not be tolerated. I am pleased the Scottish
Government has also decided that forced marriage should be a criminal
offence, and new clause 9 introduces a similar provision for Scotland.
Breach of a forced marriage protection order is already a criminal
offence in Scotland, so there is no need for a similar amendment to
mirror clause 103, which makes that the case in England and Wales. The
other amendments in the group are consequential on new clause
9.</hs_Para>

Opposition accept the need to deal decisively with forced marriage in
Scotland, as in England, and we are pleased that the Government are
extending to Scotland provisions that make forcing someone into a
marriage a criminal offence. We therefore support the new clause and
its consequential amendments. It was clear from evidence taken in
Committee that there are differing views on the issue, and some who are
active in the sector oppose the use of criminal law in that area
because they believe it would deter victims from reporting what is
happening to them. That is an understandable view, but not one I share.
Victims of forced marriage are British. They are of many ages, although
many are young people. British boys and girls, of whatever colour,
deserve the same protection as every other British boy and
girl.</hs_Para>

is important to make the point that forced marriages are not about
religious beliefs—they are not condoned by any of the major
faiths, whether Christianity, Islam or Hinduism. Forced marriages are
about abuse, often of children. What we condemn as abuse in any other
sector of society cannot be condoned because of the colour of a
person’s skin, their ethnic background or their parents’
culture. I am therefore glad that new clause 9 will make coercing
someone into a marriage a criminal offence in all parts of the UK. I
hope we will give young people, their communities and others the
confidence to challenge forced marriage and to stand up and say no,
knowing that they are supported by the law throughout the country, and,
I would hope, by others in the
community.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000270" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000270">It
is fair to say that, in some respects, Scotland has moved ahead of the
rest of the UK on the matter because, as the Minister has said, breach
of a forced marriage protection order is a criminal offence in
Scotland, as it will be in the rest of the UK when the Bill becomes
law. It is therefore clearly right that new clause 9 extends the
criminal offence of coercing someone into a marriage into Scottish law.
However, the UK Government and the Scottish Government need to do much
more. No forced marriage protection orders have been issued in Scotland
since its current legislation came into force, and yet no one would
seriously argue that there were no forced marriages last year. In fact,
the UK forced marriage unit gave support in 1,483 cases related to
possible forced marriage. That is a high number, but the National 
<?notus-xml column=604?>Centre for Social research report published in 2009 estimated that there
were between 5,000 and 8,000 reported cases throughout the UK each
year. Of course, many cases go
unreported.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000271" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000271">The
Opposition therefore support the Government’s legislation for
Scotland and the rest of the UK, but I should tell the Minister that
the legislation by itself is not enough. We need to put in place a
system that allows people to report when they are at risk of forced
marriage, that encourages them to report, and that offers them the
support they need. Currently, that is sadly lacking. For example, much
more work needs to be done in schools, so that teachers are alert to
the signs that a pupil might be being forced into marriage. Young
people need to be educated so that, if they or one of their friends are
at risk, they know where to seek
help.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000272" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000272">I
therefore ask the Minister to say what the Government are doing to
raise awareness of forced marriage. Where is the money to fund such a
campaign? In 2012, the forced marriage unit said that many agencies,
whether those dealing with children or with vulnerable adults, still
did not recognise forced marriage as a safeguarding issue. That is
totally unacceptable. There is evidence that police throughout the UK
recognise the need to deal with forced marriage proactively, but other
agencies—not just schools, but colleges and health
organisations—still have a long way to go. I hope Ministers
discuss the measures needed with the Scottish Government, so that we
can develop a common approach throughout these

Government proposals in the group are on the setting of fees for two
distinct public services. New clause 10 concerns fees charged by the
Disclosure and Barring Service. It is Government policy—I
imagine and hope that this is supported by hon. Members on 
<?notus-xml column=606?>both sides of the House—to encourage volunteering in our
communities. To that end, it has long been the case that criminal
record checks, where needed, such as in respect of work with children,
are provided free of charge to volunteers. The new clause puts on a
clear statutory basis the ability of the Home Secretary to take into
account the cost of providing criminal record certificates and other
services covered by part V of the Police Act 1997 when determining the
fees charged for those services.</hs_Para>

clause 28 contains substantive provisions to replace clause 147, which,
as we made clear, was a placeholder clause. The new clause provides the
Lord Chancellor with a general power to set fees at a level that
exceeds the cost of the related services. The services are those
provided by the courts in England and Wales, including the Court of
Protection, the tribunals for which the Lord Chancellor is responsible
and the Office of the Public Guardian. The primary focus of our
proposals for using this power will be the courts of England and Wales.
The courts play a vital role in our society, providing access to
justice so that the public can assert their legal rights. Ensuring that
they are properly resourced is essential to maintaining access to
justice. This must be delivered when public spending is required to
fall—deficit reduction is one of the Government’s key
priorities—and the courts and those who use them must make a
contribution.</hs_Para>

new clause 28 makes clear, the purpose of enhanced fees is to finance
an efficient and effective court system. This change to the way that
fees are set will help to ensure that courts are properly resourced to
deliver modern, efficient services so that access to justice is
protected. The proposed legislation provides a general power; specific
fees would be increased through secondary legislation. When a specific
fee or fees are set at an enhanced 
<?notus-xml column=607?>level for the first time, the order will be subject to the affirmative
resolution procedure—there will be full debate in both Houses.
Any subsequent changes to those fees will be subject to the negative
procedure.</hs_Para>

will shortly be consulting on proposals to achieve full cost recovery,
less remissions, in the civil and family courts. However, even on this
basis the running of the court system in England and Wales costs more
than £1 billion a year, so we need to go further in
reducing the burden on taxpayers. We believe it is fair and
proportionate that those who use the courts and can afford to do so
should make a greater contribution to their overall funding. That is
why we are bringing forward this provision to allow fees to be set
above cost in some circumstances.</hs_Para>

me assure the House that we will not be using the power to set
excessively high fees. In setting fees, the Lord Chancellor must have
regard to the principle that access to the courts must not be denied.
The new clause requires him to have regard to the overall financial
position of the courts and tribunals, and the international
competitiveness of the legal services market. We are not bringing
forward specific plans for charging enhanced fees at this stage. We
want to take some time to ensure that we get the measures right. As I
said, we will consult widely on the proposals and look carefully at how
any proposed court fees might compare with the overall cost of
litigation, the value of the issues at stake and the fees charged by
our international competitors. Following the consultation there will,
as I have indicated, be full parliamentary scrutiny of any enhanced
fees that we decide to introduce.</hs_Para>

95 relates to miscarriages of justice. I am proud to serve the city of
Birmingham. In 1974, the city saw the most appalling terrorist outrage
when, as a consequence of bombings by the Provisional IRA,
21 innocent citizens died. Six innocent people were then
convicted of that terrorist outrage. I should make it clear that I have
been a lifelong opponent of violence by the Provisional IRA. My mother
and father were both Irish. I was also on the executive of the National
Council for Civil Liberties for many years, and served as its chairman.
In that period, we campaigned against terrorist violence and for
justice at a time when it was sometimes difficult to stick one’s
head up and say that what had happened to the Birmingham Six and the
Guildford Four was unacceptable. Sixteen years after the Birmingham Six
were sent to prison, they were released and found to have been wrongly

thoroughly support new clause 10, because it is right that we recognise
volunteers. Too often, people have had to pay far too much to go

is an issue, however, about the availability of the right level of
disclosure for criminal record certificates. I thought I knew this area
reasonably well, but I did not realise until recently that it was not
possible to get a basic certificate—there are three levels:
basic, standard and enhanced—listing unspent convictions in
England and Wales; the only body that does it is Disclosure Scotland.
While getting the pricing correct, therefore, we must also ensure
availability. It seems perverse that only under Scots law can somebody
get what most employers ought to have access to. Most employers do not
realise that they should have the basic, rather than standard or
enhanced certificate. I hope that Ministers will consider that point
and ensure that while providing the right costings, we also get that
right, and that the Government implement the relevant provisions in the
Rehabilitation of Offenders Act

new clause 28, the Minister made a strong case for having some fees. I
think we would all agree that if a Russian oligarch makes great use of
our courts, they should make some contribution. None of us would
suggest that their having to pay £1,000 or so would inhibit
their ability to get justice. Perhaps the cost of using the courts
should be a fraction of the fees going to the lawyers; that might be a
safe way of ensuring that 
<?notus-xml column=610?>we make our fair share. That is not the route chosen, however, although
it is quite tempting, given how large the legal fees are in many of
these cases. It is not just Russian oligarchs, of course; it is anybody
with a very big transaction. It seems right that they should contribute
to the costs of our fantastic court

ensure, however, that people not in a position to pay are not hit. It
should still be possible for people without money to access the courts,
and in that, the fees system could help, because by taking more money
from those who have lots of it, we could subsidise those who do not. I
note that there is broad support for the idea that any money made
should be reinvested in improving our court system and ensuring that it
works well. Broadly, therefore, I am pleased to see the new

subsequent judicial appraisal of relevant evidence, been overturned,

Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark on behalf of the Joint

certainly am not minded to become involved in a contest relating to
whether the House should divide on whether to keep the whole clause or
on whether to amend it in the way suggested by amendment 95. On the
basis of what I have heard from Liberal Democrat Members, as well as
the important statements that we have heard from the Opposition Front
Bench, I will say that—although my party has no Members in the
House of Lords, and will have none until it has become a reformed and
democratic Chamber—if there are other worthy heads there that
are able to concentrate on this clause in its fullest and important
sense, I shall give them every encouragement to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T13:33:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000354" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000354">We
cannot treat this issue lightly. The Government may say, “It is
all about the compensation culture: it is simply about cutting
costs.” They may say that they do not want compensation to be
automatically provided in cases with which people might not be
comfortable because they might find the recipient unattractive, and
because it might relate to a crime about which there was a great deal
of deep and understandable public feeling. However, none of those
considerations should allow us to indulge a clause that would
fundamentally tilt the presumption of innocence—that would tilt
the balance away from someone’s guilt having to be proved beyond
reasonable doubt. People who have been convicted and deemed guilty may
be able to challenge that decision subsequently, but, even if they are
released, they may in a sense be unable to escape from the original
conviction.</hs_Para>

143 in its present form marks a significant and hugely detrimental
shift in the law which would make it far more difficult for individuals

Non-governmental organisations concerned with human rights, including
the Committee on the Administration of Justice, as well as highly
respected organisations such as Justice and Liberty, have expressed
major anxieties about the clause. As the hon. Member for Foyle (Mark
Durkan) explained very
eloquently,<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T13:36:35"></hs_TimeCode> an
individual who applies for compensation for a miscarriage of justice
must currently demonstrate that a court could not have established 
<?notus-xml column=616?>beyond reasonable doubt that he or she was guilty of the offence. Clause
143, however, shifts the burden of proof to the individual, and compels
that individual to prove that he or she is innocent of the offence. A
miscarriage of justice would henceforth be proved to have taken place
only if newly discovered facts showed beyond reasonable doubt that that
person was
innocent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T13:36:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000359">As
Justice has pointed out, since 2006 section 133 of the Criminal Justice
Act 1988 has provided the only avenue for individuals to obtain
financial redress after miscarriages of justice have occurred. It is
chilling to think that, had the proposed change in the law been in
place at the time, none of the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four, the
Maguire Seven or the Cardiff Three—I have some interest in that
case, and indeed referred to it earlier—would have satisfied the
innocence test.</hs_Para>

infamous cases, of course, paved the way for the establishment of the
Criminal Cases Review Commission. The individuals involved won
compensation because it was proved that the evidence that had been
brought against them was flawed, and that a jury could not have found
them guilty had the case been retried. As was made clear by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T13:37:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Foyle, the justice system of England and Wales is unlike
the Scottish system in that a case cannot be found to be
“not proven”, although there have been arguments about
that
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T13:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000361">In
the notorious cases that I have just listed, the rule of thumb for the
awarding of compensation was always that the individuals would receive
the amount that they would have earned had they been working during the
time when they were wrongfully imprisoned. The purpose of that was to
ensure that they would not be impoverished when they were released. It
would be wicked indeed to deny individuals that compensation when the
justice system has gone
wrong<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T13:38:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000362" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0001.htm#13101587000362">Under
the current law, it is already exceptionally difficult to persuade the
criminal Court of Appeal to review new evidence. For cases to qualify,
the Criminal Cases Review Commission is required to apply
section 13(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995, which
provides that individuals must satisfy a “real possibility
test”. Arguably, both the Criminal Cases Review Court and the
Court of Appeal adopt an excessively strict interpretation of this
test. They restrict reviews to new evidence that was not available at
the time of the trial or appeal, which means in practice that evidence
that was available at the time of the trial or appeal cannot be
considered, even in cases in which it was suppressed by the police.
Given how difficult it is to get cases referred to the Court of Appeal
under both the “real possibility test” and the need for
fresh evidence, it is harsh indeed that the Government are attempting
further to restrict people’s ability to gain compensation.
Innocence is far too high a test and would be virtually impossible to
prove after many years, which is when such cases are usually
heard.</hs_Para>

this view from the Supreme Court in the Adams case, which held
unanimously that the presumption of innocence is not infringed by the
current arrangements for compensating a miscarriage of justice. In our
view, the proposed change does not alter that analysis. As the European
Court acknowledged, more than an acquittal is required to establish
that there has been a miscarriage of justice. Through clause 143, we
are determining where that line should be

clause 143, there is no requirement for a person applying for
compensation for a miscarriage of justice to “prove”
their innocence. What is determinative is the fact on which the
conviction was overturned. So, for example, if a person’s
conviction is overturned because DNA evidence comes to light showing
they could not have committed the offence, it is only right that they
should be compensated. Following the coming into force of clause 143,
they will, as now, be eligible for
compensation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000387" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587000387">The

miscarriage of justice, the Court made it clear that states were

important points about the powers of police community support officers.
In particular, he proposed that two new powers should be conferred on
PCSOs: first, that they should be able to issue a fixed penalty notice
for riding a bicycle without lights; and, secondly, that they should be
able to search someone for controlled

gave a commitment to consider my hon. Friend’s proposals over
the summer, in the context of the specific role that PCSOs play in our
communities. As my hon. Friend pointed out, there is an inconsistency
in PCSOs’ powers around cycling. They can issue a penalty notice
for riding on a footway, but not for riding without lights. Extending
their powers in respect of cycling, as provided for in new clause 11,
would end this anomaly and complement their important engagement role.
Being on foot patrol, they are well-placed within their communities to
increase awareness and educate people about the importance of cycle
safety. Backing this up with the power to issue a penalty
notice could enhance the impact they have in their
neighbourhoods.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000431" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587000431">The
power to search for controlled dugs is more complicated. We do need to
keep a clear distinction between the role of a PCSO and that of a
constable. We need to be mindful of the risk that new powers could
increase the element of confrontation in the role of PCSOs and detract
from their presence on the streets. It is vital that we get this right
and, accordingly, we are still considering whether such an expansion of
powers is appropriate. I assure my hon. Friend that I will let him and
the House know the outcome of that consideration as quickly as
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101587002632" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587002632">2

low-value shop theft, clause 144 is intended to improve the management
through the courts of the high volume of shop thefts involving goods to
the value of £200 or less by enabling them to benefit from
procedures applying to summary only cases. In particular, offenders
will be able to plead guilty by post and, in turn, the police will be
able to prosecute suitable cases directly as “specified
proceedings”, without the need to involve the Crown Prosecution
Service. That will simplify procedures and enable swifter justice in
such cases. Although clause 144 makes low-value shop theft
“summary only”, it preserves the defendant’s right
to be tried at the Crown Court, through subsection (2) of new section
22A of the Magistrates’ Courts Act 1980. Amendment 136, tabled
by my hon. Friend the Member for Shipley,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:01:40"></hs_TimeCode>would remove
that subsection. The Government have been clear that they will defend
the right to trial by jury; it is an historic freedom that is rightly
protected by the coalition’s programme for government. Although
the statistics suggest that the right is not often exercised in cases
of shop theft—last year, only 700 out of 77,000 cases went to
the Crown Court—we see no reason to depart from that general
principle. In this instance, I urge my hon. Friend to reconsider his
amendment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000435" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587000435">Government
amendments 61, 69 and 73 are consequential on those changes. Amendment
61 will ensure that a range of powers in the Police and Criminal
Evidence Act 1984 available to the police and others to deal with
indictable offences, which currently includes all theft from shops,
will remain available to deal with the theft of goods of a value of
£200 or less. That means that magistrates will still be able to
issue search warrants, the police will be able to enter premises to
search for evidence or arrest suspects, and store detectives will still
be able to arrest suspects. I hope that that provides some reassurance
to some retailers that I know have been anxious about this. The
amendment also ensures that the equivalent PACE provisions applying to
service personnel are similarly amended to preserve relevant powers of
investigation. This will ensure that cases of shop theft can continue
to be investigated and pursued appropriately and rigorously by the
police, while providing that where individuals are to be prosecuted in
court, that can be done more efficiently and

infiltration of peaceful protesters in the environmental movement by
Mark Kennedy; serious questions have been asked about the

Let me make myself clear: undercover policing is vital in the fight
against serious organised crime and terrorism, and is a key part of the
police’s ability to keep communities safe. I pay tribute to the
work done by brave police officers in dangerous and often difficult
circumstances. However, undercover operations are also incredibly
sensitive and have a substantial impact on the lives of members of the
public. As such, they require the highest ethical and operational
standards. That is why we have tabled new clause 27 to ensure that all
long-term undercover operations would be signed off by a relevant
independent body, to ensure that this important tool is used
proportionately, sensitively and only when necessary, and with clear
and improved accountability arrangements. That type of sign-off for
police operations has precedent. If the police or security services
want to break in and bug a room or intercept a phone call, they have to
have a justification in the interests of national
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:06:44"></hs_TimeCode>—</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000439" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587000439"><Member ContinuationText="David T.

deal with new clause 26. Last year alone, 4% of retail staff were
attacked at work and 34% were threatened with violence. Our new clause
seeks to address a discrepancy in sentencing policy regarding people
who suffer serious assaults during the course of their daily
employment. At present, sentencing guidelines are explicit that an
aggravating factor in determining a sentence for common assault on a
public-facing worker should be whether the offence was committed
against an individual working in the public sector or providing a
service to the public. Whereas assaulting a police constable while they
are discharging their duty is a separate offence that carries an
additional sentence, an attack on those in public sector employment,
such as nurses, is an aggravated offence. However, that consideration 
<?notus-xml column=629?>does not apply in respect of the millions of hard-working people in our
shops, petrol stations and restaurants. That leaves the judge to decide
under which of the three categories of harm and culpability, the 19
aggravating factors and the 11 factors reducing the seriousness,
assaulting a staff member falls. That is why there is real concern,
particularly but not exclusively in the retail sector, about the level
of attacks on employees and the sentencing guidelines—or lack
thereof<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:09:24"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
a real problem, brought to the public attention not only by unions such
as the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers but by the
British Retail Consortium, who have come together to advance the
“Freedom from Fear” campaign.</hs_Para>

some progress has been made—of that there is no
doubt—there remains an unacceptable level of assaults against
public-facing workers, with 30,000 attacks on shop staff reported last
year. Indeed, the British Retail Consortium estimates that the figure
could be as high as 35,000. That does not include those that were not
reported. Our proposed new clause simply makes it clear that attacking
an individual in the course of their employment should be considered an
aggravating factor, whether they work in the public or the private
sector.</hs_Para>

which only a handful of legal highs are scrutinised every year. This is
a marketplace where new products constantly evolve, many of which put
those who use them seriously at risk, and in the future we should
tackle the problem, banning the use of such products, while, where
appropriate, putting out of business those who promote and sell them. I
hope that the Government will respond positively to this powerful case,

I agree with most of what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:15:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Birmingham, Erdington (Jack Dromey) said. I particularly support
new clause 26 on public-facing workers. I have little need to add
anything. The hon. Gentleman was absolutely right in everything he
said. In fact, only yesterday, I dealt with a lady, a retail worker,
who had been spat at at close range. Obviously, I meet many rail staff
who—the hon. Gentleman did not mention this—are the
victims of daily verbal and physical abuse. We have already heard about
nurses, too. I absolutely agree with the new clause and told my Whips
that I would support it and vote for it, if it came to a
vote.</hs_Para>

am saddened that I am unable to do so, however, because of new clause
34, about which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:16:29"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stockport will speak in a minute. I ask her to think very carefully
about that, because the clause would reverse some of the good work that
would be done by new clause 26. It would take away some of the rights
that police constables, who are, after all, public sector,
public-facing workers, should have. They should have the same rights as
nurses, rail staff, bus drivers and the rest. That is important because
police officers are often called to domestic dwelling houses late at
night, in cases where drugs and drink can be involved, and they will
suffer horrendous verbal abuse and, sometimes, threats of physical
abuse. I do not think that police officers 
<?notus-xml column=631?>should have to put up with that any more than social workers or anyone
else who goes into a private dwelling house.</hs_Para>

clause 34 might also have unintended consequences. I am not trying to
suggest that anyone is doing anything wrong, but sometimes neighbours
might ring to allege that domestic violence is taking place and, when
the police officer arrives, they might find one angry male—I am
sorry if that is a stereotype, but it is often the case—under
the influence of drink and shouting, swearing and so on. If neither of
the people in that house is able to make an accusation, the fact that
one person is drunk and shouting might be enough to allow a police
officer to remove them from the premises by arresting them under the
Public Order Act 1986. That is not something that police officers do
lightly because they know that any arrest needs to be
proportionate and that they will have to take somebody in front of a
custody officer, who will not take kindly to arrests made without due
cause. I ask the hon. Lady to think very carefully about her
new clause.</hs_Para>

new clause would change the law to make the use of racist or other
abusive language in a dwelling house an offence when it was directed at
a policeman. I was recently contacted by a serving police officer from
my constituency who was present when a colleague from the Greater
Manchester police was called a “nigger” in a private
house. Under section 4A of the Public Order Act 1986, no offence is
committed if the “harassment, alarm or distress” takes
place inside a dwelling house—that is, somebody’s house
or flat. I was surprised by that because, like many people, I was under
the impression that racist abuse was an offence wherever it was
committed. However, this is not the case. I was shocked to hear that
somebody could not be charged with the offence because it took place in
a dwelling against a police officer pursuing his
duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:19:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000460" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587000460">My
amendment would make it an offence to use racist or other abusive
language against a police constable who was present in a dwelling in
the execution of his duty. The police officer from my constituency
described attending a property where two men were aggressively arguing.
One was very drunk and called one of the police officers a nigger. The
officer described seeing her colleague abused and she told me,
“I was quite horrified he had to endure this kind of abuse. I
felt very frustrated and helpless that we could not charge the offender
with any offence.” I am sure that this is by no means an
isolated case and I suspect that other professionals such as social
workers and health visitors have also been subject to racist abuse when
visiting a person at their home
address<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:20:20"></hs_TimeCode>. It does
not seem right to me or, I suspect, to the public that if the police
officer had been called a 
<?notus-xml column=632?>nigger in the street, an offence would have been committed, but none was
committed because it happened inside a house. I hope the Minister will
feel able to consider the amendment that I

amendments 179, 178, 180, 181 and 183. I do that not just in my own
name, but on behalf of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, which
examined the issue as part of its consideration of the Bill. The Joint
Committee is disappointed that the Government have not yet published in
full their responses to their consultation on schedule 7. These are
controversial issues. Of course, we need anti-terrorist legislation and
there is always a balance to be worked out between the civil liberty of
the subject and the powers of the authorities.

believe, however, that it is very important that legislation
distinguishes between the conventional powers to stop, to
search, and to question, which can be exercised without reasonable
suspicion, and more intrusive powers, such as those of
detaining and taking biometric samples, for which
the Committee believes the Government have not yet made a persuasive
case. The Joint Committee recommends introducing a
reasonable suspicion requirement for the more intrusive powers under
schedule 7.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:22:00"></hs_TimeCode> know that some
argue that schedule 7 should go altogether. That is not the position of
the Joint Committee nor, coincidentally, is it the position of my
party, which debated this at our conference in Glasgow a few weeks ago

set out by the Joint

issue came to prominence, as the House will remember, in August, when
Mr David Miranda was stopped at Heathrow when coming into this country
on his way back home to Brazil and was detained for nine hours under
the anti-terror laws. There were protests by the Brazilian Government
and widespread concern about whether the powers were used extensively.
We hope we can persuade the Government to take the position of the
Joint Committee on Human Rights, but we will not seek to divide the
House this afternoon, hoping there might be a chance not just for my

PCSOs, allowing them to issue fixed penalty notices to cyclists riding
without lights. I am a huge champion of cycling. I was delighted when
the House passed a motion to get Britain cycling. One of the banes of
my life in that context is cyclists who do not obey the rules of the
road. Anything that we can do to get people to cycle safely and legally
will make it easier for those of us who want to extend facilities for
cyclists. There are sensible ways forward. In Cambridge we have been
using a “lights instead of tickets” campaign to make sure

There has been particular controversy

Southwark (Simon Hughes) mentioned, because of the detention of David
Miranda, the partner of <I>The</I> <I>Guardian</I> journalist working
on the Edward Snowden leaks. This has led to the Independent Police
Complaints Commission taking the Met to the High Court over failure to
address complaints and how schedule 7 is used. This is a very broadly
written power. It should not be a surprise that it has expanded from
its original use in Northern Ireland in the 1970s to become worse and
worse as illiberal Governments have made it even
heavier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T14:24:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587000468" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0002.htm#13101587000468">It
seems to me that it is not right for people who “look like
terrorists” to be detained. That is exactly what happens under
schedule 7. StopWatch has done a huge amount of work on this. Last year
there were 64,000 schedule 7 stops—a huge number. Twenty-seven
per cent. of those stopped for under an hour were Asian, much more than
their proportion in the community, and 77% of those stopped for more
than an hour were from ethnic minority populations. We should not
consider that acceptable. StopWatch cites some chilling quotes from one

There are many concerns about schedule 7. One option would be to get
rid of it. There are alternative powers in section 47A. I hope the
Minister will comment on what that is. There are other options that we
have looked at. I would like to see us committed to David Anderson

rule of law to that process and making sure that data collected are not
used inappropriately should be important in the case of David Miranda.

26, as I said in Committee, I entirely agree with the sentiments behind
the clause. The work of a great number of people, whether within the
public or the private sector, brings them into face-to-face contact
with members of the public, and we know that some of these
people suffer violence in the course of their jobs. It is essential
that we are satisfied that the law adequately addresses this issue.
However, I do not think the new clause is necessary to achieve that.
There is already a range of offences that have general application and
that criminalise violent behaviour and they would already apply in the
context envisaged by the clause. Sentencing guidelines specify that
where an assault is committed against someone providing a service to
the public, whether in the public or private sector, this is an
aggravating factor and so could well result in a higher sentence within
the current maximum. So I do not think the clause is necessary,

welcome. I particularly welcome the Government’s decision to
extend the law to private property. The onus will now be on owners to
exercise responsible control of their dogs at all times, which will be
welcomed not just by postal workers but by other delivery workers,
health visitors, doctors, party members canvassing at election times

believe that a strengthening of the defence must be built into the

defences given to householders who do their utmost to ensure they keep
their dogs under reasonable control. It is my contention, and that of
bodies such as the RSPCA, that the current defence does not do enough
to protect householders who do their best to keep their dogs under
control at all times. We can never legislate for all possibilities, and
it is important that we include the best possible defences in the Bill
to ensure that householders do not, for example, adopt the habit of
keeping dogs imprisoned in the house for most of the day because they
have 
<?notus-xml column=666?>visitors. That would be unreasonable, but the Bill as currently drafted
could make dog owners feel vulnerable to the proposed legislation, and

reasonable and I hope the Minister will take it seriously.</hs_Para>

point about the content of the Bill is that we need more than currently
exists. What we do have is not necessarily best designed and in many
ways is inadequate for encouraging responsible dog ownership and
improving the welfare of dogs more generally. We need not only
consolidation of the legislation but a comprehensive look at what
measures we need for dog control. That position is supported by a grand
coalition of charities and trade unions, including the RSPCA, the Dogs
Trust, the Blue Cross, and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home. The Dogs Trust
pointed out that 12 pieces of legislation in statute deal with dog
control, but little emphasis is placed on the prevention of attacks and
there is little focus on responsible dog ownership.</hs_Para>

legislation that deals with dog ownership in the broadest possible
sense, which is why I am working with animal welfare charities on a
strategy to take a long-term look at what needs to be done, and at how
charities work together to improve welfare standards and responsible
dog ownership. Once finalised, legislation will inevitably be part of
that strategy, focusing not only on dog control by the dog owner but on
the breeding and sale of dogs, and the responsibility of all involved
in dog welfare, including dog owners.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101587001657" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#13101587001657">The Bill does
not tackle that issue holistically or comprehensively, and along with
animal welfare charities I remain disappointed that we have not had a
dedicated Bill to update the legislation. Community protection notices
are a blunt and unwieldy measure, not suited to the task of tackling
irresponsible dog ownership. As indicated by the changes in new clause
17, the Bill contains no power to issue notices instantly so as to get
on top of a dog that is potentially dangerous or out of control as soon
as the situation occurs. In some cases, inevitably, the authorities
will wait until an attack has been committed before issuing a notice,
because they will not feel they should intervene and go through the
unwieldy procedure to get a written notice before they can make that
move. I do not believe that the Bill tackles those issues. New clause
3, tabled by my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Croydon North (Mr Reed), contains the
important requirement that an owner whose dog is potentially out of
control should be made to engage in training and behaviour courses
related to their ownership of the dog, and in that sense the new clause
is helpful.</hs_Para>

provides for a bespoke community protection notice modelled on the dog
control notices recommended by the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
Committee. Guidance has already been issued on community protection
notices and the measures in the Bill, but so far that guidance is long
and difficult to interpret, and much of the support offered is found in
the annexes to the guidance, not the guidance itself. As far as animal
welfare charities are concerned, there will be an issue about the
interpretation of that guidance, and a risk that animal welfare
standards will be compromised as a result of the way it has been
drafted. The guidance has not been produced properly in consultation
with animal welfare charities.</hs_Para>

have been patient, Mr Deputy Speaker—I will refer quickly to the
new clauses that relate to section 1 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.
Clearly, section 1 on breed-specific legislation is
not working. In a consultation run by the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs on that Act and the measures before us today,
71% of those consulted thought that the breed-specific section of that
Act should be repealed because it is not working. It costs a tremendous
amount of money to kennel dogs seized under section 1 of the Act, with
an annual cost over the past three financial years of £2.6
million for the Metropolitan police alone.</hs_Para>

clauses relate to the need to ensure that a time limit is imposed on
the courts regarding how long a banned-breed dog can be held before the
issue of whether it should be exempt from the legislation is dealt
with, to ensure that animal welfare standards are not compromised. That
is critical. There should also be the power to rehome dogs that are fit
for exemption but have nowhere to go. The only other choice available
to animal welfare charities at the moment is euthanasia, which is not
good enough. It is the deed not the breed, and I look forward to
hearing the Minister’s comments on that important issue, which I
know the Metropolitan police, as well as animal charities such as the
RSPCA, are keen to see dealt with.</hs_Para>

Crouch</B> (Chatham and Aylesford) (Con):</Member> I rise to address
amendment 133 tabled in my name, which looks specifically at extending
the Bill to include protected animals. I tabled a similar
amendment—slightly differently worded—in Committee, and
it has been redrafted by animal welfare charities for consideration
today. The amendment is intended to be limited in scope, and would not
capture a genuine, accidental attack by a dog on a protected
animal—that was one concern raised in Committee. For example,
some dogs chase cats or other small animals, and that would not be
caught by the amendment, which refers specifically to
attacks.</hs_Para>

general public are concerned about the increase, yet we do not have a
public record of the number of attacks and must rely on press reports.
We know that there have been 66 reports of attacks—mostly
fatal—on cats, including one last week, when the death of

problem is genuine for people who love their pets—it is
incredibly important to them. My proposal is designed to deal not only
with dog-chasing-cat events; attacks are often aggravated. The argument
in Committee was that the current legislation deals with the problem,
but some animal welfare charities beg to differ. For example, it is
true that the RSPCA has used section 4 of the Animal Welfare Act 2006
on occasion to prosecute 
<?notus-xml column=668?>following dog attacks on other animals, but there is often incitement by
the animal’s keeper or a history of other attacks. It can
therefore be difficult to obtain information or prove a case, which
means that section 4 is not a straightforward mechanism for
prosecution.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101587002637" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#13101587002637">3.30

that commitment, and the Government have gone a long way to
address the problems with dog control notices. Tellingly,
organisations such as the Dogs Trust have made it clear that they are
assured that the principle of DCNs could be applied within a CPN.
However, the Dogs Trust has said—I am sympathetic to
this—that the draft guidance on CPN enforcement is vague,
particularly with regard to application. The Minister therefore needs
to reassure the House, the charities that have been in touch with hon.
Members on DCNs, and trade unions such as the Communication Workers
Union, which provided an excellent briefing in advance of the debate,
that CPNs will do as much if not more than DCNs. It is important that

clause 18 deals with a different situation—it is a simple
preventive measure to stop injuries to many people who, every year,
post millions of bits of paper through letterboxes. It is not unknown
for dogs to regard fingers put through letterboxes as curiosities and
fair game for fastening their teeth on. Some dogs are aggressive, but
others might simply believe they are being playful. The thought of a
dog hurtling itself at a letterbox might conjure up visions of an
hilarious scene from a sitcom, but for the real-life recipient, it can
be traumatic and painful. People can sustain injuries ranging from bite
marks and minor bruising to fingers or nerves being severed, causing
long-term injury. Some years ago, I had to take my constituency

rush out and buy a wire guard—if they have a good dog there is
no need to worry. However, if there is a chance that their dog might
jump up and, for whatever reason, bite someone through the letterbox,

me touch briefly on the issue of breeding dogs. We know that a strong
contributory factor to dogs becoming out of control is how they are

example, they are taken away from their mother too soon or are
appropriately socialised with other dogs and people or are sold to
people who know how to train and look after them. This may be an issue

attacks on all protected animals. Attacking other animals is a sign
that dogs are becoming dangerously out of control and therefore a

trauma of an attack and the related veterinary expenses and heartache?
Many owners are actually injured while trying to protect their beloved
pets, such as the woman in Atherton who, just two weeks ago, lost part

enter other people’s properties with malicious intent should do
so entirely at their own risk, and to support the extension to private

the Member for Bolton West 
<?notus-xml column=676?>(Julie Hilling) has been affected in more recent times. We have heard
the worst examples and seen evidence in newspapers and on television of
the most tragic injuries and of people who are permanently disfigured.
As we have heard, every year, thousands of people are hospitalised.
Every year, hundreds of thousands of people are attacked by a dog and
may not present themselves to the NHS. For many of those people, there
are long-term psychological consequences. For people on the front line
who go into homes, be they social workers, BT workers, meter readers or
energy company staff, such attacks can have a long-term impact on their
ability to work.</hs_Para>

we have heard, the attacks come at a great cost. The estimates that we
have are very conservative. There is a cost of £10 million a
year to the NHS. That should cause any Government concern. Equally, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:58:22"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Sherwood (Mr Spencer) said, people who are visually impaired will
be affected if their guide dog is attacked. I do not think that enough
of us know—I learned this only recently—that it costs
£50,000 to train and look after a guide dog over its lifetime.
That is all charitable money. If a guide dog is attacked by a dog, not
only will there be a cost and long-term consequences for the guide dog,
but the owner, who has spent time bonding with the guide dog and has
depended on it, will no longer have a friend. That can also have
long-term
consequences<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:59:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587001719" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#13101587001719">I

carefully to the Minister’s response, too, but I have strong
concerns. As it stands, CPNs are very bureaucratic and practitioners
will need a lot of time and resource to implement them. They will not
sufficiently address dog behaviour and welfare. That is, essentially,
what all of us here are talking about
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:00:23"></hs_TimeCode>. There are

They would also serve to impress upon enforcers the need to ensure
expertise among those authorised to issue notices. We have not spoken
about what a DCN would specifically do. It would place a responsibility
on an owner to undertake requirements tailored to the need of the
individual and their dog. That could be something as simple as the use
of a lead or a muzzle at an appropriate time, or the maintenance of a
dog-proof fence, or a request to undertake some training. I have
attended events the Dogs Trust puts on for free, so I have met many
people

over 3,000 responses to the consultation, and although there was strong
support for an increased maximum penalty, there was no consensus as to
where to set the bar. Given the volume of responses, I regret that it
has not been possible for the Department to conclude its consideration
of the issue in time to table a Government amendment on Report, but I
can reassure my hon. Friend the Member for Bedford (Richard Fuller)
that the Government will table an amendment to increase the maximum

Government amendment will reflect the high public concern that two
years is an insufficient penalty for these offences, and the fact that
some 16 adults and children have died in dog attacks since 2005, and
some 10 assistance dogs are attacked by other dogs every
month. As the consultation made clear, we will be looking to
distinguish between attacks on people and attacks on assistance dogs.
For attacks on people and where a person is killed or seriously
injured, I am attracted—perhaps given my former role as a
Transport Minister—by the comparison with penalties for causing
death or serious injury by dangerous driving. Where a dog attacks an
assistance dog, we will be looking at a lower maximum penalty, but one

of control in a park, a written notice can be issued on the spot by the
relevant officer who has control in that situation. The owner would
then be given a “reasonable time”, which might be just
five minutes, to respond. If the dog is not brought under control in
that time, the community protection notice can be issued right away. I
do not understand why the Opposition think that there could be huge
delays in the process, because there could not. It is a simple piece of

remarks. I have not been a Home Office Minister for long, but I dealt
with dog legislation for many years in opposition, so I think I know
what the legislation says. I have given him an absolute assurance that
the issues the Opposition are concerned about, as am I, such as
microchipping and neutering, could all be dealt with under the
community protection notice. I have given the hon. Member for
Liverpool, Wavertree an
assurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:24:18"></hs_TimeCode> that
those matters can be dealt with very quickly. Those are the two points
that the Opposition are perfectly correct to pursue, and I have given
answers that I had hoped would satisfy them. I guess the proof of the
pudding is in the eating. As far as I am concerned, the measures they

whether it can be dealt with quickly and effectively, which is what the

hon. Member for Penistone and Stocksbridge (Angela Smith), who is
seeking to intervene while I am trying to respond to her points,
proposes to reduce the time delay that can take place following the
seizure of a suspected section 1 dog, such as a pit bull terrier,
before it is examined by expert witnesses for the defence or
prosecution to assess whether it is a prohibited dog. I understand her
concerns about the impact that such delays can have on the welfare of
dogs. That is why we are committed to bringing forward regulations next
year to make it clear that when the police seize a suspected prohibited
dog they will not be required to kennel it, but need do so only where
they are satisfied that the situation of dog and owner do not present a
risk to public safety. It is right to give the police this discretion,
and that is the aim that we intend to take forward. It will be a
condition of release, if release occurs, that the owner consents to the
dog being muzzled and on a lead in public, as well as being
microchipped and neutered before it can be released back to the owner.
This is to ensure public safety and to prevent breeding from section 1
dogs. On that basis, we do not consider the hon. Lady’s new
clause 29 to be
necessary.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587001779" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#13101587001779">I

the Member for Chatham and Aylesford (Tracey Crouch), which seek to
extend the offence in section 3 of the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 to cover
incidents where a dog injures or kills a protected animal. I entirely
understand and sympathise with her reason for proposing that measure.
She listed some of the existing legislation, which does have an effect
and can be used in certain circumstances, including the Animal Welfare
Act 2006, the Animals Act 1971, the Dogs Act 1871, and the Dogs
(Protection of Livestock) Act 1953. It is rather unfortunate that the
Criminal Damage Act 1971 classifies animals as goods or property in
this respect.</hs_Para>

the concern of people whose cat is savaged by a dog, but the way

attacks a horse and a rider, because the rider is likely to have
“reasonable apprehension” 
<?notus-xml column=685?>that the dog will injure them, and therefore an offence would be
created. My hon. Friend also referred to the livestock issues that I
mentioned earlier. We are keen to make sure that other animals are
protected. However, as I said, the general nature of the legislation
provides options through, for example, the injunction procedure to see
whether there are other avenues that can be taken to deal with dogs

been much improved by the scrutiny of this House. We often beat
ourselves up—and are beaten up by people outside—about
the level and quality of scrutiny we apply to legislation in this
House, but I think the Bill is now in better shape than it was when it
entered Committee, and for that I thank hon. Members from across the
House. Foremost among the improvements is the insertion of a whole new
part of the Bill at the instigation of my hon. Friend the Member for
Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood), and 67 other right hon.
and hon. Members from across the House who supported new clause 5. I
pay tribute to my hon. Friend for the energy and perseverance she has

2012-13, well over 1,000 people were convicted in this country of
offences relating to child sexual exploitation. It is a horrible and
repulsive crime and we owe it to the victims, and to all children, to
do all we can to eliminate it. Prosecutions and convictions are
essential, but by then, of course, the damage is done—or, as my
hon. Friend put it, a childhood has been lost. We must therefore do
more to prevent such horrendous crimes from occurring in the first
place.</hs_Para>

which help protect the public from individuals whose behaviour means
there is a risk that they will sexually abuse or otherwise sexually
harm others, play an important part in our prevention strategy. 
<?notus-xml column=690?>Although provision for such orders has been in statute for 10 years, and
there are many cases in which they have been used effectively, it is
clear that the current regime in the Sexual Offences Act 2003 is too
inflexible. Instead of supporting the protection of vulnerable
children, it places unreasonable obstacles in the way of keeping them
safe. The new sexual harm prevention order and sexual risk order will
simplify and strengthen the current powers available to the police,
rebalancing the scales of justice in favour of children and vulnerable
adults.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587002352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0003.htm#13101587002352">In
many respects, the approach we are taking to the reform of civil
prevention orders under the Sexual Offences Act mirrors our approach to
antisocial behaviour powers, and as in that case, the Bill sweeps away
the complex and bureaucratic array of powers that put unnecessary
obstacles in the way of front-line professionals taking fast and
effective action to protect vulnerable people and communities. With the

have identified important shortcomings, but we will grant the Third

been debated, which have been raised by Members of all parties. Some
issues have seen cross-party co-operation—for example,

which I served. After my active participation, I am in no doubt that it
may well be my last! I was pleased to play a role and I think that we
Back Benchers sometimes underestimate and undervalue the work we do in

am particularly proud to have made some progress on the issue of
bullying—a subject on which I feel strongly, and I believe that
the House should continue to feel strongly about it. It is an issue

Building advice on bullying into Home Office guidance is a very
positive step forward. I would have liked to see more, but that is for
another day. We can continue to discuss online safety and
cyber-bullying via the Select Committee on Home Affairs and the Select
Committee on Culture, Media and Sport, and I have no doubt that we will
come back to those issues at some future date.</hs_Para>

Member for Delyn (Mr Hanson), but I disagree that we should be harking
back to the halcyon days of ASBOs. Although they might have started off
as a very good measure for tackling antisocial behaviour, the simple
truth is that the breach rates are far too high. Clearly, then, because

<?notus-xml column=696?>it is broke, it needs fixing. We can argue about how best to fix it, but
I think that the Government proposals will strengthen our response to
antisocial behaviour.</hs_Para>

Minister and the House will be pleased to hear that I recently attended
a residents’ meeting in Chatham at which we discussed the
significantly high levels of antisocial behaviour in one small part of
a ward. The police told residents that new provisions were going
through Parliament as they spoke that would enable them to deal much
more effectively with this problem in the future, including by ensuring
some sort of community punishment. We have introduced what I consider
to be sensible measures to ensure that people who commit crimes do not
go into the stocks, but I can tell the Minister that my residents were
very keen to put some of those perpetrators of antisocial behaviour
into the stocks. I am pleased that we have amended the Bill to provide
for proportionality of response, but I am also pleased that there will
be an opportunity to impose community punishments such as cleaning up
all the litter or getting rid of all the graffiti. That will be greatly

main changes that have been made relate to extradition. There was a
fair degree of consensus on the Bill, which was why at one point we had
to slow down a little so that the extradition clauses could be tabled.
The Committee had also considered the issue of extradition. In recent
years, we have seen a number of examples of why the European arrest
warrant is sometimes a good thing for Britain. We have seen gangsters
extradited from Spain very quickly, sometimes within hours, and
identified. One can understand why the Home Secretary is minded to opt
back into the arrest warrant, following an opt-out, subject to
reassurances.</hs_Para>

we are also aware of many constituency cases in which people have not
been treated so well, and human rights have not been dealt with
according to the good old British tradition of allowing a someone his
day in court. People have been whipped out of the country somewhere
abroad, have spent a period in prison, and have ended up either not
being charged or being acquitted. It is a pity that we did not have an
opportunity to explore that more fully today, although I know that a
good many Members will be doing so. Of course, the House of Lords is

the issues—and I am sure that there will be proper scrutiny in

people often used them as a badge of honour. We have also heard that
the public do not think that they were effective. Last year, about 8%
of people in an Angus Reid poll said that ASBOs were an effective way
of reducing antisocial behaviour. Therefore, I am pleased that we are
moving away from them. Unlike the shadow Minister, I am pleased that we

Bill, from pre-legislative scrutiny to now, that they are listening and
will reflect. I hope that that will continue in the other place and
that this can be the right sort of Bill that helps us to deal with the
genuine problem of antisocial behaviour, but also protects, indeed
enhances, civil liberties by retreating from some of the things that
the previous Government introduced—antisocial behaviour orders,
schedule 7 to the Terrorism Act and much
more.</hs_Para>

between the two sides of the House on the Bill, it appears principally
to centre on whether ASBOs have been a good thing. I understand that
there is politics around this and the Labour party is deeply attached

become a badge of honour for some teenagers, and the breach rates of
ASBOs among teenagers in particular have risen to such levels that they

I have said, this motion allows for charges to be imposed in connection

would be granted for the exploration or exploitation of any of the
certain mineral types for which the International Seabed Authority has
regulations—currently, those are polymetallic nodules,
polymetallic sulphides and ferromanganese cobalt-rich crusts. The
licence would be specific to a particular area of the deep sea bed and
it would not have effect until the ISA issued a corresponding contract

saying, the application fee for an exploration licence stands at

continue to hold the licence; those fees are £15,000 for the

the third year. Those are substantial sums; indeed the fee for an
application to the ISA is $500,000. Those involved are not small-scale
companies but businesses that are prepared to make significant
investments in the search for minerals on the deep sea bed. Two
licences have been issued under the Deep Sea Mining (Temporary
Provisions) Act 1981, and should this Bill become law we hope it will
encourage other companies to apply. The fees go into the Consolidated

got to the stage where Wales had the chance to make laws on its own
soil, not for the first time in history, but for the first time in
1,000 years. Laws were made by Hywel Dda between 942 and 950, and they
were very progressive. One stated that if a wife caught her husband in
bed with another woman for the third time, she could divorce him and
get compensation for the previous two occasions. Women had the right to
own land, which was progressive in 942. There was also a law—it
is rather better than the bedroom tax and other measures we have
now—stating that if a person had passed through three villages
asking for food but not been fed, he or she could not be punished for
stealing food. That was progressive Welsh legislation, and it should
have inspired the Government to realise that, as the great Welsh
proverb states: Hawdd cynnau tân ar hen aelwyd—it is easy

of State, I was the author of the Government of Wales Act 2006, under
which this process took place. I can tell my hon. Friend, and the
House, that in no way was that Act drafted and designed to allow for
this situation to occur. The drafting of the relevant clause dealt with
cross-border issues where there were questions, for example, about
rivers that flowed across the border or other environmental concerns
about which there might be disputes after a Wales Act had been passed
by the UK Government in Westminster. There needed to be a reserve power
by which the Secretary of State for Wales could clarify or tidy up
anything that resulted from such a cross-border issue. It was never

Secretary of State for Wales is responsible for initiating the action.
The sad thing is that in each case, he has acted right at the last
minute. Instead of discussing early on whether the Assembly was taking
the appropriate measures or proceeding in the right way, on each
occasion he has waited until the very last minute, when the Welsh
Assembly Government have had everything ready and have been prepared to
act, to raise the objection, in an almost obstructive manner. I
hesitate to use that word because it might be considered
unparliamentary to

for Wales, virtually all the responsibilities of my predecessors had
gone to the National Assembly for Wales. Although my hon. Friend and
I—we have been friends for far too many years to
remember—were not always on the same path on the issue, we have
ended up in the same place on it, not least because the people of Wales

Wales and Northern Ireland. Beyond that, there is machinery, for which
I was once responsible, for joint ministerial committees. If necessary,
there is British-Irish Council. All that means that matters can be
resolved

rather fancy that the Solicitor-General will talk about whether the
National Assembly has the powers to do certain things and whether it
acts ultra vires or intra vires. Even those points can be resolved by
diplomatic means, however, if they are talked through. By going to the
Supreme Court, we press the nuclear button. Although that might satisfy
the lawyers, civil servants and Ministers who think it should be done,
they are unwittingly doing immense damage to the devolutionary
settlement, whether in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland. The whole
purpose of devolving legislation and administration to those three
countries and regions of the United Kingdom is that they are allowed,
by Act of Parliament and by referendum, to take their own decisions. If
the Government do not like something, a crafty way to stop it is not
through negotiation among Ministers but by going to the courts. That is

measure was to protect more than 13,000 low-paid agricultural workers

time—rightly, in some ways, because they caused delay and were
complex, even for the very good officials in the Wales Office in London

the minutiae. The intention—to afford proper scrutiny in
Parliament and ensure that the Welsh Government could introduce their
own measures under the process within their clearly devolved

there was a good spirit. We managed to pass LCOs into legislation, even

hon. Gentleman, in his characteristic way, brought in history and his
own political struggle over many years, and it was clear that he would
like devolution to go further still. That is his viewpoint. I found the
information about the three villages law of 945 particularly
interesting, although I am not sure that it would be of current import
and could cause some concerns if implemented by the current Government.
It is not the Conservative’s stance on law and order, but it was
an interesting piece of context.</hs_Para>

of the debate is the role of the Attorney-General in reviewing
legislation passed by the National Assembly for Wales—a role
that I share with him. Despite the comments of
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:24:57"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Neath (Mr Hain), this role was conferred by Parliament on
the Attorney-General under the Government of Wales Act 2006. That was,
of course, under a Labour Government, with their own approach to the
issue of devolution. They had set forward a system of devolution that
was a conferred powers model rather than the sort of model used
elsewhere in the United Kingdom. As that happened, Parliament
recognised that the devolution settlement for Wales must be made to
work. The 2006 Act sets out the 20 “devolved” subjects in
respect of which the National Assembly may legislate. It is the
responsibility of this Parliament to legislate in any area that is not
devolved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:25:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587002535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0004.htm#13101587002535">The
2006 Act provides for the Attorney-General to consider each Bill of the
National Assembly, so the Government look carefully at all legislation
passed by it to ensure that it falls within the Assembly’s
legislative competence. The Act provides that, where the
Attorney-General or I consider a Bill to go beyond the
Assembly’s competence, we can refer it to the Supreme Court to
decide the
question<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:26:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587002536" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0004.htm#13101587002536">All
of that recognises that it is in the nature of legislation that it may
often appear to be about more than one thing. Where that happens with
legislation passed by the National Assembly, a judgment has to be made
about whether the legislation is about something that either is or is
not devolved. The Government of Wales Act 2006 provides a means for the
Attorney-General and, if necessary, the Supreme Court, to arrive at
that judgment. If it did not, the devolution settlement could not work.
The same power to refer a Bill to the Supreme Court is conferred on the
Counsel General for Wales. In this way, there is an appropriate
equality between the UK Government and the Welsh
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:27:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101587002537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/debtext/131015-0004.htm#13101587002537">That
illustrates an important point that I do not want to get lost in the
debate. Something has been made of the idea that this Government are
anti-devolution or are somehow determined to thwart the will of the
Welsh Government and the democratically elected National Assembly for
Wales. Where concerns arise, as the right hon. Member for Torfaen (Paul
Murphy) said,
most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:27:15"></hs_TimeCode> are
resolved by a process of negotiation between the UK and the Welsh
Governments. My officials have excellent working relations with their
colleagues in the Wales Office and their opposite numbers in the
Counsel General’s Office. The Attorney-General and I have
excellent working relations, as one would expect, with the Secretary of

<?notus-xml column=718?>State for Wales and with the Counsel General, Theodore Huckle, QC.

was a problem with the UK Government making an effort to resolve issues
before they escalated to the Supreme Court. It is, however, the last
resort. The Wales Office, working with the Department for Environment,
Food and Rural Affairs, has discussed with the Welsh Assembly
Government concerns about the Agricultural Sector (Wales) Bill from the
outset, and the Secretary of State wrote to the First Minister as soon
as the draft Bill was available, expressing concerns about
it—but the Welsh Government could not be persuaded to address
them. The mechanisms provided under the Government of Wales Act 2006
will therefore need to be
followed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T18:28:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Under

to the Supreme Court is not a confrontational process. It does not
amount to this Government or any Government picking a fight with the

particular piece of Welsh legislation raises difficult devolution

process of resolution is to the benefit of the Welsh Government, the

those powers to the Assembly, allowing it to pass its own laws in 20

Causeway coast area and Northern Ireland as a whole have been severely
hit by unemployment in recent years. People will ask: has the whole UK
not been hit like that? The answer, of course, is yes, but more
significantly so in Northern Ireland. We have been cushioned a little
by the dependency on the public sector in Northern Ireland. In that
context, last week, no less a person than the Prime Minister was in
Northern Ireland to try to encourage inward investment, because he, the
Government, the Executive and my friend and colleague Arlene Foster,

result of the consultation that closed a few weeks ago, is his
Government taking jobs from Northern Ireland. Hopefully, that will not
be the case. The north coast has a lower-than-average wage structure,
compared with Northern Ireland as a whole, which has a
lower-than-average wage structure than the United Kingdom. We can see
the absolute dependency not only on getting and creating more jobs, but

time to time, we do not see eye to eye—says he, with a bit of
sarcasm in his voice. On this issue, however, there was not only
cross-community support, but total and utter unanimity. Not a single
voice of dissent came from the Chamber. The voice and views of the

Any decision to centralise the services in Swansea would have massive
implications, not only for the employees, which is obvious, but for all
their dependents. Some of those females are part-time employees. The
prospect of trying to get other employment in a Northern Ireland that
is trying to attract inward investment, as I have just alluded to, is

opportunities for the predominantly female staff.</hs_Para>

the services. An analysis has been done of the services offered by the

Northern Ireland and those for the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency
in Swansea. I do so with a word of caution, because I fully understand
that the sheer scale and complexity of the DVLA in Swansea provides a
much more challenging environment in which to achieve targets. That is

Swansea, completing changes of registration almost exclusively in 11
working days—95% of the time—is a reasonably good
performance, but in Northern Ireland we achieve that same in less than
half the time. People in Northern Ireland will be saying, “If

want to raise an issue about which there can be no dispute: Northern
Ireland is the only region in the UK with a land border with another EU
state—the Irish Republic. Traditionally, over many years,
evasion rates have been significantly higher in Northern Ireland, but
the rate has reduced considerably due to a comprehensive campaign
there. Part of the reason is the local work force with local knowledge
of vehicles and residences. Evasion rates that had continued to be high
in the past have recently been reduced.</hs_Para>

chances of evasion in Fermanagh, south Armagh and Tyrone, which have
borders with the Irish Republic, being detected by people operating
from Swansea? The task will be much more difficult. I contend, with
some justification given the previous figures, that evasion rates will
rise, rather than fall. We do not want to encourage evasion or allow it
to increase, rather than continue the drive to get it down.</hs_Para>

important reference point has emerged in the past four days. From media
reports over the weekend, I understand that the DVLA’s
independent complaints assessor has a draft report on the past two
years, 2011-12 and 2012-13, with the various Departments for accuracy
checking. When it is released in two weeks—I was assured
yesterday that it will be released by the end of October, and I hope
the Minister can confirm that—it will confirm a significant
increase in the volume of complaints about the service people get at
the DVLA in Swansea. Obviously, it is a draft report and we will wait
to see the final outcome, but if complaints are increasing, part of the
reason will be the sheer volume and complexity of cases being dealt
with at one central agency. If anything can clinch the case for
retaining a localised service, it will be in the context of the series

due to a change in how complaints are handled. Previously, the chief

wider community that relies on the services provided, or is it about
developments in IT systems, through which local people will also lose

the Northern Ireland economy, which, given the size of Northern
Ireland, is a remarkable statistic. The removal of £22.2 million
from the Northern Ireland economy will have an impact on all its
sectors, notably wholesale and retail trade, accommodation spaces, food
services, entertainment and recreation, plus financial services,
property, housing and the supply industries—and all that at a

stated would be significant savings. Surely, a more acceptable form of
improvement would be to upgrade the DVA’s IT systems. We must
ask why the IT systems in Northern Ireland have been neglected, and not
upgraded as a matter of necessity over the years. We ask that question
because that has been replicated in other service areas. Some people
say that, over recent years, some areas might have been prepared for
privatisation and others for closure. For me, it is simply a case of
downgrading a service and undermining the economic stability that

or people in the haulage industry— with an excellent level of
service. That under-resourcing has left the staff open to the business

to Northern Ireland, because, of course, 1,200 jobs across the United
Kingdom will be lost in 39 regional offices. However, the difference is
that one quarter of those jobs are located in Northern Ireland, and one

want to consider three areas this morning. First, will the new system
be better than what we have at present? The Minister will argue that it
will make available to people in Northern Ireland services that are
currently not available. However, surveys show that not many people are
looking for those services. Indeed, many have said that they do not
wish to use such services. Some 60% of customers and 90% of dealers say
that the services that are being withdrawn are the ones that they wish
to use. The proposal, therefore, is not a response to what the public,
who are paying for vehicle licensing, say that they want.</hs_Para>

people who will be affected include small dealers. Some 20,000 new
registrations every year come through small dealers, who mostly use
local DVA offices because they do not necessarily have the computer
back-up  for online services. Then there are the complex cases.
Indeed, the Department’s own estimate is that 2,000 or
3,000 complex cases will have to be dealt with by post, so
people will have to deal with Swansea, rather than having face-to-face
encounters at local DVA offices. That will inevitably lead to
difficulties. The fact that a case is complex suggests that a person
needs to talk to someone.</hs_Para>

Department’s own estimate, some 3,000 people will find that they
are less well off. The Minister has cited the matter of refunds and
given us some figures, but if wants to ask some questions of his
officials, perhaps he should ask not just about refunds but about first
registrations, changes to registrations and the average wait at
offices. On all those matters, Swansea’s performance is poorer
than that of the DVA offices in Northern Ireland. Service will be
reduced to a wide range of customers and on a wide range of
issues.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=183?>prepared for an MOT. Even though I could prove that, officials said that
it was on the road without tax, so I got fined and received a lot of
publicity. Because of such rigorous enforcement, we have the lowest

the additional work load that will result from the Northern Ireland

new jobs that will be created in Swansea will not be sufficient to deal

lost. The Department wishes to give additional services to people in
Northern Ireland, even though the majority of them do not want those

Minister to give serious consideration to one suggestion that has been
made. Yes, there will be a transition; there is resistance to the
changes. There is quite clear evidence that people still want to use
the DVA services. If the new system were put in place, those who wish
to use the new services and the new methods of delivering them could do
so, and those who did not wish to use them—that residual group
of people—could still use the full DVA services. That would
probably mean that 100 jobs would be lost immediately, but the rest of
the jobs would be retained. Three offices would remain, but the rest
would have to close. That is the estimate that has been made in
Northern Ireland.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:21:28"></hs_TimeCode>Over time, that
situation might change as people get used to the new services, but at
least this option would avoid the big bang of sudden job
losses—all the jobs going—and there would be no gap for
people who need, or want, to use the face-to-face services.</hs_Para>

option would<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:21:46"></hs_TimeCode>
also produce considerable savings. The savings on the running costs
would be £4.5 million—a 36% reduction in
running costs in Northern Ireland and twice the savings that the Driver
and Vehicle Licensing Agency anticipate will result from the change to
the integrated system. So the Minister could make the case for choosing
that option on the basis that savings would still be
available.</hs_Para>

that option would also mean that DVA staff in Northern Ireland would be
trained on the new system. Bearing in mind what has already been said
about the pressures that exist on the Swansea system at present,
choosing that option would provide a contingency for DVLA to fall back
on—a contingency of trained staff in Northern Ireland, in a
place where, as has already been pointed out, productivity is far
greater than elsewhere. So choosing that option has a number of
benefits. It is one way to retain a significant number of jobs in
Northern Ireland and avoid the proposal’s high economic impact
on one part of the United Kingdom. The impact would be
disproportionate, but I will not go through all the figures that other
Members have already mentioned.</hs_Para>

are, of course, other options, including transferring blocks of
services, but I do not think that the Minister can simply say,
“Look, we have decided that all these services will be
withdrawn, and there will be this huge gap left in the job market in
Northern Ireland.” To me, saying that would not be good for
customers, the Exchequer or the Northern Ireland economy, and it would
not make sensible use of the skills that already exist in Northern
Ireland and that will be abandoned if this change is
made.</hs_Para>

about protecting the existing level and quality of services and,

system as it currently operates, but he actually presented himself here
in Westminster Hall today as a satisfied victim.
<I>[</I><I>Laughter.</I><I>]</I> That just shows the degree to which
there is customer satisfaction. The fact that he can advertise his own
victimhood as a justification for keeping the status quo, and building
and improving on it, says an awful lot for the DVA and its staff in
Northern Ireland. It also possibly says something for the hon. Member,
too, who I never thought would appear as a satisfied victim. There

important to recognise that it is not only the defence of the jobs and

course, there was the whole offensive implication that came in the
context of discussing this issue—namely, that removing the jobs
from Northern Ireland would be a way to remove any threat or fear of
religious or sectarian bias. That was rightly seen as a direct slur,
not only on the DVA’s work force, but on the entire public
sector work force in Northern Ireland. This idea was, “Well,
we’ll protect you from anything that might involve a suggestion
of religious bias by removing jobs.” If that is the case, why
stop at DVA jobs? Remove more and more public sector jobs if doing so
is meant to be a way to try to create a shared future; it will be a
shared future of poverty and unemployment, but at least there will be
no

when we look at what has been happening with the Driver and Vehicle
Licensing Agency in Britain, we are also concerned. We have seen that
the presumption that providing online services will mean that everyone
moves online is not borne out by the experience of the past 10 years.
The chair of the Scottish Motor Trade Association described the
situation in Scotland as “a shambles”, because of the
closure of local offices and the move to centralisation. When we have

only the representatives of the people of Northern Ireland, but the
Department for Transport and the Minister should be listening to that

allowing the DVA to be retained in Northern Ireland—in

want to make the point that we have had experience in Northern Ireland

“Let’s centralise tax credit.” The tax credit
office was removed from Northern Ireland, although many cases in
Northern Ireland are particularly complicated and people unable to deal
with or understand the needs and circumstances of people there, not

other hon. Members have said, significant cross-border issues relate to
vehicle

including local traders’ dealings with the DVA, particularly in
respect of used cars with a cross-border history. From time to time,
there are changes in patterns of vehicle importation across the border
from the south and the trade goes the other way, with people in the
south buying their cars in the
north<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:30:37"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
important that licensing and registration in both Shannon and the DVA
in the north can work together, to track, connect and make sense of
those things<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:30:48"></hs_TimeCode>,
and work with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Garda

matters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:30:53"></hs_TimeCode>. All
that would be lost and we would end up with a repeat of the serious,

hon. Member for East Londonderry said that people always start
Westminster Hall debates by saying that the issue is topical and
important, and this one is that. The issue has rightly attracted huge
concern from across the political spectrum in Northern Ireland. I will
raise three major issues on how the process is being undertaken and its
potential impact on Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:40:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000053">My
first point is about how the reform is being done. I am sure we would
all support in principle the modernisation of vehicle registration
licensing. As has already been said, there has been significant neglect
and under-investment in vehicle licensing services by the DVLA in
Northern Ireland, and all drivers deserve the same high level of
service. It may make sense to try to centralise databases between GB
and Northern Ireland, to streamline the system and so on, but just
because systems and databases can be streamlined does not necessarily
mean that how the service is delivered to the public has to be
centralised, too. That point has been made by a number of hon. Members
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000054">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:42:03"></hs_TimeCode>
experience of DVLA centralisation in other parts of the UK is not
encouraging. The Minister said that the initial rise in complaints has
not been maintained, but that does not answer the full point.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:42:14"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:42:14"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Ealing North said that, since the start of
the closure programme, the DVLA has spent in excess of £1.63
million on overtime payments, and
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:42:23"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for South Down (Ms Ritchie) corrected him by saying that the
figure is worse than that—£1.65 million.</hs_Para>

amount has been spent so far on overtime payments for the
centralisation process, something is going wrong. That is no criticism
of the staff at Swansea, who do a professional job, as their colleagues
do in other parts of the UK, but there is a real question about whether
Swansea is equipped to cope with the increased demand of the
centralisation programme. We would all question whether centralisation
from Northern Ireland should be added to the demand already being
created in Swansea without significant
investment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:43:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000056">I
have some practical examples. In Scotland, all applications to transfer
a personal registration plate from one car to another moved to Swansea,
which led to processed applications falling well behind the seven-day
target. The Scottish Motor Trade Association, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:43:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Foyle (Mark Durkan) said, reported delays of up to six
weeks and described the situation as “a shambles.” That
has caused frustration, and it is poor service.</hs_Para>

good enough for the Minister simply to say, “Well, we are
getting on top of this,” because we need to learn from what has
happened. We need to know how the Government have got on top of the
situation and whether the centralisation in Northern Ireland will make
matters worse; it seems to me that it is likely to. We should not
repeat the
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:44:09"></hs_TimeCode>.

second point is on the centralisation’s social and economic
impact. Hon. Members from across the political spectrum have rightly
talked about that. Some 324 jobs are going in Northern Ireland, with
250 of those jobs in Coleraine. I know from personal experience in my
own constituency that the closure of a major employment site not only
causes direct job losses, serious enough though that is, but has an
enormous impact on the local economy, too. Many hon. Members have made
that point today. The actual job losses due to the overall effect of
the centralisation programme in Northern Ireland is estimated to be
closer to
500<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:44:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000059">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:45:03"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friends the Members for South Down and for Foyle, and other hon.
Members, have talked about the centralisation not only being an issue
for Coleraine, although that is the biggest single concentration; there
are impacts in Downpatrick, Derry and elsewhere. Bluntly, we are
talking about the equivalent of many thousands of jobs going in GB if
the same scale of job losses were to happen over
here.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000060">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:45:38"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have been rather coy about the likely impact of those job
losses on the economy, but not everyone else has been. Oxford Economics
has undertaken research estimating that £22 million of gross
value added a year will be removed from the Northern Ireland economy,
which will add to the rising unemployment bill. There will be an
estimated increase of some £2.5 million in the annual
jobseeker’s allowance bill because of the job losses alone, and
there will be a further £3.6 million lost in tax revenue. If all
that is added up, along with various other things, we are talking about
substantial losses and a substantial hit to the Northern Ireland
economy, as hon. Members have already
said<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:46:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000061">With
such questions on what is taking place, people might think that the
Government would at least have got their consultation procedure right,
that they would have started the consultation in a timely fashion, that
they would have done it sensitively and that they would have listened
to advice from people on the ground who know what the real situation
is. That just has not happened, has it? The Government failed to listen
to local people’s
concerns.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000062">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:49:22"></hs_TimeCode>
pay tribute to the work of those, including the former Northern Ireland
Environment Minister, Alex Attwood, who got the Government to consult
in the first place. However, as many hon. Members have mentioned, the
consultation document contains accusations that are, frankly,
offensive—not to one section but to every section of the
community in Northern Ireland. That requires a bit more than a public
apology. I welcome the public apology from the Minister concerned, but
the Government need to think about how they came to issue a
consultation document containing that kind of thing in the first

issues raised today on the services that will be at
risk, on the scale of job losses involved, on the impact on the
benefits bill and on the hit to the UK taxpayer, and until he can
quantify exactly what benefits will accrue from the change,
perhaps—even though the consultation is formally coming to an
end—he should pause, think again and come back with a considered
response. The way things look at the moment, although the issue has

that backdrop, I must explain that, as the hon. Gentleman will know,
vehicle registration and licensing throughout the UK is an excepted
matter and the responsibility of the UK Government. In GB, these
services are delivered by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, in
Swansea. In Northern Ireland, the DVLA has an agreement with the Driver
and Vehicle Agency, which is part of the Northern Ireland Department of
the Environment, to deliver vehicle registration and licensing services
to motorists there. The DVA has traditionally delivered those services
through its centre in Coleraine and eight other offices in Northern
Ireland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T10:50:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000069" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000069">While
I understand the hon. Gentleman’s concerns, the crux of the
issue is that the vehicle registration and licensing services available
to motorists in Northern Ireland have fallen behind those available in
the rest of the UK. For example, motorists in Northern Ireland are
unable to tax their cars online and have only limited services
available at post offices. As the owner of more than a dozen vehicles,
I must say I find the online tax system very simple. I can tax a
tractor in 20 seconds; where I have to pay to tax a vehicle, it takes
about two minutes. Otherwise, I would have to travel four miles to my
nearest post office, which I cannot, of course, do on a Sunday
night.</hs_Para>

<?notus-xml column=192?>as those in GB and can enjoy the same services. If the proposals
outlined in the consultation were adopted—I must stress that I
have not yet decided on the way forward—motorists in Northern
Ireland would be able to tax their cars online and via an automated
telephone service that would be available 24 hours a day all year
round. Many more services would also be available at about 150 post
offices throughout Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

to businesses in Northern Ireland would also be improved. Companies
would have access to the same level of service as those in the rest of
the UK, allowing them to streamline their processes so that they did
not have to manage the registration and licensing of vehicles

changes proposed in the consultation would also ensure that motorists

acknowledge that introducing new services online and through post
offices and centralising the delivery of the remaining services
delivered by the DVA in Northern Ireland at the DVLA in Swansea would
have an impact. Currently, the full-time equivalent of 324 staff work
on vehicle registration and licensing services at the DVA in Coleraine.
Introducing more online services and making more services available at
post offices would mean that those staff were no longer needed for that
work. The DVLA forecasts that 75% of the transactions currently
undertaken by Northern Ireland motorists would be carried out online or
at local post offices.</hs_Para>

is no intention to remove those jobs from Coleraine to create the same
number of new jobs in Swansea. The DVLA estimates that, if the new
online and post office services are introduced in Northern Ireland,
there would remain about 500,000 transactions where customers needed to
deal directly with the DVLA. That sounds significant, but the DVLA in
Swansea currently deals with 97 million vehicle transactions a year.

Unemployment in Northern Ireland is lower than the UK average, and it
has fallen by 1.2% in the past year. The analysis provided by Oxford
Economics does not reflect the full impact the changes to the
DVA’s operations will have, because it takes no account of the
benefits from the expansion of digital services and the widening of
services offered at post offices. Those changes will increase choice
and ease of access for customers and reduce the cost of vehicle
licensing and registration to businesses, ultimately increasing

much greater dependency on the public sector, has one thirtieth of the

the Northern Ireland Assembly. That compares well with the rest of the

some people will be unwilling or unable to use digital services at this

asked for the debate with considerable sadness. I have been involved
with health care delivery in north-west London for decades, on the
community health council, when it existed, and as a member of the

fixable just by improvements in the exchange of e-mails. It goes to the
heart of trust and clarity in the way health care is provided. I am not
alone in my concerns—I know other elected officials feel the
same; but this is not just about politicians having our noses put out

some fundamental questions that have arisen, to do with how care is and

the challenges are so great in north-west London, as they are, indeed,
in many parts of the health service, it is even more incumbent on those
who deliver and manage health care to ensure that communications are
clear, that there is a shared strategic approach to planning, and that
there are common assumptions. As the Minister knows, the backdrop to
the issue is important changes in the provision of hospital care and
the “Shaping a healthier future” strategy for north-west
London. That, of course, proposes the closure of several accident and

Buck:</Member></B> I agree with my hon. Friend. Of course, the proposed
closures and the “Shaping a healthier future” strategy
are themselves set against a financial context that puts extreme
pressure on delivery. North-west London hospital services must
accommodate a £125 million reduction in service between 2011 and
2015. At the same time—and this is pertinent to the core of my
comments—local authorities have imposed dramatic cuts in their
social care budgets. That is particularly germane to the issue, because
the work of local authority care services relates to prevention and
hospital discharge arrangements, and needs to be integrated with those
areas, so that the highly pressured hospital service can work
effectively.</hs_Para>

another factor is the impact of the top-down NHS reorganisation that we
were told would never happen, and the £3 billion that it cost,
which has taken valuable resources and a great deal of energy away from
the planned delivery of services. The slow death of the primary care
trusts and the slow emergence of clinical commissioning groups during a

communities. St Mary’s hospital was not scheduled to
lose its A and E unit, and we were pleased about
that. I and others were briefed about ambitious plans for the
development of a new, improved emergency care service, to be built
at  St Mary’s hospital. During the
discussions and briefings there was no suggestion that there would be
any specific consequential changes in the pattern of hospital services
at St Mary’s. Therefore, when, at the invitation of
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T11:06:03"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Hammersmith, I attended the independent review panel
called to consider the  A and E closures
in other parts of west London, I was somewhat taken aback to be asked
by the chairman how I felt about the closure of up to 200 beds at
St Mary’s, and the movement away of most or all
elective surgery, as part of the consequential changes resulting from
“Shaping a healthier future”.</hs_Para>

because I am automatically totally opposed to consequential changes in
service delivery. We must be grown up about such things, and it is
right that hospitals evolve and change. Things should not be, and never
have been, set in stone. Good clinical reasons and financial necessity
may drive change. However—and this is my theme today—to
make that change work there must be clarity and partnership, and

congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T11:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck) on securing the debate. I
am a London MP and I know that this matter is important to her and her

I turn to the issues raised, I put on record my thanks to the staff of
the NHS for their commitment and dedication in providing a first-class
service, particularly as they enter a period of change. We know that
that is sometimes not easy, but they are maintaining a first-class
commitment to patients
throughout.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000129">The
debate around aspects of the north-west London reconfiguration has been
going on for some time, but it is fair to say that the hon. Member for
Westminster North discussed a slightly new feature of it. Today is the
first time I have heard in detail directly from her about these
important issues. I will give her a response, but I will look at the
detail of what she said, reflect on it and come back to her more fully
after the debate. It is not possible to do that instantly, because
until now I had not heard directly from her about some of the problems
on communication and so on in the past year that she said illustrate
some wider
issues.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000130">My
understanding is that the joint committee of primary care trusts agreed
in February this year that further work was needed to bring about
improvements 
<?notus-xml column=201?>to services at both Charing Cross and Central Middlesex hospitals. I am
aware that Imperial College Healthcare is developing its clinical and
site strategy based on the principles set out in “Shaping a
healthier future”. The trust has put forward a case for some
elective surgery to be carried out at the Charing Cross site and has
developed a vision for each of its three main sites becoming centres of
excellence for the service they provide.</hs_Para>

that hon. Members and local authorities should expect openness and
transparency when discussing local health issues and changes, and the
hon. Lady has vividly put across that she does not feel that that has
happened. It is regrettable that she feels she has encountered, in her
dealings with Imperial, a lack of clarity around its clinical and site
strategy and, in particular, around planned care and elective
surgery.</hs_Para>

rightly stressed the need for partnership working through periods of
difficult change such as these. Her comments on the overall exercise
and the expressed clinical priorities were balanced, and I take
seriously what she said about wishing to work in partnership and her
point that we can clearly do a lot better. I have been assured by NHS
England that a real effort will be made by the new leadership team at
the trust and the local clinical commissioning group to engage more
fully with her, other local MPs, local councillors and the local NHS as
the site strategy is developed.</hs_Para>

that the hon. Lady met the chief officer and the GP chair of the
central London CCG to discuss her concerns about the changes to planned
care and surgery in north-west London. As a result, she will know that
under “Shaping a healthier future”, St
Mary’s will continue to provide out-patient services,
diagnostics, therapies and appropriate follow-up. I understand that
work is under way to agree the best locations across north-west London
for planned care surgery services.</hs_Para>

Slaughter:</Member></B> I hear what the Minister is saying—it is
reasonable and I know that she is sincere—but we constantly meet
these people and they are, frankly, hopeless. The issue is now becoming
political. So far, we have had political unity across the board and we
now know that the issue is on the Secretary of State’s desk. I
implore the Minister to talk to him about these proposals—in the
interests of her party, if none other.</hs_Para>

from Hammersmith and Fulham council, which is supporting the closures,
everyone across west London is united on this: it does not matter what
party they are or what position they hold. This issue is moving from
the local to the national. Will the Minister please look—it is
in her interest as well as ours—at what is going wrong in
north-west London before we take steps in closing hospitals that we
will not be able to

Ellison:</Member></B> I am not sure that describing NHS colleagues as
“hopeless” is a particularly helpful contribution to
future partnership working, but the hon. Gentleman has chosen his words
in his own style, as he always does. He is right to say that the matter
is on the Secretary of State’s desk. I will report back to the
Secretary of State after this debate, specifically on the new concerns
expressed by the hon. Member for Westminster North on the dialogue and
the relationship she has had. Beyond that, I cannot comment further on
the reconfiguration, because of its status.</hs_Para>

Buck:</Member></B> The Minister is kindly referring to my sense of the
communication problems. To reinforce the point, I should say that at
the heart of this problem is a local authority that is meant to be a
statutory partner. It has a duty to be consulted and that has clearly
not happened. That is what matters, because it is through that
consultation that decisions are made on how a local authority performs
its role on supporting care. I want that message to go back to the
Secretary of State. It is not a matter of opinion; it is a matter of
absolute fact that the local authority has been ignored by Imperial for
probably two
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000138"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jane Ellison" PimsId="5710" UID="13101579000204" xid="1010" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000204">Jane
Ellison:</Member></B> I hear that. I believe in the role that local
authorities have to play in shaping health outcomes for their
residents; as the public health Minister, one of my jobs is to champion
their role. Like Members of Parliament, they care so deeply for the
health of their local population and are so close to them that they are
well placed to shape the future of health care in their area, and we
take that seriously. I will take the hon. Lady’s concern back,
reflect on it and talk to the Secretary of State about it.</hs_Para>

limit on what more I can say on the detail that the hon. Lady has given
me. We have a lot to look at and talk to health partners about. I can
only assure her that I take it seriously. The role of hon. Members in
periods of enormous change such as this is critical, as it is for key
local authority partners, too. That message is fully taken on
board.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000140">I
will use my remaining time to give a little background on the
reconfiguration. I know hon. Members will be familiar with it, but it
is worth putting on the record. The reconfiguration of NHS services is
a matter on which the local NHS is taking the lead, hence the
importance of engaging local partners. The hon. Lady has already made
reference to the fact that we do not believe that these things can be
shaped only in Whitehall. They have to be influenced by enormous local
input. I cannot agree with the description of the service as
“hollowed out”, which is neither accurate nor
fair.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000141">Individual
health overview and scrutiny committees, and the joint overview and
scrutiny committees, made up of democratically elected members of all
the councils concerned, have the power to refer the reconfiguration to
the Secretary of State if they believe that the consultation has not
been conducted appropriately, or that proposed changes are deemed to be
not in the best interests of the local health service. We know that one
council has exercised that power.</hs_Para>

Lady is aware, the proposals were referred to the Secretary of State by
Ealing borough council in March this year; the hon. Member for Ealing
North referred to that. The Secretary of State has sought and received
advice on that referral from the Independent Reconfiguration Panel. I
fully understand the importance of the Secretary of State’s
decision to the hon. Members present and to others who have been
prominent in this debate. The Secretary of State is actively
considering the panel’s report and that decision will be made
public shortly. Although I have not been pressed on when that might be,
it is imminent. I cannot say anything further about the IRP’s
report.</hs_Para>

I want to stress is that all the changes are being driven by clinical
need and a desire to get better outcomes for patients. They are not
driven by a 
<?notus-xml column=203?>desire to save money. In that regard, I reject the comments made by the
hon. Member for Hammersmith. The hon. Lady acknowledged that the
driving force behind the reconfigurations is looking at whether we can
get better outcomes for all our constituents through greater
specialism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000144"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ms Buck" PimsId="2358" UID="13101579000205" xid="77" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000205">Ms

decisions made by Ealing council and Hammersmith and Fulham council,
but Westminster council was not even told about some of these changes,
so it could not exercise its powers on overview and scrutiny in this
case. While that is absolutely true, I do not think that anyone is

doing it without telling
anybody.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101579000147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000147"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jane Ellison" PimsId="5710" UID="13101579000208" xid="1010" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0001.htm#13101579000208">Jane

misplaced. I think the range is greater than people imagine, but that
underlying anxiety makes it difficult to sell purely electric cars, as
opposed to hybrid cars; it is a lot harder ask of the consumer. In any
case, when it comes to value for the consumer, electric cars are head
to head with the new generation of the ever more efficient and quieter
diesels. Looking at what is happening with car market sales, one can
see the result. However, even with lower emissions, more diesels

there is a problem. The solution is for us to produce and use more LPG
vehicles, but we are going backwards here. If anyone looks at the
second-hand LPG market, as I have, they will find second-hand Vectras

old—vintage—simply because cars of that sort are not
being produced for the UK market anymore. However, Opel, which is
virtually the same company, is producing the Opel Adam, a new LPG car,
as a brand leader. We therefore have the phenomenon where, in

the situation is poor with cars, it is probably worse with freight,
where the whole-life cost of lorries—lorries are surprisingly
expensive—have to be factored in by hauliers. In terms of cost
per mile, it would benefit an enormous number of hauliers to convert,
as long as they can predict the cost over a period, but to do so, they
must have some sort of guarantee that the financial environment that
they are in will remain somewhat similar.</hs_Para>

how a change in the financial environment has made a difference. At one
time in the north-west, quite a few LPG buses were running
around—they were very clean indeed—but changes in the bus

destroyed the network, and firms such as Arriva rapidly withdrew from
providing them. Initially, I thought it was an issue of reliability and
so on, but that turned out not to be the case.</hs_Para>

off-the-shelf solution, which we can implement now, but we are not
making any headway, while the rest of Europe is. Why is that the case?
Given that we have a solution—it is not the sole solution, and
it may not be the long-term solution, but we can do something
appreciable to reduce emissions—why has it not been implemented?

are two main reasons why I wanted to attend the debate. The hon.
Gentleman gave us an incredibly wide-ranging and well informed opening
speech. He touched on air quality, and findings published today show
that poor air quality can contribute to low birth weight. There is,
therefore, still much to
discover<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:17:14"></hs_TimeCode>.

first main reason for wanting to speak is that I tabled a parliamentary
question to the Department for Transport, which was due for answer
yesterday. I thought I might be able to elicit an answer by turning up
in person today. What representations have the Government made among
other members of the EU in relation to the UK’s support for the
5% cap? I do not do this often, but I want to praise the Government for
their support for that cap.</hs_Para>

also want to speak as a member of the International Development
Committee, which recently published a report on food insecurity. We
found that biofuels were a major contributor to food insecurity across
the globe and especially in developing countries. In his opening
remarks, the hon. Gentleman said their net effect would be to further
impoverish the world, but we spoke in far stronger terms in our report,
and we are not alone in doing so.</hs_Para>

not just about the usual NGOs, which campaigned on biofuels during the
recent IF campaign—I am sure the hon. Gentleman often wore the
wristband and took part in photo opportunities, and he possibly
responded to constituents in support of that campaign. A key part of it
was to call on countries to act on biofuels and, in particular, to
seize the opportunity to act in the EU.</hs_Para>

the Committee took evidence, however, it was disappointing that

Under-Secretary of State for International Development said that
biofuels were not an issue the Government were engaging in at the

because the current situation is a shame.

biofuels that do not use food-based
products<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:20:01"></hs_TimeCode>. It is

here with not just two reasons for speaking, but millions. There are
millions of people in developing countries whose lives are put at risk

that between 25 million and 135 million more people might suffer

should welcome reassurance from the Minister about what the Government
are doing at EU level to campaign on the issue. We need to think about
the price rises I mentioned. There are competing claims, but we found
in our evidence that prices for oil seed could rise by 20%, those for
vegetable oil by 36% and those for maize by 22%. As
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:21:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

prices could rise by 13% by 2020. We know what food insecurity means in

is an important distinction between greener transport fuels and making
transport greener, and I think that my hon. Friend made several points
about the latter issue. There is no doubt that vehicle manufacturers
and many others, such as fuel manufacturers, have contributed to an
enormous reduction in the amount of fuel used for road transport. The
car that I drive gets more than 60 miles to the gallon, which would
have been unthinkable when I was tinkering with cars in my early 20s.
We have heard about the possibility of switching fuels, but although
liquefied petroleum gas may reduce fuel use, it is, as its name
suggests, a fossil fuel.</hs_Para>

want to talk about fuels that I think of as greener than fossil fuels.
There are three basic sources: liquids, gases and electricity. The
important thing is to think about where they come from, and many
contributions today have been about that. As my hon. Friend said, there
are many sources of electricity, and some could well be more polluting
than putting petrol in the car. For example, electricity may be
generated in a coal-fired power station, then go down a line with the
associated line losses, and into a car that is plugged in, but that is
an incredibly inefficient way to fuel a vehicle.</hs_Para>

possible. The journey was 2,000 miles in six days, so that was pretty

want to talk now about crop-based biofuels. I must declare an interest,
because Europe’s largest bioethanol plant is in my constituency.
I challenge the idea that we can have either food or fuel. We are still
paying farmers in this country not to grow things—including 6
million tonnes of sugar beet, which is potentially a fuel for a
bioethanol plant. The idea that the issue is all about land does not
always stand up to examination. There are many political, economic and
agricultural reasons why there are food shortages in the world, and,
when overall world land use is considered, land is quite far down the

and at the other end we get three products: bioethanol; carbon dioxide,
which is captured for use in the food and drink industry in a separate
plant; and crucially, high-grade animal feed. All the protein in the
wheat ends up in high-grade animal feed, which is highly prized in the

on where the electricity comes from, and sometime soon we might have
more carbon-free nuclear at a scale that will enable electric cars to

impact of agriculturally produced biofuels and the impact that they
have on food prices and food security. That is why I am pleased that,
as far as the European Union is concerned, there has been a recent vote
to cut the number of food crops used to produce biofuels.
However—perhaps the Minister can confirm whether I am
right—we are now not talking about a 5% limit, but a 6% limit.

congratulate the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:59:22"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Southport (John Pugh) on securing this debate. He
touches on a key issue for my new Department, which is how we can build
a low-carbon transport system for the 21st century. Let me briefly
mention my own interest in this, which was alluded to by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T15:59:43"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Redcar (Ian Swales). As a farmer, I produce wheat. Indeed two loads
of it went to the Hull plant last year to produce bioethanol. I must
admit to feeling guilty when I saw perfectly good wheat, which could be
used for animal feed or biscuits, going to produce ethanol, so I was
reassured to hear from the hon. Gentleman that the residue is not
wasted but used as a ruminant
feed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:00:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000004">Although
I am new to this role, I am not new to the issue or the
subjects raised in today’s debate. Way back in 2008, I was
fortunate to be called by Mr Speaker
to ask a question of the then Prime Minister,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:00:20"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Member for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath (Mr Brown),
who I understand is still a Member of this House, about the impact of
biofuels on food production. My interest in the issue remains to this
day. The question I asked went something like this: is it better to put
ethanol in a Range Rover’s tank or food in an African
child’s stomach? I must say I did get quite a good answer from
the then Prime Minister. Before that, I was a Member of the European
Parliament and served on the environment committee as a deputy
co-ordinator for the European People’s Party group and was
involved in much of the European legislation that we are using now to
clean up our vehicle fleet and the atmosphere.</hs_Para>

means of addressing the range anxiety problem is to have fast-charge

its risks. If it is not managed properly, bioenergy can actually
increase greenhouse gas emissions and put at risk key objectives such

have already taken important steps on the path to genuinely sustainable
biofuels. In 2008, the Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation was
established. For the first time, biofuel was required to be blended
into road transport fuel. In 2011, the UK introduced mandatory
sustainability criteria to the RTFO. Those changes meant that biofuels
could no longer be sourced from areas of high biodiversity, such as
rainforests or wetlands. In 2011, we also saw the introduction of
double rewards for advanced biofuels, also referred to in this debate
as second generation biofuels, and biofuels made from 
<?notus-xml column=222?>waste. Such changes have led to encouraging trends in the fuels supplied
under the RTFO. The average carbon savings of biofuel supplied under
the RTFO when compared with fossil fuel have increased from 46% in 2008

are alternatives to fossil fuels, but does he accept that not all
fossil fuels have the same amount of carbon? If we were to replace
petrol with gas or liquefied natural gas cars, as opposed to liquefied
petroleum gas cars—there are 15 million LNG cars in the world
and 3 million in Pakistan—we would halve the amount of carbon
being produced from the transport sector. That technology exists
already. I repeat the point that I made to the shadow Minister that

constituency, which occasionally has the same effect. Used cooking oil
offers carbon savings of around 80% compared with those
produced by fossil fuel, and the latest data suggest that last year
around a third of biofuels supplied in the UK came from used cooking
oil. We are very much on the case of ensuring that used cooking oil is

we have heard in the debate, there are also concerns about the impact
of biofuels on food prices. Food versus fuel is an issue that I take
very seriously. The primary goal of agriculture should remain food
production, and the production of biomass must not undermine food
security or increase food prices. It is accepted that increased demand
for biofuel has played a role, but Government analysis has shown that
although increased global crop prices have resulted from biofuel
production there has only been a modest rise in food prices.</hs_Para>

the main barrier to setting out the clear pathway to achieving our 2020

sustainable biofuels. That is likely to be achieved through the use of
non-land-using feedstocks, such as agricultural residues and municipal
waste. However, use of these feedstocks requires advanced conversion
processes that have not yet been commercialised. These processes are an
exciting technology, which can turn unwanted waste products into
valuable transport fuel.
A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:11:48"></hs_TimeCode> number of

gas has lower carbon emissions than diesel; it produces about 15% lower

energy security, and it can improve local air quality. In addition,
natural gas benefits from a lower duty rate than diesel. I should point

also ensured that people who organise animal fights, train animals for
fights or publicise or record a fight, face the full force of the law.

for Torbay (Mr Sanders)—he is a fellow west country MP—on
securing the debate and raising an issue that attracts a great deal of

personally interested in this area before I joined the Government. I
served on the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee, and
earlier this summer, as part of my research, I read an interesting
report called “Unleashed”, which was written by an
academic called Simon Harding. It looked at the phenomena of status and
weapon dogs and tried to understand why we are seeing an increase in
some types of dog
fights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000074" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000074">There
are three key types of dog fight. First, there are those awful dog
fights where bets are placed. They often take place in private venues,
and that is the type of thing that my hon. Friend mentioned. Secondly,
there is what they call “back of van” fights or trunking,
which are awful. The idea came from the US, where they lock dogs in the
boot of a car to fight it out. The third type, which some of the
evidence suggests has had the greatest increase, is chain rolling,
where dogs are used as an alternative to a knife and there are
impromptu fights in parks. There has been a significant increase in
reports to the RSPCA of illegal fights of that
sort.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000075" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000075">A
further problem has been the growth of the internet, which has made
some of these crimes easier to commit. That point has been highlighted
by a great many of the animal welfare charities. We have the awful
problem of the different terms and code words used in internet
advertising for dogs designed to be sold for fighting, such as
red-nosed, game-proven, game-bred and blocky. I welcome what the Pet
Advertising Advisory Group has done to try to tighten that up by
creating a new code of conduct for those companies that advertise
pets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000076">The
Government deplore acts of animal cruelty and believe that offenders
deserve the full force of the courts. Our responsibility is to ensure
that the legislation is fit for purpose. My hon. Friend asked whether
we would review the legislation. We reviewed the main legislation that
protects the welfare of kept animals—the Animal Welfare Act
2006—in 2010.</hs_Para>

prepared by my Department and sent to the Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs Committee for its consideration concluded that there was broad
agreement that the 2006 Act has genuinely had a positive impact on
animal welfare. It successfully brought together 
<?notus-xml column=230?>a number of different pieces of legislation into a comprehensive whole
and placed a duty of care on those who are responsible for animals. The
2006 Act also introduced a preventive measure that has allowed action
to be taken without animals suffering unnecessarily. Although the
consultation highlighted some concerns that more could be done to speed
up court cases involving seized animals, it did not cast doubt on the
adequacy of maximum sentences.</hs_Para>

legislation must set maximum penalties. It is then for the
courts—usually the magistrates court for animal welfare
cases—to take a view on what sentence should be given. Judges
and magistrates have a great deal of discretion in sentencing. In
coming to a view, they are helped by specific sentencing guidelines
produced by the Sentencing Council, which has been responsible since
2010 for providing detailed guidance to courts on the appropriate
sentence for individual cases.</hs_Para>

guidelines help to achieve consistency in deciding the type and length
of sentence and set out the factors that should be considered in those
decisions. The guidelines set out how a judge or magistrate can decide
on the seriousness of a particular offence, and then determine the
appropriate sentence. Of course, the circumstances of different cases
can vary quite widely and that can explain the different sentences
handed out. The guidance to magistrates covers cases of animal cruelty
for offences committed under the 2006 Act and helps magistrates to
impose an appropriate penalty. Those guidelines were last updated in
2008 and reflect the current penalties
available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000080">The
Government’s responsibility is to ensure that the courts have
the flexibility to impose the appropriate sentence within acceptable
ranges. To that end, the 2006 Act makes it an offence to
cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal. That offence carries a
maximum penalty of six months’ imprisonment or a fine of
£20,000 or, crucially, both. Someone found guilty of organising
or participating in a dog fight, along the lines that my hon. Friend
described, could receive both a fine of £20,000 and a prison
sentence of six months. Six months is the highest sentence available to
a magistrates court and the fine is much greater than the usual

Eustice:</Member></B> There are a number of measures under which we can
do that. Under the 2006 Act, which was introduced by the previous

Eustice:</Member></B> Clearly, it is for the courts and the police to
enforce the bans. Other bits of legislation related to dog welfare and,
in particular, breeding, contain anti-avoidance clauses, so that if
someone has five litters of dogs being bred on a
premises—regardless of who owns or claims to own those
dogs—they are caught by the law and require a licence. There are
elements of legislation that do that, and I am here to set out what the
law states. I commend what the previous Government did in introducing
the 2006 Act. As I said, it requires the courts to state why they would
not impose such a

realise that some people would like to see the maximum limits raised,
but we need to be clear why such a move is deemed desirable by those

considered to be low compared with other similar offences? If we make
that point, however, we should compare them with the maximum penalties
for other crimes, such as assaulting a police officer, which can
attract six months of imprisonment, a fine of £5,000 or both.

provision to increase sentences to 51 weeks. I think that he was
referring to a scheme called “custody plus”, but it is
not quite true that that would relate to a custodial sentence of 51
weeks; in fact, the sentence was always intended to be a combination

is an increase intended to act as a deterrent? The Government, however,
have received no indication from magistrates that the penalties for
animal cruelty cases should be increased because they are having to
impose more and more penalties towards the upper end of the range.
Crucially, for no convictions has a judge handed out the maximum
sentence of six months. We therefore have to ask, why increase the
maximum, if the existing one is not being used by the

give an example of the penalties handed down by magistrates over the
past three years, convictions under the Animal Welfare Act have been
roughly 1,000 a year; typically, about 10% of those have been sentenced

indicate to me that magistrates consider that the maximum penalties for
animal cruelty should be increased. I understand the points made by

few statistics will show the extent of scams just in Wales, and how
they affect all of us who represent Welsh constituencies. Between
February 2012 and February 2013, 2,500 scams were reported, but it is
reckoned that only 5% of scams that occur are reported to the
authorities, so the total number could be as high as 50,000. There were
958 doorstep complaints, with 19 prosecutions, and 1,658 post, e-mail
and telephone scams, with only two
prosecutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T16:54:10"></hs_TimeCode>.
Those figures are revealing, not least because the majority of the
victims of those scams were probably people, such as myself, over the
age of 60. Those who are affected by such crooks and gangsters, who
prey on our old people, are, I fear, vulnerable, physically and
mentally. On average, older people lose £1,200 per person when

Green Deal Solutions has now shut down, I am delighted to say, after
the consumer watchdog programme, “X-Ray” on BBC Wales
found that several customers who were not eligible were charged up to
£249 for arrangement and assessment fees. Another is Cornerstone
Green Solutions, which took £99 from an elderly and vulnerable
lady in my constituency. I understand that another company, Diversity

to arrange a

among other things, it caused me to raise the matter in Parliament. It
is charging older people £299 for what it calls its advice
service, and when it is challenged, my constituents are unable to get
their money back. One of its customers—interestingly, bearing in
mind the earlier debate, he lives in Torquay—recently wrote to a
national newspaper, whose reporter contacted the company 17 times

problem is that admirable schemes have been undermined by the
activities of companies that are jumping on the bandwagon simply to
make a big profit. I have contacted trading standards offices. Torfaen
has an excellent trading standards office, which in recent weeks has
received 62 complaints about such companies, 44 of which trade in
becoming green, almost wholly from people over 60. The companies that I
mentioned operated in Cardiff, where trading standards have received
many complaints. Both authorities, and probably Newport and Caerphilly,
are looking closely into the activities of those companies and others,

guarantees of large sums of money to the recipients are visible on the
envelope. That might require the law to be amended, but it is worth
considering. Age Cymru has heard of older people receiving up to 70
letters a day from companies encouraging them to take part in various
scams. Secondly, will he work with the telephone companies to offer
more protection against phone calls, especially from abroad, and to

Consumer Protection Partnership, which is made up of partners from the

Friend the Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson)—the

<?notus-xml column=238?>consumers to take firm action against scams. Through a renewed focus on
prevention, there is an opportunity to try to protect some of the most
vulnerable members of society from falling victim to unscrupulous
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:19:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:19:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000124"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:13:48"></hs_TimeCode>I
will now mention some ways in which consumers can report scams and
fraud. The Government have established Action Fraud to allow for the
reporting of scams. Scams can be reported to Action Fraud by phone or
by completing an online fraud report. It is a simple and quick process,
and most importantly, it alerts the most appropriate authority to a
potential scam.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:14:10"></hs_TimeCode>If someone
believes that they have been the victim of a scam, or if they need help
about how to advise someone whom they believe is the victim, they can
also contact the Citizens Advice consumer helpline, which provides
clear, practical help for consumers on what they should do.</hs_Para>

Citizens Advice identifies a breach of consumer protection law, it can
alert local authority trading standards enforcement. I encourage anyone
who wishes to do so to make use of schemes such as the telephone
preference service and the mailing preference service, which will stop
addressed mail, and the “Your Choice” preference service,
which will stop unaddressed mailings.</hs_Para>

the past two years, the Government have better equipped trading
standards to hit scammers hard by transferring responsibility for
cross-cutting leadership and co-ordination of enforcement activity from
the Office of Fair Trading to the National Trading Standards Board. The
NTSB funds and directs specialist scambuster teams in England and Wales
to enable trading standards to take a cross-regional approach to
tackling scams and rogue-trading practices. Scambusters currently have
five ongoing serious investigations into scams targeting older people
in Wales, and I will highlight a couple of their successes
shortly.</hs_Para>

target vulnerable households.

standards and the Green Deal Oversight and Registration Body naturally
take a very serious view of rogue traders and will pursue them with the
full force of the law. While instances of abuse under the green deal
are only just starting to emerge, it is worth 
<?notus-xml column=239?>putting on record that scambusters have notched up a couple of
impressive wins against other vultures who prey on the vulnerable in
Wales. That serves as an example of what fraudsters operating under the
green deal banner can expect to
receive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000131">For
example, one criminal was a cold-calling rogue trader builder,
operating in the local authorities of south-west and mid-Wales. A
scambuster investigation identified 21 victims of the man; they had
paid more than £150,000 to him. The scambusters team was able to
contact and offer support to a number of victims through dedicated
specialists. The investigation resulted in the man being sentenced to
12 months’ imprisonment, suspended for two years, for using
aggressive commercial practices against vulnerable people.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>I could point to

summary, the fraudsters’ goal is a simple one: to cheat as many
people as possible out of their money by making false promises. Fraud
and scams hit the elderly particularly hard; on becoming victims of a
scam, they often lose a disproportionate amount of money in relation to
other victims. I hope that I have been able to demonstrate this
afternoon how, as a UK Government, we are taking action to combat the
issues—particularly in Wales, where we are working alongside
local authorities and the Welsh Government. We will keep that in sight,

come back to a couple of specific questions that have been raised by
hon. Members. We were asked about cold doorstep-calling and whether we
would welcome a ban, or an increased number of cold-calling
“notspots”, where people are prevented from doing so. As
a Government, we are certainly not against such initiatives when they
are genuinely community-led. When specific 
<?notus-xml column=240?>communities are being targeted by fraudsters and there is a demand in
the community for such an arrangement, we certainly do not wish to do
anything against that. However, it is worth putting on the record that
neither do we want to harm genuine entrepreneurs, who make a living
legitimately, providing a legitimate service and business to households
on their doorsteps. There is a balance to be struck, but where there
are vulnerable communities who have suffered repeated targeting,
perhaps that is one of the solutions that can be community
led.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101584000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/halltext/131015h0002.htm#13101584000134">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-15T17:19:40"></hs_TimeCode>

steps to raise awareness of the problem of scam mail among its staff.
It has put in place an internal reporting facility that allows
customers, including relatives or friends of suspected victims, to
report concerns to postal workers or directly to a Royal Mail helpline,
which allows advice to be issued and information to be passed on to an
appropriate body—the police, trading standards or a support

crimes as crooks and gangsters. That is probably some of the more
polite language that we could use to describe such people. We
absolutely want to prevent them from operating. They are at times
notoriously difficult to investigate and track down, but we as a

one of the fundamental achievements of the EU. However, the Commission
noted that free movement rights were weakened by abuse and the
Commission would support member states in using existing EU tools to
fight such abuse. These tools included sanctions, such as expulsion and
re-entry bans in certain circumstances and with the appropriate
safeguards. National authorities could also check whether an EU citizen
had become an unreasonable burden, and if so could refuse residence and
withhold benefits. The Commission noted evidence of a minority of EU

disadvantaged areas and on local
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13101580000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/wmstext/131015m0001.htm#13101580000103">The

marriage handbook needed further work and there was a need for
consistent interpretation of the free movement directive, for example
on expulsion and re-entry bans. Many member states supported the

to go, as the projection for the next year was that the total refugee
population would increase to 3.9 million. EASO noted that for half the
EU member states, Syrians were now within the top three asylum intake.
The UK highlighted that it had provided over £500 million to the
relief effort in the region, as well as participating in the RDPP with
a contribution of £425,000. For the UK, more protection and

civilians under International Humanitarian Law. UK policy includes
robust criteria on establishing positive identification and requires
commanders to do everything feasible to verify that the target is a
military objective. The UK Targeting Directive and Rules of Engagement
for Operation Herrick, which are approved by Ministers, provide clear
direction for commanders on this policy, which is constantly reviewed
in light of changing circumstances and advances in technology. An
additional review in response to the UN Mission in Afghanistan's report

Section 24 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 places a

a Section 24 report does not indicate that an offence has been
committed; rather it reflects the suspicions of the Registrar. The
following table shows the number of Section 24 reports received in each

strict rules governing interaction with detainees. Any member of staff
who contravenes any of the rules governing interaction, whether inside
or outside centres, will face disciplinary action, which may lead to
dismissal. The use of CCTV cameras in the majority of public areas in

women candidates and there are now more female parliamentarians than at
any other time. Following the cross-party 2010 Speaker's Conference
Report on Parliamentary Representation, the Government is working with
the parties and Parliament to encourage more women to seek election. We
have implemented provisions in the Equality Act 2010 which enable
political parties to use positive action, should they wish to; extended
the ability to use women-only shortlists to 2030, and to reserve seats
on electoral shortlists for those with particular under-represented
characteristics; and secured commitment from the three main parties to
provide greater transparency over candidate selection, through the
collection and publication of candidates' diversity
data.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="131015108000090" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/text/131015w0002.htm#131015108000090">Performance

Barker:</Member></B> The Government has not made such an estimate.
However UK industrial sectors—including the cement
sector—will receive over 510 million free allowances over the
course of Phase III (2013-20) of the EU Emissions Trading System, worth
over £2.5 billion at the current allowance price of around
€5/tCO<Sub>2</Sub>. This level of allocation is after the
application of the Cross Sectoral Correction Factor, which will be
applied uniformly to all non-electricity generating installations
across the
EU.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131015108001825" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/text/131015w0003.htm#131015108001825">The
Government recognises the risk of carbon leakage within the EU ETS, and
supports the proportionate free allocation of allowances as a tool to
mitigate this, without raising barriers to international trade.
However, we have expressed concern to the European Commission that
those most at risk may not be compensated sufficiently in the future if
current rules are not reformed to ensure that free allowances are
better targeted to those sectors genuinely at significant risk. We
continue to monitor and evaluate the impact of the EU ETS on the
competitiveness of UK industry, and have commissioned research to
investigate this issue further. The cement industry is folly involved
in the conduct of that research via the Mineral Products
Association.</hs_Para>

establish precise trends in the illegal activity of fly-grazing.
However, I share the concerns of landowners and horse welfare
organisations about people who graze their horses on other people's
land without their permission. I understand the frustrations of
landowners who consider that the law does not allow action to be taken
quickly enough and I support the call for enforcement bodies to share
best practice on how to deal with perpetrators. The new measures
designed to tackle antisocial behaviour, in the Anti-social Behaviour,
Crime and Policing Bill which is currently before Parliament, will also
be available to use against people who fly-graze their
horses.</hs_Para>

the best interests of a child. The LA may then place the child with
adoptive parents once either the consent of the birth parents is

NHS Trust Development Authority (NHS TDA). The NHS TDA works with

The socio-economic group used is derived from the Index of Multiple
Deprivation (IMD). IMD is a measure of multiple deprivation which ranks
the relative deprivation of each area of England in a number domains
(such as crime and income) and then combines the individual scores to
produce a . composite score for each area. The patient's residential
postcode is then mapped to one of these areas, and summarised into 10
groups for presentation. Further information is available

sites that are unable to bring forward much needed local growth and
housing, including housing at an affordable level. To facilitate the
release of such sites, the Growth and Infrastructure Act 2013 brought
in measures to enable developers to apply to local authorities to
review the affordable housing requirements of any Section 106 agreement
where this is a critical factor in site viability. The review must be
based on robust evidence of economic viability and can only address the
affordable housing requirements of the planning consent. Where a
Section 106 agreement pre-dates April 2010 or is over five years old,
an application may also be made to modify the agreement. Appeal
processes are in place where applications to amend Section 106
agreements are refused, or not determined in due time. Appeals are a
measure of last resort if local authorities and developers have been
unable to voluntarily renegotiate
agreements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="131015109000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131015/text/131015w0003.htm#131015109000020">As

Councils have an obligation to assess and meet housing need including
affordable housing. The National Planning Policy Framework makes clear
that Councils should assess the scale and mix of housing and the range
of tenures that the local population is likely to require, including
the need for affordable housing. Councils should then use this evidence
base to ensure that their Local Plan meets the full, objectively
assessed needs for market and affordable housing, as far as is
