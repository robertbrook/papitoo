senior civil servants—and not just senior civil
servants—not staying in post long enough. We are seeking to
address that, and I know that the leadership of the civil service takes
the issue very seriously. One of the effects of moving to fixed tenure
for permanent secretaries will, I suspect, be to lengthen the period
they stay in post rather than, as some have feared, shorten
it.</hs_Para>

Productivity has improved and we believe that significantly more
productivity can be gained. Current departmental plans show a continued

visit programmes over the summer. As I said, young people have to date
contributed more than 1 million hours of their time to do good work in
their communities. Part of the calculation of £3 back for every

giving. The other part is their increased employability, which reflects
the life and work skills they are gathering through

Whoever was in government right now would have to make difficult

reduction of some public sector jobs, so we need a strong private

in the private sector, meaning that overall there are 1 million more

NHS is one of the greatest institutions in the world. Ensuring that it
is sustainable and that it serves the best interests of patients
sometimes means taking tough decisions. The population of north-west
London is growing and will reach approximately 2.15 million by 2018.
About 300,000 people have a long-term condition. However, there is
great variation in the quality of acute care. In 2011, there was a 10%
higher mortality rate at weekends for emergency admissions, and the
number of hospital re-admissions differs considerably across the area.
The Independent Reconfiguration Panel expressed concerns that the
status quo in north-west London was neither sustainable nor desirable,
and might not even be
stable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0001.htm#13103062000189">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T12:34:12"></hs_TimeCode>
order to address these challenges, the NHS in London started the
“Shaping a healthier future” programme in 2009. It
proposed significant changes to services, including centralising
accident and emergency services at five rather than nine hospitals;
24/7 urgent care centres at all nine hospitals; 24/7 consultant cover
in all obstetric wards; a brand new trauma hospital at St
Mary’s hospital, Paddington; brand new custom-built local
hospitals at Ealing and Charing Cross; seven-day access to GP surgeries
throughout north-west London; the creation of over 800 additional posts
to improve out-of-hospital care, including a named, accountable
clinician for all vulnerable and elderly patients with fully integrated
provision by the health and social care systems; and increased
investment in mental health and psychiatric liaison
services.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0001.htm#13103062000190"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T12:35:09"></hs_TimeCode>These
changes represent the most ambitious plans to transform care put

seven-day working, improved hospital safety and proactive
out-of-hospital and GP services. The improvements in emergency care
alone should save about 130 lives per annum and the transformation in
out-of-hospital care many more, giving north-west London probably the
best out-of-hospital care anywhere in the

Burnham</B> (Leigh) (Lab):</Member> People at home will have listened
carefully to what the Secretary of State has just said, and they will
have one simple question in their mind: why is this man trying to close
so many A and Es when we are in the middle of an A and E crisis? At
least seven A and Es across the capital are under threat, at a time
when all London A and Es are working flat out and are full to capacity.
As we stand here, thousands of people are waiting to be seen, stuck on
trolleys or held in the back of ambulances that are queuing outside A
and E. When the A and Es we have are struggling to cope, how on earth
can it be safe to close or downgrade so

to what I see as the major flaw in what the Secretary of State has
announced. These plans have been in development for four years, as he
said. Four years ago, A and E was not in the crisis that it faces
today. The reality on the ground in London has changed. In 2013, A and
Es in London have been getting worse and worse and worse. Across
London, 200,000 people have waited in A and E for longer than four
hours in the past 12 months. Here is the statistic that should make
people stop and think: taking all its major A and E units together,
London has missed the Government’s A and E target in 48 of the
last 52
weeks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0001.htm#13103062000207">Any<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T12:41:08"></hs_TimeCode>
further changes to this fragile and overburdened system must proceed
with the utmost caution. Will the Secretary of State give me a
categorical assurance that he personally gave in-depth consideration to
the latest evidence of the pressure on London A and Es and to the
changed reality that 2013 has brought before making his decision? I
understand how tough such decisions are. Sometimes, difficult changes
need to be made, as I found when I reorganised stroke services in
London before the last election. When he does the right thing, based on
a clear clinical case that lives will be saved, we will support him, as
we did on children’s heart surgery. The problem with the closure

given winter pressures on A and Es, but he should read the document.
The proposals are for more emergency care doctors, more critical care
doctors, and more psychiatric liaison support that helps A and E
departments, and they are supported by the medical directors of all

Hunt:</Member></B> I thank my right hon. Friend for that comment. He is
right that this is about facing up to difficult decisions. One aspect
of the proposals that is so exciting for people who want a
transformation in services is that they involve employing 800
additional people for out-of-hospital care. The real way we will reduce
pressure on A and E units is by ensuring that people, particularly the
frail and elderly, are looked after better at home. That is what we
must do. We must recognise that, fundamentally, the problems will not
be solved by trying to pour in money in the way that it has always been
poured in. We must rethink the model. This is a positive and ambitious
programme. If the shadow Secretary of State were in my shoes, he would
speak differently of the proposals, because they represent the way
forward for the kind of integrated care he normally

will be very disappointed with the Secretary of State’s

However, given that the hospital trust began moving acute services out
to Northwick Park hospital many years before the process began, they
will probably not be surprised. Does he agree that there is an urgent

ensure good transport links for my constituents in Harlesden to get to

The whole House knows that all the medical directors in the hospitals
involved in north-west London support the reconfiguration. Does the
Secretary of State really understand the importance of bringing
ordinary people with him? Londoners are especially cautious about these
reconfigurations because of the historic problems with access to GPs
and the many excluded communities for whom A and E is their primary
care, and because these institutions are often major employers in their
area and people identify with them. Does he realise that unless he
brings ordinary people and patients with him on these reconfigurations,
Londoners will continue to fight them and, as in the case of Lewisham,
they will continue to

with what the hon. Lady says. It is important to carry the public with
us in these reconfigurations. Governments from both sides of the House
have struggled to do that in these difficult reconfigurations, which is
why the new structures that we have introduced will put doctors in the
front line to argue for changes. It is not just the medical directors
of trusts supporting them, but the CCG leaders, who are all local GPs,
making that case. That is why there is much stronger support for these
changes. All the elected representatives on the local councils, apart
from Ealing, supported these changes, and that is a very big change
from what we have seen previously. I agree with the hon. Lady: we need

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T13:10:42"></hs_TimeCode> certainly
agree with two of the three points. I do not think it is credible to
say that we will not make any changes to the NHS, even if they are in

would end up with paralysis, which would be against the interests of
patients. However, I do think that GPs should be in the driving seat
and be the advocates of these changes, and we should listen to them

Frankly, that is quite an achievement. Planned non-emergency hospital
services have already moved away from St Mary’s Paddington to
pre-empt the closure programmes that he is now telling us will not
happen. That was done on the basis that St Mary’s would become
the premier emergency hospital for west London, so where does that
leave the provision of additional emergency services? Will that leave
my constituents having to travel to Hammersmith, Ealing and Central
Middlesex hospitals for their treatment, something the local authority

the increase in the frail elderly population and the inadequacy of the

only in London, but in the country. The trust scored 81.03%. That is an
appalling record. What he has done today, by announcing the almost
immediate closure of Central Middlesex, can only make that much worse.

in the statement that what the A and Es at Ealing and Charing Cross
contain must be consistent with Professor Sir Bruce Keogh’s
review of A and E services across the country, which they will be, and
that any changes made in service provision must have full consultation
with his constituents, which will happen. On the basis of an IRP report
that simply says, “More work needs to be done,” I cannot
answer all his questions, but I hope I can give him greater certainty

opportunity therefore exists for written questions, correspondence and
other means to extract the information or views that he seeks. I have

order, Mr Speaker. I wish to raise a point of order relating to the
right of Members of the House to have access to Ministers and, in
particular, to Ministers at the Home Office. This relates in particular
to two cases, whose correspondence I have here. I originally wrote to
the Home Office about the first case on 9 July, saying that it was
urgent and that I needed a speedy reply. It involved a religious
organisation, the Al-Raza Foundation, in my constituency, which had an
indispensable need for a religious worker to join it for an event
beginning on 1 November. The matter has not been resolved in the
interim, despite my repeated attempts to contact the Home Office and,
in particular,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T13:33:41"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Immigration, the hon. Member for Forest of Dean (Mr Harper). That
organisation is registered by the Home Office as a sponsor, but its
activities have been wrecked by the failure of the Home Office to
respond since 9 July.</hs_Para>

second case involves a constituent of mine who has been in Copenhagen
and who has had problems with his passport. He has visited the British
embassy there daily, but has received no help. He is now homeless in
Copenhagen. During his family’s most recent visit to see me, his
brother was in tears over his predicament. I wrote to the Home Office
about the case a month ago, saying that it was urgent, but it has not
even bothered to respond. I warned it yesterday that if I did not get a

<?notus-xml column=939?>result by today, I would raise the matter with you, Mr
Speaker. As a result of that, I got a completely useless telephone call
from a member of the Minister for Immigration’s staff, saying
that they would let me know as soon as possible. I do not object to the

known him throughout my 16 years in the House, I am

courteously to him in the first instance, not only because it is the
right thing to do but because failure to do so will almost certainly

recognise that there has long been great pressure

that the right hon. Gentleman will understand that I cannot comment on
how long it might take to resolve a particular case, however
needy it might be. However, courtesy, timeliness and comprehensiveness
of replies are to be expected from Ministers in relation to
correspondence, just as they are rightly expected from Ministers in
relation to parliamentary questions. I trust that that message will
have been heard, and that it will now be

appreciate the seriousness of bullying and hate crime, we need only
look at the tragic case of Fiona Pilkington, who took her own life and
that of her daughter Francecca Hardwick in 2007, after 10 years of
harassment by bullies in her neighbourhood. The case has been well
documented, and the resulting recommendations are in line with what I
am proposing in the Bill. A few years ago, in one of my neighbouring
constituencies, Brent Martin, a young man with learning disabilities,
was beaten to death by three people he took to be friends. That was a
sad case in which a vulnerable individual was physically abused and
murdered by so-called
friends<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T13:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>. There
are ever-growing concerns that hate crime against vulnerable groups is
on the rise. My only hope is that the rise is not, as many vulnerable
people feel, indicative of an increasing antipathy towards people who
are perceived to be different from the rest of
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000306" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0001.htm#13103062000306">According
to Home Office figures for 2011-12, there were 43,748 hate crimes
recorded by the police. Of those recorded hate crimes, 82% were
race-related; 10% were related to sexual orientation; 4%
were religiously motivated; and 4%—only 1,474—were
recorded as disability hate crimes. What we need to see happen is for
offences motivated by hostility towards the disabled or those with
learning disabilities or difficulties to be treated in the same way as
those motivated by racial or religious hatred. The victims of these
crimes are equally aggrieved and equally harmed as anyone in any other
category.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000307" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0001.htm#13103062000307">I

how many right hon. and hon. Members have had the opportunity to read
Mencap’s revealing report “Don’t stand by: ending
disability hate crime together”, which investigated how 14
police forces in the UK report disability hate crime and further
highlighted how reported disability hate crime against those with
learning disabilities and difficulties was significantly lower than
actual disability hate crime. The report also found that, although many
forces recorded disability hate crime, only one force recorded it by
type of impairment—physical, sensory and learning disabilities
and mental health conditions. That is concerning.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T13:41:16"></hs_TimeCode> reported last
year by the Director of Public Prosecutions, some force areas recorded
a nil return for disability hate crime—I treat that with

element found in the report, as well as in the joint review of
disability hate crime, was the inability of some police officers to
distinguish between learning disability or difficulty hate crime and
general antisocial behaviour. In fact, Steve Ashley, programme director
to Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary, who conducted the
joint review, said that there was a lack of willingness by police
officers and police staff in control rooms to put the right sort of
questions to vulnerable people to establish their condition as a
victim<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T13:42:01"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, improved information sharing between all agencies is
essential to ensure that hate crimes against those with learning
difficulties and disabilities are properly reported and that
prosecutions are pursued as vigorously as racial or religious hate
crimes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000310" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0001.htm#13103062000310">It
is a sad fact that all too many victims with learning difficulties or
disabilities do not report to the police in the first instance. In
2010, only 1,200 cases of disability hate crime were prosecuted,
compared with 48,000 racist or religious crimes. A survey by the
National Autistic Society, however, revealed that 81% of respondents
said they had experienced verbal abuse; 47% reported that they had been
victims of a physical assault; and only 6% said they had not
experienced any form of bullying or abuse because of their disability.
Furthermore, 28% of respondents had experienced
exploitation, theft and fraud or had had their possessions or property
damaged; 24% had been victims of cyber-bullying; 65% had experienced
hate crime more than 10 times; 73% did not report the crime to police,
while of those who did, 54% said the police did not record
it as a hate crime, and 40% said the police did not act on
their report; and 62% said they did not think that the police had taken
disability into account in the recording or otherwise of the
crime.</hs_Para>

people with learning difficulties and disabilities, including autism,

some quite horrific cases. You may have heard, Mr Speaker, about the
teenage boy with autism who attended a special educational needs

about him, and he was physically restrained and handcuffed by police.
That resulted in the family receiving damages, and the High Court
described the treatment of the boy as “inhuman and
degrading”. This case highlights the need for autism, learning

is important that we accept that this is a national problem and a
national scandal, when people with learning disabilities and
difficulties are having dreadful experiences because of bullying,
verbal and physical abuse and intimidation. There needs to be a clear
definition of disability hate crime, which encompasses people with
learning disabilities and difficulties, and disability hate crime
should become a specific criminal offence. Police forces around the
country need to accept that this is a problem that needs to be dealt
with and that there is a proper recording method when such crimes
occur. We must urge police forces and police and crime commissioners to

that as a consequence of the statement, truncated time is available for

reflected in the short time-limit. There is, of course, no time-limit
on Front-Bench speeches, but I politely suggest that it would be a
considerable discourtesy to Back Benchers if Front Benchers were to
take longer than 40 minutes in their opening speeches. The
Secretary of State looks a bit alarmed at that, but there is no reason
for him to look alarmed; I am sure he can cope, and that the shadow

Gentleman, who, as ever, speaks sense. However, it was not the

Bermondsey and Old Southwark. I am enlightening the House in a way
that, I am afraid, the hon. Gentleman’s Front-Bench team failed
to do. I agree with him about continuous professional development,
which is why we are changing the way in which we support teachers,
through the establishment of teaching schools. We have 357 teaching
schools that have been established. I presume that the hon. Member for
Stoke-on-Trent Central supports that initiative, applauds the teachers
who are involved in it and believes it is the right thing to do. It

changing the way in which teachers are trained. The <I>Times Higher
Education</I><I> </I>has reported that under its new inspection regime
Ofsted pointed out that school-centred initial teacher
training—SCITT—is in many cases better than higher
education initial teacher training. According to <I>Times Higher
Education</I>, 31% of the school-centred initial teacher training
centres inspected were outstanding whereas only 13% of higher-education
institution centres were. So we are moving teacher training from those
institutions that are performing less well relatively—some of
them are still “outstanding”—to those that are
performing better. That is a real improvement in the quality of teacher
training and professional development.</hs_Para>

standards. They were drawn up by Sally Coates, the head teacher of
Burlington Danes academy, in alliance with Joan Deslandes of Kingsford
community school, Patricia Sowter of Cuckoo Hall and Sir Dan Moynihan
of Harris academies. Again, the question for
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T14:14:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Stoke-on-Trent Central and his Front-Bench colleagues is: do they
believe that the introduction of these new teacher standards was the
right thing to do? Do they support them? Do they back them? Do they
recognise that they drive improved performance in the classroom? Do
they also recognise that as a result of our changes the quality of
teaching is higher than ever before?</hs_Para>

hon. Friend the Member for Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart) rightly
pointed out that we have a tougher Ofsted regime and a more rigorous
accountability regime than ever before; it is tougher for someone to
prove that they are outstanding. Under Labour 13% of teaching at
primary schools and 11% of secondary teaching was outstanding, whereas
the latest figures show that under the coalition Government those
proportions have risen. The number of outstanding primary lessons has
increased by 12% and the number of secondary lessons judged
“outstanding” has gone up by a third. So more quality
teaching is benefiting more students in more schools as a result of the
changes we have made.</hs_Para>

They must have independently audited financial accounts. They must
appoint an accounting officer who has personal responsibility to the
National Audit Office and, through that office, to Parliament. Those
accounts must have a regularity opinion from external auditors that
sets out how regularity over income and expenditure has been obtained.
Free schools must also undergo their own financial management

no central record of their doing so in local authority schools, whereas

Madam Deputy Speaker. It is a pleasure to take part in this debate.
When making decisions about education, one question matters above all
others: how will this affect the quality of teaching? That is the prism
through which every educational decision should be viewed. A great
teacher can make the difference between a child muddling through,
struggling or aiming high.</hs_Para>

by Professor Eric Hanushek of Stanford university shows that during one
year with a very effective maths teacher, pupils gained 40% more than
they would have with a poor performer. The effects of high quality
teaching are especially significant for pupils from disadvantaged
backgrounds. Hanushek found that over a school year, these pupils gain
one and a half years’ worth of learning with very effective
teachers, compared with just half a year of learning with poorly
performing teachers. So that is the prism through which we should look
at these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T14:37:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000449" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0002.htm#13103062000449">Before
we make decisions in education, another approach is to make sure that
we follow the evidence. What assessment has

for Stoke-on-Trent Central (Tristram Hunt) made of the quality of
teachers without qualified teacher status in the classrooms? He could
shake his head when the Secretary of State was speaking, but inevitably
people will be sacked from the classroom. We have heard these people
come forward. The hon. Gentleman is shaking his head now, denying an
obvious truth. Teachers without QTS will be sacked from the classroom
if that policy is implemented.

system of accountability to make sure that there is nowhere to hide for
the teacher who is not performing. In that context a head teacher has
gone out on a limb to recruit someone who is non-QTS. We know, as was
not acknowledged by the hon. Gentleman, that the number of
non-qualified teachers in the teaching profession has fallen.

therefore have a smaller number of teachers who have been through the

children attend an independent school and have non-QTS teachers. I want
to ensure that every school can access people who can inspire pupils
within a system of accountability. If the shadow Secretary of State
told me, “We’ve carried out an assessment and got the
evidence, which shows that some head teachers are taking on unqualified
teachers just to save money and sticking them in classrooms with
low-ability children, which is letting them down”, I would be
the first to congratulate him. I would say, “Yes, let’s
look at the right policy response, but let’s not sack top
teachers who happen to be non-QTS teachers if we can possibly help
it.”</hs_Para>

me, on any kind of evidence base, that widespread numbers of non-QTS
teachers are letting down our kids. I put it to him, who has
been in post for a matter of days, that there is no such evidence base.
On the contrary, the evidence base shows that non-QTS
teachers in state schools in some of our toughest neighbourhoods are
inspirational. There are often teachers who have left the
independent sector, where he went, where I went and where my children
go, in order to try to make a contribution in state schools in
challenging circumstances. Under the Opposition’s policy, if
those people do not put themselves through the many hours required to
pass QTS, they will be sacked. That is absolutely wrong. He should not
deny the consequences of his policy: it will lead to the removal of
outstanding teachers from state school classrooms. It will almost
certainly see them turning up in independent schools, where they are
needed least, rather than most. That is the central flaw in
his argument, and I think that he sees
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000458" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0002.htm#13103062000458">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T14:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>

history of Labour in office and unqualified teachers shows that in the

qualified through the licensed or the classic routes. Government
Members say that free schools and academies are now free to employ
teachers who have a master’s degree or a doctorate, and is that
not a good thing? I am not altogether sure about that. I have a master
of science degree, but a working knowledge of maths and statistics does
not make me a teacher. Without a bachelor of education degree I would
not have the skills and knowledge to understand child development, the
science of teaching and learning, how children learn, and classroom
management and managing behaviour, or to identify the needs of children
with special educational needs and how to meet them. I would not know
about differentiation, delivering a programme of study across a range
of abilities, or assessment—that is, knowing what a child can
and cannot do, and what they need to do next. Important as those things
are, I would also not have the credibility and trust of my professional
colleagues, of parents, or, more importantly, of young people
themselves. Pupils know very quickly who is qualified and who is not,
and who is experienced and who is not, and that affects their behaviour
and how they learn in the classroom.</hs_Para>

Democrats believe that all schoolchildren and their parents should

or someone who is en route to being qualified. We want to free schools

parents have the confidence of knowing that their children are taught

expectations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000489" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0002.htm#13103062000489">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T14:56:08"></hs_TimeCode>

line—those who know best about their pupils’ educational
needs—to teach in the way that is most effective for their

will talk about the evidence that supports the use of qualified
teachers. In his report for McKinsey in 2007, Sir Michael Barber found
that although the high-performing systems in Finland, Japan, Singapore
and South Korea had very different curricula, teaching methods and
school structures, they all made the quality of teaching their first
concern. Getting the right people into the profession and giving them
the right training were the top two priorities that Sir Michael
proposed to improve education. It would be interesting to hear from the
Secretary of State how many of those jurisdictions actively encourage
schools to employ teachers who have no teaching 
<?notus-xml column=970?>qualifications. A cursory glance at other school systems shows where the
priority lies in the most successful countries. The Governments in
Finland, Hong Kong, South Korea and Japan are raising the bar for
professional qualifications, not trying to remove
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0002.htm#13103062000540">The
Government’s 2010 White Paper also looked abroad for
inspiration. It noted that South Korea recruits teacher trainees from
the top 5% of school leavers and Finland from the top 10%. Importantly,

qualifications before they become

short, whether we look at international comparisons or at existing good

unfortunately that approach is undermined by having unqualified

Glen</B> (Salisbury) (Con):</Member> I am grateful for the opportunity
to contribute to this debate. I was genuinely surprised to
see the words of today’s motion, because this debate is based on
the fact that fewer than four in every 100 teachers do not have
qualified status. If the purpose of the debate is to try to draw out
differences between the coalition parties, and sow the seeds of public
concern that if free schools and academies expand—I sincerely
hope they will—vast numbers of state-educated children will be
taught by unregulated, unqualified and unsuitable individuals, it will
fail in that objective.</hs_Para>

that free schools and academies provide freedoms for head teachers and
leadership teams to employ individuals from a range of diverse
backgrounds—perhaps for shorter periods or on an ad hoc basis to
suit the developmental needs of their pupils, or, where
necessary, to extend the curriculum. It is right to trust head teachers
to appoint the staff they need locally, and to take on
experts from industry and those with varied skills who sometimes simply
may not have ticked the final box before
qualifying. The fundamental principle that teachers are more likely
than politicians to know their staff and what they need in their school
is undoubtedly
true.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000550" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0002.htm#13103062000550">Most
importantly, academies and free schools will not be free from
Government oversight, and the process for becoming an academy or
starting a free school is rigorous—in my constituency, several
applications have been unsuccessful. If schools get through that
rigorous process, Ofsted can come in at a few days’ notice, and
Ebacc requirements will involve more and more scrutiny of outcomes. I
fear that this debate is really about an obsession with process and
uniformity, and discomfort with getting to the heart of education,

our children.</hs_Para>

was recently contacted by a top academic from Southampton university
about its teacher training programme. She noted that one of its

taught and honed on teacher training programmes, those programmes
cannot fully replicate raw talent and a passion for teaching,
which—among some—is evident in the classroom from the
start. In other words, teachers may become properly trained through
on-the-job training alone, and it seems unnecessary to make
high-quality candidates jump through arbitrary assessment hoops and
delays, when their skills are being tested and they can demonstrate
them to the head teacher’s satisfaction and secure better

to raise standards as well as the expectations of pupils and parents.
That is about removing Whitehall interference, and demonstrating our

when it comes to getting the best out of the children who face the

inspirational. Mr Burton was able to do that not because he knows a lot
about poetry, although I am sure he does, but because he knows a lot

Secretary of State is relaxed about the freedom to have unqualified
teachers in classrooms, but other freedoms that have been extended to
free schools and academies could have much more serious consequences.
An internal audit investigation team at the Kings science academy has
shown how far that can go. The school is free to have unqualified
teachers, but it is also free to appoint a principal with no real
management or leadership experience, let alone qualifications. It is
free to have unqualified teachers, but it is also free to access
£460,000 to pay for temporary accommodation in a former
independent school, of which the principal’s father was a
trustee. No wonder the school is happy about employing non-qualified
teachers. The principal was also free to employ his mother, his sister
and his father. I do not know whether they teach, but they were
employed without any interviews or applications being
required.</hs_Para>

that? Should they be free to access £10 million of Government

warehousing in a mill in Bradford, but that property company, owned by
the vice-chairman of the Tory party, is getting £300,000 a year

the Member for Norwich South (Simon Wright), who spoke today for the

Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes). They
asked an interesting question at the beginning of the debate, but they
got no answer. That question, to which we have still not had an answer,
was: why, if Labour Members are so keen on qualified teacher status,
was the number of unqualified teachers thousands higher when the Labour
Government were in power than it is today? I have the figures here. In
2005, when Labour was in power, there were 18,800 unqualified teachers
in state-maintained schools. That figure is now down to 14,800. If
Labour Members are so passionate about this, and if they want to join
my party in its strong views on it, I think that they owe it to the
House to answer the question put to them earlier. Why, if they are so
keen on qualified teacher status, were there so many more unqualified
teachers when Labour was in
power<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T15:53:25"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103062000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0002.htm#13103062000607">I

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T15:53:35"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cardiff West is able to have some fun by pointing out the
responsibilities that come with government and the need for compromises
in coalition. It is rather more difficult to explain how a party that
is not in coalition seems incapable of having just one position on
these matters. The second version of the West Lothian question that we
must ask today is the

Central question. Even without the pressures of coalition, the Labour
Education spokesman, the hon. Member for Stoke-on-Trent Central

vast majority of state-funded schools in this country still require
qualified teacher status. I have no doubt that there are people on the
Conservative Benches who would see that the logic of their policy means
that this should be applied to all state-funded schools. They accept
that there have to be compromises; they understand that and they do not
have difficulty with it. What we have found today is that the parties
in coalition accept their responsibilities and that the Labour party is
completely incoherent, hiding behind this matter to cover up the
embarrassment of its own lack of policies. We will not be blown off
course. We will continue to deliver a better education system. We will
work together closely in Government as we have since May 2010, and we
will go on delivering the reformed and improved education system for
which all of us on the Opposition Benches have been working since that

this House applauds the important role of the professional Probation
Service in keeping the public safe; recognises that more needs to be
done to break the cycle of reoffending; notes that, without
parliamentary approval, the Government plans to abolish local Probation
Trusts, commission services from Whitehall, fragment the supervision of
offenders on the basis of their risk level, and hand over supervision
of 80 per cent of offenders to private companies; deplores the fact
that under the Government’s plans supervision of dangerous,
sexual and violent offenders may be undertaken by inexperienced and
unqualified staff and by companies without any track record in this
area, without any piloting or independent evaluation, all of which is
taking unnecessary risks with public safety; and calls on the
Government to suspend the national roll-out of its plans until evidence
is made public that its proposals to reduce re-offending do not put
public safety at

probation service might not work as well as we would all like it to do
and we need to do more to reduce reoffending rates, which are still far
too high. That is one reason why we support the Government’s
moves to introduce supervision for those who receive a prison sentence
of less than 12 months, and through the prison gate supervision as
well. This debate is not about status quo versus change. This is about
good, evidence-based, tested change versus<I> </I>ideologically driven,
untested, reckless change. The Government know, as do we, that
probation works because those supervised have lower reoffending rates
than those not supervised. That is why they are extending supervision

we do not believe that what the Government are proposing is the right
way forward—abolishing local probation trusts, commissioning
services directly from Whitehall, imposing a payment-by-results model
on the system, and fragmenting supervision on the basis of risk levels.
Implementing half-baked plans in a rushed manner is a gamble with
public safety. If something goes terribly wrong or, God forbid,
tragically wrong, public confidence in our criminal justice system is
undermined. Ministers should not just take my word for it. According to

remind the House that he may have 12 months’ experience in his

who we trust in relation to probation. That is why we should be
cautious about making changes to probation. Neither the probation

hon. Friend the Member for Westminster North (Ms Buck) is right,
because compounding this situation is the unnatural carving up of
responsibility for offenders on the basis of risk. The public sector
will keep the very highest-risk offenders—the Justice Secretary
clearly does not trust G4S and Serco with them—and the private
sector will have the rest. He does not get it. Again, my hon. Friend is
right: risk is not static. In one in four cases, risk levels fluctuate.
Each time someone’s risk level fluctuates, bureaucracy and
paperwork is involved, but we cannot afford for this to be a slow or
cumbersome process, because when risk levels escalate, they tend to do
so rapidly. They might stop taking their medication or a relationship
might break down, leading to them becoming, overnight, a danger to
themselves and others, so the process needs to be swift if the
appropriate measures and support are to be put in
place.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_30_PT_1/32D8B7080146F43EC71F4921214B14B71D4E0010" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="30 October 2013">Wednesday

great irony is that in the debate on the Offender Management Act 2007,
Labour Members talked about the benefit of bringing together the skills

the categorisations are existing categorisations—they are not
mine—and are part of a triage process within the existing
probation system that we will continue to use. Secondly, on moving
people from one category to another, it will the responsibility of a
national probation trust to carry out risk assessments at the
beginning, or later if circumstances change that require a new
assessment to take place. The two organisations will be in part
co-located, so it will not be a complicated bureaucratic
process—people will be sitting in the same office. The national
probation service will carry out assessments when they need to be
carried out. I can explain this to the right hon. Gentleman separately
and at much greater length if he would like, but that is how it will
work.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Sheffield, Brightside and Hillsborough (Mr
Blunkett) and me with a report, “Managing Offenders, Reducing
Crime: a new Approach”. And it was a new approach. 
<?notus-xml column=1003?>Three outcomes from that report were significant. The first was the
creation of the National Offender Management Service, which brought
together prison and probation services in a way that had not been done
before and institutionalised the end-to-end management of offenders in
a way that has underpinned everything that has happened since. More
controversially, there was a clearer separation between commissioning
and providing services, and a greater emphasis on
contestability—a belief that by bringing more players into the
system, we could get efficiencies and innovation.</hs_Para>

of that got me into hot water with some of my colleagues, and I make
that clear now because I want the Justice Secretary to know that I am
not afraid of bringing in competition or of private sector or third
sector players coming in to help to reduce reoffending. I share many of
the objectives of his transforming rehabilitation strategy. I am deeply
concerned, however, that what he is doing is not reforming the
probation service, but destroying it. This is a Secretary of State who
wants both to nationalise and to privatise the probation service at one
and the same time. He wants to end local probation trusts, but to
create a new national probation service run out of Whitehall and to
award 21 new private sector contracts that will be drawn up

intensive alternative to custody, cannot be trusted to bid for and to

Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) alluded to
this—especially in respect of the new arrangements that the
Justice Secretary proposes for the supervision of offenders who get
short prison sentences. I support the Government in trying to introduce
this innovation—I make no bones about that—but let me be
absolutely candid about custody plus. Along with many of my right hon.
and hon. Friends, I wanted custody plus and we legislated for it in the
Criminal Justice Act 2003. The obstacle—the Secretary of State
referred to it—was the cost. But at
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:17:44"></hs_TimeCode>least I can put
a price on what custody plus would have cost. Ten years ago, it would
have cost £194 million a year. Interestingly, that was based on
an estimate of 50,000 offenders who would have been in the
system—precisely the same number as those in his impact
assessment report. I can put a figure on it, but he cannot. All we are
told is that it will be paid for by the savings generated by the
competition for low and medium-risk offenders. Frankly, I just do not
believe it. Either that supervision will be inadequate or the existing
provision will be weakened and reduced in quality.</hs_Para>

enough thought has been given to the distinctions between high-risk,
medium-risk and low-risk offenders. The idea is that all the difficult
cases are dealt with in the public sector and those deemed to be low
risk are dealt with by private contractors, which is quite dangerous.
These categorisations are not static. Even under the present system,
24% of the case load changes categorisation during the period of
supervision. Payment by results by its very nature incentivises
contractors to minimise the difficult part of their work load, so there
are some perverse economic incentives in the Government’s
idea.</hs_Para>

transfers between public and private sectors inside what is, at the
moment, a unified public service. The new arrangements will make this
more difficult, especially with economic incentives driving the
process. There is too much scope for dispute and delay, thus
endangering the public. In any event, the private sector contractors
will have to be invigilated, with their claims checked to make sure
that they are true, and that will cost money. I suspect that the

is clear from the comments of hon. Members from both sides of the House

Nearly half of offenders reoffend, but the figure for short-term

<?notus-xml column=1008?>get no help with rehabilitation at all. The result is a huge cost to
society and to the economy. We need help for all ex-offenders to enable
them to build their lives on release and not fall into the same traps
that got them into trouble in the first place. That is why I welcome
our current proposals to change the law to ensure that all offenders
released from custody, regardless of their sentence length, will
receive at least 12 months of supervision on licence. It is to be done
by making probation cost-effective, by extending the service to
lower-risk offenders on a payments-by-results basis. That additional
help that offenders receive should, literally, pay for

are some legitimate questions for the Minister. I have seen payment by

voluntary and private organisations with skill and experience that
could be put to good use in rehabilitation. There are also private
companies, however, that have failed spectacularly to handle work that
has hitherto been carried out by the public sector. Whenever the profit
motive comes into play, the desire will be to maximise profit and
minimise risk and effort. How will the Government ensure that private
companies, in particular, do not simply come along and pick the
low-hanging fruit? How will we ensure that a very important Liberal
Democrat principle is adhered
to—<I>[</I><I>Laughter.</I><I>]</I> The right hon. and hon.

really important. The principle that we would adhere to is that all
ex-offenders should receive appropriate help, even when the risk of
reoffending is high. So how will that happen? And how will the costs be
factored? After all, many ex-offenders will leave prison never to
reoffend, all on their own. Will there be some form of incentive to
encourage voluntary sector or private providers to take on the hard

changes, the structure, and crucially the contractual arrangements. I
understand that the Government intend to use the Offender Management
Act 2007 as the prime mechanism to abolish probation trusts and create
new community rehabilitation companies and the national probation

Secretary of State is right to point to the appalling reoffending

mixing potentially vulnerable young offenders and older inmates. Will

“Out for Good”, which is about what prisoners want in

points, which I have not yet heard mentioned in the debate, is the
importance of stable financial support on release. By this I do not
just mean the £46 that people take through the gate, but their
ability to have a bank account and to access insurance. Many banks have
carried out pilot projects—Barclays has made more progress than
most—and the charity Unlock is doing its best to corral the
financial services industry in this regard. However, I urge Ministers
to try a little harder. Without access to a bank account, which is now
such an important part of daily life, or adequate insurance,
rehabilitation is made that much

in all parts of the House have praised the voluntary sector and the
charities that can all play such an important role, but I have detected
a slight discrepancy whereby Opposition Members see them as being
welcome participants but in a subsidiary role. I am happy to see them
in a leading role, and I think they want to do far more. For example,
the Clink Charity is a support group for about 1,000 different smaller
charities that is actively trying to work with the Government to play a
role in this. I urge the Minister to look closely at its
recommendations about how we can involve those smaller charities fairly
in the commissioning sector. It proposes that some of the up-front
financial risk that they have to bear should be transferred to the
upper-tier providers of these services, perhaps allowing them to play a
much greater role.

and I think we have already answered it. The reoffending rates are
static, but the bulk of the problem lies in a group that is not yet the
responsibility of any organisation—certainly not of the
probation service. What I am suggesting is that if we want to provide
support for that group of offenders, we should extend the remit of the
organisation that has proved that it has the expertise, skills and
ability to make a difference. Instead, the Government intend to move to
an untested system of payment by results that is unique throughout the
criminal justice world and that will be inhabited by companies that
have proved themselves to be not only incompetent, but dishonest in the
exercise of previous contracts let to them by this

shown that the relationship between an offender and their probation
officer is crucial to whether—once released—they succeed
on their licence or order. That continuity is so important that, as I
understand it, a change of probation officer for an offender is
investigated by Her Majesty’s inspectorate of prisons, and every
effort is made to ensure that the prisoner keeps the same 
<?notus-xml column=1016?>probation officer throughout. As a result of the split between the NPS
and the CRC, probation officers are concerned that that relationship
could be affected, with serious consequences for both the offender and
wider

concern is that probation officers are concerned about their careers
because when they join they have, as I understand it, a mixed

high risk. If the probation officer is a member of the CRC, they will
inevitably end up with high-risk offenders all the time. I am told that
the pressures on those who look after those offenders—who are
potentially dangerous—is immense. At the moment, because
probation officers have a mixed portfolio, they welcome the fact that
they do not have that continual assault on their time. I would be
grateful if when he concludes, the Minister commented on career
prospects for those probation officers who will still be in the
probation service run by the public sector.</hs_Para>

probation officers would argue that we should run the probation service
for all offenders, rather than arbitrarily dividing them into high, low
or medium risk and artificially separating them. We heard earlier that
three councils have asked the Government whether the proposals could be
delayed for further consideration, and I would be grateful if the
Minister told the House

probation services do good work most people do not find out about it.
On the odd occasions when things go wrong, however, the entire world is
made aware. When I visited Derbyshire probation service I was blown
away by the commitment, imagination and bravery of our probation
officers, and that is why they command such respect across both this
House and the country. These changes appear to be lacking in evidence
base. They fly in the face of all expert opinion and are so dangerously
misguided that they are very worrying indeed.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Tooting (Sadiq Khan) had to initiate this debate
to allow the House to discuss these changes is a matter of shame for
the Government. That the other place had to table an amendment to the
Offender Rehabilitation Bill to prevent the Government from making
changes to the structure of the probation service until it was debated
by this House, and that the Justice Secretary failed to bring that Bill
back to us, speaks volumes about his political cowardice and the lack
of support that the reforms
command.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0003.htm#13103075000008">The
Secretary of State tells us that we should trust him because he
believes his proposals are right. His approach seems to be this: we
have a problem—reoffending rates—and we need a policy;
this is a policy, therefore it is right. He has not explained in any
way why his intention to extend services to offenders sentenced to less
than 12 months must coincide with the creation of a load of new
companies and a privatisation. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:10:11"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.

of those services—it is already happening in some

the Secretary of State has confidence that wholesale privatisation is
right—it is privatisation not just of probation provision, but
of commissioning the services—why did he not let the pilots run

that was because he has an unblemished track record and a
Midas touch, Opposition Members might be a little less nervous.
However, as my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:10:49"></hs_TimeCode>
right hon. Friend made clear, the Secretary of State was responsible
for the shambolic Work programme, under which people were better off if
they were not on it. He was also the man at the heart of defending the
operation of the work capability assessments when dead
people were found to be fit to work. One would have hoped that, with a
track record like that, he would show a little caution before ripping
up a service on which so many people
depend.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0003.htm#13103075000010">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:11:16"></hs_TimeCode>

that the Conservatives are on their way out and that he has to
introduce his proposals before he is out of power, when he will not

service has a limited budget that has to stretch a long way, but it is
performing. Every single service is ranked as good or outstanding. Its
success is built on partnership working with local authorities, the
police, prisons and other services. Many people are worried about that
partnership working. The probation service operates as a seamless
whole. As we split the service in two, the services will not have the
partnership aspect that is so important to its success. The
Women’s Work programme in Derbyshire brings together all women
who have been in prison, regardless of their sentence. That is exactly
the kind of specialist work that will be under threat when the service
is split in
two.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0003.htm#13103075000012">The
implementation of the integrated offender management programme involves
collaboration with the police in working with offenders who are at a

perpetrators of acquisitive crime, but not the people who are
considered to be at a high risk of causing harm—the sort of
people about whom the entire community breathes a sigh of relief when
they are banged up. They are capable of creating a spike or a rut in
local crime figures depending whether or not they are inside. Those
people—walking crime machines—are the sort who are likely
to fall through the net because of the changes being

changes are dangerous and could create a huge problem. The Secretary of
State has said that his proposals are not about giving probation to big
companies, but I bet we will see the big companies getting all the
services. The idea that the voluntary sector will pick them up is a
mirage. The Secretary of State is involved in a dangerous experiment
and has a track record of failure. He should stop listening to the
voices in his head that are telling him he is right. Instead, he should
listen to the wide body of opinion telling him that he is getting this
wrong, and protect our probation services

Member for Batley and Spen (Mike Wood) tried to position the debate as
a public versus private one. The entirety of my career before becoming
an MP was in the public sector. The ethos of public service flows
through my veins. We are talking about having effective vehicles to
deliver our policy objectives. Whether delivery is public or private is
not important; the important thing is that we achieve the outcomes we
intend. That is why the instinctive opposition to the proposals from
Labour Members is disappointing. As all hon. Members recognise, the
rate of reoffending remains stubbornly high, notwithstanding the
efforts of Governments of all colours. Unless we show some imagination
in tackling that, we will not win the fight against crime and we will
continue to fail people who are trapped in the cycle of reoffending. I
welcome the initiative and imagination shown by the Government. As we
have heard, the National Audit Office has estimated that the cost of
crime committed by offenders released from short prison sentences is up
to £10 billion. For the sake of those offenders, their potential
victims and the economy, we must not allow that to
continue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0003.htm#13103075000015">Let

the things that we did in our earlier report on the Work programme was
praise the approach to that particular aspect of contract management,

providers taking those contracts bore the risk. That is a principle

recently had the privilege of visiting the Dudley office of the
Staffordshire and west midlands probation trust. I was impressed with
its work. It is currently the third best in England and Wales at
reducing reoffending. Of 53,216 ex-offenders in the entire region, just
6.9% went on to reoffend, down 16% compared with 2007. Across all areas
covered by West Midlands police, none have reoffending rates above
10%.</hs_Para>

is excellent work, but it is not unusual. In July, the
Government’s own report assessed all probation trusts as being
either good or exceptional. Despite that, the Justice Secretary has
criticised reoffending rates for prisoners serving less than 12 months,
but the probation service will not be allowed to deal with those
people. Despite all the evidence that the probation service is
functioning well, the Government plan to hand 70% of its work to
private companies.</hs_Para>

support using private and voluntary sector expertise and investment
where it works, and I believe that the principles of competition and
contestability drive up the quality of public services and can reduce
costs, but the Government are planning to invest in a
completely untested payments-by-results model and do not
have a clue if it will work. First, they have no evidence that it will
work in practice. Nowhere else in the world uses a payment-by-results
model, and the Justice Secretary cancelled pilot schemes in his first
week on the job.</hs_Para>

the Government have no clue how many low and medium-risk offenders will
go to private companies. This is key to the Government’s plans,
but parliamentary questions have revealed they have no idea how many of
the 260,000 offenders handled by the probation service are low, medium
or high risk. We need to remember that low risk does not mean no risk.
Figures show that the majority of serious offences committed on
probation are committed by low and medium-risk
offenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:21:52"></hs_TimeCode>. Those
are the basics and they should be absolutely clear. Instead, the
Government are intent on splitting the probation service, and
introducing bureaucracy and delays that could lead to

Government do not even know if the scheme will save money. They are
investing in a completely unproven scheme, instead of tried and tested

truth is that the probation service should be more integrated into the
justice system, not
less<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>. The first
way to do that is to ensure more cases are dealt with by the courts
and, where community resolutions are used, probation officers should be
involved. Community resolutions are being used more and more
extensively: the cases never go to court and the perpetrators do not
come into contact with the probation service. I heard about a case
where an offender kidnapped his underage girlfriend at knifepoint and
raped her repeatedly. He assaulted the girl so severely that she
miscarried. Unbelievably, just four weeks before the attack he had been
issued with a community resolution for underage sex with the same girl.
In another case, the rape of another underage girl was dealt with by
community resolution, and in other cases robbery, domestic violence and
sexual assault were dealt with in the same way. These people should be
going to court and the probation service should be working with them,
because there is no other way of stopping criminals from
offending

probation offices and courts need to work together at the local level.
In Dudley, the Government are threatening to close our criminal court,
which is in the same building as Dudley magistrates. Part of the reason
why Dudley has one of the best probation teams in the country is that
it too is based in the courts and works closely with them and uses
their local
knowledge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075000033">Third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:23:41"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
probation officers should work more closely with prisons. Investment in
prisons without investment in rehabilitation is a false economy. There
is normally a small probation team based in each prison charged with
co-ordinating the sentence planning and the programmes that a prisoner
should be on, in conjunction with external probation officers, but I am
told it is not permitted to run offender programmes, which are
ultimately the best way of reducing reoffending and rehabilitating
offenders prior to
release<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:24:11"></hs_TimeCode>. I am
told the team finds it almost impossible to work with prisoners in
private prisons in Birmingham and Wolverhampton, because the companies
that run them are paid to lock people up and have no incentive to do
anything that might ensure they do not commit crimes when they are
released.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075000034">The
Government know that their plans are a gamble—that is why they
are trying to force them through quickly and quietly—but we
cannot afford to gamble with probation. The cost could be more
criminals on our streets and more victims of crime. The probation
service is working—we have the evidence to prove it—and
we should be investing in it, not selling it off. That is the way to
reduce reoffending still
further.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_30_PT_1/CB36FBC5E78AD958DFA8E8D9FBE16FAF26D01ECB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="30 October 2013">Wednesday

Targets for completions on domestic violence interventions, and for
court report timeliness, have been exceeded, and completion targets

of the success of the probation service in reducing reoffending has
been its use of more targeted interventions. A good example is how
interventions for women are handled. These work well because they are
small, local and holistic; they look at each woman as an individual

Under the proposals, this type of niche service is likely to be lost

faces different circumstances and everybody has different needs.

failing to test, evaluate or improve the model, Ministers are failing
to manage effectively the risks that come with their plans. They will
not even admit to them and publish the risk register. Our most serious
concern is risk management and the fragmentation of the supervision of
dangerous offenders. As we have heard from Members—on both sides
of the House, to be fair—risk is not static. One in four
offenders change their risk category during their order, and they do
not always go from low to medium to high; they shift around far more
dynamically than that. As the hon. Member for South Dorset (Richard
Drax) observed in his excellent speech, the nub of the matter is that
the Government are introducing a dangerous layer of bureaucracy where
an offender, while at their most volatile, will be passed between
organisations. There is a serious risk—if this is not
inevitable—of information being lost and vital warning signs
being missed through this unnecessary divide, yet the Government have
failed to pilot it, and check what sort of delays might be caused and
how quickly information can be reliably passed
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075000085">The
Government have failed to provide any evidence for the benefits of this

<?notus-xml column=1029?>have written to the Secretary State this week to ask him to delay his
rushed timetable, which is risky, unreasonable and, they say,
“unrealistic”. Apparently, those managing the changes do
not “just believe” that everything is going to turn out
all right. By forcing through a timetable that his own Department has
deemed “aggressive”, the Secretary of State, who is
having a friendly chat with his colleagues rather than listening,
appears to be showing more concern for being a champion of

the Ministry of Justice’s capacity to ably procure and contract

procurement process was described as “shambolic” by the
Select Committee on Justice, and the Public Accounts Committee reported
that the Department was not an “intelligent customer”.
The Justice Committee also found that the Ministry’s naivety in
contracting was matched by its “indulgence towards
underperformance” after the contracts came into operation. In
the past two years, we have had: Jajo the rabbit signed up to be a
court interpreter; charges for tagging dead inmates; and a new
contracted prison in which it is easier to get drugs than soap. When is
the Secretary of State going to recognise the need to hit the brakes,
build skills and capacity in his Department, and improve on past

good voluntary sector organisations that do exactly that sort of work.

second huge advantage to what we are proposing is that we bring into

hon. and learned Friend the Member for Harborough (Sir Edward Garnier)
summed up the case for doing that passionately and well; we have
overlooked those people and we should not do so because it is not in
our interests to do so, as those are the offenders with the highest
rates of reoffending and it is very important that we deal with them.
It is also important that we deal effectively with support through the

additional cost. I suspect that had I gone to him as a Treasury
Minister—he was a very good one in his day—and said that
I wanted the probation trusts to do more and wanted the money to pay

ruined—unlike the wonderful celebrations we have had in the

Mills</B> (Amber Valley) (Con):</Member> I am grateful for the chance
to raise this important, if tragic, issue. I remember it well because
the murder of Rachael and Auden Slack took place shortly after the
general election, and I mentioned it in my maiden speech nearly three
and a half years ago. I am not sure that it is a great commendation for
our system that it has taken three and a half years to get to the
inquest, and to have the chance to try to learn some of the lessons
from the tragic death of three people.</hs_Para>

Auden Slack were murdered on 2 June 2010 by Rachael’s ex-partner
and the father of Auden. The gentleman concerned had been suffering
from mental health issues for quite a long time, and there had been
various reports about his behaviour to the police, local health
services and mental health trust social services. Sadly, however, not
enough action was taken, and on 2 June he stabbed his
ex-partner and child and took his own life with the same knife. It was
a truly awful incident, and probably one of the worst murder situations
we can imagine, especially as Rachael was pregnant at the time. We lost
three innocent lives because of what seemed to many people to be the
failure of various parts of the system to provide the protection,
prevention or indeed the health care needed, that could possibly have
prevented it from happening.</hs_Para>

for the debate tonight is that the inquest finally reported last week.
The verdicts for Rachael and Auden were that they were unlawfully
killed, and that, in part, their deaths were more than minimally
contributed to by a failure to impress upon Rachael that she was at
high risk of serious injury or homicide from her ex-partner. A further
verdict on Auden’s death was that the police had failed to
discuss with Rachael what steps could have been taken to address the
risks to
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075001142" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075001142">The
case is one of far too many around the country in which domestic
violence incidents are not taken as seriously as we might like, ending
with tragic results. This tragedy resulted in the death of two people

prevent anything like this from ever happening

is worth recounting some of the facts. As I have said, the police, the
mental health trust, the general practitioner and others had been
involved in the case. The facts in the week before the tragic incident
are as follows. On 26 May, Rachael took her ex-partner to a police
station after he refused to get out of her car. He was assessed by the
mental health team but released because they believed he was no threat.
Questions have been asked about whether those who did that assessment
were fully aware of his mental health history, which was known to the

words. I agree entirely that there seems to have been a long failure to
provide Andrew with the care he needed. We cannot be wise after the
event. None of us can say that people must have known the incident
would happen. However, perhaps they ought to have seen a pattern of
escalation of his condition—perhaps it gave off more warning

28 May, in that tragic week, two days after Andrew was arrested and
assessed, he phoned Rachael more than 20 times. He went round to see
her and forced her to take him and the child out. While they were out
at a park, he threatened to kill her and made various threats saying
that she did not realise how dangerous he could be. That was reported
to the police. Sadly, he was released on police bail with conditions
not to approach Rachael, but no further action was
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075001147" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075001147">A
neighbour reported further threats Andrew had made to take away Auden.
There was some concern that the police did not take action following
that report. At that point, the police concluded that Rachael was at
high risk. Unfortunately, there is no evidence that they told Rachael
how high their assessment of the risk was. That is what led to the
coroner’s
findings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075001148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075001148">On
the day of the tragic incident, Mr Cairns visited his GP, who reported
that Mr Cairns was anxious and agitated. Mr Cairns remarked to the GP
that, “The next few days will be the most important of your
career.” By the time Mr Cairns left the GP, he had apparently
calmed down and was rational, but, clearly, even on the day, he had
made a cry for help that sadly was not heeded. I am sure that, if any
of the police, the mental health team, the GP or anybody else had
thought that the tragedy would happen later that day, they would have
taken action to prevent it. The question we need to ask is: what more
could have been done to assess the risk properly and see whether there
was a realistic risk of such a tragic event? No hon. Member wants

Mills:</Member></B> I am grateful to my hon. Friend for her
intervention and I entirely agree. One of the issues is ensuring that
the police have the specialist knowledge and training to be able to
handle domestic violence cases. The right answer has to be more
specialist police officers, but because there are so many reports of
domestic abuse, which police all over the county have to handle
urgently, I am not sure that it is possible always to send out a
specialist domestic violence officer to each of those incidents. It is
perhaps a question of ensuring better training in general for police
officers and then 
<?notus-xml column=1042?>making sure that cases that look to be serious receive specialist
follow-up as soon as possible to ensure that signs of escalating
behaviour or real risk have not been missed by a perhaps less trained
person. In general, I agree with my hon. Friend’s
suggestion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075001151" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075001151">The
coroner last week suggested that he would make some recommendations to
the Home Office, and I am not sure whether the Minister has received
those yet. One of those suggestions was for some kind of electronic
document that would summarise the important details in the
investigation that would be available to all the police officers
involved in the case. Outside agencies might also have some input, such
as the mental health teams, social services, the local health teams or
anyone else deemed relevant. It is key to ensure the full and complete
sharing of information between the various teams involved. If everyone
who had ever dealt with this case had known the full history of the
complaints by Rachael and Mr Cairns’s mental health issues, it
might have shown the pattern of escalating behaviour. He might have
been viewed as a much higher risk than was initially thought by most of
the people involved.</hs_Para>

suggestion is that perhaps we could strengthen police bail conditions
or introduce greater sanctions if they are breached. There is a
question about what can be done by court bail and what can be done by
the police, but it cannot inspire public confidence if someone is
released on police bail with a condition that he cannot approach
someone, but very little action appears to be taken if he approaches
her soon after being given that bail condition.</hs_Para>

campaign, supported by 38 Degrees—not an organisation
Conservative Members are always fans of—suggests a
full public inquiry into how the whole system deals with domestic
violence issues. The Independent Police Complaints Commission is
carrying out a review, but as various police forces around
the country have received strong criticism from the IPCC on how they
have handled domestic violence cases in recent years, perhaps we need
to go a step further than an IPCC review. A full public inquiry could
look at all the agencies involved rather than just focusing on the
police, which is not where all the issues lie. Perhaps the Minister
could tell me whether the Government are inclined to have a public
inquiry on an issue as important as this. The
statistics suggest that two or three women a week are killed in
domestic violence incidents, and that is an awful situation for a
country such as ours still to be
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075001154" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075001154">It
is not for us to reinvestigate this case. Reports are still required
from the police and various other agencies, but my purpose today is to
raise with the Home Office both the tragedy of this case and the points
at which greater action could have been taken to protect
Rachael—perhaps to give her greater security, or regrettably to
advise her to flee her home to ensure that she was not at immediate
risk—or to address Mr Cairns’s health needs, perhaps
including sectioning him or giving him more intensive treatment than he
was able to get. Is it fair that Rachael was never recorded as Mr
Cairns’s carer so she never really got any information or
support for the help that she was trying to give her ex-partner for his
mental health condition?</hs_Para>

discussed this with Derbyshire police over the past three years, I am
aware that they have reviewed their processes and have tried to make
improvements. 
<?notus-xml column=1043?>There are outstanding reports that may require further consideration,
but they now have initiatives to work more closely with social services
from the same base and to try to improve links with the mental health
team. Perhaps the Minister can talk about initiatives he may have seen
elsewhere that could be rolled out as best practice around the country.
The closer the working relationships, the more immediate the contact
and the sharing of information, all of which might make a positive
outcome more likely. We all talk about greater partnership working and
sharing, but people work in silos and if there are not robust processes
and good personal working relationships, trying to bridge three trusts
or public bodies with different demands on their time is not always
very effective. The question is: how can we improve and create best

is tempting to think that Parliament could wave a magic wand, pass a
new Bill or give new powers to stop this type of incident happening. I
am not convinced that we have missed anything. The police have never
said to me, “If only we had had this power we could have stopped
it.” However, if the Minister has any suggestions about extra
powers that the police need or could have used in this case that they
were not aware of—I am not saying that that is the
case—that would be helpful to the family. There is a feeling
among the family, friends and the community that something went

again stress my condolences to the family and friends of Rachael and
Auden for their tragic loss. I wish that the inquest had reported
several months or years earlier. It is a pity that we have had to wait
three and a half years before being able to have a public assessment to
start to learn the lessons in the public domain. I urge the Minister to
do whatever he can to make the inquest system much faster. I struggle
to see why we have to put people through three and a half years of
waiting before they can get the closure they need. I hope the Minister
can provide some assurance that the Government take this issue very
seriously—I know they do—and that we can expect further
progress to ensure that this kind of thing can never happen

want to begin by offering my condolences to the family of Rachael Slack

circumstances of Rachael and Auden’s deaths are tragic, and were
eloquently outlined by my hon. Friend. The sad loss of such individuals
is doubly distressing, because it is now clear from the
coroner’s findings that their deaths could have been prevented.
Such a case deserves our attention and we must ensure that lessons are
learned, but we must do more than that: we must ensure that those
lessons are acted on. I have noted with concern the findings of the
coroner in this case, Richard Hunter, which were released on 22
October. I understand that he will be writing to the Home Secretary in
due course. I would like to thank him for his thoroughness and

was concerned to read that police failings “more than

have the utmost respect for the police and the vital work they do with
professionalism and integrity day in, day out. However, it is alarming
that in this case officers appear to have assessed Rachael as being in
danger and yet failed to pass that message on to her—the one
person who really needed to know. The Independent Police Complaints
Commission is currently assessing all the evidence in this case
following the inquest. It will then make a decision on the next steps.
This case follows other reports from the IPCC that have flagged up
police failings, such as the cases of Maria Stubbings, Clare Wood and
Susan McGoldrick. I would like to reassure Parliament that I take such
cases extremely seriously; such failings cannot be allowed to happen

Rachael and Auden’s deaths in 2010, the Government have
supported a series of reforms to the handling of domestic violence by
the police. All police forces have measures in place to ensure officers
have the knowledge and skills to deal effectively with cases of
domestic violence. Specific training on domestic violence and abuse is
included in the national police training curriculum. This training was
updated this year to take account of the Government’s
introduction of a new definition of domestic abuse. The new definition
helps to prevent the escalation of abuse, which can end in tragedy, by
dispelling the belief that domestic abuse begins and ends with
violence. It places coercive control at the centre of determining
whether abuse is taking place.</hs_Para>

significantly, since
April<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:45:12"></hs_TimeCode> 2011 the
Government has placed homicide reviews on a statutory footing. Now
every local report into a domestic homicide is reviewed and quality
assured by a panel of independent and Home Office experts. A community
safety partnership in Derbyshire is among those to have completed a
domestic homicide review that has been quality assured by the
independent panel. Each review has resulted in a tailored action plan
that must be delivered by the area in question to make sure we learn
from these individual tragedies. I am also happy to confirm that the
Home Office will be issuing a document collating the lessons learned

hon. Friend asked about specialist teams. Of course, that is a matter
for each individual police force to decide, but it is
important—indeed essential—that police who attend
domestic violence cases have the right training. The Home Office is
working closely with the College of Policing to ensure that this
occurs. The Home Secretary has also announced a force-wide review by

of suspected domestic abuse, it is right that children’s
services are engaged, if there are children present. Sometimes, if
there is domestic abuse of a partner, there can also be domestic abuse
against children. It does not always follow, but sometimes it does, and

local domestic and sexual violence support services. Facilities funded

advisers, who help victims of domestic violence get their voices heard,

sure my hon. Friend will join me in congratulating Derbyshire county

Derbyshire domestic abuse helpline, to those at risk of domestic abuse.

we can, should and will do more nationally to reach out to those caught
in cycles of abuse. That is why the Home Office has piloted two new
initiatives designed to empower victims and stop domestic abuse in its
tracks. This comes to the point my hon. Friend made about what more can
be done. The first of these pilots is named after another young victim,
Clare Wood, who was tragically murdered by her former partner in
Salford in 2009. Known as Clare’s law, the domestic violence
disclosure scheme is a system where anyone can seek disclosure of a
partner’s violent past. Those with the legal right to know are
provided with information that could well save lives, empowering them
to make an informed choice about their
futures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103075001172" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/debtext/131030-0004.htm#13103075001172">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:50:00"></hs_TimeCode>
second pilot scheme creates a new process to protect victims in the
immediate aftermath of domestic abuse. Domestic violence protection
orders have the power to prevent a perpetrator of domestic abuse from
having contact with the victim for up to 28 days. This offers both the
victim and the perpetrator the chance to reflect on the incident. In
the case of the victim, it provides an opportunity to determine the
best course of 
<?notus-xml column=1046?>action to end a cycle of abuse, as well as providing immediate relief
and protection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:49:53"></hs_TimeCode>.

is no room for complacency, however. It is because of cases such as
Rachael’s that the Home Secretary has commissioned HMIC to
review police handling of domestic violence and abuse. The inspection
is under way and I look forward to receiving the findings, probably in
April. We will review the recommendations with care, and ensure that
they are acted on as we strive for further improvements in this

the reduction in domestic violence referrals to the Crown Prosecution
Service by the police at the end of last year. The Home Office has held
a round-table with the Director of Public Prosecutions and national

James Clappison</B> (Hertsmere) (Con):</Member> Mr Owen, it is a
pleasure to have you chairing the debate on a subject that is important
to many families up and down the country. Some 2 million people in the
UK are living with or beyond cancer, and that figure is set to rise
to 4 million by 2030. Although it is a cause for celebration
that more people than ever survive after a diagnosis of cancer, a
significant challenge must arise in ensuring that their clinical and
human needs are met and that patients have the best possible
experience.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000009">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T09:31:04"></hs_TimeCode>
turning to the nature of the challenge and the points I wish to raise,
I pay tribute to all those who work in and support the many charities
and voluntary organisations that address the challenge posed by cancer.
There are many such organisations, but, with utter respect to all those
involved in the field, I shall mention just a few: Macmillan Cancer
Support, Cancer Research UK, Breakthrough Breast Cancer, Marie Curie
Cancer Care, Breast Cancer Care, Beating Bowel Cancer, the Roy Castle
Lung Cancer Foundation and the Teenage Cancer Trust. There are many
others. They all do fantastic work and much to improve patient
experience and give hope to many of our constituents.</hs_Para>

Government have set great store by patient experience and all the
issues that naturally interest cancer patients. I warmly welcome my

cancer patient the opportunity to be a research patient if he or she so
wishes; that must interest many people in that position.</hs_Para>

leads the world in recruiting cancer patients to take part in research.
One in five cancer patients in the UK takes part in some form of
research, which compares with 3% of people in a similar position in the
United States. I pay tribute to the research  of Cancer
Research UK in that regard. Last year, 36,000 patients took
part in its trials in this country.</hs_Para>

welcome the fact that NHS England has said that it plans to continue
the important national cancer patient experience survey. The results of
the 2012-13 survey showed that there is room for improvement in some
areas of care. I make that point not as a criticism of the NHS, but to
highlight areas where there is room for improvement. Macmillan Cancer
Support highlighted some such areas in particular, and has urged
Ministers to take notice of and act on them. I urge Ministers to listen
to the representations being made to them by Macmillan Cancer Support
and others.</hs_Para>

national cancer patient experience survey highlighted several important
issues, and I will mention three. The first is care planning and
information. The most recent 
<?notus-xml column=262?>cancer patient experience survey reveals that before starting treatment,
45% of patients were not fully informed about the side effects that
could affect them in future, that 78% were not offered a written
assessment and care plan, and that 41% were not given enough support
from health and social services after leaving hospital. As a result,
not all patients felt that their families were given all the
information needed to help care for them at home. That is clearly an
area where there is room for
improvement<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T09:34:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

next issue is financial support. Cancer patients and their families
obviously need financial support, just as everybody else does. Although
significant progress has been made since the first cancer patient
survey in 2010, almost half of patients who would have liked

Friend on securing this hugely important debate. He mentioned the
importance of financial advice and support, but does he agree that
service design is also important? I came across a case of one
constituent, David Wilson, who, while undergoing chemotherapy, received
270 different pieces of paper from our city council in just one
month—August this year. It is vital that we design services so
that Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, local councils and the
Department for Work and Pensions work together to make life for
patients easier and simpler and to ensure that they understand the
financial

Clappison:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes an excellent point that I
am sure the Minister will want to address. The last thing that somebody
coping with the treatments and everything else wants is to be bombarded
with different pieces of information and requests from central or local
government bodies, which could do something much more coherent and easy
to understand if they streamlined their services.</hs_Para>

would like to address relational care, which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T09:36:37"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Upper Bann (David Simpson) raised in his intervention. It covers
matters such as communication, trust in nurses and being treated with
respect, all of which are important for cancer patients. There is still
room for improvement, according to the findings of the most recent
survey. For example, 42% of respondents 
<?notus-xml column=263?>said that not all doctors and nurses asked what name patients preferred
to be called by, which can be important to older people. It is a
question of finding the right amount of kindness. Our
clinicians—nurses and doctors—are marvellous, but that
did emerge from the patient survey. Kindness can make a great
difference to people in that situation.</hs_Para>

Cancer Support’s report showed that patient experience across
the NHS is still not regarded as having equal importance as clinical
effectiveness and patient safety. The Government’s decision to
make patient experience one of the five domains against which the
health service will be held to account should be warmly welcomed. It is
clear, however, that a lot of effort needs to be put into the
institutional framework to reinforce that priority.</hs_Para>

mandate and outcomes framework needs a stronger focus on improving
relational care. Hospital boards need to take a lead on prioritising
patient care; a recent survey showed that its importance to different
hospital boards varies considerably, which is clearly wrong, because
all hospital boards should take it seriously. Commissioners of cancer
services have a vital role to play, as does the chief inspector of
hospitals. All such bodies need to reinforce the need for relational

put a point to the Minister on behalf of Macmillan Cancer Support: I
hope that the Government will deal with the matters we have discussed
and put patient experience at the heart of the inspection process being
put in place for our health service. One way of doing that is to use
the results of the cancer patient experience survey to inform ratings
at a cancer team and service level and to monitor and assess providers
of care—for example, as part of the foundation trust assessment
process.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103051000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000026">In the light
of all that, I have four specific questions for the Minister, on behalf
of Macmillan Cancer Support and other charities. First, will the
Government consider making relational care a priority area in the
refreshed 2014-15 mandate to NHS England? Secondly, will the Government
support the use of cancer patient experience data in the inspection
regime of the Care Quality Commission, which is led by the chief
inspector of hospitals?</hs_Para>

the Government work with commissioners and providers to ensure that the
results of the national cancer experience survey continue to drive
improvements in cancer care? Fourthly, and specifically on breast
cancer, can the national cancer patient experience
survey  
<?notus-xml column=264?>include a question asking whether the respondent has secondary breast
cancer? The Breast Cancer Campaign specifically asks to have that
included.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000028" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000028">More
generally, I welcome the Government’s ambitious plans to improve
cancer care in the United Kingdom, including those they set out in
January 2011 in “Improving Outcomes: A Strategy for
Cancer”, which promised action on a number of important fronts,
such as diagnosing symptomatic cancer earlier; helping people live
healthier lives to reduce the incidence of preventable cancers;
screening more people; introducing new screening programmes, as
recommended by the National Screening Committee; and ensuring that all
patients have access to the best possible treatment, care and
support.</hs_Para>

measures should save at least an additional 50,000 lives every year by
2014-15. Many of us will be aware of the efforts being put into those
different fields, to encourage people to come forward for screening, to
make screening available, to make members of the public more aware of
symptoms and to encourage people to lead healthier lives. That has been
much more evident than it had been hitherto. In the light of all that,
it would be good to hear from the Minister what progress has been made
on the ambitions that the Government set out in January 2011.</hs_Para>

what progress has been made in tackling inappropriate regional
variations in cancer outcomes? Many advances have been made in cancer
treatment in the UK, of course, but historically there has been a
disparity on cancer survival rates between the UK and other comparable
western nations. That has been the case for many years, under
Governments of all parties, but it was underlined most recently by a
2009 Eurocare study, which revealed a disparity between UK cancer
survival rates and those achieved in countries with the best
outcomes.</hs_Para>

16th in the survey for both men and women. Wales was ranked just in

analysis was a little old, because it was based on patients diagnosed
between 1995 and 1999, although that had to be the case to detect
survival rates. More recent surveys have also seen the same pattern,
such as one comparing the USA with the United Kingdom. With older
patients, there is an even more marked gap between the UK and other
comparable nations and economies. I have seen figures from the
<I>British Journal of Cancer </I>that show that for women over 70 with
breast cancer, the three-year survival rate in the UK is 79%, but in

sure he would agree that there is a lot of ground to make up. The
important point is that we

rates as a result of advances in medical science; we should judge
ourselves by how well we use those advances compared with other

Minister will agree that that is good news, but I look forward to
hearing from her that the Government’s ambition is to close the
performance gap between ourselves and other countries and that the gap
is being
closed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000037">In
closing, I should like to pay the utmost respect to doctors, nurses and
all clinicians working in the field. We owe them a great debt of
gratitude and my comments are no reflection on them. We are all hugely
indebted to their work and I am sure that many of our constituents
would echo that sentiment. I am just drawing attention to how the
system has operated in this country over a number of years, and the
experience of the patients within it. I hope that the Minister can tell
me that the Government have ambitious plans for improving the cancer
patient experience and that there is evidence that those plans are on
the road to
fulfilment.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_30_PT_1/70D91C4A829180EABFC71184692BEEDBFCB33E6C" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="30 October 2013">Wednesday

cancer patient experience, but we will all have personal experience of
the issues. I congratulate the hon. Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison)
on tabling the subject for debate. In his introduction he rightly said
that the debate refers to the NHS in the UK, and there are four
Northern Ireland MPs here because each of us can contribute to the
debate by relating our experiences. I hope that the Minister will
consider a strategy that involves not just the mainland, but all four
regions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000039">As
I was saying to my hon. Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David
Simpson) earlier today, when I first considered my contribution to the

me who have had cancer, and I have never experienced so many people
passing away as a result  of it.</hs_Para>

Poots, and I intend to have a public meeting in my constituency to
review cancer care with the general public and the trust and look at
how best we can do it. My frustration is compounded by discussions with
the trust. I do not want to be critical, because that is not how I do
things—I try to see how we can move forward and be more
positive—but I am concerned about the magnitude of cancer cases
in my area and across the United Kingdom.

employed in my Newtownards office, my parliamentary aide had two
grandparents die from cancer and her father suffers from cancer, my

my office manager seems to have escaped cancer in their immediate

we look into the community, we can see that my examples provide an
accurate reflection of the way that cancer affects entire communities.
Someone in the United Kingdom is diagnosed with cancer every two
minutes. More than one in three people in the UK will develop some form
of cancer during their lifetime, which is a horrifying statistic. The
risk of developing cancer before 50 is 1 in 35 for men and 1 in 20 for
women, so the situation is more extreme for

Friend moves on to discuss carers, which is an important matter, does
he agree that a big issue is people’s reluctance and sometimes
failure, in particular among us males, to visit the GP when there may
be a problem? We should encourage everybody, but males in particular. I
do not understand the logic. If my television does not work, I get a TV
repair man in. If the washing machine does not work, I get the washing
machine repair man in. If people have a health problem, they go to
their GP. Unfortunately, however, males seem reluctant to do
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000045"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13103051000137" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000137">Jim
Shannon:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that contribution. The
males of the species do tend to wait just that wee bit longer. I will
not relate my personal case to Westminster Hall, but we do sometimes
leave things a little longer than we should, which is perhaps a
failing on our part. The Health Minister and his Department in Northern
Ireland have run several campaigns to highlight prostate cancer in
particular. It may be that MPs know more people, but I have two close
friends who were diagnosed with cancer. Thankfully, in both cases, they
acknowledged early that something was wrong and went to their doctors
and were then referred for health checks. I am happy to say that the
treatment that they are now receiving will save their lives, but if the
diagnoses had been made a couple of months later, I suspect that it may
have been different. My hon. Friend is absolutely right. Entire
families and communities are affected by this cancer pandemic. The
House must deliver an effective strategy to help those experiencing the
scourge of cancer.</hs_Para>

great interest the Macmillan report and the hon. Member for Hertsmere
outlined the many cancer organisations and societies that do tremendous
work. Macmillan’s document, “Improving care for people
with cancer: Putting cancer patient experience at the heart of the

yesterday from carers and people involved with Macmillan how important
that is. The report references England and Wales only, but the overall

recently met Edwin Poots, the Minister of Health, Social Services and
Public Safety in Northern Ireland, regarding the provision of cancer
carers in my area, as it is clear that changes that could really make a
difference cannot be implemented due to a lack of funding, which is
part of the problem, and the lack of a strategy for the increases in
demand over the next 10, 20 or 30 years. Looking at the Ulster hospital
in particular—I am not going to be critical of the staff, who
are tremendous and can never be paid enough for what they do—I
can see greater demand and that needs to be taken on board. I ask the
Minister to consider holding discussions with those in the regions, in
particular with the Northern Ireland Assembly and Edwin Poots, because
we need a strategy that takes into account the whole of the United
Kingdom and not just the mainland. We can work together. Experiences,
interests, qualifications and knowledge may differ across the UK, but

adults. I have met some young carers and am aware of young sons and

may ask how the cancer experience can ever be positive, but although
going through cancer will always be horrific, the care that is given

address that problem today. Cancer is no respecter of persons, but that
does not mean that cancer treatment precludes the sufferer receiving
the utmost respect and dignity through treatments that may be
undignified in their essence.squeeze-col2 We have all lost
a little dignity while in the doctor’s surgery and the manner of
the doctor or nurse often determines how embarrassed we become. If we
are treated gently and with care rather than being pushed through the
process as quickly as possible to get the next patient seen, we may
feel better as a result. That does not always happen and I can
certainly appreciate the pressure that doctors and nurses are under to
do the procedures, tick the red-tape boxes and bring down waiting
lists. However, the fact that we are not dealing with lists but with
people must never be far from our
minds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000054">Again,
I stress that I am not placing the blame on the providers of care, but
something must be done to address the fact that, on average, only 56%
of cancer patients in England said that doctors and nurses asked them
by what name they wanted to be called, which was an issue highlighted
by the hon. Member for Hertsmere. A little bit of consideration and
allowing the patient to maintain their dignity does not take a whole
lot of effort. It may seem trivial, but this is a serious point: a girl
called Betty works in my office and were I to call her
“Beatrice”, she would get upset and would tell me.
Similarly, should I refer to the other lady in my office as Mrs Cotter
when she is actually Mrs Armstrong-Cotter, she would immediately put me
in my place. I use those examples because it is important that a caring
bond is formed with cancer patients. A wee bit of time, consideration,
humility and dignity can really make a difference. The same can be said
on a greater scale when people are doing intimate things to patients
while always reminding them that patients do not know them. That is a
small thing that the Macmillan report highlighted that could make a
patient feel that much more comfortable and indeed that much more
safe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000055">The
carers at the Macmillan reception also described some things that they
thought should be happening in hospitals. They outlined the need for
someone to be available to hospitals across all regions. The six people
we met yesterday were all from different parts of the United Kingdom
and all had different stories to tell. It seems that some trusts are
responding well, but others are not. We need a universal response that
encompasses all areas. The Macmillan representatives also suggested
that someone should also be available to provide advice on benefits and
on care and just to give
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000056">Another
point that came out of yesterday’s discussion was about respite
care. Some of the ladies we met were single carers—in other
words, a wife looking after a husband, with no sons, daughters or other
family members close at hand. We also need to consider the issue of
respite care and how we can help such carers get a wee bit of time for
themselves.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103051000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000057"><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13103051000140" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000140"><B>Mark

my opinion, the ethos of a hospital is reflected in how patients are

meetings, but that only 5% of such items led to further action: boards
noted the patient experience, but did not deem it important enough to

absolutely endless reports on matters prioritised as categories 1, 2 or
3: something in category 1 needed immediate attention, something in
category 2 needed attention in a reasonable time, and something in
category 3 needed attention just at some stage. It is safe to say that
many of the category 3 priority cases remained the same and did not
change from year to year, because time never permitted for making those
changes, as something more urgent was always pressing. In other words,
there were always category 1 and 2 priorities and, unfortunately,
category 3 priorities sometimes sat on the

will not speak for long, because I am conscious that there will be
other speakers after me, but to give a little bit of the history, the

the UK. We tried to analyse why patients who reach the one-year point
in this country stood as much chance of getting to the five-year point
as in any other health system in Europe, while we fell down on getting
patients to the one-year point. That result tends to suggest that the

been diagnosed, but is very poor at diagnosing cancer in the first

very few magic keys in life that will unlock the door to a panoply of
unexpected treasures, but one exists for cancer—earlier

of bombarding local primary care trusts, as they then were, with lots

lights, with the emphasis on the one-year point, as a driver of change.
PCTs—now clinical commissioning groups—that were towards
the bottom of the table would, if their managers were worth their salt
and their large salaries, introduce local initiatives, peculiar to
their population: for example, whether theirs was an ageing population,
whether an adaptation was needed for an industrial illness, such as
mesothelioma, or whether there were black and minority ethnic
communities. Those local initiatives would drive up earlier diagnosis
to combat those poor one-year survival figures, because we all know
that late diagnosis makes for poor one-year survival figures and, in

disconnect. Setting the bigger picture strategy is well intentioned and
essential, but if we are really to improve patient experience, we need
to ensure that that national policy is followed through locally. At the
moment, that is not taking place, and if we do not put that right

experience. For example, all London trusts put action plans in place,
following the 2010 cancer patient experience survey, so we know that
that is effective. We do not need to reinvent the wheel on that one; we

I said, there is a lack of specialism, even in a hospital situation

ache that went on and on, without a particular issue.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:28:54"></hs_TimeCode>Other hon.

will cite some other figures, although I am aware of the time factor.
Some 33% of pancreatic cancer patients feel that they have been given
conflicting information, compared with 29% of all other cancer

important questions all or most of the time, compared with 9% of all

doctors and nurses when discussing treatment, compared with 30% of all
other cancer patients.</hs_Para>

I said, I am being totally partisan. The all-party group’s
experience and my experience personally is that, for some reason, this
country is way down the line on pancreatic cancer—despite it
being the fifth biggest cancer, in terms of the number of people who
die from it—when it comes to international comparisons for
improved outcomes. There are treatments, but far too often they are far

Members have talked about dignity and humiliation. I will be utterly
personal about the issue, because, in one sense, that is what has
driven me to get so involved. I remember my partner’s situation.
It was a case of finally going to hospital, being told that people
there would do some tests and then that they would carry out an
operation because they thought it was cancer. “What does that
mean?” We did not know.</hs_Para>

remember being sat in the hospital and my partner coming back, straight

it?” The doctor turned round and said, “Oh, it’s

That is the kind of situation that happens. Where is the understanding?

finish with two particular demands, or requests, for the Minister. The
all-party group wants consideration to be given to an awareness
campaign, particularly about pancreatic cancer. I add my praise for the
involvement of Macmillan and Pancreatic Cancer UK, which is the charity
that backs up the all-party group and continues to support us, in terms
of the campaign on awareness.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103051000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000114">Macmillan has
been piloting decision tools to help GPs assess the risk of cancer,
including pancreatic cancer, and make decisions about further
referrals. We would like to see those properly evaluated with
consideration given to a full roll-out of the pilots that Macmillan has
been spearheading so fantastically.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103051000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000115">We have also
been trying to raise awareness that pancreatic cancer is not an old
man’s disease, in crude terms. The risk increases with age, but
35% of all diagnoses of pancreatic cancer occur in people under the age
of 65—that is about 3,000 of the 8,500 diagnosed each year. The
split among men and women is reasonably even, with slightly more cases
in women than in men. I am not sure that that is clear, so that would
be part of what we would request in a campaign. It would lead to
greater awareness and, hopefully, earlier referrals and better
outcomes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103051000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103051000116"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:33:20"></hs_TimeCode>My
final request relates to the national cancer patient experience data.
Pancreatic Cancer UK paid for a separation of data for pancreatic
cancer patients—in fact, the Department of Health paid for that
to be done once. We would like pancreatic cancer patients to be
routinely separated out from all upper-gastrointestinal cancer patients
as part of the system of getting such statistics. I do not see why a
charity or the Department should try to do that as an extra thing. It
should be part and parcel of the routine, given the nature and impact
of this dreadful, increasingly misunderstood
cancer.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_30_PT_1/B748042117713DC4A5D98350325C78199139A71F" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="30 October 2013">Wednesday

know that a good experience makes all patients feel as though they have
been supported and respected as individuals, whereas a bad experience
can make them feel, at best, as though their needs do not matter and,
at worst, that their basic human dignity has been denied. Cancer
patients whom I speak to, such as those at the local Macmillan Cancer
Support group, which I recently joined in my constituency, constantly
emphasise their experience of care and how they are treated by NHS
staff as absolutely critical at such a frightening time in their lives.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:35:49"></hs_TimeCode>However, the
importance of the patient experience goes far beyond the personal value
to individuals.</hs_Para> 
<?notus-xml column=278?><hs_Para UID="13103052000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000005">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:30:00"></hs_TimeCode>
is now strong evidence that good patient experience is consistently and
positively associated with better health outcomes and safer and more
clinically effective care. A systematic review of 55 studies, which was
published in the <I>British Medical Journal</I><I><B> </B></I>last
year, found that good experience is linked to better outcomes for
individual patients—both the outcomes that patients themselves
report and objectively measured outcomes. It was also found that
patients who have a good experience are also more likely to stick to
their recommended treatments and medicines and to use preventive
services, such as screening, immunisation and healthy living
programmes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103052000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000006"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:36:34"></hs_TimeCode>The
third reason why patient experience is important is that there is
increasing evidence—from the US, if not from the UK—that
it is linked to getting better value for money. A good patient
experience, in the US at least, is associated with a reduced length of
stay in hospitals and fewer problems with patient
safety—so-called adverse patient events. Hospitals that achieve
good scores on patient experience also have higher staff retention
rates, which also contribute to lower costs through lower staff
turnover. Understanding the link between staff experience and patient
experience is absolutely essential in this debate. That is actually
common sense: when staff feel valued and respected, they are more
likely to treat patients in the same way.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103052000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:37:26"></hs_TimeCode>What
makes for a good experience for cancer patients? Macmillan Cancer
Support says that three issues are consistently highlighted. The first
is meaningful involvement in their care, not only for individual cancer
patients,  but for their families, too. The second is excellent
communication, so the patient’s diagnosis, treatment options,
risks and follow-up care are clearly and simply explained. The third is
properly co-ordinated care.
When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:37:56"></hs_TimeCode> people are
going through a desperately difficult time, the last thing that they
want to face is a battle between all the different services. They want
their hospital, primary and community services, social care and wider
help—such as financial information and welfare and benefits
advice—brought together in a seamless package that is built
around their needs and not the individual institutions. That kind of
whole person care is vital to all patients, not only those with cancer,
but if we can get it right for cancer patients, I think that we can get
it right for all patients, too.</hs_Para>

previous Government made huge strides in improving cancer care through
the work of the national cancer plan and the cancer networks. There is
still further to go, particularly with earlier diagnosis, but major
progress was made in starting to bring NHS care for cancer patients up
to the standards in other countries. The national cancer patient
experience survey, which was started under the previous Government, was
absolutely integral to that. The latest results, from August this year,
found that about 80% of cancer patients rate their care as good or
excellent.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:39:07"></hs_TimeCode>, there
are warning signs that problems are building in the system, which could
harm that progress.</hs_Para>

for vital cancer tests are getting longer. The number of people waiting
more than six weeks for diagnostic tests, including ultrasounds,
colonoscopies and gastroscopies, has increased by 65% between July 2010
and July 2013.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:39:05"></hs_TimeCode>
The cancer networks that were so important in improving the quality and
co-ordination of care have been abolished, with their work subsumed 
<?notus-xml column=279?>into generic clinical networks, and many staff say that that risks
losing their vital specialist and local expertise. We have seen a

hon. Members have talked about the persistent long-term variations in
the experience of cancer patients. The national cancer survey has
consistently shown worse outcomes for patients with rarer cancers, for
younger patients—an issue highlighted by the Teenage Cancer

is an issue particularly close to my heart as an MP for the very
diverse city of Leicester. There are also continuing problems with
ensuring that patients get the financial information and benefits

care.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000011">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:49:38"></hs_TimeCode>
am sure hon. Members saw the excellent report published earlier this
week by Macmillan Cancer Support, which found that 73% of people with
cancer would prefer to die at home but that less than a third are able
to do so. Therefore, some 36,000 cancer patients died in hospital when
they would have preferred to die at home. That is not only terrible for
cancer patients and their families at an awful and difficult time; it
does not deliver best value for taxpayers’ money either.
Research by the national end-of-life care programme suggests that there
are potential net savings of some £950 for every person who dies
in the community, rather than in a hospital, because of the reduced use
of hospital

the chief inspector of hospitals, Professor Sir Mike Richards, who is
the former national clinical director for cancer, but only two of the
150 indicators in the CQC’s new methodology currently address
patient experience. Again, 
<?notus-xml column=280?>those indicators are generic. What plans does the CQC have to ensure

will conclude on an important point relating to what
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:44:16"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Basildon and Billericay said. We must ensure that we address
patient experience locally and on the ground, not just nationally.
Although holding CCGs to account and the CQC’s monitoring of
hospitals are important, they essentially happen after the
event—after care has been delivered. We must ensure that patient
experience is at the heart of what all parts of the NHS and all staff
do day in, day out. I have two suggestions for how we can make that
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000017">First,
we have to transform the use of what I call real-time patient
feedback—not annual surveys or annual monitoring, but day in,
day out use of patient feedback. There are brilliant services such as
Patient Opinion, which allows patients to tell their story, positive or
negative, online, by phone or in writing. Hospitals, GPs and social
care providers that register with Patient Opinion can see what people
are saying about them on that same day. I know because I used the
service when I had to make an unfortunate visit to an urgent care
centre this time last
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:45:35"></hs_TimeCode>. Patient
Opinion is a powerful tool for individual patients to tell their story,
for members of the public to see what others are saying about their
service and for staff to hear first-hand, immediately what they can do
to improve the quality of care. What plans do the Government have to
encourage greater use of such services across the NHS and social
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:46:01"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000018">Secondly,
the education and training of NHS staff is important. Last week, I
visited the university of Worcester, which is doing pioneering work.
Patients and users help to interview student nurses who apply for the
course to ensure that they have the right values and attitude. Patients
and users help to develop the curriculum used to train student nurses
and other health professionals to ensure that it covers the issues that
really matter to patients. Patients and users are also an integral part
of the course, and they help with the training
process<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T10:46:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000019">In
Leicester, we also have a groundbreaking project between De Montfort
university and Macmillan Cancer Support in which students training to
be nurses, NHS managers or pharmacists volunteer for Macmillan. Those
students get vital skills and experience of communicating with cancer
patients. How will the Government ensure that such work to improve the
skills, knowledge, experience and training of staff starts when they
begin working for health services? What vital work is being done to

drive a good patient experience, we must listen to patients’
voices. In December 2010, the Government published the first national
cancer patient experience survey report. The survey was the first
cancer patient survey to take place for six years, the first to involve
patients with all types of cancer and the first national survey
explicitly to use the word “cancer”. The survey revealed
that, while there had been substantial improvements in the patient
experience since 2000, there are still unacceptable variations in the
quality of care people receive, as hon. Members have

drive improvement locally, reports were produced for individual trusts.
This is where the transparency agenda the Government set such store by
is really important. The data are openly available and published, and
all of us—not just people in the NHS, but hon. Members, local

providers to account, based on that openly published data at
local trust level. Commissioners and providers can be directly
challenged and incentivised to improve. Providers can benchmark their
performance against each other’s. Quality Health, which provided
the survey, also visits poor-performing trusts to discuss their results
in detail. A number of those discussions have led to really quick
improvements in local outcomes, but there is always more to
do.</hs_Para>

priority is important. That includes communication, trusting nurses and
all the

references in the mandate, we have included important pledges in the

Munt</B> (Wells) (LD):</Member> I am concerned that this debate may
herald the end of the British breakfast as we know it. Following a
consultation, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
has ordered a reduction in the permitted sugar level for jams, jellies
and marmalades from 60% to 50%, and the removal of the UK national
limit for reduced-sugar jam and of the national provisions for curds
and mincemeat.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T11:01:02"></hs_TimeCode> focus of my

permitted sugar levels from 60% to 50% would in time destroy the
characteristic quality of British jams, jellies and marmalades, and
could mislead consumers. We all know what we expect when we go to the
supermarket: something of beautiful quality with beautiful colour, with
a shelf life of about a year. Traditional jams use cooked fruit,
without additives—that is important: the quality of those
preserves is determined by the proportions of sugar, fruit, pectin and
acid. If the total sugar percentage is reduced, the characteristic gel
in the consistency of jams, jellies and marmalades will be lost, and
the result will be a homogenised, spreadable sludge, bearing no
resemblance to the product we know and enjoy in England as British
jam<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T11:01:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000052">Scientists
who worked at Long Ashton agricultural research station at the
university of Bristol in the 1920s examined the shelf life of jam and
other, similar products. The recommendation that they made was for a
minimum sugar content of 60%, regardless of the type of fruit used in
the recipe. That ensured a good shelf life of at least a year. The 60%
level has its origin not in Brussels, as many people think, but in
Bristol.</hs_Para>

are greatly interested. Sometimes, Departments want to slide
regulations through, and those things do not always hit the public. We

new regulations are part of the Government’s red tape challenge
to reduce the regulatory burden on industry—particularly on
small and medium-sized businesses. They revise the Jam and Similar
Products (England) Regulations 2003, which I regard as completely
adequate. Those regulations state that the percentage of soluble solids
content for jams, jellies and marmalades must be 60% unless the product
is one with reduced sugar, when it has a permitted percentage of
between 25% and 50%.</hs_Para>

encouragement to make more reduced sugar products, as they might be
perceived as more healthy. Some jam manufacturers have urged caution
with the percentage. The Department’s impact assessment document
for the new regulations cited a potential for increasing the risk of
spoilage. Currently, reduced-sugar products, with a percentage of 25%
to 50%, may contain chemical additives to ensure that they have a good
shelf life, which sugar will give naturally. Potassium sorbate or E202
will be added if we reduce the level of sugar  in
jam<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T11:05:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000059">At
a time when public attention is being directed to the content of food,
it seems inadvisable to encourage the unnecessary production of food
items with additives and artificial flavours. With a 60% sugar content,
the colours of sweet preserves are bright and the fruit is fantastic. A
lower percentage produces products with a darker, muddier colour, which
may affect consumer confidence in a well known British product. In
addition, if the consistency lacks the characteristic gel, and is more
like that of a fruit spread or fruit butter, consumer confidence in the
properties of jam and other products may be lost. I urge the Minister
to consider calling things fruit spread or fruit butter, as happens on
the continent.</hs_Para>

whole egg or egg yolks—or both—and fruit. The 2003

come from a family involved in fruit farming. The jam industry is
itself important, but having it as an outlet, a market, for the fruit
industry is also important. One of the things that I learned, to my
cost, while trying to grow strawberries is that a lot of things can go
wrong in the fruit industry, whether bad weather, bruising of fruit or
pallets of fruit tipping over, so having the jam industry market for
some of the damaged fruit is very
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T11:15:51"></hs_TimeCode>. I

provide the context, the proposed changes to the regulations are part
of DEFRA’s contribution to the Government’s red tape

identified under the food and hospitality theme that could benefit from
improvement and where potential savings could be delivered to
businesses. The jam regulations were identified as an area in which we
could consider changes that might provide businesses with greater
flexibility and less restrictive

impetus behind the change was a request by some in the industry for the
UK to consider taking up an optional derogation in the EU jam directive
that permits—but, crucially, does not require—a sugar
level lower than 60% to be set, which is something that a number of
other member states have already done. The derogation allows member
states to set a lower minimum sugar level for jam and similar
products.</hs_Para>

for a minimum permitted sugar level of 55%, others have requested that
we consider lowering the minimum permitted level even further, to 50%,

the necessary clearances. The reduction in the minimum permitted sugar

is in charge of making the jams. She said that there has been a trend
among consumers over the past 10 to 15 years to seek out products with
lower sugar levels. They want products with more fruit and less sugar.

pointed out that the 60:40 sugar-to-fruit ratio was recommended
following research at the Long Ashton research station in Bristol in
the 1920s. That was a long time ago and since then there have been
technical advances and recipe experimentation. In the last few years,
our market has included fruit spreads and jam with a sugar level of
less than 60% with no increased spoilage reported. The reduction of the
minimum requirement to 50% removes the current gap for products that
fall into the 50% to 59% category. The flexibility delivered by the
change will help to ensure that British jam manufacturers remain
competitive because they will have the option to market their jam
products with a higher fruit content on a level playing field with
other member

sugar level that they can market in Europe will be able to do so, and

lower sugar content will have an inferior product and if customers
conclude that, as she suggested, they taste like mud, they will not buy
it again. The market for that product will be small. In a free market

of its high pectin content and do not need quite as much sugar. My hon.
Friend said that the market for such products is small, but an internet
search showed quite a number of products using Bramley apples as part
of a mixed jam, such as Bramley and blackcurrant and Bramley and
blackberry. There are exciting prospects for them, and there is nothing
more British than the Bramley apply. We are almost unique in Europe in
having specialist culinary apples rather than just generic apples. This

regulations will be improved in respect of reduced-sugar jams. Since
2006, when new regulations on nutrition and health claims were
introduced, there has been an overlap with the 2003 regulations that
specify that a reduced-sugar jam must have a sugar content of between
25% and 50%. In contrast, the nutrition and health claims rules require
all products labelled “reduced sugar” to have at least a
30% energy reduction compared with a standard product. To sort out this
discrepancy, we are doing away with the specific rules for
reduced-sugar jams so that they will need to comply only with the same

consulted on the proposed changes earlier in 2013 and received some
useful contributions. One option that provoked strong opinions was in
response to whether the UK’s national provisions for fruit curds
and mincemeat—the sort in mince pies—were still useful or
whether they could be removed. I can reassure my hon. Friend, who
highlighted many concerns, that although she may not agree with our
proposals to reduce the minimum sugar content of jam, we have acted on
the evidence put to the Department and we will not change the
regulations on fruit curds or
mincemeat.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000102">The
main justifications cited were that curd and mincemeat standards help
to maintain the production of these uniquely British products whose
origins are firmly established and go back centuries. They are not part
of other member states’ culinary culture and UK producers
manufacture them to traditional recipes. The current rules reflect
those
practices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103052000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0001.htm#13103052000103">The
standards provide an important yardstick and their removal could result
in a reduction in quality and could stimulate the introduction of
products that are materially different from our current traditional
curds and mincemeat products. So, as a direct result of the cogent
arguments put forward in the consultation process, 
<?notus-xml column=293?>including a response from my hon. Friend’s constituent, Mrs
Lloyd, we will retain unchanged the national provisions for fruit curds

Individual jam manufacturers who pride themselves on their brand and
who passionately believe that jam must have 60% sugar to be good will
be able to market their product as a niche, specialist product. If
there is no market for products with less than 60% sugar, it will not
develop. It is for the industry voluntarily to come together if they
want to and jointly market traditional jams. I welcome this important

June this year, at the request of a number of my constituents, I
attended a reception, here in Parliament, for the “Safe and
Sound” campaign run by Guide Dogs. It was there that I was
alerted to the dangers faced by blind and partially sighted people from
silent electric cars.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T14:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>The development
of electric and hybrid vehicles is very much welcome across the
country; they reduce the cost to motorists who buy them, and they are
important for our greener environment. I have to say, parochially, that
their success is particularly important to the economy of my region,
the north-east, where Nissan in Sunderland has invested more than
£400 million in the development of the Leaf electric vehicle. In
addition, the Government have pledged more than £800 million in
subsidies for the ultra-low emission market.</hs_Para>

the downside to such vehicles is that they are so quiet that they pose
a danger to members of the public, and particularly the elderly, the
blind and the partially sighted, all of whom rely on hearing sound to
judge when it is safe to cross the road. Guide Dogs “Silent but
Deadly” report, which is an excellent report that I am sure
everyone here today has read, states:</hs_Para>

We must remember that being able to hear a vehicle also allows road
users to judge the direction and speed of nearby traffic, which are
crucial factors in deciding when it is safe to cross the road. For all
pedestrians, 80% of our perception to danger is from our
hearing.</hs_Para>

that every one of us in the House have had the opportunity to do a walk
with the Guide Dogs association, where we put on a blindfold 
<?notus-xml column=295?>and do a 2-mile walk through a very busy town. If ever an illustration
was needed of how dangerous it is for a blind person, and how
vulnerable they are, that is one way in which the message is brought
home very quickly. Does she feel that when it comes to electric cars,
there is an onus on the Government—perhaps the Minister will
address this point today—to have some sort of method of warning
people, whatever that may be? I am not an expert, but blind people and
vulnerable people need to be protected on roads and on

Strangford (Jim Shannon) is right, and the tenet of our debate today is
to ask the Government to do more. I have to confess that I have not yet
done a walk around with a blindfold on, but I know people who have, and
I do not think that any of us here who are blessed to have our sight
can imagine what it is like or what the dangers are until we have
experienced what people with poor sight or no sight have to
experience.</hs_Para>

by the TAS Partnership that was published only last month shows that
electric and hybrid vehicles were involved in 25% more collisions,
causing injury to pedestrians, between 2010 and 2012, than conventional
vehicles. Moreover, between 2005 and 2008, crashes involving quiet
vehicles trebled. In 2011, research for the Department for Transport
found that electric and hybrid vehicles were far more difficult to
detect than internal combustion engine vehicles at the lowest steady
speed and, when pulling away from rest, at the lowest speed. EU
research has shown that 93% of blind and partially sighted people have
experienced difficulties with electric vehicles.</hs_Para>

those figures are very concerning. The fact that people have been
injured in accidents with these vehicles is frightening enough, but as
Guide Dogs has pointed out, loss of confidence is also a massive
problem for blind and partially sighted people, and a bad experience,
as already described, could ultimately lead to someone not wanting to
leave their home, and therefore losing their independence. Many blind
and partially sighted people are easily discouraged from independent
mobility if any element of their journey is adversely impacted by
outside factors. Guide Dogs estimates that about 180,000 blind and
partially sighted people never leave home alone.</hs_Para>

premiums will be higher. That would be an incentive for makers of these

been in contact with it, has been researching and working with
cognitive and acoustic psychologists to produce a practical system that
is safe and environmentally friendly. Many technical issues need to be

It seems to me that now is the time to be taking action, before we have
the very rapid rise in the number of these vehicles, which I gleefully
anticipate. We have only to look at how fearful our elderly residents
are of people on bicycles riding around, especially when they are on

saying, “Why don’t cyclists use their bells?”

it has spurred on people such as me and, I am sure, other MPs to bring
up this issue. Again, it is a timely issue, and I hope that the
Minister will be able to send us away today feeling that he has

round and tells them via touch that it is safe to cross if they cannot

distractions of playing in the street do not need to be stressed, and

growth of electric vehicles is good for not only our economy, but our

visited my local Guide Dogs branch, as well as the Kent Association for

electric vehicles. It is important, though, that we remember other
pedestrians in this debate. I do a lot locally and nationally on the
issues that affect elderly people. We have to recognise that they face
particular challenges when they try to cross the road or stay connected
within their local community. We welcome the growth of these silent
vehicles—the electric cars—but some of them are
frightening our elderly population, especially those in the early
stages of dementia, who perhaps do not understand some of the
technological changes. We always need to be aware of the issues that
face them.</hs_Para>

various challenges, and the issue of electric vehicles was rightly
raised with me. Other issues were also raised, such as how difficult it
can be to get from A to B, even with a guide dog, or just with a stick.

makes the other senses more acute and it shows how much we rely on

the commands the user gives. The problems that she has mentioned became

members of the public are ignorant as to what the guide dog is there
for. The same lady from the previous story told me about how she had
got on a bus and asked the driver whether it was the one to Chatham.
The bus driver said, “Can’t your dog tell you
that?”, as if the dog could somehow read the number of the bus
and communicate that in human language to the blind person. These are
important issues about electric vehicles, but the debate also gives us
the opportunity to discuss the many challenges that partially sighted

face.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103054000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103054000070">I

still and smile at the camera. It was a pleasure to meet them, and I am

do not want to isolate people further from their communities. People
with a physical or learning disability already face social isolation,

Dogs is therefore right to raise concerns, and it is a good time to
look at this issue, as it is still developing. What has happened is a
classic example of the law of unintended consequences. For
environmental reasons, we all want to see the greater take-up of these
vehicles, but we now find that they may pose a serious danger for the
blind or partially sighted. Guide Dogs cites a statistic showing that
quiet hybrid and electric vehicles are 25% more likely than
conventional vehicles to be involved in a collision with a pedestrian
because pedestrians might not hear them coming. Although the debate is
about the blind and partially sighted, other groups—particularly
the elderly, youngsters and cyclists—are also

pedestrian crossings have no audible signals. In the centre of London,
people would cross the road only at a pedestrian crossing—at
least if they had any sense—and most crossings have audible
signals. In relatively quiet areas—in small villages or towns
such as those in my constituency—there may not even be a

streets. At that point, the organisation was concerned by moves in many
areas to remove defined kerbs and to allow the intermingling of
vehicles and pedestrians, the idea being that each would be more aware
of the other and take more care. As part of that campaign, Guide Dogs
took me to a shared street, put a very effective blindfold on me and
asked me to cross the street. The only thing that would give any
indication of the presence of a vehicle was noise. It was a terrifying
experience, although I knew it was temporary, and I could take off my
blindfold at the end. There were also people there to make sure no one

Japan, it has been investigated by a UN commission. That is an
eminently sensible precaution, and if it is implemented now, it will
ensure that the vast majority of these vehicles are fitted with devices

and  
<?notus-xml column=306?>others that we have not been slow in the past in insisting on safety
precautions for those in vehicles. Seat belts are the perfect example,
and air bags are another example. Both add to a vehicle’s cost,
but they have been introduced because of the need to ensure the safety
of people in vehicles. Is it not right, when we develop new vehicles,
that we also look at the safety of people crossing the road when these
vehicles are about, given that the large section of the population with
disabilities may not be able to hear them coming? It seems a small
price to pay to ensure that those fellow citizens are safe when they
cross the road. Will the Minister seriously consider how to ensure that
not only those who travel in a car, but other people on the roads, can
be

certain disability rights arrangements, such as putting ramps in at
village halls. People who used wheelchairs, or who were severely
disabled, went on being hoiked up steps in a profoundly undignified
way. That was wrong, and we would never want to go back to those days.
When we speak of rights and independence for people who are blind or
visually impaired, or who fall into any of the many categories
mentioned by colleagues in the debate, we should recognise that it is
not possible to be a little bit equal. We need to give serious

must be quite common for people to be pushed out into the road, as has
been mentioned this afternoon. I have had many complaints about it. A
traffic flow system has been installed, but it changes when the stadium

cane or go out with a guide dog, must cope with such
complications—pedestrians and cyclists on the pavement, a

they become mainstream and not afterwards, when there has been an

accidents at low speeds—cannot be heard until they are just one
second away from impact with a pedestrian. Recent research from the TAS

from other countries has already shown that quiet vehicles pose real
dangers to vulnerable road users, and that has led to action in Japan

Surely, there is now enough evidence to support other European Union
member states and some British MEPs who are saying that now is the time
to do something. We have opportunities to act in the negotiations next
week and the discussions on 
<?notus-xml column=311?>the regulation on 5 December. The UK Government should not hold back or
delay that process or wait for proof, the form of which is not clear;
they should be at the forefront of promoting road safety and standing

certainly the case that in towns, there are often pedestrian light
controlled crossings or traffic lights with crossings at them, which
make it much easier for blind and partially sighted people. He also
referred to the concept of shared space, which a number of towns in the
Netherlands have developed. A few tentative approaches have been made
in this country as well. He said that, for a person with limited
vision, it was a terrifying experience going on to a shared space area.
However, in general, the evidence is that towns with such areas are
safer than the ones with conventional traffic and pedestrian
segregation. He also made the point that we introduced seatbelts to
make the car safer, but there was very clear and real evidence that
safety belts did improve safety.</hs_Para>

why they offer a once-in-a-generation opportunity to support our growth
ambitions and environmental commitments. Last month, we published an
ultra-low emission vehicle strategy, “Driving the future

leading market for such vehicles, with UK industry at the forefront of
their design, development and manufacture. That included a commitment
to launch a call for evidence later this year to help shape our 
<?notus-xml column=315?>package of support and to inform us on how best to utilise an additional
£500 million of funding, which we are making available between

2012 labour force survey, low pay is more prevalent in the private

of low pay at 47%, 35%, and 26% respectively. That compares with a low
pay rate of only 15% in local
government.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103054000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103054000166">Although
the tax credit system cushioned living standards between 2003 and 2008,

sector that pay or use procurement rules with the voluntary and private
sectors to extend a living wage to more and more people. The Government
should at last support the recognised living wage accreditation scheme,
which would be a splendid way to mark national living wage week next

Nokes</B> (Romsey and Southampton North) (Con):</Member> As ever, Mr
Hood, it is a pleasure to serve under your chairmanship. I particularly
thank Mr Speaker for granting this important debate on a subject that,
had it not been brought to my attention by a constituent, I would not
have believed possible outside the scripts of comedy or perhaps, more
appropriately on the day before Hallowe’en, a horror film.
However, the occurrence is possibly far more widespread than is known
about, and my constituent fears that it is the modem equivalent of
body-snatching by unscrupulous undertakers who, keen to ensure that
they are subsequently contracted by bereaved families to organise
funerals, take unlawful control of a body.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000003">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:01:34"></hs_TimeCode>
situation, which the funeral industry states is rare, and the hospital
concerned states arose under unusual circumstances, is none the less
one raised by my constituent amidst fears that it was in fact a
deliberate attempt to exploit bereaved families in the immediate
aftermath of a death, enabled to do so by a legal grey area and poorly
drafted Department of Health guidelines. As a result of my
constituent’s case, and after acquainting myself with the
guidelines on how bodies are dealt with, I decided to seek this debate
to raise two issues. The matter is clearly of limited interest to
colleagues, but I welcome the opportunity to make my points direct to
the Minister, and I look forward to his
response.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000004">First,
the existing legislation needs clarification. There is a definite need
for guidelines for hospitals and hospice staff to be revised, so that
they comply with the existing law, and prevent staff from being exposed
to unwarranted prosecution based on the technicalities of existing
legal grey areas. Secondly, and probably more importantly, I
want to highlight a culture of complicity between undertakers and
hospital staff, and potentially deliberate unscrupulous practices
deployed by undertakers, who get away with them not in spite of
Department of Health guidelines but, worryingly, because of
them.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000005">A further
point worth raising is Bristol royal infirmary’s failure in its
duty of care towards the deceased and her family. On Saturday 23 March
this year, Gladys Pugh, the mother-in-law of my constituent, Mr Peter
Williams, sadly died in Bristol royal infirmary. Her body was taken to
the hospital’s mortuary to await the coroner’s permission
for it to be released. The following Tuesday, Mr Williams and his wife
began the painful task of contacting undertakers to ask for quotes and
to discuss possible funeral arrangements. Three funeral directors were
contacted. Mr and Mrs Williams planned to travel to Bristol to register
the death and to visit the funeral directors they had contacted, but
with the long Easter weekend so close, they could not make the journey
until 2 April. The family contacted all the undertakers they had spoken
to and informed them they would come back to them if they were
interested in taking matters further after the Easter break.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000006">On 2 or 3 of
April, one of the undertakers, Thomas Davis, part of Bristol Funeral
Directors group and a member of all the relevant trade organisations,
including the National Association of Funeral Directors, contacted Mr
Williams and asked what was happening about the arrangements. Mr
Williams informed them clearly that 
<?notus-xml column=325?>they had decided to engage the services of another undertaker, thanked
them for their interest, and left it at that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000007">It then
transpired that without the permission of the Williams family and
without any form of verbal or written contract, Thomas Davis had driven
to the hospital’s mortuary on 27 March, the day it was contacted
by Mr Williams, and removed Mrs Pugh’s body to one of
its own facilities. The situation came to light 10 days after Mrs
Pugh’s body had been taken from the mortuary when the company
subsequently appointed by my constituent contacted the mortuary to
arrange collection of Mrs Pugh’s body, only to be told that it
had been taken away some 10 days
previously.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000008" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000008">There
was an understandable feeling of horror, shock and disbelief that Mrs
Pugh’s body had been kidnapped by an undertaker whose sole
instruction was to offer a quote, which incidentally was never
forthcoming, and to inquire about available dates for cremation. I use
the word “kidnapped” after considerable thought.
First, I cannot use the word “stolen” as a dead
body is not technically the property of anyone except the deceased.
That is one of the grey areas that legal experts agree needs
clarification. Secondly, as kidnapping is the removal of a person
without their consent, and as a dead person is still considered a
person in law but is unable to give such consent—and, as
“stolen” would not be legally
correct—“kidnapped” is the only suitable word that
I can use to describe what happened.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000009"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:49:53"></hs_TimeCode>I
argue that Thomas Davis acted unlawfully, because all that had been
requested by the Williams family was for a quote to be provided for the
services, and for provisional inquiries to be made with a local
crematorium. There was no contract, no formal quote, and at no time
were the family informed that the body had been collected. Furthermore,
at no time was any of the paperwork required under Department of Health
hospital guidelines for the release of Mrs Pugh’s body handed
over by the family to Thomas Davis.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000010">It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:50:22"></hs_TimeCode>
is that point—the lack of consent given by the Williams
family—that makes the removal of the body unlawful. That is
where the first issue arises. Ignoring the motivation for a moment, how
can an undertaker take possession of a body from a hospital lawfully?
The answer—for it to be lawful, the person in control of the
body must be enabled by law, by dint of their status in the life of the
deceased or through being appointed the agent of such a person. In the
case of Mr Williams’ mother-in-law, the undertakers had not been
given the legal right to take control of the body by the family and
were therefore not in legal possession of
it.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:50:59"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000011">What<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:59:34"></hs_TimeCode>
checks were made by the mortuary staff to ascertain the lawful right of
the undertakers to take responsibility for the body? None, it would
appear. It seems that the law is at the same time both very clear and
utterly confusing on that point, and furthermore, contradicts the
Government’s own guidelines. I hope that my hon. Friend the
Minister will bear with me while I try to explain that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000012"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:51:21"></hs_TimeCode>Although
NHS trusts have very strict guidelines on releasing bodies, largely
based on the Department of Health’s publication, “Care
and Respect in Death: Good Practice Guidance for NHS Mortuary
Staff”, and usually stipulate that the person collecting the
body must be in possession of the relevant paperwork, often including
“the green form”—an interim death certificate
releasing 
<?notus-xml column=326?>the body for disposal—those guidelines are, I am told, probably
of no legal effect. In the case of Bristol royal infirmary, its own
release note, which Mr Williams was told would be essential for the
release of the body, is also possibly not worth the paper it is printed
on.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000013">That is
because case law dating back to 1841 states that once a person has
died, unless the medical staff or the coroner order an autopsy, the
deceased person’s body becomes the responsibility of—but
not the property of—in the following order: the executor of the
will; the next of kin; or, in the absence of the above two, a person or
persons intending to pay for and arrange the funeral. Failing that, the
local authority must take control. There are, therefore, a limited
group of people to whom lawful control of a body can be given, which
can also include their appointed representatives.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:52:48"></hs_TimeCode> is the bit
of the law that is absolutely crystal clear.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000014">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:52:40"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:52:47"></hs_TimeCode>,
what follows is much more confusing.
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:52:37"></hs_TimeCode> where
guidelines stipulate which forms must be presented before a body can be
released—such as Bristol royal infirmary’s own release
form—in fact, once someone who can lawfully take responsibility
for a body demands to be allowed to do so, the hospital is apparently
powerless to prevent the release of the body, irrespective of trust or
Department guidelines, and irrespective of what paperwork the person or
persons may or, in this case, may not have.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000015">That is a
very important, albeit technical, point, which I wish the Minister to
take note of, because if a hospital employee, following the appropriate
guidelines, refuses to release the body to someone who can lawfully
take control of it, honestly believing that he or she is doing the
right thing, that employee can technically open themselves up to
prosecution for preventing a burial or cremation—even if that
was never the intention and even if they were simply seeking to
establish whether the person taking responsibility was legally entitled
to do so.</hs_Para>

be overlooked.</hs_Para>

Nokes:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that intervention.
He is, of course, exactly correct on that point. It is a time of great
grief and distress to families, and they are often not in a position
either to know what the legal technicalities are or to ensure that they
are properly implemented. I will come on to his specific points very
shortly.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000018"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:54:24"></hs_TimeCode>According
to some legal experts, this grey area has arisen from a number of test
cases—including one in 1974—that have apparently
established that a person claiming lawful control does not need to
provide any paperwork at all to justify their claim over a body.
Furthermore, and of great concern, not only are there no stipulations
in law regarding what paperwork must be presented, or what conditions
met, irrespective of guidelines, it is apparently illegal to demand
that anyone seeking lawful control of a body do anything to justify
their claim. In other words, unless my understanding is incorrect, not
only are trust guidelines of no legal effect, 
<?notus-xml column=327?>but they can actually put the staff seeking to implement them at a
technical risk of prosecution—something that I know will be of
concern to my hon. Friend the Minister.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000019">The first
issue, therefore, that I would like my hon. Friend the Minister to
consider is clearing up the discrepancy between the guidelines that
NHS, hospice and care home staff are given and the technical exposure
to prosecution that they face if they seek to abide by them.
Furthermore, perhaps the law can also, at the same time, be clarified
to state what rights the next of kin have over a body, which is
something that it does not clearly do at the moment, because, as I said
earlier, the body is not technically considered to be the property of
anyone.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000020"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:55:32"></hs_TimeCode>I
turn to the second point that has been highlighted by my constituents.
The right of lawful control does not pass to undertakers unless
they have been properly contracted and bestowed with the right to take
the body. Furthermore, departmental guidelines clearly state that that
right must be demonstrated by the production of the relevant paperwork.
What we have to ask, therefore, is how did this situation arise and how
widespread is the practice?</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000021"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:56:00"></hs_TimeCode>In
accordance with Department of Health guidelines, Bristol royal
infirmary operates a system where a body will not be released without
staff being presented with one of its own release
notes—something that my constituent was very clearly told.
However, in this case, no such release note was presented, because the
undertaker was never given it. How, then, did the body come to be given
to the undertaker? In answer to that, I again draw the attention of my
hon. Friend the Minister to his Department’s guidelines, which,
like the law, can at best be described as vague.</hs_Para>

example, while the guidelines state that a body must be released to
“the correct recipient”, they do not say who that is. The
guidelines also say that “standard operating procedures”
should be known by all staff through training, and be robustly audited.
They clearly state:</hs_Para>

if that was a legal requirement, which it seems it may not be, in this
case there were clearly no checks of the paperwork because none can
have been presented.

the advice is that hospitals need good working relationships with local
undertakers. It seems that that advice has been taken far too literally
in this case at least, and I fear elsewhere, with the establishment of
a very cosy relationship between undertaker and hospital—a
relationship where it is deemed that things can be taken on trust, and
contrary to guidelines, no checks are required as to the legal right of
the undertaker to take control of the body. That is not a good working
relationship with clear lines of communication; it is an abuse of
trust.</hs_Para>

what is clear in this case is that Bristol royal infirmary and the
undertakers did not act in accordance with the Department’s
guidelines and were, in fact, acting like some modern-day Burke and
Hare operation. What is abundantly clear is that Bristol royal
infirmary’s response to Mr Williams is inadequate. Although some
changes to policy have been implemented, those are changes that my
constituent calls “minimal”, and there is no guarantee
that it will not happen again. As my constituent noted in a letter to
the hospital’s chief executive, Mr Woolley:</hs_Para>

my constituent is unhappy with the response that he has received from
the hospital would be an understatement. He is desperate to see the
changes required to prevent other families experiencing the kidnapping

has raised with the hospital have simply been ignored, with the
hospital blaming a member of staff for not following
procedures.</hs_Para>

Williams asks two perfectly reasonable questions in his complaint to
the hospital. Those questions are, as yet, unanswered. First, why did
Thomas Davis arrive at the hospital without the paperwork that the
hospital itself says is essential for a body to be released? Secondly,
why was the body released without that paperwork? Mr Williams
is worried that the answer to both those questions is this: because the
undertaker assumed that he would not need the paperwork—an
assumption based on past experience of acting in a similar manner. That
begs the obvious question: how many other bodies have been taken in
that way? It appears that the hospital will not accept responsibility
for its failure in its duty of care towards the Williams family,
seeming to want to blame individual hospital employees and the funeral
industry.</hs_Para>

we await with interest the decision on that complaint, but there is no

hope that, in his response, the Minister will touch on both aspects of
this sorry tale: the lack of legal clarity, rights and protection that
both relatives and NHS staff have; and measures designed to prevent
undertakers from seeing distressed and grieving families as

kidnap the body by relying on the cosy relationship that they might

that his experience is merely the tip of the iceberg—a

issue has been highlighted, the Department will seriously consider
bringing clarity to what the legislation says and will offer protection
to NHS, hospice and care home employees and to grieving families,
protecting them from undertakers who should be there to offer a service
at the time of greatest need and ensuring that bereavement and grief

Minister of State, Department of Health (Norman Lamb):</Member></B> I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for Romsey and Southampton North
(Caroline Nokes) on securing the debate and raising an issue of extreme
sensitivity. I can imagine the enormous distress for the family
involved. As the intervention suggested, at a moment of grieving, no
family would want to have to cope with this situation. Let me be very
clear that the practice that my hon. Friend describes, whether it is a
one-off or more widespread, is completely unacceptable. That message
has to be disseminated to the entire system, because respect for
families who have suffered a bereavement and respect for the deceased
person are of paramount importance. I am therefore very grateful to my
hon. Friend for raising this subject and enabling me to respond. I am
grateful also to her constituent, Mr Williams, for raising
the issue with her so that it could be exposed in
Parliament.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000034">Each
year, more than 500,000 people die in England and Wales, with local
mortuary and bereavement services working hard to ensure that during
the period of grief, the bereaved are supported and due regard is given
to their individual needs. I think that in the vast majority of cases,
that happens and people are treated with the respect that they
deserve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000035"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:03:21"></hs_TimeCode>The
current guidance, entitled “When a Patient Dies: Advice on
Developing Bereavement Services in the NHS”, which was published

relatives in decisions about care after death, but does not set out

me now deal with the legal context. A dead body is a possible source of
infection, so society requires that the law balances the need to give
regard to the respectful disposal of the dead with the need to ensure
the protection of public health. Hospitals have put in place procedures
to try to manage a number of competing demands and legal requirements
in a way that causes the least difficulty for the vast majority of
people and that allows coronial, health-and-safety and other
requirements to be
met<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:04:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000037">The
law does not recognise—my hon. Friend made this point—a
dead body as someone’s property, but it has been held in case
law that the executors, administrators or other persons charged by law
with the duty to dispose 
<?notus-xml column=330?>of the body have a right to its custody and
possession until it is disposed of. In straightforward cases, in which
the coroner is not involved, the duty to dispose of the body can rest
with a range of individuals or organisations, with an established order
of precedence. The executor of a will, not the next of kin, has the
primary claim to
possession<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:05:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000038">Generally,
when a person dies, an early priority for the family is to arrange the
final disposal of the person’s body. Lawful disposal may occur
once a registrar has received a satisfactory medical certificate of
cause of death and subsequently issued a certificate of disposal,
commonly known as the green form, or the coroner issues a certificate
of disposal where a death has been referred for a coroner’s
investigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:06:08"></hs_TimeCode>.
My hon. Friend has clearly done an enormous amount of research on this
subject. I am very impressed by the amount of knowledge that she has
acquired.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13103066000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000039">The person
with the authority to administer the estate of the deceased person has
the right to possess the body in order to arrange disposal of the
body— the funeral. The green form is one of the pieces
of documentation required to allow a funeral to proceed and is often
passed from the family to the funeral director. However, it is not a
legal requirement for an individual to produce a green form in order to
collect the body from the hospital. In practice, many hospitals appear
to treat the green form as the key documentation for body release. I
understand that hospitals do that to confirm that the death is not a
coroner’s case. Potentially, up until the green form is issued,
a registrar could refer a death to the coroner because new information
relating to the death has come to light and the registrar finds
themselves under a duty to report the death to the coroner.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:07:09"></hs_TimeCode> other reason
for some hospitals insisting on seeing the green form is,
understandably, for reassurance that the body is being released to the
right person. That is key to the case that my hon. Friend has raised
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:07:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000040">In
the context of about 500,000 deaths a year, my Department has had very
little representation to suggest that local hospital procedures for the
release of bodies are causing difficulties. I am interested in this. My
understanding is that the Department has not had many representations,
yet my hon. Friend’s assertion, which I take seriously, is that
the practice could be more widespread. We need to understand whether
that is the case. At the moment, there appears to be a
lack of evidence, but if she or anyone else is aware of more
evidence, we need to hear about it. This is a very important
matter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000041"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:08:06"></hs_TimeCode><Member ContinuationText="Caroline Nokes" PimsId="5614" UID="13103066000058" xid="1135" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000058"><B>Caroline

to the concern the
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:08:07"></hs_TimeCode>hon. Member for
Strangford (Jim Shannon) raised earlier, one issue my constituent
raised was that the practice occurs at a time of bereavement and
grieving, and consequently people are far less likely to complain,
because they wish to move on and get on with their lives and the
grieving process. That point is important, because we simply do not
know the extent of the problem. My constituent is concerned because his
mother-in-law’s body was released with no paperwork whatsoever,
so the practice could be far more widespread than we will ever know,
because it is
unreported<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:08:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Lamb:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention. I
appreciate that if such practices have occurred, families will in many
cases feel reluctant to 
<?notus-xml column=331?>raise a complaint. None the less, we need evidence, so if people are
aware of such activities, I encourage them to come forward.</hs_Para>

some areas, funeral directors had experienced delays in collecting
bodies from hospitals due to the documentation required by the
hospital, which relates to the problem my hon. Friend raises. A
national representative body of funeral directors reported its
members’ concerns to officials in my Department. Following the
concerns being raised with us, my Department re-circulated advice on
the release of bodies to the NHS in a 26 October 2012 edition of <I>The
Week</I> bulletin, to highlight to NHS trusts that having sight of the
green form was not a legal requirement for the release of bodies, that
holding bodies can cause unnecessary delays, and informing them of
proposals to consult on a draft body release form as part of the
consultation on death certification reforms. I want to reinforce the
point that a delay in the release of the body can also be distressing
for loved ones, who are going through bereavement. Ensuring that the
process works efficiently is incredibly important.</hs_Para>

hospitals have been using their own body release forms, which is the
impression I received from Bristol. The situation my hon. Friend
describes would not have happened if the hospital had followed its own
procedures. Such forms are used to facilitate release of the body, 
<?notus-xml column=332?>and that is potentially a way forward to resolve the problem. Officials
have worked with key partners, such as mortuary technicians,
bereavement services and funeral directors, to develop a draft body
release form designed to provide the NHS with reassurance about the
appropriateness of releasing a body, which they currently achieve via
the green form. My Department will seek views on the merit of such a
form, and the contribution of key groups, such as funeral directors
associations, will be vital. The consultation will make further
relevant proposals, and when it is published in due course, I will
welcome my hon. Friend’s
participation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103066000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/halltext/131030h0002.htm#13103066000045">My

release a body. It is important that we respond to all the points she
made, and I will ensure that we do so. I end by again thanking her for

the potentially severe environmental impact of the dumping or

economic benefits for member states. All member states welcomed the
potential of the proposals to improve compliance with the waste
shipments regulation. The UK and Bulgaria argued that further
consideration was required as the proposal risked failing to achieve
its objectives. Several member states agreed with the UK’s
concern that requiring the publication of detailed inspection plans
could be counterproductive. The UK argued that such detailed proposals
were contrary to the principle of subsidiarity. The UK would prefer an
obligation on member states and their authorities to plan effectively
for inspections, without being overly prescriptive. A number of member

UK.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13103050000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/wmstext/131030m0001.htm#13103050000027">Council

Luxembourg rail protocol is intended to facilitate the financing of
high-value railway rolling stock by seeking to ensure protection, for
example of a leasing company’s rights against defaulters by a
method of central registration, priority and common contractual terms.
One of the purposes of this is to reduce the costs of leasing contracts
for rolling stock. The rail protocol does this by providing an
international mechanism whereby financial interests in railway rolling
stock may be registered in a central database. Where an interest is
registered a rule of priority would operate in favour of that interest,
so protecting the investment where the operator of the rolling stock
defaults on his obligations. The financial interest is protected and
recoverable except when those financial interests rest in public
service rolling stock in 
<?notus-xml column=53?>respect of which an appropriate declaration has been made. Protecting an
investment in this way increases the confidence of leasing companies,
and could thereby lead to a reduction in costs for
industry.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13103050000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/wmstext/131030m0001.htm#13103050000037">The
proposal has been published with a legal base falling within title V of
part three of the treaty on the functioning of the European Union

title V (JHA) legal base would usually mean that there would be
universal acceptance that the UK’s JHA opt-in protocol applies
and that the UK would therefore be free to choose whether to
participate. However, the EU institutions do not accept that the JHA
opt-in protocol applies when the 
<?notus-xml column=54?>relevant JHA provisions fall in an area of exclusive external
competence—as is the case here. The Government believe that the
UK opt in under the protocol to title V of the treaty on the
functioning of the European Union applies and they have therefore
asserted their right to choose whether to opt in; they have decided it
is in the UK’s best interests to do
so.</hs_brev><hs_brev Justify="left" UID="13103050000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/wmstext/131030m0001.htm#13103050000038">The

an environmental nuisance over which local authorities have enforcement

those cases which have been put “on hold” can themselves
be progressed through the system or decided appropriately. The number

programme of trials to specifically tackle arrears, whether supporting
those who report they are unable to pay or those that are unwilling to
accept their responsibilities to pay for child maintenance. The trials
apply behaviour change principles and range from changing how the Child
Maintenance Service communicates with clients at points when payments
usually break-down, to sign-posting support to help clients better
manage essential household expenditure. These trials either aim to help
clients avoid missing payments, support clients who feel unable to pay
to make payments, or ensure that clients who are unwilling to pay are
compelled to make
payments.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103083000330" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/text/131030w0002.htm#13103083000330">Trialling

other Departments, however each Government Department has arrangements
in place to provide interpreters for people who are deaf, hard of
hearing or speech impaired and who need to use its services. The
Department for Work and Pensions has contracts in place with two
providers to supply a face to face British Sign Language (BSL)
interpreting service. Local arrangements with “off
contract” suppliers can be used where they meet the required
standards, offer value for money and/or where the customer has an
established or trusted relationship with the
interpreter.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103083000352" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/text/131030w0002.htm#13103083000352">BSL

are qualified to NVQ Levels 1 to 4 (or equivalent) in BSL and are
registered as a member with the National Register of Communication

equivalent registration with other organisations.</hs_Para>

Penning:</Member></B> The Government is currently developing a new
Employment Strategy for disabled people and those with health
conditions which will be published before the end of the year. The
strategy will recognise the crucial role that employers have to play in
enabling disabled people and people with health conditions to realise
their employment aspirations. It will seek to improve the support
available to all employers (including those taking advantage of the
Youth Contract) to recruit, retain and enable people with disabilities
and health conditions (including mental health conditions) to progress.
Changing attitudes and removing stigmas is central to this. We have
publicly signalled our commitment to the Time to Change (TTC)
initiative and are currently progressing the associated action plan
with relevant TTC
representatives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103083000443" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/text/131030w0002.htm#13103083000443">At
the Disability Employment Conference, on 18 July 2013, the then

what support is available. This campaign will include nine regional
events held across the United Kingdom at which employers are invited to
contribute and share good practice. The first event is in Birmingham on
21 November. The role of employers in promoting employment of disabled
people and breaking down stigma and barriers is central to the

automatic enrolment is based on establishing a pro-compliance culture.
In doing so they are focusing on educating and enabling employers of
all sizes to ensure they are aware of automatic enrolment and
understand what they have to do. Throughout the initial roll out of
automatic enrolment TPR has been assessing the impact of their
communications and updating their products to ensure they meet the
needs of the changing audience, from the UK's largest employers with
thousands of workers, through to those with a small work
force.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103083000446" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131030/text/131030w0002.htm#13103083000446">The
regulator sends out a series of letters and emails to employers from 12
months prior to their staging date. As their staging date approaches
each e-mail informs the employer what stage they should be at and also
signposts the relevant guidance and tools provided by the regulator.
The tools available on the regulator's website include, an interactive
planning tool to assist employers in getting ready, a staging date tool
to find out your staging date, and detailed guides. They have also
established a customer support centre for employers to discuss any
question they may have. An employer advertising campaign is underway to
