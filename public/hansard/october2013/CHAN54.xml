only now? The OFT did not recommend a cap on pension scheme charges. I

now, secondary schools have been judged by the proportion of their
pupils who are awarded five GCSEs at grade C or better, including in
English and maths. Schools currently improve their league table
position if pupils move over the C/D borderline. That gives schools a
huge incentive to focus excessively on the small number of pupils
around the five Cs borderline. In our view, that is unfair to pupils
with the potential to move from E grades to D grades or from B
grades to A grades. It is also, paradoxically, unfair to those
on the C/D borderline because it leads schools to teach to the test.
Ofqual, the Chairman of the Select Committee on Education and others
have warned about those adverse
incentives.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000199">Indeed,
all five of the maths organisations that responded to the consultation
said that the current approach harmed the teaching of mathematics. The
Association of Teachers of Mathematics
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1310143000963" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000963">“Teaching
to the test…results in superficial skills development which
means that students are ill prepared for adult
life”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="1310143000200" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000200">Furthermore,
as Chris Paterson at CentreForum has shown, the current accountability
framework discourages schools from focusing on the lowest-attaining
pupils. In a recently published book, “The Tail”, the
authors argue that the past 15 years have seen rises in average
attainment in our schools, but not in the attainment of those at the
bottom. International surveys such as the trends in international
mathematics and science study confirm that position.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:34:58"></hs_TimeCode> need a
secondary school accountability system that gives more attention to
pupils who are falling
behind.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000201" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000201">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:35:05"></hs_TimeCode>
current measure also permits many schools, particularly in affluent
areas, to coast. Those schools find it easy to hit targets based only
on five C grades. Although those schools may look successful, C grades
are not a measure of success if pupils are actually capable of
achieving far more. The accountability system must set challenging but
fair expectations for every school, whatever its
intake.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000202" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000202">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:35:32"></hs_TimeCode>
five A* to C grades measure also encourages schools to offer a narrow
curriculum. Mastery of just five subjects is not enough for most pupils
at age 16. Furthermore, the use of equivalent qualifications means that
some students have not been offered a rigorous academic curriculum,
which would have served them well. Until this year, a school could
offer English, maths and only one BTEC and still have the pupil count
as having achieved five Cs or better.</hs_Para>

believe that the system can do much better than that, so we will
require all schools to publish core information on their website in a
standard format. From now on, there will be four key measures that must
be published. The first is pupils’ progress across eight
subjects, so a parent will see whether pupils at a school 
<?notus-xml column=438?>typically achieve one grade higher than expected or
one grade lower. The second is the average grade that a pupil achieves
in those same best eight subjects. That will show, for example, that
pupils in a particular school average a high B grade or a low D grade
in their GCSEs. The third is the percentage of pupils achieving a
C grade in English and maths. The fourth is the proportion
of pupils gaining the EBacc, which will continue in its current form.
We will also look at developing a destination measure to show the
percentage of pupils in any school who move on to further study or
employment, including further
training.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000204">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:37:07"></hs_TimeCode>
are proposing an important change to how we measure underperformance,
and to our floor targets. Rather than the five A* to C GCSEs threshold
measure, we will use the new progress measure for the floor targets.
That will be much fairer, because it will take into account a
school’s intake. A pupil’s key stage 2 results, achieved
at the end of primary school, will be used to set a reasonable
expectation of what they should achieve at GCSE, and schools will get
credit when pupils outperform those expectations. A child who gets an A
when they were expected to get a B, or a D when they were expected to
get an E, will effectively score points for their school. That approach
will ensure that all pupils matter, and matter equally. It will be
fairer for schools and fairer for
pupils<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000205" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000205">Coasting
schools will no longer be let off the hook. Equally, head teachers will

progress and attainment will be assessed in eight subjects: English and
maths, three further EBacc subjects and three other high-value
qualifications. That final group can include further traditional
academic subjects such as art, music and drama, and vocational subjects
such as engineering and business. English and maths will be
double-weighted to reflect their importance. That will encourage
schools to offer all pupils a broad curriculum, but with a strong
academic
core<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:38:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000207" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000207">We
will define the new floor standard as progress half a grade lower than
reasonable expectations. So if pupils at a school are expected to
average a B in their eight subjects, the school will be below the floor
if they average less than four Bs and four Cs. At present, there are
195 schools below the existing floor standard. Using existing figures,
we estimate that about twice as many schools would be below the new
floor standard. However, as schools will adjust their curriculum offer
to the new framework, the actual number is likely to be significantly
lower.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000208" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000208">We
also want to recognise schools in which pupils make exceptional
progress. Therefore, a school in which pupils average a full grade
above reasonable expectations will not be inspected by Ofsted the
following year. This is the first time the accountability regime has
offered schools a carrot as well as a stick. Schools have planned their
current curriculum for years 10 and 11 on the basis of the existing
accountability system, so for that reason, the new system will begin in
2016 for students currently in year 9. We will, however, allow schools
to opt into the new system from 2015 if they
wish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310143000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0001.htm#1310143000209">The
Government response to the consultation also describes how we will
publish information we hold about secondary schools through a new data

young people to continue studying maths and English to 18? We also need
more detail about how the changes will impact on technical and

swings of the Secretary of State and his infamous friend Dominic
Cummings? Parents, pupils, teachers and head teachers are livid about
the latest knee-jerk announcement via the press, when pupils are
already preparing for exams and only days away from the deadline for
exam entry, that only first entry into GCSE can be counted in the
school accountability measure. If the badgers are moving the goalposts,
Ministers are changing the rules in the middle of the match. Will the

this change being implemented in such a way?</hs_Para>

this change to the accountability system make any real difference to

his free schools policy, that some will fail for those reasons. That is

Laws:</Member></B> We were concerned by what was happening in
increasing numbers in some schools before the announcement was made. I
draw the hon. Gentleman’s attention back to the massive
expansion in the last couple of years in the number of students doing
multiple GSCE entries—170,000 in summer 2013. Almost a quarter
of maths entries were multiple entries from students who had not
reached the end of key stage 4. Several bodies have expressed concern
that some of the youngsters might get a C when they could go on to get
a B, an A or an A*, and they are potentially being let down. It also
means that teaching in those subjects ends at a much earlier stage than
it should, with a year only of preparation in the subject rather than
the full two years. It is crucial that we have a school system that
acts in the best interests of the students, not simply of the
schools.</hs_Para>

me by a number of constituents. In September, pupils were told that
they would be entered for an exam in November. A few days later, as a
result of the Government’s announcement, schools had to
make the decision that that would not be right because of the
impact it would have on league tables. Would it not be better to
consider the impact on students—given the very high numbers

conference season; it was timed on the basis of the evidence available
to us. If schools believe that young people should be entered in
November, they are perfectly at liberty to do that—we have done
nothing to stop them. Indeed, if they are confident that students will
be able to secure their best grades at that time, they should put the
students in for the exam. If, however, the students will achieve only a

Pursuant to the point about key stage 2 raised by

the Member for Kingswood (Chris Skidmore), may we use this opportunity

at the age of 11 with a reading age of 7, and many of them are
condemned to fail at GCSE the moment they walk through the door of

accountability, we are significantly increasing the bar for what
success looks like at the end of primary school. We are doing that
because pupils at the end of primary school who achieve only the level
of attainment set as a measure of achievement by the previous
Government overwhelmingly go on to fail even the existing five good

Mr Speaker. I wonder whether you will indulge me with the benefit of
your extensive expertise in all things procedural in this Chamber. I
was pulled out of the shuffle for questions to the Deputy Prime
Minister tomorrow but have subsequently been notified by the Cabinet
Office that the DPM is refusing to answer my question on constitutional
reform. Can you offer me guidance as to how I may challenge that
decision, so that the Deputy Prime Minister is held accountable by
Members of this House?</hs_Para>

Speaker:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for his point
of order and for giving notice of his intention to raise it with me. I
simply say to him that it has always been for the Government to decide
which Minister is responsible for answering questions. I understand the
hon. Gentleman’s frustration, but as far as I can see 
<?notus-xml column=452?>from the material available to me nothing disorderly
has occurred. It is often the case that a question put to one Minister
can be judged, perfectly reasonably, to be more within the purview of
another. If such a judgment has been made, it is not for the Chair to
quibble with it. I do not seek to engage the hon. Gentleman further at
this time, so he should not spring to his feet and recite to me the
question he had posed. I think it is fair to record that in his
otherwise unexceptionable letter to me on the matter dated today he
does not say what the question was. I have at this stage to conclude
that the transfer, though from his vantage point frustrating, was, as I
say, not disorderly. But he is nothing if not a perspicacious terrier,
and I feel sure that he will use all his intellectual and political
resources to test the Deputy Prime Minister in another way on a
different occasion. We will leave it there, and I hope that the hon.

157647 and 157648. They were named day questions, which were meant to
be replied to on 5 June. They were actually replied to on 8
October. That is not the worst of it. I tabled another named day
question on 16 May to the same Minister, which was meant to have been
replied to on 21 May, and it has still not been replied to. The

late in red on the Order Paper, so that we all know quite how
often the Home Office is late. Or we could introduce a late answer
penalty of £100, taken off a Minister’s salary, for every

of those proposals will be reflected upon, but on a serious note, I do
say to Ministers that it is deeply unsatisfactory, and should be a
source of some shame to Ministers, including those who have overall
responsibility for conduct, when delays of this kind take place. Quite
apart from considerations of efficiency, it is simply rude. I know that
it is not something that the Chief Whip would ever want because he is
among the most courteous people in the House, but it really should be
gone. I say in fairness that when the Government Chief Whip was Leader
of the House he was always most solicitous in pursuing these matters
with Ministers, and I feel sure that the Leader of the House, who is
temporarily unavailable to us for a very short period, will, when he
returns, get on to the matter without delay. I know that if that does
not happen, the hon. Gentleman will be on to me again, so we must find

achieved a fair allocation of time among the many important issues the

concern about the programme motion relates to the section covering the

collection of new clauses and new schedules on matters other than dogs,
with a maximum of two hours available for debate. They include forced
marriage in Scotland, on which I will not claim to be an expert, court
fees and compensation, and a collection of policing and offences
issues, including several that I would like to raise about schedule 7
to the Terrorism Act 2000, which needs to be curtailed. There are a
range of other issues about drugs policy and a section on extradition.
For all that, we have available a maximum of two hours, which would be
limited even further in the event of any statements or urgent
questions. I can accept voting for this motion because I have not
tabled an amendment, and nor has anybody else, that would protect that
time. However, in the event of there 
<?notus-xml column=459?>being statements or other things that delayed
progress, will the Minister make sure that we have time to debate these

the important issue of dangerous dogs to forced marriage and major
issues of police reform, including a provision allowing foreigners to
become police chiefs. Also—I know this is an issue of huge
concern to some Government Members—it relates to the Terrorism
Act 2000 and extradition. If we are to have a serious debate about such
issues and ensure public confidence in us, we need more time than that
allotted by the programme

Although the House has had many debates on the subject of the European

debate the extensive Scott Baker report that the Home Secretary
commissioned, yet we are expected to have an informed opinion on
detailed new clauses that are effectively the Government’s

has tabled a significant number of amendments and new
clauses that I believe would strengthen the European arrest
warrant and protect the rights of the British citizen, while still
broadly supporting the principle of opting back into it. Those
amendments have drawn cross-party support, so it is regrettable that we
will probably not have the chance to address them because of
the order in which the groups of amendments will be taken tomorrow.
Whatever the reason behind that order, we need to discuss the issues of
temporary extradition, which sounds good but could be strengthened to
protect our constituents; of proportionality; and of whether we should
discuss the use of extradition as a last resort, not the first resort.
Its use as the first resort has plagued the lives of many citizens of
this country who have been wrongfully

more flexible and therefore more effective than previous orders. 
<?notus-xml column=475?>The new orders may be made to manage broader categories of risk,
allowing them to be used in particular to manage risk

the condition for the availability of the new sexual risk order is that
the defendant has done an act of a sexual nature as a result of which
it is necessary to protect the public. The previous
“non-conviction” order required that the person concerned
must have done at least two acts from a specified list of risky

me deal briefly with new clause 8, which adds murder committed overseas
to the list of offences that may form the basis for making a violent
offender order. These are civil preventative orders, which can be used
by the police to impose restrictions on offenders convicted of a
specified violent offence and who pose a risk of serious violent harm
to the public. They can prohibit their access to certain places,
premises, events or people to whom they pose the highest risk. Murder
was not originally one of the specified offences for application of a
violent offender order because an individual convicted of murder in the
UK is managed indefinitely as a result of his automatic life sentence.
Having identified this gap in the reach of a violent offender order,
this new clause is designed to close it. In addition, new clause 8 will
enable additions to be made to the list of specified offences through
secondary legislation, subject to the affirmative procedure. Offenders
and offending change over time, and it is right that the legislative
powers for managing such behaviour can also change, while retaining
appropriate parliamentary oversight.</hs_Para>

will be required for the purpose of protecting the public generally, or
any particular member of the public, from sexual harm. I understand
that the new clause removes the requirement for a risk of serious
sexual harm, which takes it down one level. The Opposition welcome
that. The court must be satisfied that the defendant’s behaviour

key theme of these new orders is that both are equally committed to

commit abuse. The global nature of sex crimes means that it is right
that we make it easier to prevent foreign travel by known paedophiles

are looking at the imposition of a civil order to protect children in
the UK. We also need, however, to examine the issue of people who have
not been convicted but pose a threat to children. I understand that the
changes proposed today will also make it easier to impose an order when
a criminal offence has not been committed. Such an example may be where
an individual has attempted grooming on the net, for example, by
impersonating a young person on social media, but has not actually, at
that stage, committed a crime. Will the Minister explain whether the
Government have any plans for introducing changes to legislation to
make the grooming of a child on the internet an offence? I understand

reason it is hard to impose a risk of sexual harm order is that such
orders demand a criminal standard of proof, even though they are civil
orders, and that difficulty may remain in respect of the future orders.
The demand for a criminal standard of proof was not actually in the
Sexual Offences Act and there was some confusion therefore about the
standard of proof required. The Home Office did issue guidance, which
suggested a civil standard of proof—the “reasonable
belief” approach. However, the courts tended to take a different

hon. Member for Mole Valley (Sir Paul Beresford) raises an important
issue in new clause 7. It is topical given that at the weekend W. H.
Smith had to withdraw information and e-books from its website. It has
taken too long to obtain acceptance of the fact that viewing child
abuse images is an integral part of the abuse process. Only the abusers
deny that now. We know that viewing abuse often triggers behaviours in
individuals. We know that Stuart Hazel and Mark Bridger had both been
viewing legal pornography simulating violent sex and abuse prior to
committing appalling crimes. The new clause, which deals with the
written form of that abuse, is worth looking at. I hope that the
Minister will comment further on that. We need to be careful, because

Blackwood</B> (Oxford West and Abingdon) (Con):</Member>
I thank the Minister and the shadow Minister for
their opening remarks. I will speak to new clause 5 and the Government
amendments relating to prevention orders. I think that by now
colleagues will be familiar with my reasons for tabling the new clause.
The vast majority of children in this country grow up free from fear,
but a vulnerable minority never know a safe or happy childhood. I will
never forget sitting in the Old Bailey and listening to truly harrowing
evidence of how a violent organised crime gang systematically groomed
girls on Oxford’s streets to sell them for sex from as young as
11, plying them with hard drugs to make them 
<?notus-xml column=482?>more compliant to being repeatedly raped by strangers and conditioning
them to believe that that was what real relationships were like. Too
many colleagues in this House have had the same experience as me, as
cases have emerged across the country. Every police force and local
authority needs to take positive and proactive preventive action to
root out this vile crime.</hs_Para>

of grooming behaviour are now much better understood. We should be
aiming to disrupt the process before it progresses to systematic sexual
abuse, because the consequences of failing to intervene are both well
documented and appallingly destructive. However, over the past few
years case after case has emerged in which child protection agencies in
possession of detailed intelligence have seemed unable to
intervene.</hs_Para>

our inquiry into child sexual exploitation, the Home Affairs Committee

conclusions are for another day, but even leading forces, such as
Lancashire police, who are proactive not only in innovative
investigative techniques, but in disrupting grooming behaviour using
methods such as abduction notices, licensing enforcement and dispersal
orders, found that a key tool—civil prevention
orders—just was not working. They have been on the statute book
since 2003, as we have heard, and should be at the forefront of the
fight against grooming, but instead they were found to be fundamentally
flawed by a 2012 review commissioned by the Association of Chief Police
Officers and written independently by Hugh Davies QC and a team of
experts.</hs_Para>

2003 our understanding of patterns of sex offending and disruption

to reflect that progress and resolve the flaws in the existing orders.
I welcome the fact that the Government have accepted the case for
reform and tabled amendments today. Put simply, the reformed orders
will protect more vulnerable children from sexual exploitation. That
could not be more urgent, because the Children’s Commissioner
estimated only this year that 16,500 children are at risk of sexual
exploitation, but the prevention orders are still failing to protect
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101425000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0002.htm#13101425000011">Before<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:53:36"></hs_TimeCode>
explaining how the proposed reforms will address that, let me explain
why the current orders are not working. Three orders were legislated
for in the Sexual Offences Act 2003: the sexual offences prevention
order, the foreign travel order and the risk of sexual harm order. A
SOPO can be sought on conviction, or on proof of relevant offending
behaviour subsequent to that conviction, to protect a UK adult or
child. An FTO can be sought on proof of offending behaviour subsequent
to previous sexual conviction and can be sought to protect non-UK
children. Despite some misleading coverage of this campaign, the ROSHO
is already a pre-conviction order, and it can be sought on proof of two
contact offences to prevent serious sexual harm to children under the
age of 16. Neither new clause 5 nor the Government’s amendments
would create a revolutionary pre-conviction order today. That has been
an accepted necessity since 2003.</hs_Para>

one in this House would disagree with the principle that a person is
innocent until proven guilty, which is a fundamental principle of the
rule of law, but in no way would that be compromised by these
amendments. The case against a defendant would have to be proved to the
criminal standard, and a defendant’s procedural rights 
<?notus-xml column=483?>under the proposals would be identical to those in place under the
current provisions. The fact of the matter is that a criminal
prosecution is not the only mechanism that is necessary to achieve an
acceptable level of protection against the sexual abuse of
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101425000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0002.htm#13101425000013">Criminal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:55:08"></hs_TimeCode>
prosecution is not always possible. In some situations a prosecution is
found not to be in the interests of a child victim, and therefore not
in the public interest. In other situations there might be compelling
evidence or some technical reason why the evidence is not found to be
admissible. In other cases, as we have seen recently, a vulnerable
witness might simply find the court process too traumatic and so the
case collapses. Anyone who follows the progress of policing and the

Blackwood:</Member></B> Absolutely. To answer the shadow
Minister’s question about whether a civil standard would be
appropriate, I think that it is important to ensure that we maintain
the balance. The reason it was not possible to achieve ROSHOs
previously was the combination of two contact offences plus a standard
of serious sexual harm. I do not think that the necessary approach now
is to lower that standard of
proof.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101425000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0002.htm#13101425000016">Some<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:59:33"></hs_TimeCode>
have expressed concern that these orders are intended as an alternative
to prosecution, but that is not the case; they are simply a practical
necessity alongside prosecution. As a civil order they are no different
in nature from other civil orders designed to protect children, such as
injunctions or restraining orders in a family court or a barring order

intervene and protect vulnerable people from foreseeable harm, even if
prosecution is not possible, we are failing in our duty of care. The
current orders are failing. The requirement to prove two contact
offences for the ROSHO produces the absurd result that an offender who
sexually touched a 15-year-old twice would be eligible for an order but
an offender who raped a four-year-old once would not be—the
police would have to wait for the offender to do it again. That is not
a sensible way to assess
risk.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101425000018" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0002.htm#13101425000018">Further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:57:46"></hs_TimeCode>more,
given the existence of a specific form of order to prevent foreign
travel, ROSHOs have never been used in practice to protect children
abroad. The outcome is that non-UK children enjoy a materially lower

are other basic flaws in the existing regime. Application for all three
orders can be made only by the local chief of police, but all too often
an offender 
<?notus-xml column=484?>travels ahead of the evidence between force areas, especially in
grooming and trafficking cases. The ROSHO applies only in relation to
children up to the age of 16, meaning that 16 to 18-year-olds, who
might have been caught up in abuse from a much younger age, can only be
protected by a SOPO with a much higher threshold.</hs_Para>

the sexual abuse of children is big business in many destination
countries. Hundreds of thousands of children are routinely trafficked
for that purpose. Although offenders often have a clear record of
offending in different jurisdictions, they can still escape prosecution
in each, as many jurisdictions simply fail to prosecute due to
different standards of children’s rights or pure corruption. In
that context, the FTO threshold for offending behaviour subsequent to a
conviction is entirely unworkable. It is unsurprising that since 2005
only 50 FTOs have been granted. In 2007, a year in which

describing child sex abuse in pornographic, and often lurid, detail.
All, including the written word in this form, are designed by the
individuals concerned for sexual stimulation over the sexual abuse of
children. If an individual wrote from his or her imagination a graphic
description of child sexual abuse—which could, and often is,
more emotive and more graphic than any picture of any form—even

me give a simple example that I gave in speaking to my ten-minute rule

Kent who wrote describing his wish to kidnap an early-teenage girl,
strip her, sexually abuse her in an exceptionally unpleasant way and
then, in an even more unpleasant way which I will not detail, slowly
kill this girl. It is horrific, especially as his writings then

that of the Childhood Lost campaign, which I have strongly supported,
will be especially warmly welcomed by my constituents and hers, who are
horrified at what was uncovered by the Operation Bullfinch
investigation and prosecutions in Oxford. They are very worried that it
was not possible to stop these crimes happening earlier and that even
now there are people it has not been possible to bring to justice
before the courts because of the difficulty in giving evidence.

must be greatly

want to underline an enormously important point that the hon. Lady made
about the strength and clarity of guidance that is given on the use of
these orders and the importance of each local area having the
wherewithal to carry them into effect. In the wake of Operation
Bullfinch, in Oxford we have had established the Kingfisher unit, which
she and I jointly visited. It brings together all the relevant agencies
and undertakes preventive and educational work as well as helping to
bring cases to justice. We need such units in every part of the
country. There has to be the strongest guidance to ensure that these
orders are going to be used. I look forward to an assurance from the
Minister that there will be close reporting and monitoring on the
extent and areas of their use so that this House can see the progress
that we all very much hope the bringing into law of these orders will
represent.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_14_PT_1/D1BA454B3EA67BD1DD9655C2F58F3DA26FD447C6" __version__="1.6"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="14 October 2013">Monday

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:15:56"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Oxford West and Abingdon (Nicola Blackwood), who gave a fantastic
example of her grasp of the details of this subject and her attitude to
it. I served with her on the Committee during its inquiry into child
sexual exploitation in response to localised grooming, when we all
shared experiences that will stay with me and, I am sure, with her for
the rest of our lives. Some of the things we saw and heard about were
absolutely horrific. It is to her great credit that she has responded
in a very measured way to try to address this. Her speech was exemplary
in that

all think that abuse of children and of any vulnerable adult is
completely and utterly unacceptable. It is a heinous crime. Everybody
in this House opposes it and 
<?notus-xml column=489?>wants to see it ended; that is absolutely clear. It is also clear that a
crime of this nature is a crime regardless of where it happens. When
people go overseas to abuse children, that cannot be okay just because
those children happen not to be British. That much is absolutely,
completely and utterly clear.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:17:09"></hs_TimeCode>a number of
improvements in what the Government are suggesting. For example, it
seems odd that a rule was brought in saying that there must be two
offences before a breach of something became a serious matter. I
struggle to think of any other examples where someone would have to do
something twice before there was perceived to be a problem. It is
absolutely right to get rid of

was very surprised by several of the comments by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:17:27"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson). There is a danger that we
get trapped in the idea that we must do anything to protect children.
It becomes a mantra: “Won’t somebody think of the
children?” We do need to protect children but in a way that will
work and will not cause us problems. It is an important principle that
people do not get jailed based on anything less than the criminal
standard of proof. I was genuinely horrified by her suggestion that it
would be worth considering something else. I accept that this is a
deeply emotional area, and we all want to protect children. I hope that
on reflection she will reconsider some of her comments about my
perspective on that. We all want that protection to happen, but we must
also ensure that we do not break some of the principles of the rule of
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101425000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0002.htm#13101425000052"><B><Member ContinuationText="Diana Johnson" PimsId="4791" UID="13101425000131" xid="854" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0002.htm#13101425000131">Diana

hon. Lady said. That is critical. I listened carefully to her comments
about the idea that not everyone subject to an order could be jailed,
but I would hope that that would be the principal aim. I think we would
all like people who abuse children or vulnerable adults to go to jail,

case of Simon Walsh was interesting—it was surprising that it
was brought in the first place— and he was eventually

people have been found explicitly not guilty. I think we will have a

vast majority of the problem was caused by organisational failures and
by people not trusting or listening to young people—a series of
things that will not be fixed by legislation. We must not delude

Sexual Violence against Children and Vulnerable People, which I chair
and whose membership is indicative of the widespread group of people
necessary to act on this terrible crime. It includes not only a number
of Departments, such as the Home Office to deal with the criminal

the Member for Crewe and Nantwich (Mr Timpson) and his representatives,
but the health service, local government and the police, which have
important roles to play. The group also includes many non-governmental
organisations and charities. Such organisations often sit outside
governmental structures and shout through their megaphones about how
Government should be doing things better. It seems to me that in a
matter of such seriousness and urgency, having them sitting at the
table from the start saying, “This is how you should do
things,” is likely to produce a much faster and more sensitive

for Kingston upon Hull North (Diana Johnson) rightly mentioned. There
is a wide range of issues that it could deal with, but we have set four

second priority is the attitude of the police. Extra training is
required so that police officers who are approached with evidence of
child abuse and particularly of grooming like that seen in Oxford,
Rochdale and other areas are better trained than they have been to
assess the credibility of the story, rather than of the witness. One of
the problems is that many of the young girls who come forward are in
care or in trouble with the police and are likely to be involved in
drugs and alcohol, not least because they have been put on them by the
men who are grooming them. They may not, therefore, appear at first to
be the most credible or compelling of witnesses. Looking beyond the
individual in front of them to the terrible and frightening crime that
lies beyond is a skill that police officers can learn through training.
The police are trying hard to do that across the regional police forces
and through the National Crime

point, once an order is made, the supervision of it will be in the
hands of the local police. It is sensible for them to be on the front
line of making any application to vary the order. Obviously, the NCA
will make it a habit to work closely with local forces when they are
working together in specific areas, as they will be in this case. It
should become entirely habitual for the NCA to pass evidence to local
forces. I know that the leadership of the NCA is determined to do that.

new clause 7 seeks to extend the offence of possessing a prohibited

a pornographic non-photographic image of a child that is grossly

extend that offence to include the written word. I add my thanks to the
many that have been given this evening to both Members for their
personal efforts in the fight to protect children from abuse. Their
motivation for the new clause is entirely laudable, and it is quite
right for the House to have the opportunity to discuss

material that describes the sexual abuse of children is undoubtedly
distasteful and disturbing. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:40:25"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
said, he and I have had many discussions and meetings on the matter,
and I put it to him that criminalising the possession of the written
word in any context is a significant step, and we should pause before
taking it. In our view, it is a step that should be taken only once we
know the full extent of the problem. In this case, there are two
particular requirements. First, there must be evidence that possession
of such material is causing harm to children. Secondly, it must be
practical for the police—in this case CEOP—to go through
all the material on people’s computers. It is much more
difficult to do that with the written word than with images. As my hon.
Friend said, there is special technology that allows speedy checks of
images. We are working on improving that technology, but it is more
difficult in the case of the written word. If, after considering those
caveats, we conclude that there is a case for changing the law,
we will need to ensure that we go about it in the right way so that it
has some practical effect and improves child
protection.</hs_Para>

make an order under this section (a “sexual harm prevention
order”) in respect of a person (“the defendant”)
where subsection (2) or (3) applies to the
defendant.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) This subsection
applies to the defendant
where—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the court
deals with the defendant in respect
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i) an offence
listed in Schedule 3 or 5,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(ii) a finding that the
defendant is not guilty of an offence listed in Schedule 3 or 5 by
reason of insanity,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(iii) a
finding that the defendant is under a disability and has done the act
charged against the defendant in respect of an offence listed in
Schedule 3 or
5,</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel2>and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
the court is satisfied that it is necessary to make a sexual harm
prevention order, for the purpose
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i) protecting the
public or any particular members of the public from sexual harm from
the defendant, or</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(ii)
protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular
children or vulnerable adults, from sexual harm from the defendant
outside the United Kingdom.</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3)
This subsection applies to the defendant
where—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
an application under subsection (4) has been made in respect of the
defendant and it is proved on the application that the defendant is a
qualifying offender, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
the court is satisfied that the defendant’s behaviour since the
appropriate date makes it necessary to make a sexual harm prevention
order, for the purpose
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i) protecting the
public or any particular members of the public from sexual harm from
the defendant, or</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(ii)
protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular

Kingdom.</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4)
A chief officer of police or the Director General of the National Crime
Agency (“the Director General”) may by complaint to a
magistrates’ court apply for a sexual harm prevention order in
respect of a person if it appears to the chief officer or the Director
General that—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the
person is a qualifying offender,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) the person has since
the appropriate date acted in such a way as to give reasonable cause to
believe that it is necessary for such an order to be
made.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) A chief officer of
police may make an application under subsection (4) only in respect of
a person—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) who
resides in the chief officer’s police area,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2> <hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) who the chief officer
believes is in that area or is intending to come to
it.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) An application under
subsection (4) may be made to any magistrates’ court whose
commission area
includes—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) any part
of a relevant police area,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any place where it is
alleged that the person acted in a way mentioned in subsection
(4)(b).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The Director
General must as soon as practicable notify the chief officer of police
for a relevant police area of any application that the Director has
made under subsection (4).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8)
In this section “relevant police area”
means—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) where the
applicant is a chief officer of police, the officer’s police
area;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) where the applicant
is the Director
General—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i) the police
area where the person in question resides, or</hs_AmendmentLevel3> 
<?notus-xml column=498?><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(ii) a police area which the Director General

Kingdom, anything which would constitute an offence listed in Schedule
3 if done in any part of the United

offender” means a person within subsection (2) or (3)
below;</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel3>“vulnerable

is within this subsection if, whether before or after the commencement
of this Part, the
person—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) has been
convicted of an offence listed in Schedule 3 (other than at paragraph
60) or in Schedule 5,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) has
been found not guilty of such an offence by reason of

be under a disability and to have done the act charged against him in
respect of such an offence,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(d) has been cautioned in
respect of such an offence.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3)
A person is within this subsection if, under the law in force in a
country outside the United Kingdom and whether before or after the
commencement of this
Part—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the person has
been convicted of a relevant offence (whether or not the person has
been punished for it),</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a
court exercising jurisdiction under that law has made in respect of a
relevant offence a finding equivalent to a finding that the person is
not guilty by reason of

made in respect of a relevant offence a finding equivalent to a finding
that the person is under a disability and did the act charged against
the person in respect of the offence,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(d) the person has been
cautioned in respect of a relevant
offence.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) In subsection (3),
“relevant offence” means an act
which—</hs_AmendmentLevel1> <hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) constituted
an offence under the law in force in the country concerned,
and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) would have constituted
an offence listed in Schedule 3 (other than at paragraph 60) or in
Schedule 5 if it had been done in any part of the United
Kingdom.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>For this purpose an
act punishable under the law in force in a country outside the United
Kingdom constitutes an offence under that law, however it is described
in that
law.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) For
the purposes of section 103A, acts, behaviour, convictions and findings
include those occurring before the commencement of this
Part.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Subject to subsection
(7), on an application under section 103A(4) the condition
in subsection (4)(b) above (where relevant) is to be taken as met
unless, not later than rules of court may provide, the defendant serves
on the applicant a notice—</hs_AmendmentLevel1> 

<?notus-xml column=499?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) stating that, on the facts as alleged with
respect to the act concerned, the condition is not in the
defendant’s opinion
met,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) showing the grounds
for that opinion, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c)
requiring the applicant to prove that the condition is
met.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) The court, if it
thinks fit, may permit the defendant to require the applicant to prove
that the condition is met without service of a notice under subsection
(6).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) Subsection (9) applies
for the purposes of section 103A and this
section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) In construing any
reference to an offence listed in Schedule 3, any condition
subject to which an offence is so listed that
relates—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) to the way
in which the defendant is dealt with in respect of an offence so listed
or a relevant finding (as defined by section 132(9)),
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) to the age of any
person,</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>is to be
disregarded.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1><B>103C SHPOs:

prevention order prohibits the defendant from doing anything described
in the order.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) Subject to
section 103D(1), a prohibition contained in a sexual harm prevention
order has effect—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)

may specify that some of its prohibitions have effect until further
order and some for a fixed
period;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) may specify
different periods for different
prohibitions.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) The only
prohibitions that may be included in a sexual harm prevention order are
those necessary for the purpose
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) protecting the
public or any particular members of the public from sexual harm from
the defendant, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular
children or vulnerable adults, from sexual harm from the defendant
outside the United
Kingdom.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5)
In subsection (4) “the public”, “sexual
harm”, “child” and “vulnerable
adult” each has the meaning given in section
103B(1).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Where a court
makes a sexual harm prevention order in relation to a person who is
already subject to such an order (whether made by that court or
another), the earlier order ceases to have
effect.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1><B>103D SHPOs:

does not prevent a prohibition on foreign travel from being extended
for a further period (of no more than 5 years each time) under section
103E.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) A sexual harm
prevention order that contains a prohibition within subsection (2)(c)
must require the defendant to surrender all of the defendant’s
passports at a police station specified in the
order—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) on or before
the date when the prohibition takes effect,

specified in the order.</hs_AmendmentLevel2> 
<?notus-xml column=500?><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Any passports surrendered must be returned as

a sexual harm prevention order containing a prohibition within
subsection (2)(c) (unless the person is subject to an equivalent
prohibition under another
order).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Subsection (5) does
not apply in relation

the defendant, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular

the defendant, subject to the modification set out in subsection

<hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5)
Where—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a sexual harm

the court must make a notification order in respect of the defendant
(either in addition to or instead of a sexual harm prevention order)

invites the court to do so, and</hs_AmendmentLevel2> 
<?notus-xml column=502?><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) it is proved that the conditions in section

A defendant may appeal against the making of a sexual harm prevention
order—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
where the order was made by virtue of section103A(2)(a)(i), as if the
order were a sentence passed on the defendant for the
offence;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
where the order was made by virtue of section103A(2)(a)(ii) or (iii),
as if the defendant had been convicted of the offence and the

was made on an application under section103A(4), to the Crown

On an appeal under subsection (1)(c), (2) or (3)(b), the Crown Court

just.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Any order made by the
Crown Court on an appeal under subsection (1)(c) or (2) (other than an
order directing that an application be re-heard by a

 Sexual risk orders: applications, grounds and
effect</B></hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) A chief officer
of police or the Director General of the National Crime Agency
(“the Director General”) may by complaint to a
magistrates’ court apply for an order under this section (a
“sexual risk order”) in respect of a person (“the
defendant”) if it appears to the chief officer or the Director
General that the following condition is
met.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The condition is that
the defendant has, whether before or after the commencement of this
Part, done an act of a sexual nature as a result of which there is
reasonable cause to believe that it is necessary for a sexual risk
order to be made.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) A chief
officer of police may make an application under subsection (1) only in
respect of a person—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a)
who resides in the chief officer’s police area,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) who the chief officer
believes is in that area or is intending to come to
it.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) An application under
subsection (1) may be made to any magistrates’ court whose
commission area
includes—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) any part
of a relevant police area,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) any place where it is
alleged that the person acted in a way mentioned in subsection
(2).</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) The Director General
must as soon as practicable notify the chief officer of police for a
relevant police area of any application that the Director has made
under subsection (1).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) On an
application under subsection (1), the court may make a sexual risk
order if it is satisfied that the defendant has, whether before or
after the commencement of this Part, done an act of a sexual nature as
a result of which it is necessary to make such an order for the purpose
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) protecting the
public or any particular members of the public from harm from the
defendant,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular
children or vulnerable adults, from harm from the defendant outside the
United Kingdom.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) Such an
order—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) prohibits the
defendant from doing anything described in the
order;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) has effect for a
fixed period (not less than 2 years) specified in the order or until
further
order.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(8) A
sexual risk order may specify different periods for different
prohibitions.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(9) The only
prohibitions that may be imposed are those necessary for the purpose
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) protecting the
public or any particular members of the public from harm from the
defendant, or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) protecting
children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular children or
vulnerable adults, from harm from the defendant outside the United

makes a sexual risk order in relation to a person who is already
subject to such an order (whether made by that court or another), the
earlier order ceases to have
effect.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1><B>122B  Section
122A: interpretation</B></hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(1) In
section
122A—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel3>“child”
means a person under

himself or herself from 
<?notus-xml column=504?>physical or psychological harm is significantly impaired through
physical or mental disability or illness, through old age or
otherwise.</hs_AmendmentLevel3><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) In that section
“relevant police area”
means—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) where the
applicant is a chief officer of police, the officer’s police
area;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) where the applicant
is the Director General of the National Crime
Agency—</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel3>(i) the police

other than a country named or described in the order,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) a prohibition on
travelling to any country outside the United

does not prevent a prohibition on foreign travel from being extended
for a further period (of no more than 5 years each time) under section
122D.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) A sexual risk order
that contains a prohibition within subsection (2)(c) must require the
defendant to surrender all of the defendant’s passports at a
police station specified in the
order—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) on or before
the date when the prohibition takes effect,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) within a period
specified in the order.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5) Any
passports surrendered must be returned as soon as reasonably
practicable after the person ceases to be subject to a sexual risk
order containing such a prohibition (unless the person is subject to an
equivalent prohibition under another
order).</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Subsection (5) does
not apply in relation
to—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) a passport
issued by or on behalf of the authorities of a country outside
the United Kingdom if the passport has been returned to those
authorities;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a passport
issued by or on behalf of an international organisation if the passport
has been returned to that
organisation.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) In this

Kingdom passport within the meaning of the Immigration Act
1971;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a passport issued by
or on behalf of the authorities of a country outside the United

organisation;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) a document
that can be used (in some or all circumstances) instead of a
passport.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1><B>122D
 Sexual risk order: variations, renewals and

within subsection (2) may by complaint to the appropriate court apply
for an order varying, renewing or discharging a sexual risk
order.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(2) The persons
are—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) the

subsections (4) and (5), on the application the court, after hearing
the person making the application and (if they wish to be heard) the
other persons mentioned in subsection 
<?notus-xml column=505?>(2), may make any order, varying, renewing or discharging the sexual
risk order, that the court considers
appropriate.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) An order may
be renewed, or varied so as to impose additional prohibitions on the
defendant, only if it is necessary to do so for the purpose
of—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) protecting the
public or any particular members of the public from harm from the
defendant,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b)
protecting children or vulnerable adults generally, or any particular
children or vulnerable adults, from harm from the defendant outside the
United
Kingdom.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>Any
renewed or varied order may contain only such prohibitions as are
necessary for this purpose.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(5)
The court must not discharge an order before the end of 2 years
beginning with the day on which the order was made, without the consent
of the defendant
and—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) where the
application is made by a chief officer of police, that chief officer,
or</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) in any other case, the
chief officer of police for the area in which the defendant
resides.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(6) Section 122B(1)
applies for the purposes of this
section.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(7) In this section

which made the sexual risk
order;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) a
magistrates’ court for the area in which the defendant
resides;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(c) where the

magistrates’ court whose commission area includes any part of
the officer’s police
area.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1><B>122E  Interim

has been made, may be made by the person who has made that application,
by complaint to the court to which that application has been
made.</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(3) The court may, if it
considers it just to do so, make an interim sexual risk order,
prohibiting the defendant from doing anything described in the
order.</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel1>(4) Such an
order—</hs_AmendmentLevel1><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(a) has effect
only for a fixed period, specified in the
order;</hs_AmendmentLevel2><hs_AmendmentLevel2>(b) ceases to have
effect, if it has not already done so, on the determination of the main

Committee considered the human rights compatibility of the new civil
injunction to prevent nuisance and annoyance—an IPNA. The Bill
states that an IPNA may be imposed if the court considers it
“just and convenient” to prevent antisocial
behaviour—a lower test than the test of necessity required by
human rights law. We also considered that the new IPNA definition of
antisocial behaviour is too broad and not clear enough. I hope
Ministers will consider positively the idea that the Bill should be as
clear as possible and compatible with other legislation; we should not
start introducing concepts not found in other legislation, which would
mean that people would not know how the law would be
interpreted.</hs_Para>

Committee’s view, the Bill’s current provisions on the
prohibitions and requirements that can be attached to an injunction are
far too broad. Furthermore, we have not been persuaded that it is
necessary to state expressly that prohibitions and requirements in an
IPNA must “so far as practicable” avoid any conflict with
religious beliefs. The Committee is clear—the House has been
clear about this on many occasions—that the 
<?notus-xml column=512?>freedom to hold religious beliefs, or any beliefs that may not be from a
religious perspective, is not a relative right but an absolute right
that cannot be interfered with. The power to exclude a person from his
or her home through the use of an IPNA is a severe measure, and the
Committee believes further provision is required to ensure that such a
power is used only when necessary.</hs_Para>

sanctions can be imposed on children as young as 10, the Committee also
scrutinised the provisions and considered their impact on the rights of
children. To reduce the potential negative impact of IPNA measures on
children, we recommend that the courts must take into account the best
interests of the child as a primary consideration in any IPNA legal
proceedings. That explains the Committee’s position, and I will
now consider quickly other amendments in the

163 and 164 go together and would mean that one test a court should

I know from my constituency work—and, I guess, the same is true
for colleagues—it is always difficult to judge whether going to
court and getting an injunction is the right way to deal with what may
be growing, yet still relatively modest, antisocial behaviour. We think
proportionality is appropriate and that it is better to write that into

is a well publicised issue. In my borough, both when my colleagues were
running the administration and when it has been under Labour
administration, there has been discussion publicly as well as among
councillors about whether an injunction should be used to kick people
out of their council home or their housing association home, and if so,
in what circumstances. In a way, such a provision is slightly
discriminatory because it applies only to people who are in publicly
funded housing; it does not apply to someone in private rented
property. That remains an
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:06:35"></hs_TimeCode>.
We want the Minister to be positive about our amendment 166, which
would add to subsection (c) one more condition—that the court
has to be satisfied that the exclusion is necessary and appropriate. Of
course, if someone has engaged or threatens to engage in violence, or
has threatened other people in the house, whether it is domestic
violence among members of a family or household or otherwise, the logic
might be that they should be excluded. I do not resile from that at
all, but because it is such a draconian solution the court needs to be
clear that it is necessary and appropriate. That is the run of

that it was a civil standard of proof, as opposed to a criminal
standard of proof. We think we ought to make that clear, not just so

justification for the new discretionary ground of possession for
riot-related anti-social behaviour. We are concerned about its
potential serious implications for family members, and consider that it
may disproportionately affect women and children. We also consider that
it amounts to a punishment rather than a genuine means of preventing

and say that I am conscious that that area is controversial. The
controversy arose in my constituency a year and a bit ago, in the
summer, when we had “riots” on the streets of Southwark
and—not to a huge degree, but to some degree—on the
Walworth road and in Peckham. Other cities in Britain as well as other
parts of London were affected by riots. The question is how we deal
with those who are caught rioting. The issue that was the subject of
widespread discussion was whether it is right to take away a home when
one of the people living there has been involved in rioting. Is it
right that a 15 or 17-year-old youngster living in a council property
in Lewes, Cambridge, Southwark, Kingston-upon-Hull or anywhere else,
should have their home taken
away<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:15:15"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

Select Committee makes the point that such a provision is more likely
to punish innocent women and children for the mistake of somebody who
is more likely to be male, and more likely to be a teenager. That will
not necessarily be the case: some of the riots in London involved
people who were certainly not teenagers, and some who were certainly
not males. They were caught on CCTV and by other cameras. We were very
clear, however, that we should remove from the Bill the ability to give
power to recover possession on riot-related antisocial behaviour
grounds.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000131"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:16:03"></hs_TimeCode>I
am not an expert, but I believe that most local authorities have the
power to terminate possession of tenancies on the basis that somebody
has breached their tenancy agreement. It is certainly a breach of a
tenancy agreement to behave in a way that seriously causes a nuisance
to one’s neighbours or community. There are issues about how
close that has to be, and so on. I ask the Government to be very
careful in reflecting on the question. Although the easy populist line
might be that it is good to have such a power on recovery in the Bill,
I ask them to reflect on whether in fact it might be excessive and on
the idea that it would not necessarily deal with the offence.</hs_Para>

away the threat of criminal sanction, taking police off the beat to
attend training on new and weaker powers of response, and requiring the
new injunctions to be taken out not in magistrates courts, which would
mean they could be dealt with quickly and efficiently, but in county
courts, which are slow and overburdened. Amendment 96 seeks not to
prevent the Government from introducing injunctions to prevent nuisance

speak from experience. Before the people of Croydon North elected me to
the House last November, I spent nearly seven years as leader of
Lambeth council in south London. When Labour won power there in 2006,
we found that the Tory-Lib Dem coalition had spent the previous three
years stalling ASBOs on ideological grounds. One year, it issued none
at all. As a consequence, antisocial behaviour remained too high,
without sanction. Young people drifted from antisocial behaviour to
low-level crime, and then to high-level crime, including street
robberies. Gang violence rose. The fear of crime and the perception
that local streets were simply not safe became
endemic.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000139">One

refer again to my experience, Lambeth council increased the use of
ASBOs to achieve a reduction in antisocial behaviour not for the

needed to get a grip of our streets and return confidence to the
law-abiding majority of residents. Government Members cannot tell me

work in part because they are backed by a criminal sanction. Breaching
an ASBO is not something to be taken lightly—it is a criminal

communities, and people expect effective sanctions. With
Labour’s ASBOs, that is exactly what they got. Instead, the
Government propose to take away the criminal sanction. Offenders can
breach IPNAs in the full knowledge that they are not committing a
crime. If the police or local councils want action taken against
someone who has breached their IPNA and who is terrorising a local
community, they will not get support from the criminal justice system.
There is no automatic penalty. Instead, the breach of an IPNA will lead
to the potential of civil action brought under the contempt of court
proceedings. Offenders across the country will be rejoicing that the
Government have gone soft, while the law-abiding majority will be
horrified.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000144">The

abolishing ASBOs and replacing them with IPNAs, the Government are not
only taking away the power of the police to clamp down effectively on

civil courts would be in the region of £1,500 on every occasion.
Based on last year’s court figures for breaches of ASBOs, the
switch to IPNAs will cost councils and police forces another
£1.5 million a year. That £1.5 million will be taken from
two of the hardest-hit parts of the public sector. If a 20% cut to

clear that such a change will require a legislative consent order in

lives demands a tough response. ASBOs give police and councils the
ability to clamp down and target offenders: IPNAs will not. Many of my

is exactly why it is important to add to the Bill the requirements to
deal with bullying. We can deal with the bullies as well as the

at home. The positive requirements would enable all sorts of agencies

the bullies

it was when I was at school, when it was people being mean to each
other in the playground. It is now persistent bullying on and offline.
That is why I am pleased that the Government accepted the need to put
bullying back into the guidance on the injunctions. It was originally
in the guidance on the 1999 Act that introduced ASBOs. The subsequent
review of ASBOs in 2002 also included persistent bullying, but the 2006
guidance—which until recently was the current Home Office
guidance—did not mention bullying. I was grateful therefore for

we are including bullying within the guidance of the injunction, it is
logical to give those who primarily have responsibility for dealing
with bullying—mainly schools, which unfortunately retain most of
the responsibility—the tools to deal with it. That is why in

opportunity to apply for the injunctions. That would have been a
permissive power that I thought would be a logical step. Unfortunately,
that view is not shared by the teaching unions, all of which I have

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> I support
amendments 158, 176 and 177, which have been tabled by the Joint
Committee on Human Rights. I am not sure that they go far enough, but
they are what we have before
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:40:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000170">On
amendment 158, my anxiety relates to the wording in clause 1. It almost
legislates for pre-crimes, which became fashionable a couple of years
ago. Hon. Members might recall that, at the time of the royal
wedding, Dr Chris Knight and a number of his friends wished to
protest against expenditure on the royal wedding. As part of a theatre
group, they were going to take papier-mâché
representations of the royal family to Buckingham palace on the day of
the royal wedding and ceremonially guillotine them. The police arrested
Dr Knight and his friends, detaining them—this was eventually
legally challenged—on the basis that this was not a crime, but a
pre-crime that could, at some point in the future, be designated as a
crime.</hs_Para>

causing a nuisance and not a crime that is taking place, but a judgment
that there could be a crime in the future. That is a burden of judgment
placed on a police officer or others that is almost impossible to
determine and will leave us open to legal challenges until the cows
come home. I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>
support the amendment because it would at least define
“reasonable judgment”, with criteria brought forward when
the judgment is exercised. Otherwise, we will potentially be giving
officers and others—in particular, the court—extensive
powers, with little evidence on which to base the exercise of those
powers.</hs_Para>

theme of our concerns in amendment 176 is to ensure that people have
the right to express their views and the right to protest. Part 1, by
designating certain forms of behaviour as unacceptable, can close down,
as pre-crimes, certain activities. Those activities are exemplified by
the experience of Dr Chris Knight, who was simply attempting to voice
an alternative view. I am grateful to Mr Matthew Varnham for pointing
out, in his evidence to the Joint Committee, that, as the Bill
currently stands, any spontaneous act of protest could be designated as
antisocial behaviour.</hs_Para>

enough, I met Mr Varnham on a protest in Parliament
square—people with disabilities were campaigning against work
capability assessments. The protest had been applied for in advance and
the police had given permission for it to take place. Spontaneous acts
will take place at such protests. Groups will break off spontaneously
and undertake other forms of protest, because they will have been
convinced by the people speaking or by the debate that has taken place
that further action needs to take place. As the Bill stands, that form
of spontaneous protest would be outlawed and we would be dragging
people through the courts simply because they went along to listen to a
speech—for example, by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:44:52"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes)—were
excited by it, and decided that they wanted to do something spontaneous
to ensure that his views were echoed in the wider
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:45:02"></hs_TimeCode>. At
the moment, they would be arrested. God forbid that the right hon.
Gentleman would ever incite anyone in that way—not on the basis
of his speeches in this place, but perhaps
elsewhere.</hs_Para>

we close down free speech, we will be dragging people through the
courts who simply want to exercise their right in a democratic society
to say that they disagree. It is often the people who exercise this
right to whom Parliament listens. It is as a result of such
protest that legislative reform takes place. Most hon. Members have
been involved in such campaigns, in particular the Minister, who is our
sleeper within the Home Office on matters of this sort. I am anxious
that we are giving a breadth of powers to courts and others to prevent
freedom of speech. That is why I agree with amendment
176—a relatively mild-mannered amendment —which says that
where there is an opportunity for peaceful assembly people should not
be dragged before the courts just because they have taken the
opportunity to protest
spontaneously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:46:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000176">Amendment
177 is also tabled by the Joint Committee on Human Rights. I am
extremely anxious about the additional penalty. I was involved in a
case in south London where a family was threatened with eviction by, 
<?notus-xml column=525?>I believe, the London borough of Wandsworth. One member of the family, a
young man, was prosecuted for participating in the riots. The family
had no role whatever in the riots. I am not sure what their attitude
was towards the young man—it never came out in discussions
—but they certainly never knew that he was engaged in that
behaviour. However, they were all threatened with eviction. Eventually,
legal action was threatened and the local authority withdrew. I am
worried that when the Bill is passed we will be in a situation where
parents and others, who have no control over individual members of
their family, will suffer as a result of a crime that they never
participated in and, often, did not condone.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101431000177" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000177">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:40:47"></hs_TimeCode>
inclusion of the measure in the Bill might have been politically
advantageous a couple of years ago, but time has moved on. It is
draconian and will result in injustice. As has been said, if a crime is
committed by a member of a household in the vicinity of that property,
powers already exist to deal with that. Most hon. Members would seek to
ensure that the landlord, whether the council or a housing association,
implemented the tenancy agreement. Every tenancy agreement I have seen
in recent times allows the exercise of powers to seek repossession if
necessary when a family, or a visitor, has brought about antisocial
behaviour that has affected neighbours and others living in the
vicinity. This measure is therefore unnecessary and will have a
disproportionate impact on the families of those who may well have been
involved in other forms of illegal activity—the riots were given
as an example by the Minister when this was debated
previously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:49:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000178" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000178">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:49:04"></hs_TimeCode>

hon. Gentleman has with the Minister is so influential that
accommodation can be reached on this matter. If there is not
accommodation, I think the amendment will come back at a later stage,
because the measure will be seen to be unacceptable. If it did go
through, I think it would cause future Governments—here and
elsewhere in Europe—immense difficulties as these matters are
contested, because the right to free speech is being undermined, as
well as the articles of human rights legislation that allow people to
enjoy the freedom of being in their own home.</hs_Para>

Department, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker) to his
new post and by congratulating him on his promotion to Minister of
State. His injection

right hon. Friend the Member for Coventry North East (Mr Ainsworth) and
I campaigned for ASBOs. We did so because when we knocked on doors in
certain estates, we often found that elderly people were being
terrorised by gangs. In that part of Coventry, those people used steel
doors to protect themselves. That is why we need to be careful when we
say that ASBOs work or do not work. It depends greatly on the local
authority and the police to make ASBOs work. I do not quite buy what

Huppert:</Member></B> I absolutely accept that there are problems of
antisocial behaviour, including in many areas of my constituency. I am
sure that all hon. Members’ constituencies are affected by it.
The fact that there is an antisocial behaviour problem, however, and
the fact that the words “antisocial behaviour” appear in
the name of the order does not mean that the one is a solution to the
other. I simply do not accept that they have been a very effective
mechanism. Much better approaches have been taken by a number of
innovative councils. Islington, for example, has tried antisocial
behaviour contracts, which have been far more successful and there has
been a range of successes
elsewhere<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:53:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000188" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000188">Simplifying
the toolkit available is another issue. I welcome the idea of going
down from 19 powers to six, which will make it much it much easier for
people to find out what the options are. That is another reason why I
reject the idea of keeping ASBOs together with IPNAs—injunctions
to prevent nuisance and annoyance—which seems to me to be the
worst of both worlds.

both IPNAs and CBOs. It disallows the rules that say that children
should not be named and shamed publicly. We should all be extremely
alarmed about that because children make errors. They may do something
very silly when they are 14. Particularly in today’s age when
data is freely available, what they have done could stay with them for
the rest of their lives, and there is very little that anybody could do
to stop that. That makes it hard for them to rehabilitate, to grow up

so many people will do.</hs_Para>

is surprising, to say the least, that the Government have chosen to act
so brazenly, given that in their response to part II of the Commission
on Devolution in Wales, they said that the interpretation of this
self-same exception was “unclear”—referring to the
provision that specifies antisocial behaviour orders as an exception to
the Assembly’s legislative competence in respect of local
government, namely paragraph 12 of schedule 7 to the Government of
Wales Act. The question of how the Government can amend the exception
without being certain of its interpretation is beyond at least my
understanding, and probably beyond that of many other people. Given
that the Government suggested that the Silk commission should
look into the matter, it is perverse for them to act in advance
of the commission’s recommendations. Furthermore, as
they stated in their evidence that they were uncertain about how to
interpret the exception, I do not know how they can be so sure that no
legislative consent motion is required to amend

proposed amendment to the exception were passed, all orders to protect
individuals from behaviour giving rise to harassment, alarm or distress
would be outside the legislative competence of the Welsh National
Assembly. The Assembly would consequently be unable to legislate to
protect people from such behaviour, even in devolved fields such as
education, health and housing. The amendment would represent a
substantive alteration in the institution’s competence, and the
House should therefore not accept it without first seeking the
Assembly’s agreement. I understand that a legislative consent
memorandum and motion are to be laid in the Assembly, and that the
Welsh Government will not be supporting the motion. I expect that the

ASBOs for those who were engaging in antisocial behaviour which was
affecting people in the area, the truth is that merely securing the

that basis, and although the decision has not been easy, I am not
minded to oppose the Government’s desire to remove my first
attempt at legislation in this House, successful as it was, because the
Committee did not divide on the amendment I was proposing to
clause 1. My amendment was accepted by the Minister who was
then in charge, although there was a reservation when the
“like” amendment was proposed to clause 27 that the
Government reserved the right to come back to this matter on Report, as
they have now done. Be that as it may, I am not going to take further
the point that the Committee did not divide. The simple fact
is—the Minister needs to make this clear from the Dispatch Box,
so that it is clear to courts in due course—that one matter that
has to be taken into account when an injunction is granted are the
caring responsibilities of those against whom it is to be granted. That
addresses amendments 1 and

amendments 45 and 46 relate to clause 93 —we are
see-sawing around a lot because of how the amendments have been
grouped—which deals with community remedies and the community
remedy document. As the House will know, every Member having read the
Bill in detail, that is a list of community
remedies—punishments, if one prefers—that can be handed
out, 
<?notus-xml column=532?>which is drafted by a local policing body. Before it came into
Committee, the Bill provided no guidance as to what that document might
contain. As I pointed out in Committee, it might have provided that one
punishment or remedy that could be handed out was to place someone in
the stocks for two or three hours and have oranges hurled at them. Many
of our constituents would doubtless think that a very sensible
community remedy to be contained in a list of punishments or remedies
that might be handed out to those guilty of antisocial behaviour.
Obviously, the police and crime commissioners who gave evidence to the
Public Bill Committee indicated that some form of guidance would be
both desirable and necessary, and that has been taken on board by the
Government. I tabled, but did not move, a probing amendment in
Committee and it has been picked up by the Government, in that they
have tabled amendments 45 and 46 to deal with the possible problem that
one might have ended up with rogue and inappropriate remedies. Those
measures therefore have my full support and I hope they will also have
the support of the

do not wish to detain the House for too long, but I wish to discuss
amendments 39 and 40, which relate to clauses 70 and 73 and the time
within which those who obtain orders must return to court. The Bill
specifies a relatively short period—no doubt the Minister knows
precisely what it is—but for the purposes of computing time no
account is taken of days when the courts might be closed. I proposed to
the relevant Minister somewhat longer periods, because it seemed to me
that a problem might arise in respect of bank holidays and public
holidays, as the courts would not be able to deal with these matters
sufficiently quickly to enable the time limits to be complied with.
Some of that has been taken into account, because the Government now
propose that Christmas day will be removed from the period of
calculation in these clauses, but there remains a difficulty with which
the Minister needs to grapple.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:14:05"></hs_TimeCode> Minister for
Policing and Criminal Justice and it was suggested that specifying
Christmas day was sufficient in this regard, but what about Easter? As
we know, it consists of two public holidays, Good Friday and Easter
Monday, so we are talking about a four-day period. The Home
Office’s response has been, “The courts are able to deal
with this because they may open over the weekend.” The Minister
needs to reassure the House that that is the position and that there is
therefore enough time over the Easter holiday, in particular, for these
orders to be dealt with appropriately and for the Bill’s time

the owner of premises where an order is made—I have forgotten
which part of the Bill this relates to, but the Minister will doubtless
remind me. The Government’s point is that where such an order is
made—for example, against a nightclub—the police should
be able to recover their costs, and that is absolutely right. However,
as I pointed out in Committee, nightclubs or late-night premises often
are not owned by the people who occupy the premises where the nuisance
occurs. For that reason, we need to include the word
“occupier”, as the Government are now proposing. I am
pleased that that piece of advice, which I gave for free—that is
rare—was accepted. The amendment is therefore sensible and I

the ability of inner-city local authorities to deal with particular
instances of antisocial behaviour; I know that the Minister has been
informed about them by the redoubtable cabinet member, Nickie Aiken,
from Westminster city council.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:16:40"></hs_TimeCode>I shall raise
two main areas of concern, to which I would appreciate the Minister
giving consideration, and one specific amendment, which I suspect will

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:11:04"></hs_TimeCode>powers of arrest
and direct access to the criminal justice system, criminal injunctions
are, as we all know, more effective than civil injunctions in reducing
high-level antisocial behaviour, which damages communities and harms
the reputation of central London. The Bill proposes to replace ASBOs on
application and ASBOs on conviction with IPNAs and criminal behaviour
orders—CBOs—respectively. Breaching a CBO will
automatically be a criminal offence, whereas breaching an IPNA will
not. Local authorities will be able to apply for an IPNA, but will not
be able to apply for a CBO. Therefore, local authorities such as
Westminster city council—in a former life this would have
applied to the shadow Minister in his role at the London borough of
Lambeth—will no longer be able to apply directly for any order
or injunction on antisocial individuals or groups that would lead to
criminal proceedings in the event of a breach. Instead, local
authorities, housing associations, Transport for London and even police
chiefs will have to apply separately for an IPNA arrest warrant.
Alternatively, local authorities will have to negotiate on a
case-by-case basis with the Crown Prosecution Service, which I fear
will be operating with increasingly limited resources and capabilities,
to place CBOs on antisocial
individuals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:18:17"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:18:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000233" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000233"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Steve Reed" PimsId="6003" UID="13101431001151" xid="1244" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431001151">Mr

Field:</Member></B> Naturally, I will try to be constructive. I wholly
agree that the lower level nuisance and annoyance behaviour covered by
an IPNA does not always warrant the threat of criminal prosecution,
which perhaps happened in the past with ASBOs. Among the concerns
expressed earlier was that elements of those ASBOs were not being
properly enforced. We should rightly look to avoid criminalising the
country’s youth wherever possible, but in practice the specific
problems that we face with, for example, the very professional,
aggressive begging on the streets of Westminster, literally within
yards of where we are all sitting tonight, can currently be tackled
only through the use of ASBOs on application. We rely heavily on the
genuine threat of arrest to protect victims and to deter professional
aggressive beggars, who are completely different from the 16-year-old
who has got into trouble by graffitiing a bus-stop, for example. We
lose that threat under the new
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:20:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000237" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000237">I
want also to speak briefly about the antisocial behaviour committed by
people with no fixed UK address. From the experience in Westminster
city council area, but also in the City of London area that I
represent, I know that tackling antisocial behaviour often involves
dealing with organised aggressive begging gangs from across the EU. I
fear that we will hear a lot more of this in the months to come. Some
individuals travel to the UK in large numbers, with the sole intention
of doing a short, but profitable begging stint before
returning to their home. These people enter the UK according to
their rights as EU citizens, and cannot currently be deported unless
they remain in the country for longer than three months or commit a
criminal offence. While they are in the UK, and particularly while they
are here in central London, they have no fixed address and are
completely transient in nature, with many sleeping
rough<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:21:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000238" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000238">Where
we have previously dealt with such individuals through ASBOs on
application, under the IPNA system the local authority will be able to
apply for an arrest warrant only after a breach has occurred, by which
time the individual in question may well have left the country,
entirely unchallenged, to return at a future date. These people are
deliberately off the grid, and we must have some legislation in place
that closes this potential loophole and does not actively encourage the
gaming of the
system<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:22:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000239" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431000239"><B><Member ContinuationText="Stephen Phillips" PimsId="5622" UID="13101431001155" xid="1141" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0003.htm#13101431001155">Stephen
Phillips:</Member></B> My hon. Friend raises an extremely important
point, to which I hope the Minister will respond. Might provisions in
other statutes be used, under which, where a crime had been committed,
people could be deported without an ASBO having to be made against
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000240" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000240"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Field" PimsId="3229" UID="13101431001156" xid="198" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431001156">Mark
Field:</Member></B> I cannot use ignorance of the law as an excuse, but
my hon. and learned Friend knows considerably more about these matters
than I do. He makes a relevant 
<?notus-xml column=535?>point, which is that we do not necessarily have to go entirely down that
route. The ASBO legislation and this concurrent legislation is designed
to look at the whole issue of antisocial behaviour in a constructive
and codified way. The problems to which I have referred apply not
simply to the City of Westminster, Southwark or inner-London boroughs.
Increasingly, it will become apparent in places such as Manchester,
Leeds and Birmingham, so we should look at it fairly urgently. Without
being overly negative about the potential open-door arrival of a
significant number of people from Romania and Bulgaria, there is no
doubt that some of the specific problems in central London in recent
months have come disproportionately from groups who have already come
to this country from those other EU states. We need to ensure that
local authorities are given a chance to take
action<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:23:40"></hs_TimeCode>. As such,
I strongly feel that the Bill should be amended better to reflect the
circumstances that affect inner-city areas, recognise the particular
challenges that are faced in the UK’s major cities and
specifically enable a court to grant IPNAs with automatic powers of
arrest in a wider variety of circumstances.</hs_Para>

that power should be used only exceptionally, which is why it is

important issue raised in Committee relates to the application of the
new powers in relation to antisocial behaviour in or around a
respondent’s home, this time in relation to the criminal
behaviour order. The first condition that must be met before a criminal
behaviour order can be made is that the court is satisfied that the
offender has engaged in behaviour that caused or was likely to cause
harassment, alarm or distress to one or more persons not of the same
household as the offender.

I have said, the main replacements for the ASBO are the injunction
under part 1 of the Bill and the criminal behaviour order under part 2.
In drawing comparisons with the ASBO, they should be seen together,
rather than be taken individually. The injunction is a purely civil
remedy. That means it has a lower test than the ASBO on application,
coupled with the lower civil standard of proof, so it will be quicker
to obtain than the existing order. Front-line professionals will be
able to use it as a preventive measure to nip emerging problems in the
bud before they escalate into something more serious—which I
think is good news for victims— but, crucially, the
court could also include “positive requirements” in the
order. That is missing from the ASBO arrangements; indeed, that is one
of their major flaws. That has meant the focus has been on stopping the
behaviour, but not on getting individuals to deal with the underlying
drivers of their behaviour. If we are to prevent reoccurrences of bad
behaviour, it is very important we address that.</hs_Para>

for the ASBO, breach of the IPNA will not be a criminal offence. This
means there is no risk of criminalising under-18s. It will also help to
reduce the burden on the police and others in gathering and providing
evidence. That does not mean that the injunction has no teeth if it is
breached: it does. Adults can be imprisoned for up to two years for
breaching the terms of the IPNA, and the court can detain an under-18

years in prison. That is the same sanction as is available for the

important Committee of this House. I am grateful to the Committee for
its detailed scrutiny of the Bill. Taken together, the amendments would
introduce additional requirements that professionals and the courts
would have to meet in order to use the new powers. While I agree that
we must ensure that appropriate safeguards are in place, I believe that
those are already built into the Bill and fear that the

victims and communities, but it must not become a means of targeting

annoyance” they must be mindful 
<?notus-xml column=542?>that the injunction should not be used to stop
reasonable, trivial or benign behaviours that have not caused and are
not likely to cause harm to victims or communities. For example,
children simply playing in a park or on a street, or young people
lawfully gathering or socialising in a particular place, may be
annoying to some, but those activities are not in themselves

Bill also requires that the court must hear the views of the relevant
youth offending team in breach proceedings. This will also allow the
court to hear the views of the young person, in addition to the young
person’s views being put forward through a legal representative.
Moreover, the Bill explicitly specifies that a court can impose a
detention order on a young person only as a very last
resort—that is, where it determines that, because of the
severity or extent of the breach, no other power available is
appropriate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:46:38"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T20:46:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000286" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000286">As
I said in response to an earlier amendment, given that the injunction
is civil it will not criminalise young people. Indeed, it should
prevent criminality, through the use of positive requirements. In these
ways the new powers improve on the orders they replace in order to give
young people who behave antisocially the best chance of addressing the
underlying causes of their antisocial behaviour in the long term, which
benefits both the perpetrator and the victims. I emphasise that normal
behaviour is not being caught by this. I want to make it very clear
that there should be no court orders for playing in the

reporting, I accept there is a balance to be struck. Publicising orders
can provide reassurance to victims and communities that action has and
will be taken when they report antisocial behaviour. However, I agree
that, when deciding to publicise an order against a young person,
agencies must be satisfied that doing so is necessary and
proportionate, taking into account the likely effect on the young
person in question. We have made it clear in the draft guidance that
agencies must carefully decide each case on its own facts. That is
already the way the courts have approached these provisions and I

Member for Dwyfor Meirionnydd (Mr Llwyd), who is no longer in his
place, spoke about amendment 82, which is a consequential amendment to
the Government of Wales Act 2006. Provisions on antisocial behaviour
orders are among the exceptions to the legislative competence of the
National Assembly for Wales in respect of local government matters.
Amendment 82 simply updates that exception to recognise the abolition
of the ASBO, thus preserving the status quo with regard to the
Assembly’s competence. The UK Government is firmly of the view
that amendment 82 is purely consequential upon the abolition of
antisocial behaviour orders, so a consent motion is not required. It is

suspect it will help the House if I respond to new clause 4 before the
Opposition deal with it, in that peculiar way we sometimes have. The
new clause has been tabled by those on the Opposition Front Bench and
relates to two firearms licensing issues that we discussed in Committee
and during the Westminster Hall debate initiated by the hon. Member for
Easington (Grahame M. Morris) in early September. The first part of the
new clause seeks to create a presumption that if an applicant for a
firearm meets one of the stated criteria, the police should not grant a
licence. The stated criteria include evidence of domestic violence,
mental illness, and drug or alcohol
abuse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000374" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000374">As
I said in Committee, the police already have the ability to take those
factors into account when assessing the risk to public safety. I
understand that there are particular concerns about domestic violence
and abuse, and in response to those, on 31 July we published specific
guidance on that issue, providing greater detail on how the police
should handle such cases. Just last week, we published a new
consolidated guide on firearms licensing law. It is therefore fair to
say that the Government have taken on board the many important points
that were raised in Committee, and we have been quick to 
<?notus-xml column=552?>act. As the House will agree, decisions must be made on a case-by-case
basis, but guidance is clear that evidence of domestic violence will
generally indicate that an application should be refused. That new
guidance is being applied now by police forces up and down
the country, which I hope will be welcomed across the House.</hs_Para>

also seeks to introduce a requirement that the police must follow any
guidance issued by the Home Secretary when assessing public safety. I
consider, however, that guidance must remain just that. It is right
that chief officers have discretion to assess applications for firearms
in their local area, taking into account the merits of each case and
the newly published guide. Chief officers are ultimately responsible
for public safety at local level. The Government have sought to make
decision making a local responsibility wherever possible. I do not want
to undermine that, which is what new clause 4 would do.</hs_Para>

firearms licensing is conducted in practice, and we will use the
findings from the exercise to drive up the consistency of decision
making across the country. Again, that was a legitimate point made in
the course of our debates and outside. People wanted greater

second part of new clause 4 seeks to introduce a legal requirement for
the Secretary of State to consult all chief police officers before

reiterate that consultation with the police is integral to the
fee-setting process and we accept the need to consider the impact of
licensing on police resources. That is why we are introducing a new
online licensing system, which cuts the administrative burden of the
old paper-based system. We do not need primary legislation to make this

conclusion, I hope the Opposition Front-Bench team will acknowledge
that progress has been made in all the significant areas where

Given that this involves nearly 2 million weapons, we should be

also that we want the police to conduct more background checks.
However, the Government need to start explaining where they want the

general policing budgets—money that could otherwise be keeping
bobbies on the beat? Will the Minister explain why, at £50 for
five years, the annual cost of a firearms licence is barely a third of
the cost of a fishing licence, which costs £27.50 a year, or why
it is the equivalent cost of a Criminal Records Bureau check, which
costs £44 and requires only a name to be checked against a

five years later. The Government have claimed that they want to improve
the system of background checks associated with a firearms licence,

the Dunblane shootings in 1996, in which 16 children and one teacher

introduce tough new licensing laws, but it is also right that we, as

recent years, we have also seen a rise in the use of firearms,
breaching police and public safety, by individuals with track records
of domestic violence and mental illness, leading one coroner to call
for “root and branch changes” to gun licensing laws. For
instance, in the last 12 months, 75% of female gun deaths occurred in
domestic incidents, and 53% of female gun deaths in the last five years

guidance that the Minister has provided for the police on this issue is
to be
welcomed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000405" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000405">Such
statistics reinforce Labour’s call to ensure that applicants do
not have a history of domestic violence or violent conduct as a
statutory requirement and not just as a discretionary guideline. While
the last Labour Government went a long way to reducing crime and
encouraging safer, stronger communities, and introducing tough
sentences for gun crimes, too many people still believe the use of guns
to be an occupational consequence of their criminal activity. Perhaps
the most high-profile incident of gun crime was the appalling murder of

<?notus-xml column=557?>11-year-old schoolboy Rhys Jones in Liverpool in
2007. Sean Mercer was sentenced to life in prison, but what made the
incident even more sickening and unpalatable was that Mercer was just
18 years of age. That is why the Government are right to be tough on
those who possess prohibited firearms and who sell or transfer them to
criminal gangs, which blight neighbourhoods in so many of our major
cities.</hs_Para>

city, we have tried many innovative approaches to tackling gun crime.
Across Merseyside, the police and the local media deserve enormous
credit for the campaigns they have undertaken on firearm detection and
recovery. This is not just some right-wing tough-on-crime agenda; this
is an issue that primarily affects the lives of ordinary people up and
down the country, something that Parliament must ensure is reflected in
the strength of the laws that govern gun control licensing and in the
length of imprisonment. That is why I support clause 100, which seeks
to separate the existing offence in the Firearms Act 1968 into two
parts, and, in doing so, make it an offence to possess prohibited
firearms for sale and transfer, and introduce a maximum penalty of life
imprisonment.</hs_Para>

is also right for the clause to increase the maximum penalty for the
existing offences of manufacture, sale or transfer, or the purchase or
acquisition for sale or transfer, of unauthorised firearms from 10
years to life imprisonment. Speaking with Merseyside police and the
governors of local prisons, it is becoming increasingly clear that the
tactic deployed by gangs is to use the same firearm for different
shootings, but then to redistribute the gun to different members of the
gang as and when it is “needed”, so to speak. By making
the transfer of a firearm a crime punishable by a life sentence, I am
positive that this will act as a stronger deterrent, and that those who
ignore this change and are later prosecuted will receive severe
custodial sentences.</hs_Para>

of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 to increase
the maximum penalty for the unlawful importation of firearms,
prohibited under section 5 of the Firearms Act 1968, from 10 years to
life imprisonment. This is particularly important for an area such as
Liverpool, with our revitalised docks now shipping record tonnage of
trade. Inevitably, there will be those who wish to import illegal
firearms into the port. The clause sends a strong message to people
involved in the smuggling of weapons into Merseyside that if they are
caught, this activity will carry a life sentence.</hs_Para>

support clause 102 in its efforts to allow British Transport police
officers to carry firearms without requiring an individual certificate,
giving them the same powers as officers of other police forces. Many
incidences of gun attacks have taken place on public transport in

this specific threat.</hs_Para>

am keen for the laws on firearms to be as tough as possible. New clause
4, tabled by the Labour party, will help the Government to achieve this
common aim. New clause 4(4) notes the rising cost to police forces of
administering the current firearms licensing regime. According to the
Minister, more than 170,000 firearms licences and approximately 620,000
shotgun licences have been issued. The current fee for a firearm or a 
<?notus-xml column=558?>shotgun licence is only £50 for five years, yet the cost to the
administrating force is, according to the Gun Control Network, about
£200. Considering that the firearms licence averages out at just
£10 a year, it is cheaper to own a gun than it is to own a
fishing licence. That is absurd. I cannot see why the taxpayer is being
asked to subsidise a large number of gun licences that are being issued
to and used by a minority of individuals who wish to use guns for
recreational sport. I am not aware of any other licensing system that
subsidises to that degree.</hs_Para>

Rotheram:</Member></B> The hon. Lady is absolutely right that if the
burden can be transferred to another expense and taken from the police
force budgets to subsidise this practice, it could only be good for law
enforcement in the country. Last year, Devon and Cornwall police

firearms licence applications, but recouped only £514,000 in
fees—phenomenally disproportionate.</hs_Para>

Green:</Member></B> The protections are the new guidelines, the new
professional standards issued by the college and any recommendations
that Her Majesty’s inspectorate of constabulary comes up with
from its inspection. Those things will make the whole system more
robust, so that the specially trained individual police officers who
will be making those investigations will be better trained than ever
before to judge whether, for example, an accusation is malicious or
whether it is a genuine accusation and there is evidence of domestic
violence or abuse and that therefore the individual should not be
permitted to possess a firearm. Clearly, what one can expect and demand
in such cases is that the individual officer taking the decision is as
well trained as possible and is operating to very clear guidelines.
That will be the case, and it is the best protection against malicious
accusations. Equally, or perhaps more importantly, it protects those
who may have been victims of domestic abuse and who may be victims of
something worse if a gun is left in the wrong hands. That is what hon.
Members on both sides of the debate are seeking and, as I say, it is an
argument about practicality.</hs_Para>

answer to her question about e-commerce and the new system is that 24
forces are already signed up to phase 1, which comes into force either
this year or next year, with eight other forces involved in phase 2.
Thirty-two forces have therefore already agreed to do this, and I know
that the national

ensure that all other forces eventually sign up.</hs_Para>

made the point, quoting the Treasury document, about full cost
recovery. It is true that, in principle, full cost recovery within the
Treasury’s policy on managing public money does apply to
firearms licensing. Of course, we are in discussion with the Treasury
on the subject of firearms fees. As I said, we are working towards full
cost recovery as our ultimate objective. However, in this period our
commitment is to increase the efficiency of the licensing process, as a
first step. That is essential to achieve a balance between increased
income and increased efficiency. The trick—this is true in all
areas of public spending—is not to regard full cost recovery as
a given, because we can always bring the costs down. We have already
seen in the early pilots of the use of an electronic system for
licensing not only that people get a quicker and better service, but
that it is considerably cheaper for the police to operate, and so there
is a benefit all round. One hon. Member cited a figure of £200
from the Gun Control Network,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T21:40:47"></hs_TimeCode>and I know that
the police have come up with a figure of about £190 for full
cost recovery, but the figure will be much lower under an e-commerce
system. That is to the benefit of the police and of those applying for
licences, be it for working purposes, as is the case in many rural
parts of the country, or for recreation, which various hon. Members

subsidise people who want to have a gun and get a gun licence to the

Lucas</B> (Brighton, Pavilion) (Green):</Member> This petition has been
signed by almost 1,300 individuals, the vast majority of whom are
residents of my home city of Brighton and Hove. All are rail users who
are united by concerns at the rising cost of rail travel and the poor
quality of train services. They are particularly concerned that since
privatisation the cost of train travel has risen by 23% in real terms
and the cost to the public purse of running the railways has risen by a
factor of between two and three times. My constituents want to see the
public money invested in the railway used to deliver a better service
for passengers, while also achieving wider social and environmental
goals and real consideration given to bringing rail back into public
ownership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000974" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000974">The

to the history, the large, leased pubcos are not pub companies in any
real sense. They are highly leveraged property companies whose business
model is based on charging unreasonably high rents and outrageously
high prices for beer to their tenants. This goes back to the beer
orders. Prior to 1989, most pubs were tied to the large
brewers. It was believed, rightly, that this led to a substantial
restriction in the choice of products available to consumers, so the
beer orders restricted to 2,000 the number of pubs that could be owned
by and tied to a
brewer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000981" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000981"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:08:42"></hs_TimeCode>The

that they were on to a good thing, the pubcos, led by Punch, went on an
acquisition spree, buying up pubs for more than their actual value,
simply to inflate their share value artificially. In valuation terms,
the same yield or multiple was applied to inflate portfolio values,
with hypothetical wet rents being used, rather than actual numbers. To
maintain the wet rent at as high a level as possible, beer prices have
been increased year on year, substantially above the rate of inflation.
So as to inflate artificially the pub and estate values, and then to
borrow vast sums against that imaginary valuation, the companies were
adding to the dry rents the profits achieved by wholesaling beer to
create an overall rent. That led to the values being falsely
inflated<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:10:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000985" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000985">During

the Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley), has previously
raised. Enterprise Inns, for example, conducted an in-house study of
sales, profits and costs in a sample of its estate, and despite
establishing a much higher level of costs from that quoted to tenants,
it maintained utterly unrealistic low levels of business overheads that
barely allowed for repair and maintenance, let alone staffing, training
and business promotion. As we know, many tenants took on unsustainable
businesses, losing their entire life savings before inevitable business
failure. The situation was akin to loan sharks, with the misleading
presentation of the proposition, attractive terms of entry and often
initial discounts, but without the cold, hard, unsustainable reality
and the wholly unrealistic future that went with signing up being
spelled
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:16:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000994" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000994">Then
there was the role of valuers. It is odd that Humberts was the chosen
valuer of both large pub companies, Punch and Enterprise. It also helps
them to have their own man inside the Royal Institution of Chartered
Surveyors writing the valuation guidelines for the properties in their
sector so that they can be applied in their favour. Yes, it is
Enterprise Inns’ very own national rent controller, Rob May, who
has been overseeing the process since 2005. At one time he was the
chairman of the valuation party. Despite the obvious conflict of
interest, the interpretation of the new guidance is still controlled by
the group that Mr May participates in. Select Committees and the
Government have identified that there was confusion in the
interpretation and application of the new RICS guidance, and despite
requests even from the Department for Business, Innovation 
<?notus-xml column=572?>and Skills, RICS has simply referred the matter to Mr
May’s group. Did the Secretary of State and his officials know

there was another wheeze, involving rating. Knowing that most tied pubs
turn over little money, would it not be advantageous for the pubcos to
have a system of rating where all the usual rules were ignored in
favour of a special scheme whereby the rates paid by a company’s
tenants were artificially lowered using a scale based on turnover
rather than the usual method of looking at rent? Of course, if the
company’s tenants are paying lower rates, it can increase the
rental burden at rent reviews and, of course, increase the capital
value of its pub estate. Just £5,000 per annum per pub amounts
to £25 million per annum across 5,000 pubs, and the capital
value increases by up to £300 million all of a sudden. That was
all helped, unwittingly, by the taxpayer. Did the Secretary of State

there was the issue of full repairing and insuring leases. Suddenly,
the company that owned a building did not have to pay anything for
maintenance, inside or out—it was like a tenant renting a house
or flat and then having to maintain the entire property. Of course, the
pubco was heavily protected to ensure that it had as good an investment
as possible by passing on as many costs as possible to the
tenant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:18:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000997" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000997">The
key to the scam, of course, is double-overcharging. The pubcos derive
two rents. The dry rent is the fixed income for the property, the wet
rent the large profit derived from selling beer to the tenant at
inflated prices. In the recent Association of Licensed Multiple
Retailers survey, we see that far from being lower than open-market
free-of-tie rents, the dry rents alone that pubcos charge are higher.
That is a de facto abuse of the
tie<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:19:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Worse than
that, in a tied pub, with wet rent added to dry, rather than the usual
rent of 10% of turnover, the aggregate rent is fast approaching 20% of
sales, hence the incredibly derisory income derived by many
tenants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431000998" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431000998">Perhaps
the most suspicious part is the so-called wholesale price of
beer—an artificial instrument maintained to ensure that
excessive profits, over and above those that can be gained in the open
market, are available to companies that own pubs. No one in the free
trade pays the full wholesale price, or anyway near that amount, for
any beer, and only unfortunate tied publicans are subjected to that
excessive pricing. Far from being a discount, in reality tied tenants
are paying more than any right hon. and hon. Member would by going to
their local brewery.</hs_Para>

stark example, in six years an 11-gallon keg of Foster’s from
Enterprise has gone up from £107, excluding VAT, to
£151—an increase of £44. Data from wholesalers
show that in the free trade that keg cost £77 six years ago and
£87 today—an increase of £10. The same duty rates,
and the same increased manufacturing costs and overheads apply, yet the
price increase to a tied tenant has been nearly four and a half times
that of a free-of-tie publican over six years for the same product. If
that is not a manipulation of pricing, I do not know what is.</hs_Para>

to the enforcers—Brulines, or Vianet as it was recently
rebranded, knowing its already damaged reputation. It is pertinent to
note that the company was started by Derrick Collin, who was convicted
for blackmail and conspiracy in 1986. He devised the flow monitoring
technology that was to become Brulines. It is a rudimentary 
<?notus-xml column=573?>system, but instead of being used simply to check
flow as a helpful tool, it is used, through intimidation, to threaten
tenants and provide calculations for “buying-out fines.”
It has not been tested in situ by any formal agency, and is shown to be
highly inaccurate in several reports by experts, including one from a
trading standards officer. It could be considered to be in use in
trade, but at the moment it is not regulated under the
Weights and Measures Act 1986. It has no CE mark, no other
certification, and the lease documentation signed by lessees means that
if they are threatened by such fines, they risk legal costs of their
own to defend those charges. To be clear, no independent expert
evidence as to the accuracy of the system has yet been heard in court,
and I ask the Secretary of State to look at the issue again.</hs_Para>

is clearly a disaster for tied publicans, but also for the UK economy.
Look at the collapse of share prices: 95%, 98%—perhaps only an
80% collapse from Enterprise. Punch Taverns and Enterprise Inns have
arguably been in a form of passive administration for several years.
They are zombie companies that do not pay dividends, and they have no
growth plan or export potential. They just about pay the cost of their
debt by selling off their assets. That asset stripping is happening
now—slash and burn. Enterprise Inns and Punch Taverns, the two
largest pubcos, collectively disposed of more than 5,000 pubs between
2008 and 2012—one third of all of their pubs. No other part of
the sector has experienced anything like that level of disposal and
failure.</hs_Para>

technique used to generate even more profit is the use of
“churn”, which involves forcing the failure of tenants
over time and replacing them periodically. That enables the pub company
to retain rent deposits, pursue personal guarantees, take new deposits
and ingoing costs, and perhaps charge a higher rent over time to the
new tenant. Data leaked from Punch in 2009 and released to the media
showed that the pub company “churns” as much as 25% of
its entire estate in any one year, and that average individual tenants
might be expected to last no longer than three years in their pub.
Enterprise Inns’ 2013 interim results reveal that of its 5,720
pub tenants, 1,463—more than 25%—have been in occupation
for less than a year.</hs_Para>

situation is also bad for the taxpayer. The taxpayer-owned Lloyds bank
had to write off some £600 million when Admiral Taverns went
into administration in 2010. Similarly, Royal Bank of Scotland acquired

only way to do that is the Select Committee solution—the market

certainty and confidence for brewers, more jobs and investment in
brewers, good news for smaller brewers, who would have greater access
to market, and good news for consumers, who would see a greater choice
of beer and a cheaper pint in pubcos. I ask my right hon. Friend to
look out for the new research coming from the Federation of Small
Businesses tomorrow, and I ask him to sit down with his officials and

market rent only option would save pubs because it would stop the kind
of asset stripping that is going on around the country. The provisions
of tied leases and tenancies enable pubcos and others to circumvent the
Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 security of tenure protection. When sites
are very valuable for development, pub companies are changing terms and
applying pressure to drive tenants out. I can show my right hon. Friend
cases—there are some close to him—where that is clearly
happening<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:28:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431001010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0004.htm#13101431001010">In
conclusion, pubs will continue to be viable businesses, despite
changing times, but they will no longer be a guaranteed source of
over-rentalisation for property companies, whether they brew or not.
That model is gone. It is nearly dead, but without the market rent only
option it will take down thousands more pubs in its death throes. The
great British pubco scam has done 
<?notus-xml column=575?>huge damage to pubs and the UK economy, but as long as the overcharging
is allowed to continue, this will happen. I gently point my right hon.
Friend, for whom I have great respect, in the direction of his 2010
speech about “spivs and gamblers” and the reckless
behaviour that brought the UK banking sector to its knees. Having heard

the Member for Leeds North West (Greg Mulholland) for raising the issue

that he has played an enormous and disproportionate role in getting the

pubcos in general. Although many of the abuses he described were highly
specific, they are not unique to the pubco industry. We saw problems of
over-leverage in a whole set of industries, notably banking, and the
horrible consequences of that. He has provided examples of another

We are all aware of the ALMR benchmarking survey that shows that for
the second year running tied pub rent has exceeded the free-of-tie rent
as a proportion of turnover. Tied rents as a proportion of turnover
were 10.7% whereas for the free-of-tie rent the figure was 9%. He has

me make a few general points to round up the debate. There is consensus
on both sides of the House that although this is an important industry
that makes a significant contribution to the economy, it is also an
area in which many of the publicans who communicate with us have a
strong sense of facing hardship, adversity and unfairness. I
acknowledge the work of the Select Committee on Business, Innovation
and Skills over the years as well as that of the all-party save the pub
group in raising awareness of the issue.</hs_Para>

described as coming out tomorrow—the Fair Deal For Your Local

together much of the material in this area. We have had four Select
Committee reports on whether the tied model causes an imbalance in
bargaining power and we have received a vast amount of correspondence
from tenants. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T22:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>We

the short time I have, I should stress that the tied business model, as
opposed to abuses of it in recent years, is probably not the main
source of the problems in the industry. I am not sure how far my hon.
Friend agrees with that, but the number of pubs has been declining for
three decades at least—there were 70,000 in 1980 and there are
50,000 today. Neither the 1989 beer orders nor the pub company
consolidation, which is the source of the problems he describes,
brought about a major change in the rate of decline. There have been
bigger and deeper problems in the commercial property market, in which
over-leverage was a common
feature.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431001019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0005.htm#13101431001019">However,
I appreciate that his central point—this is the concern of hon.
Members on both sides of the House—is not the rate of closures,
but the low incomes prevalent in the tied centre and the impact they
have. The question throughout is how we deal with those abuses.
Initially, we hoped that self-regulation would work. As we know, there
was an agreement between the pubcos and tenant groups in November 2011.
The pubs independent conciliation and arbitration service and an
industry framework code were introduced, but they have not gone far
enough, and the problems
persist.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101431001020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/debtext/131014-0005.htm#13101431001020">There

business support priorities. In recognition of this, BIS

local growth fund, already confirmed at the spending round as worth at
least £2 billion for the whole of the next

identified by LEPs in their strategic economic plans. The local growth
fund underlines the Government’s commitment to the devolution of
economic powers from central Government to local areas, putting
business-led LEPs, working with their local partners, at the heart of

proposals for direct entry in the police, as set

published an estimated range of costs for ECO, with a central scenario
of around £1.3 billion per annum on average. Although, as the IA
explained, there are a large number of variables and uncertainties
relating to this figure, we have seen no evidence to date that would
lead us to change this estimate. For example, 
<?notus-xml column=429?>over £250 million of ECO compliance has now been traded on the
brokerage platform with prices in line with the £1.3 billion
estimate. The ECO companies also report on their costs of delivery to
Ofgem and initial indications are again broadly consistent with our
original cost estimates.</hs_Para>

Barker:</Member></B> The EC directive on renewable energy defines the
renewable energy from a heat pump as the total usable heat less the
energy used to drive the heat pump. The "Seasonal Performance Factor"
(SPF) of a heat pump, a measure of its efficiency, is defined as the
heat output divided by the energy input. This means that the
corresponding renewable energy can be defined as the heat output times
(1 - 1/SPF). The directive also sets a minimum SPF for heat pump
outputs to be defined as renewable under the terms of the directive.
For electrically driven heat pumps, this is currently 2.5; for heat
driven ones, it is 1.15. When this is achieved the renewable component
is at least 60% of the total heat output of an electrically driven heat
pump, and 13% of a heat driven one. For electric heat pumps with an SPF
of 3.0, the share is 67%. We estimate that most (electric) heat pumps
operating in UK houses have SPFs in the range 2.5 to 3, and we are
undertaking a major monitoring programme of installations under the
renewable heat premium payment (RHPP)

10,000 premises each week. By the spring of 2014 it is anticipated that
25,000 premises per week will be gaining availability to superfast
broadband and by the summer of 2014 that will rise up to 40,000 per

addition, the Government is removing a swathe of red tape to avoid
potential delays to the roll out of infrastructure. Measures are in
place to relax the planning restrictions for new cabinets, poles and
overhead lines, and mobile infrastructure, to speed up and reduce costs
to communications providers rolling out broadband. The Government is
leading discussions with key players to improve the co-ordination of
street works and achieve value for money in relation to power supplies
to cabinets as part of the rural broadband programme. The wayleave
regime governing the installation of equipment on private land is also
to be reformed which should help speeding up the installation of

tables show the total number of the listed offences of human

noted that the statistical discrepancy between the two totals is a
result of an international policing operation which identified a high
volume of offences in the 2012-13 year, as listed under two Crime
Records. As a consequence, the high numbers of victims identified by
MPS were, with the authority of the Crime Force Registrar, not recorded
under usual procedures but instead listed along with the details of
separate investigation reports, so would require significant further
analysis by MPS to report. In addition, the nationality of victims was
not recorded in all cases by MPS, for a variety of operational

three primary routes for advice—help lines, website and public
enquiry offices. Consistency comes from the overarching policy
frameworks, from which customer advice is given, and that advice is
further checked by quality sampling, audits and reviews of policy and
website content. All policy exceptions are also referred to senior
caseworkers for clarification or approval. Customer feedback, including
complaints, also provides a valuable measure of the consistency and

Harper</Member></B> <I>[holding answer 12 September 2013]:</I> Central
records on the UK's participation in Joint Investigation Teams (JITs)
with other EU member states have only been held since October 2010, at
which point member states were obliged to notify their national
representatives at Eurojust, the EU Judicial Co-operation Agency, when
setting up a JIT. Consequently, the figures for 2009 and 2010 may not
represent the total number of JITs the UK was involved in, but instead
they provide a minimum number. Information provided by Eurojust
indicates that the number of Joint Investigation Teams commenced in
each of the last five calendar years involving UK authorities is as

or legal guardians in a child's passport. The inclusion of parental
responsibility details in the passport would not reduce the requirement
for border staff to be satisfied with the relationship between the
accompanying adult and the child. The inclusion of parental details in
the child's passport would only reflect the information provided at the
time of the issuing of the passport. Border Force staff would still
need to determine whether an entry in the child's passport remained
relevant at the time of travel and establish the accompanying adult's
relationship with the child. Further advice on travelling with children

one improvement notice to Babcock, as the nuclear site licensee, in

It was issued on 16 July 2013, following a number of events in which
operations were not carried out in accordance with DRDL's health and
safety operating instructions; and the statutory provisions of the
Management of Health and Safety at Work regulations. Although satisfied
that this issue did not have an immediate impact on safety, and that
DRDL had already taken action to remedy some of the problems, ONR's
opinion was that

much to be gained from undertaking the planned analysis to understand
the needs of this client group, the Ethics Committee considered that
the individual medical benefit likely to stem from the sharing of
information on any individual was not sufficiently demonstrated. It is
likely to be the case that if there are indirect medical benefits
realised, it may be in respect of future cohorts of people in
treatment, rather than individuals whose data was used to inform the

individually as local councils issue multiple cases that are heard at a

relate to, or how many defendants attended. The only way we may be able

usually about the facts of a case, and are designed to be
user-friendly, so having a lawyer isn't usually necessary. We have also
removed legal aid for certain immigration judicial reviews. The

asylum cases, where the person fears for their life if sent

HMCTS currently has 105 magistrates (volunteers) that sit at Dudley
magistrates court and live in Dudley. All of these magistrates have
been involved in pre-consultation meetings and all have had a copy of
the consultation document to consider. HMCTS will continue to offer
sittings on dates and at centres where they

If the proposed listing pattern is implemented, the long-term viability
of Dudley magistrates courthouse would be; following consultation with
judiciary, stakeholders and court users, to use the courthouse to
accommodate family, civil and tribunals (CFT) hearings. In contrast to
the decreasing criminal work load, the CFT work load is increasing and
there is a requirement for additional court estates to accommodate this
rise. This would provide court users with local services which at
present are only available in Wolverhampton and Walsall. HMCTS does
keep its estates under constant review to ensure that it meets
operational needs. The proposals in the consultation are designed to
make better use of our estate and the judicial resources available in
the black country to improve the service we provide to all court users.
We can confirm that there are no plans to close Dudley
courthouse.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310158000698" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/text/131014w0003.htm#1310158000698">(3)
There are no plans to make any staff redundant. In the eventuality that
staff are required to undertake duties in neighbouring courts, HMCTS
will undertake and comply with all statutory consultation procedures.
It is proposed that Dudley courthouse will accommodate civil, family
and tribunal hearings which will require staff resources thus reducing,
possibly eliminating the need to ask staff to travel to neighbouring
centres.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310158000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/text/131014w0003.htm#1310158000699">(4)
The consultation has been managed by a group of senior magistrates and
senior managers within HMCTS all of whom work in the west midlands, the
black country and Warwickshire. There has been a lot of
pre-consultation, inter-agency engagement with court users, police,
CPS, GeoAmey, Victim and Witness Delivery Group, prisons, DVLA and
local solicitors to ensure that the needs of all linked agencies are
considered. There have also been three consultation meetings with HMCTS
staff, police, probation, CPS, magistrates and judiciary to assess the
listing proposals. In addition to this, the project group has held
individual meetings with GeoAmey, probation, police and youth
offending, witness service and the Legal Aid Agency to ensure that all
stakeholders have been involved and any challenges faced addressed
prior to consultation. A copy of the consultation paper has been
distributed to in excess of 70 separate bodies; responses to be
received by 21 October 2013. All parties/agencies will be
involved in final implementation

Vara:</Member></B> A comprehensive framework of civil remedies and
criminal offences is available to deal with stalking and harassment.
This framework was strengthened by this Government by amendments to the
Protection from Harassment Act 1997 made by the Protection of Freedoms
Act 2012. The offences of harassment and stalking require a person to
pursue a course of conduct which amounts to the harassment or stalking
of another person—a course of conduct is therefore an element of
the offence which must be proven in order to secure a conviction. A
course of conduct must involve conduct on at least two
occasions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310158001109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/text/131014w0004.htm#1310158001109">In
determining the appropriate sentence in each case the court will take
account of all the circumstances including the level and nature of the
contact. The sentencing guidelines for harassment offences make clear
that where there is persistent contact over a longer period there is a
greater degree of harm and the sentence should be aggravated
accordingly.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_14_PT_1/9B11E91B594E30AC6C25761723F5EE40777D79A2" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="14 October 2013">Monday

subsidised by passengers on services run by franchised operators as
explained in my earlier answer today (UIN 169873). Open access
operators on the East Coast route have typically delivered lower levels
of performance than the franchised operator, in part because they
operate relatively old diesel trains. Other diverse rail providers,

selected on the basis of a competitive request for proposals process.
The trial intends to pilot discounted ticket types which will have an
impact on the revenue of the selected train operating company. The
Department is therefore funding the trial to cover both these and
relevant administrative and system costs. As this will be a competitive
process in order to secure the best value for money, it would not be

improved customer experience and contains the explicit treatment of
non-financial factors (quality) in assessing and awarding new
franchises. In the fares and ticketing review, published 9 October, we
stated that, although we will not expect to specify in detail how train
companies should upgrade their ticket machines, we want them to have
the flexibility to tailor their ticketing package to local needs and
drive continuous improvement in customer service. Other measures in the
review such as the code of practice on ticketing information, and
improvements to the way we manage ticket office changes, will also
encourage operators to consider investment in this area.</hs_Para>

no assessment has been undertaken by the Department for Transport on
the use of LED lighting, a number of trials and reviews have been

these suggest LED lighting can be more energy efficient and
environmentally friendly than traditional lighting and also gives rise
to better colour identification. As LEDs have a longer life expectancy
when compared to a traditional lamp, implementing such a change in
street lighting can result in both energy and maintenance savings for
councils. However, any benefits need to be considered in the context of
the role that street lighting plays in each local area that it

melatonin status and sleeping patterns in relation to changes in street

whiter light, as from LED street lighting, is more effective in
suppressing melatonin production than the red/orange light from
traditional street lighting. Such an effect may be helpful in keeping
drivers alert and preventing accidents. Recognising that people will
generally be able to use curtains or blinds to exclude externally
arising light from their homes, Public Health England do not see

barriers to the provision of safe abortion services, including legal

beliefs held by individuals and agencies. DFID's position is clear: we
believe that access to safe abortion reduces recourse to unsafe
abortion and thus saves women's and adolescent girls' lives. Girls and
women must have the right to make their own decisions about their
sexual and reproductive health and well-being, and be able to choose
whether, when and how many children to have. Our position is consistent

consistent with the key message of the International Humanist and

exists to protect the rights of individuals to manifest their beliefs,
not to protect the beliefs themselves. The report records a sharp
increase in the number of prosecutions for alleged criticism of
religion by atheists on social media. Protecting freedom of expression
online is a priority for the British Government and we have
consistently argued against attempts to create a new international

criticism.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101522000810" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131014/text/131014w0005.htm#13101522000810">We

deposit orders on weak elements of claims. An initial sift process,
conducted by judges has also been introduced to help identify and
manage weak claims earlier in proceedings. In addition, claimants now
have to pay a fee to bring an employment tribunal case. Fees will help
claimants consider whether alternative forms of dispute resolution,
such as the free conciliation service provided by ACAS, are more
appropriate for resolving workplace disputes. From next year, claimants
will be required to contact ACAS in the first instance and consider
early conciliation before being able to proceed to an employment

All regions of the UK which fell into the Convergence (i.e. Cornwall

Allocations to all other wealthier (i.e. Competitiveness) areas outside

The combination of the Government's application of a basket of
indicators and a safety net had the effect of directing relatively high

£13.5 million for new humanitarian funding in Kachin State which

This is because the number of cases handled (often known as caseload),
is most effectively and safely determined at the local level by the
organisation providing the health visitor service. This approach
ensures that local factors, particularly the demographics of the
population and the associated level of need, can help determine not
