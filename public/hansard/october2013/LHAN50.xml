Knight of Collingtree (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, is it not the case
that, whatever else can be denied, secondary reasons may come into the
decision? However, when the main reason for the terminations about
which I am questioning the Government is that the coming child is a
female, it seems to me as a human being and a female, as it does to
millions of others, that that cannot possibly be right. Does my noble
and learned friend accept that those of us who took part in the debates
on the Abortion Bill in 1967 did not dream for one moment that it was
necessary to put down an amendment to protect girl babies? Had we done
so, I 
<?notus-xml column=172?>do not think that the Bill could ever possibly have
been passed. Finally, is it not extremely dangerous that the law of the
land should allow killing on gender grounds at any
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:20:50"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I know of the
long-standing interest that my noble friend has had in this issue,
going back, as she indicated, to the passage of the initial
legislation. Given the reporting, people might well think that this
case was about medical practitioners offering abortion on the basis of
the gender of the child. In those circumstances, it would seem
incomprehensible that the full force of the criminal law was not being
brought to bear on a practice which most of us would consider
abhorrent. However, if one reads the full note provided by the Director
of Public Prosecutions earlier this week, which I will make available
in the Library, one will see that on the facts of the case it would not
have been possible to prove that either doctor authorised an abortion
on gender-specific grounds alone. It is a far more complex case than
that. Indeed, the criteria used were those set out in Section 1 of the
Abortion Act
1967<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:21:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Morris of Aberavon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, first, there have been
differing reports as to whether there was a realistic prospect of
prosecution, and I wonder whether the Minister could clarify that
again. Secondly, on the public interest point, did the director consult
the Attorney-General on this very issue, and what exactly were the
public interest points against prosecution in the case which has been
very much in the
newspapers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:22:23"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, with regard to the first
point that the noble and learned Lord raises, the note that the
Director of Public Prosecutions has set out indicates that the evidence
was not strong and that the prospects of conviction would not have been
high but that, on balance, there was just sufficient prosecution to
provide a realistic prospect of a conviction. As the noble and learned
Lord well knows, there is a second test—the public interest
test. The view taken by the Crown Prosecution Service was that the jury
would have had no independent yardstick of professional practice by
which to assess the facts of the case—hence the need for the
greater clarity which is now being sought. On the other question that
he asked, the Director of Public Prosecutions did not consult the
Attorney-General before the decision was made not to prosecute. My
right honourable friend the Attorney-General has obviously had
subsequent discussions with the Director of Public Prosecutions in the
context of the review and, without in any way wishing to infringe on
the independence of the prosecutor, he believes that the decision was
taken in a proper and conscientious
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:23:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Walton of Detchant (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, does the noble and
learned Lord accept that there are a number of potentially lethal
genetically determined diseases which are transmitted by an X-linked
recessive mechanism and hence affect only boys? Does he therefore
accept that, unless the availability of pre-implantation diagnosis were
available, a female carrier of such a potentially lethal gene would be
fully entitled to abort an affected male
foetus?</hs_para>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I certainly bow to the
medical knowledge of the noble Lord—I do not pretend
to come anywhere near it. However, there is reference in the
BMA’s code of ethics and law regarding this factor, where there
may be issues that could relate to gender and a medical condition.
Indeed, my understanding is that in the two cases that have given rise
to the current controversy, the patient concerned indicated
that she had had previous serious difficulties in a female pregnancy
due to genetic abnormalities. That is why it was not possible, in the
view of the Crown Prosecution Service, to prove that the procedure was
conducted purely on the grounds of gender
selection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:25:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I am certainly cognisant
of the strong views that are held about this Act and its operation. One
of the clear things emerging from this case is the great need to have
clearer guidance for doctors on how to carry out their functions and
the tests that are set down in Section 1 of the Abortion Act. I am
confident that that will now be addressed. Certainly, the Crown
Prosecution Service stands ready to assist in any way to provide that
clarity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:26:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Steel of Aikwood" PimsId="4110" UID="13101062000550" xid="1445" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000550">Lord

Wallace of Tankerness:</Member></B> My Lords, I entirely agree with my
noble friend that gender selection as a ground for abortion is wholly
repugnant. It is quite clear that that is the very strong view of
Members of your Lordships’ House. While abortions did not take
place in this particular case, attempting to commit a criminal
offence—that is, doing something that goes further than just
preparing to commit it—is a crime in its own right and it is on
that basis that the Crown Prosecution Service looked at the facts of
this case. I do not know yet when the General Medical Council will come
forward with any revised guidance; I have indicated that I think that
it is necessary. However, the Chief Medical Officer will be writing
again very shortly to all doctors involved in abortion provision,
setting out the Department of Health’s views on sex-selection
abortions—making it clear that sex-selection abortions are not
acceptable—as well as pre-signing of certificate forms and other
relevant issues, highlighting the need for doctors to keep up to date
with legal provisions in the
Act.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/87F327BCAFBD06CEAFF4A8E0F4BDF0D461432089" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 October 2013">Thursday,

cynicism in failing to abolish this House and now packing it with

course, we would like to be in a situation where we did not need to
debate parity of esteem, but I start from one simple fact. We have 6
million adults in England suffering from depression or crippling
anxiety disorders, and of them only a quarter are in treatment. You can
compare that with people with physical conditions where, in most cases,
more than 90% are in treatment. The same is true of children: only a
quarter of those who would be diagnosed as mentally ill are in
treatment. That is not parity of esteem; it is a really deplorable
situation. What is the reason? The reason is the lack of parity in the
provision of care; that is the central reason.</hs_para>

course, medication is available for most people who come forward with
those problems, but most of them would prefer, or would want
in addition, psychological therapy. We have excellent psychological
therapies with 50% recovery rates for anxiety and depression
conditions, for children’s disorders and so on, and NICE has
reviewed all of them and recommends that psychological therapies ought
to be offered to all patients with mental health problems. However,
that recommendation is largely disregarded in huge areas of the country
where those therapies are not available. Let me give just one extra
argument why they should be available—other than the obvious
humanitarian argument that we should treat people who are ill; that is
why we have a health service. In this case, there are also huge savings
to be had if we treated them. Those savings in welfare benefits and
extra taxes would pay for the cost of the psychological therapy. That
is a complete, 100% offset. Another probable 100% offset is in the cost
of additional physical care that mentally ill people
demand<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000066">So
the argument for making those therapies available is overwhelming, but
it is happening very slowly. As Sir Mike Rawlings, the former chairman
of NICE says, this is the area in the whole of the NHS where NICE
recommendations are the most flagrantly and casually disregarded. If
the same thing happened with cancer or heart disease, there would be
uproar. That is why what happened in this House two years ago was so
important. It was the landmark moment for millions of people because
the amendment that we passed in this House introduced the principle of
parity between mental and physical health. The issue that we must
discuss today is what that means. That was not said in the Bill. We
need to discuss exactly what that means and how we would know if we got
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:54:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

simple principles. First, NICE guidelines should be as faithfully
implemented for mental illness as they are for physical illness. That
is a very simple principle. Secondly, treatment should be provided
speedily when it is needed, as it generally is in the case of mental
illness. Those two basic principles should guide the way
forward<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:55:18"></hs_TimeCode>. How do
we get from here to where we need to be? The mandate, which is now
under discussion, is the key. I very much hope that the Minister can
help us with some improvements in the draft of the mandate which has
been circulated for
comment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000068">Let
me start with waiting times. It is shocking that there are waiting
times for hospital treatments and no waiting times for psychological
therapy. This is not acceptable. Depression and anxiety are pressing
conditions; more pressing than some physical conditions, although
obviously less pressing in most cases than cancer. With cancer we talk
about two weeks. It seems clear that we should be aiming at a maximum
wait for access to psychological therapy of 28 days. Many people have
argued this. I very much hope that that can be included in the
mandate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000069">Of
course, that raises the question of what scale of service would be
needed to achieve that objective. The main provider of psychological
therapy in the NHS is Improving Access to Psychological
Therapies—the programme known as IAPT, launched in 2008. It has
been very energetically and faithfully supported by Ministers from all
political parties, for which everyone is extremely grateful. The
programme grew rapidly, but 80% of those treated still wait for more
than 28 days. Some wait for more than 12 months. Waiting
lists are rising as people become aware that there is some hope in
their
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:57:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000070">How
large a service is needed to implement the NICE guidelines for all who
need them? By 2011, in the third to fourth full year of the programme,
the programme was seeing more than half a million people. But that of
course is only 10% of the 6 million with the condition. Since 2011, the
programme has stalled due mainly to poor priorities on the part of
local commissioners, the dislocation of the messages coming down to
them and the pressure on them from the higher levels of the NHS as it
is being
reorganised.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000071">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T11:59:37"></hs_TimeCode>
think we can all agree that 10% is a completely unacceptable figure.
The Government have already committed to 15% by 2015, but even that
deals only with the tip of the iceberg. From our experience in
the first three and four years of the programme, it
would be feasible to reach a figure of 25% by 2020. I would
urge the Government to be thinking in those
terms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000072">The
Government, rightly, will want to have people not only treated but
recovering. That is the right way to be thinking and that is where the
IAPT programme is so strong because we know how many people recover.
Patients are monitored on a meeting-by-meeting basis and there is now a
45% recovery rate for the patients who have two or more sessions. The
Government target is 50% and the right way to express a vision for 2020
would be the numbers of people who have recovered as a result of
treatment.</hs_para>

Government will be giving some indication of that longer term
perspective in the mandate. It is really important because we can get
good people to train as therapists for the service only if they see
that the number of jobs will go on expanding. We will get commissioners
to commission this service at an expanding rate only if they see that
they are expected to do that and block in increasing sums. Too many of
these commissioners have concluded that they have done what they need
to for IAPT, which is how it has stalled. It has to be restarted, so I
urge the Minister to include at least some phrase in the mandate, if he
can, such as “continuing expansion of access up to 2020, linked
to 50% recovery rates”. Some phrase of that sort would show that
the Government and the service are serious about this. We know that the
good will is enormous towards IAPT on the part of the coalition
Government, but can they please set this down in some concrete way that
commissioners can read and see that they have to act on?</hs_para>

financial constraints and commissioners are always tempted to dumb down
in areas which look like soft targets. Incredibly, one commissioner
will not pay for any patient receiving more than two sessions unless
they can be shown to have recovered. This is an outrage but there are
many who will pay only up to a maximum of six sessions for any one
patient, as if they would cut an operation short if it happened to need
more than the standard time. This is absolutely unacceptable
discrimination and it is rife throughout the commissioning system. How
can we deal with it? It would be by pressure of all kinds
from above and, of course, with a constant emphasis on outcomes. I
place great hope on the measurement of outcomes as the ultimate source
of pressure on commissioners. When we get to outcomes-based payments,
which we may in a few years’ time, we must again resist the
pressure to dumb down by leaving the tariff price free for the local
commissioner. There has to be the national reference cost, otherwise
this will again be the soft area which gets dumbed down.</hs_para>

comment on the IAPT programme. It is currently in the list of 10
services suitable for “any qualified provider” treatment,
together with incontinency services, wheelchairs and a few other
things. Is the treatment of depression and anxiety really worthy of
being treated like that? A recent study from the World Health
Organisation compared the disabling effect of depression with that of
angina, asthma, arthritis and diabetes. I hope it is not surprising to
Members of this House that depression was 50% more disabling than each
of those four conditions. One wonders why those four were not included
in the list, together with incontinency and wheelchair services. If
there is confusion about parity of esteem at the centre, no wonder
there is even more confusion at the local level.</hs_para>

depression and anxiety disorders. There are many other mental health
problems for adults, and of course for children as well, which I am
sure other noble Lords will talk about. But I want to mention just one
general point: research. According to the WHO, mental illness accounts
for 38% of all illness when weighted by severity in this country and
23% of the total burden of disease, including premature mortality. But
what percentage of health research goes 
<?notus-xml column=185?>on mental health? It is 5%. We need much more mental health
research. We need more trials on therapies other than CBT
and many more on therapies for children. For adults we do not even know
about effective group treatment, which could be very economical and
effective compared with individual treatment, and so on. Most trials in
mental health are very short follow-ups compared with the decade-long
trials for treatment of physical illness. All this should be changed
and there should be some statement about it this at this point,
although it cannot be changed overnight.</hs_para>

Minister will reassure us on the four points I have raised—the
28-day maximum wait; the commitment to continued expansion; taking
psychological therapy out of the degrading position of coming under
AQP, which leads to many of these terrible commissioning decisions; and
more research for mental health, especially psychological therapy. We
know that the political pressures coming for psychological therapy are
trivial compared to the pressures on politicians from those who suffer
from most physical illnesses—especially, of course, those which
are helped by the pharmaceutical industry—but one third of all
families include someone with a mental health problem. Many are silent
because of shame, but I think that they will privately thank any
politician who shows that they understand their
problems<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:05:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000078">It
is an amazing fact that mental illness, as the surveys show, causes
more misery in our society than physical illness does,
causes much more than unemployment or poverty do and costs the
Exchequer £60 billion. It is extraordinary that it still has
such a low priority on the ground. I think that we still live in the
materialistic shadow of William Beveridge. As noble Lords know, he
identified five great giants—poverty; unemployment;
undereducation; poor housing; and physical illness—but he
omitted the problems of the human spirit within. This has caused us
decades of unnecessary misery. It is time to name the sixth giant, the
great, hidden problem in our society, and that is mental illness. If it
had parity of esteem, it would have its own Cabinet Minister, like the
other subjects I just mentioned. Perhaps the best test of when we
eventually have parity of esteem is when we have a Cabinet Minister for
mental health. I beg to

McColl of Dulwich (Con):</Member></B> I thank the noble Lord, Lord
Layard, for initiating this important debate. As a medical student I
was rather surprised to hear professionals refer to patients with
psychiatric conditions as “nutters” and “away with
the fairies”, among similar comments. As the noble Lord, Lord
Layard, said, we do not ridicule people with heart failure or cancer;
why do we do it with mental illness? This made me rather interested in
psychiatry and I did think of entering that profession, or trying to
enter it, but that came to an end when I presented a patient to a
psychiatrist, who shall be nameless, having spent a lot of time taking
a history from the patient and writing it all up carefully. I started
presenting it to the psychiatrist and half way through, he started
laughing. I said, “What’s the joke?”. He said,
“He’s a psychopath”. I said, “I know
he’s a psychopath but what exactly is the 
<?notus-xml column=186?>joke?”. “Well, we can’t do anything for
him.” I thought that was totally inappropriate and I learned
later that the psychiatrists call that “incongruity of
affect”. Anyway, that put me off
psychiatry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:08:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000080">It
is not surprising that people with psychiatric problems feel isolated
and abused and find it very difficult to talk about their problems, so
all credit to Alastair Campbell, Stephen Fry and others who have spoken
openly about their own illness. This has encouraged others to do the
same. There is, of course, great misunderstanding about so much of
mental illness. Take, for instance, Alzheimer’s. Over the years
I have been consulted by many people, some of them in this House, about
their relatives with Alzheimer’s and how they find it so
irritating that they keep asking the same question and so on. The
principles are quite simple: you do not ask a patient with
Alzheimer’s any questions and you do not argue with them. When
they do things that seem very inappropriate, you ask the question,
“Does that matter in terms of eternity?”. I remember that
once a patient was frying bacon in honey. I was just a very junior
registrar in cooking, and I was not sure if this might be some recent
recipe. The meal was delicious; it was impossible to clean the frying
pan afterwards, but that did not seem to matter. I have also found it
important that they have as much independence as possible. That
sometimes means taking risks, but it is well worth
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:10:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000081">In
the old days, in the 1950s and 1960s, I found it very difficult to get
psychiatrists to come to the accident and emergency department. I do
not know why that was, but they would never come. One day I was in
trouble and I needed help in A&amp;E. I rang the psychiatric department
and a lady answered the phone. When I explained that I was in
difficulty and asked her to come and help, she said, “I would be
delighted to come”. I nearly fell on the floor; I had never had
that response before. She was terrific. Her name was Ros Furlong, and
she became a very distinguished psychiatrist. I mention that because it
seemed to me that when women started coming into psychiatry,
it changed things. Mind you, if you go back to 1945 or 1946, before
there were many women in medicine, medical schools were a bit of a
rough house. On one occasion a lecture was about to start and ex-Wing
Commander Twistington-Higgins said to ex-Able Seaman Smith, who was
wearing bell-bottomed trousers, “Smith, you’re improperly
dressed”, whereupon ex-Able Seaman Smith stood up, picked up the
ex-wing commander and knocked him straight out. However, when women
came into medicine, the whole thing became rather more

wife had Alzheimer’s for the last five years of her life. I pay
tribute to the Maudsley Hospital, which was superb in all its help,
especially Professor Simon Lovestone, who is a brilliant psychiatrist
and a most kindly man. I got to know him quite well, and I told him the
story of how I wanted to be a psychiatrist but was put off by the
psychiatrists themselves. He said, “My experience is exactly the
reverse”. He had wanted to be a surgeon but he met a
psychiatrist called Colin Godber, who was a
psychogeriatrician—the crème de la crème of the
psychiatric world. Colin Godber asked him if he would like to come and
visit a patient at home. They went there, the patient prepared a nice
cream tea and then played the piano for half an
hour, 
<?notus-xml column=187?>and then they went home. He said to Colin,
“He didn’t seem to be much of a patient”.
“Oh no, he wasn’t the patient,” said Godber,
“It was his wife. I looked after her, and this week
is the anniversary of her death. She died two years ago, and on the
anniversary I always go and have tea

the noble Lord, Lord Layard, has mentioned, one-third of the population

sexually abused. At a meeting in No.10 Downing Street some years ago,
there were 20 of us in a room discussing this very problem. Without
thinking, I said, “Of course, at least 10% of children are
sexually abused”. They were horrified and just would not believe
it. In fact, one of them said, “There are 20 of us here. Do you
mean that two are involved?”. I said, “Well, it does go
across the board”. We now know that it is much higher than 10%.
We know that one in four women is abused in one way or another, which
means that millions of men are smashing up millions of women. It also

Stone of Blackheath (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there is a great deal
of expertise here today on this subject. I am no expert, but I have two
perspectives based on my particular experiences. The first is as chair
of the award -winning health charity DIPEx. We have spent
10 years researching, in depth and on camera through the
Health Experiences Research Group at Oxford University,
patients’ experiences of illness. We publish them on the
internet for free as www.healthtalkonline.org and
www.youthhealthtalk.org. We have completed 75 separate
modules of different illnesses, each with more than a year’s
interviewing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000086">We
have covered a wide range of physical illnesses, including most of the
cancers, heart conditions, diabetes and osteoporosis. We have also
researched mental conditions such as depression, experiences of
psychosis, dementia and life on the autism spectrum, and we are about
to launch a recently completed module on the use of
antidepressants.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=188?><hs_para UID="13101062000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000087">I want to relate here
some of the observations from patients’ perspectives. First,
patients living with physical, mental and social needs must be seen as
actor-agents in their own recovery. The Centre for Mental Health has
said that we should ensure that people using mental health services are
equal partners in their care and support, with full respect for their
needs, wishes and human
rights.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000088">Secondly,
our senior researcher Susan Kirkpatrick, conducting interviews with the
www.healthtalkonline.org patients from the recent antidepressant module
to be launched in November, says that while people feel that an
antidepressant may be helpful, most say that they benefit most from a
combination of medication and therapeutic help. However, the
effectiveness of therapeutic treatments seems not to be proven to the
satisfaction of those prescribing these medications. The new charity,
MQ, has said that to achieve parity of care, we must also have parity
of research. MQ is one of the few organisations in the field that does
not take sides. It believes that medication and therapies deserve equal
research, and says that there is a huge gap between the cost of mental
illness and its research funding, as has been mentioned. The UK should
capitalise on its role as a leader in research and become one in
developing better treatments for mental
illness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000089">Thirdly,
as my noble friend has mentioned, for some patients a long waiting time
for therapeutic help proves frustrating and even debilitating, and in
some mental health cases can be fatal. Here is a disparity. It seems
that the system can understand the urgencies in a case of physical
illness but with mental illness it feels that the patient can wait. The
Centre for Mental Health has observed, as have many people whom we have
interviewed, that appropriate waiting times must be established so that
people with mental health problems know the maximum waiting time for a
treatment, just as people with physical health problems know the
longest that they can expect to wait for a
treatment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000090">The
NHS constitution has no requirements on waiting times for people with
mental health problems, and in particular many psychological therapies
are NICE- approved and recommended in NICE clinical guidelines.
However, due to the NHS constitution, people are not entitled to them
in the same way as one is entitled to drugs approved by the NICE
technology appraisals. That means that commissioners are not obliged to
commission psychological therapies. Even when they do, as has been
said, often a maximum number of treatments are prescribed. Can noble
Lords imagine, for drugs for a physical illness or chemotherapy, being
told, “When you’ve had a maximum of 20 of these
injections or radiotherapy sessions, you’re on your own,
mate”? Why should that be so for treatment for mental
illnesses?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000091">To
return to medicines versus therapies, my second viewpoint is from my
involvement in mindfulness practice. For centuries we have understood
that there are practices we can adopt at an early age for our physical
well-being that can be preventive and stop us getting ill, so that even
if we contract an illness our physical fitness helps us to recover
faster or at least helps us live more comfortably with the condition
that we have. We have only recently become aware that the same is true
for 
<?notus-xml column=189?>our mental health. With mindfulness-based practices, one can have a
healthier, more enjoyable and productive way of life, and mindfulness
can prevent depression and anxiety. It has been proven to NICE that to
prevent people slipping back into depression, mindfulness practice can
be more effective than drugs or talking
methods.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000092">Again,
the Centre for Mental Health has said that we need to narrow the gap in
the way people’s needs are met in physical and mental health,
not only in health and social care but in education, employment and the
criminal justice system. A mindfulness strategy for the UK is being
designed and developed by my honourable friend Chris Ruane MP and my
noble friend Lord Layard and others. It builds upon the work currently
being done in this field by universities such as Bangor, Oxford and
Exeter. They are working on mindfulness in the education system, for
students and teachers in schools and universities, so that it exists in
the same way as we have physical training, and are also working in the
criminal justice system where, as has been said, we have systemic
issues with mental health. Mindfulness practice could be enormously
helpful for offenders and police.</hs_para>

why this is such an important debate and thank the noble Lord, Lord
Layard, for securing
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:22:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Some of the
biggest inequalities in health today are faced by people with mental
health problems. Nothing illustrates that more starkly than the fact
that we know that people affected by serious mental illness die on
average 20 years earlier than the rest of the population from
preventable physical health conditions—something I am sure we
all regard as a scandal. Thus I strongly welcome the
Government’s very clear commitment to achieve parity of esteem
for mental health. The 2011 strategy document, <I>N</I><I>o Health
Without Mental Health</I>, made an unambiguous commitment to parity of
esteem and set a clear objective that more people with mental health
problems will have good physical health, fewer people with mental
health problems will die prematurely, and more people with physical ill
health will have better mental health. In addition, of course, as we
have heard, the NHS mandate commits to achieving this and will carry
out a progress report in
2015<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:23:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000095">I
think, however, that in this Chamber we would all accept that there is
still a long way to go. To make a reality of these very good intentions
I contend that three things need to happen. First, people with mental 
<?notus-xml column=190?>health problems must have the same access to treatment and services as
those with physical health problems; secondly, they must have the same
rights within the NHS constitution; and thirdly, they must have equal
patient voice as those with physical health problems. What more, then,
can be done in

will start with something that I regard as very positive indeed, which
we have heard spoken about so eloquently by the noble Lord, Lord
Layard. I refer to the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies
programme. We all know that in many places this programme has provided
an invaluable service. It has achieved high recovery rates and has
helped people both get back to work and stay well. Indeed, an IAPT
service user recently told the mental health charity Mind
that:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13101062000466" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000466">“Receiving
psychological therapy turned out to be the best thing that could
possibly happen for me, it was exactly what I needed … a place
for me to finally look at my past and put the pieces together and come
to understand why I felt the way I
did”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13101062000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000097">I
shall now talk about how this affects people with complex needs. It
was, of course, hoped that focusing additional resources on the more
common mental health problems, such as anxiety and depression, would
free up waiting lists and resources for other forms of therapy for
those with more complex needs, such as people with substance misuse
problems and those with more severe mental health problems. As ever,
there have been unintended consequences.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:29:37"></hs_TimeCode> is worth
emphasising that IAPT was never intended to act as a comprehensive
service delivering all forms of psychological therapy. Indeed,
Department of Health guidance made it clear that IAPT money should not
be used to replace funding for other psychological therapies. Despite
that, in 2010 the <I>We need to talk</I> report showed that this was
happening in a number of areas, where non-IAPT services were either
having their funding cut or being entirely decommissioned, so that IAPT
was replacing, not improving, the provision of psychological
therapies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:25:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

health problem we would not tolerate the lack of choice and treatment
options given to people with mental health problems. In some places we
are in danger of reaching the point where if you do not get better
after a course of CBT there is simply nowhere else for you to
go—and we all recognise that for some people, CBT is not the
right choice of therapy in the first place. There are other

Minister two questions. First, do the Government recognise the need to
provide a full choice of evidence-based psychological therapies on a
sufficient scale to meet the requirements of people with more complex
mental health problems? Secondly—this echoes something that the
noble Lord, Lord Layard, said—what plans do the Government have
to introduce standards for waiting times for mental health equivalent
to those for physical health, and, in particular, to amend the NHS
constitution to ensure the availability of psychological therapies
within 28 days of a

preventive approaches, and in particular to intervening early in a
child’s or a young person’s life. There is now clear
evidence of the importance of intervening early to promote resilience
in young people, to prevent mental illness and to promote well-being.
The children with the poorest life chances of all are 
<?notus-xml column=191?>those who have early-starting behavioural problems. They are 19 times
more likely than their peers to be in prison by their mid-20s, and have
high rates of school exclusion, unemployment, gang

parenting programmes are now available for families whose children have
behavioural problems, to help them manage them from an early age. These

parity to extend to children with behavioural problems, two things are
necessary. First, maternity services, health visitors, GPs and schools
should regularly look out for families at risk and routinely assess
healthy child development to identify children with early signs of
behavioural problems. Secondly, parenting programmes should be made
available to families who really need them, targeted towards those in
greatest need but with easy referral routes to prevent them from

primary care and mental health services are configured. I do not think
that it will be a surprise if I say that they often do not work
well together. How could primary care services be designed
so as to encourage better integration with mental health services?
There are three potential big improvements. The first would be mental
health support for the 4.6 million people in England with
major physical conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease and cancer,
and a concurrent mental health problem—most likely to be
depression—by offering psychological therapies, as I described
earlier, and help with
self-management<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:29:20"></hs_TimeCode>.
The second would be physical health support for people with
severe mental illness—for example, those who may need help with
weight management, particularly those on anti-psychotic medication, and
with smoking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>
cessation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
Finally, there is care for people with medically unexplained symptoms.
At least one-quarter of hospital outpatients who have physical symptoms
with no explained physical cause may very well benefit from
psychological
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:29:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000104">Breaking
down the barriers between primary care and mental health is vital to
achieve the changes that we want to see. I contend that GPs need clear
incentives to address the overlaps between physical and mental
health—for example, through the Quality and Outcomes Framework
for general practice—and that payment systems for mental and
physical healthcare need to be better aligned to prevent mental health
budgets being raided when there is pressure on acute hospital spending.
On that issue, we hear almost daily of the pressure on A&amp;E
departments. There are growing concerns about the quality of care and
support that people with mental health problems receive when in crisis.
Recently published research showed that people using mental health
services were twice as likely as others to present in A&amp;E, causing
all the problems that we have heard so much
about<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:30:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000105">In
the comprehensive spending review of June 2013, the Chancellor
committed to every A&amp;E department having constant access to mental
health professionals 
<?notus-xml column=192?>to ensure that people with mental health problems
got the best possible care. That is something that I very much support.
It is vital that all hospitals put in place comprehensive liaison
psychiatry services, available 24/7 to all hospital wards for people of
all ages, from children with emergency admissions for self-harm to
older people with dementia. Can the Minister update us on progress in
this area?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000106">I
stress the very important and key role that family, friends and the
wider community can play in mental health and well-being. In many
areas, we have seen good projects and approaches. There is
support and care for the families and carers of those with mental
health problems, as well as, in some cases, carers having their own
recovery plan, which is a very interesting idea. Finally, I emphasise
the important role that health and well-being boards should be playing
to embrace mental health, seeing it as a key aspect of public health. I
know that in local government its profile is being raised, and some
local
authorities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:32:04"></hs_TimeCode> are
now having a local authority mental health champion. That is very
positive—to have a member who can champion mental health issues

Murphy (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the sustained commitment of the
noble Lord, Lord Layard, to improving mental health care has had a
profound impact on mental health services since 2008, and I admire him
for it. If today I challenge some of the priorities, this in no way
detracts from his remarkable achievements in addressing the needs of a
long-neglected group of patients who, after all, make up the vast
majority of a GP’s mental health load. But I return to patients
with severe mental illness, including schizophrenia, the recurring
psychoses, and those with mixed substance abuse and psychosis. As the
noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, said, the importance of achieving parity of
access and healthcare for them is shown starkly by the increased
mortality and physical morbidity that they suffer. As Professor Graham
Thornicroft from the Institute of Psychiatry has memorably observed,
patients with long-term psychoses have third-world mortality in a
first-world country, dying on average 20 years earlier than the general
population, often of preventable smoking-related diseases and treatable
cancers as well as the obvious suicides and accidents. This is
completely unacceptable in a country such as ours, so I would like to
know what are we doing for them and whether we are truly prioritising
those greatest in
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:33:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000108">There
have been considerable successes in the mental health strategy that has
been adopted in recent years, and I mention in particular the increased
services for people with dementia, which has undoubtedly risen up the
Government’s awareness scale. That has been a great help for
families which have a person with dementia. We have also had some
success in trying to improve the assessment of risk to others posed by
some severely mentally ill patients. This year’s annual report
of the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by
People with Mental Illness by Professor Louis Appleby and his
colleagues shows that homicide by mental health patients has fallen
substantially since a peak in 2006. The most recent figures are the
lowest 
<?notus-xml column=193?>since data collection began, albeit in a setting of a national reduction
in homicides. This is especially true for people with schizophrenia.
The homicide statistics are tiny, in spite of what might have been
heard on the news in the past week—they are now extremely
small—but they are very important as an indicator of the
cultural attitude of mental health workers to assessment of
risk.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000109">But all

Suicide<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:35:28"></hs_TimeCode> by
mental health patients has risen again. There were more than 1,300
deaths in England in 2011, after a previous fall. The rise partly
echoes the rise in suicide in the general population, probably related
to the economic downturn, as has happened in every previous recession
that we can measure. But in recent years there have been more suicides
in those undergoing home treatment or crisis resolution than in-patient
care, which used to be one of the areas with the greatest risks. A
substantial proportion of these deaths occurred in patients who live
alone, have refused treatment, or are accepting only partial treatment.
Services simply are not providing enough round-the-clock care of the
right kind to the very severely ill. The mantra of home treatment needs
better thinking through if we are to keep patients out of hospital and
safe.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000110">So we
have made substantial gains in some areas but are losing pace in
others. I have concerns about the direction that mental health services
are now taking. I do not want to disparage the value of treating
patients with common mental health episodes with cognitive behavioural
therapy and other NICE-recommended therapies, but we have to be aware
that the budget for psychological therapies has gone up from
£100 million annually to £400 million without even
reaching a high proportion of sufferers of the milder forms of
distress, as the noble Lord, Lord Layard, has said. I do not dispute
the efficacy of such treatment; with good CBT, faithful to the model
delivered by a good therapist, 40% get better, of those who accept the
offer of treatment, which is 15% better than doing nothing. For mildly
to moderately unwell patients it is effective. But we have to recognise
that the studies do not include patients who never accept treatment
because of chaotic lives, intrusive events, a dislike of sitting down
and talking, a failure of faith in the referrer, which is all too often
the case, and sometimes also because people have learning disabilities
and are unable to value the treatments, in spite of those
patients having a very high order of risk of depression and
anxiety. These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:38:21"></hs_TimeCode>
factors significantly reduce the efficacy of treatments. We would
surely get better value for money from addressing the problems which
still beset people with more serious long-term mental illness. I accept
the economic argument from the noble Lord, Lord Layard, for treating
lesser forms of disorder; it is very compelling. But the only true
justification for treating patients is the overall reduction in patient
suffering and the burden of disability overall in the community, which
is worse for those with the most severe
illness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000111">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T12:38:46"></hs_TimeCode>
USA introduced a parity of esteem law in 1996. It was meant to improve
the investment in mental health services through Medicaid and other
insurance and to bring it up to the level of physical health services.
I accept that managed care solutions 
<?notus-xml column=194?>funded by the public purse in the United States are not entirely
analogous to publicly funded systems here, but they are similar enough.
There is now worrying evidence that, in the States, the greater access

the care of the seriously mentally

A recent study by the well-known sociologists David Mechanic and Donna
McAlpine, who for many years have been experts in the United States on
the provision of mental health care, demonstrated that this apparent
increased democratisation of mental health has simply shifted money
from the severely ill to the lesser forms of illness, away from those
with the least chance of ever being able to work and those with the
highest excess mortality and suicide
rates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000112">These
findings are deeply worrying and should give us pause. There is some
evidence that this is already happening here. In 2011-12 there was a
reduction in spending on crisis resolution and on outreach services for
those in acute crisis, while spending on psychological therapies rose
by 6%. Total spending on mental health has increased by a massive 60%
in real terms over the decade. That is something for us to celebrate,
but now we are beginning to see a fall in investment in the acute care

to me that the NHS and social care services should listen more to Mind,
Rethink and SANE, and listen to what their priorities are. If true
parity of esteem is to be promoted then we must look at the way that
these acute and crisis services are running. Four in 10 trusts have
staffing levels well below established benchmarks. There are serious
issues around safety, respect and dignity in in-patient care. There are
still insufficient non-hospital

mental health services, we must first and foremost concentrate on those

the Bill became an Act that it does make a difference, that it is a
legal requirement, that health commissioners now have to address this

noble Lord, Lord McColl of Dulwich, reminisced about his experience as
a medical student, and inevitably encouraged me to think in the same
way. I remember quite a different experience. As a young medical
student I went to work for a psychiatrist, Dr Artie Kerr, for a number
of weeks. I was enormously impressed by the way in which he could
understand what was going on behind the scenes with the patient. He was
able to pick up—and to help me to understand in a way that I
simply had not seen at all—how sometimes the person who came
along smiling was actually deeply depressed inside, and how in fact
much could be done even with those people who had been ill for a long
time, not least in caring for them when you could not cure
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000118">What an
extraordinary business it is that we think that if you cannot cure
someone with a mental illness you should not bother to look after them.
If this was a patient with diabetes, which we cannot cure, would we
say, “Ah well, we should forget about it”? Take a child
with cystic fibrosis. We know that they are likely to die early, but
should we say that we should not bother putting any money into caring
for them? Yet if someone has a mental illness, and they are not going
to get better in a short time or perhaps not at all, then caring does
not seem to matter. It is all about cure. Let us not be seduced by
those kinds of arguments. They take humanity out of our service, and
they take humanity out of ourselves. It was that understanding from

I remember very well doing a programme with a very senior surgeon,
Professor Rodgers. He had been a surgeon all his life, and was a very
eminent man. He listened to me for a little while, and then he said,
“You know, I have treated many people with terminal illnesses,
very painful illnesses, who were having a very hard time. Very, very
few of them ever decided to end their life; some did, but very few. But
I know that a large percentage of people with mental illness find life
so intolerable that they want to bring it to an end. In many ways, the
suffering of mental illness is so much greater than the suffering of
even some of the dreadful cancers I have had to treat”. I have

is enough evidence to demonstrate that we are far from achieving the

inappropriate discharge arrangements, lack of follow-up of patients,
lack of care pathways, insufficient access to psychological treatments
and poor access to services for particular groups amount to inadequate
standards of care that impact on the lives of service users and their

something dramatic such as self-harm or suicide is clearly a crisis,
there are all sorts of ways in which mental disturbances differ from
each other. This is not a homogenous group of people with a homogenous
group of disorders, which is one of the reasons why we run into
problems. On the physical side we are very aware of the difference
between symptoms and a disorder. If I run up the stairs to the
Principal Floor I will probably be breathless; I am not terribly fit,
you see. That is a reaction to physical exertion, but it is not a sign
of illness. It is a sign of unfitness, but not a sign of illness.

many ways in which we experience psychological symptoms. It always
seems curious to me that we accept that we will all have physical
illnesses, mild and more severe, during our lives, yet we pretend to
ourselves that we will not have mental and emotional
disturbances—every single one of us, not just the ones who have
to be referred for treatment. However, many of the emotional reactions
that we have are not a sign of illness or disturbance. If someone is
down and depressed and is not sleeping very well three weeks after the
death of their spouse, that is not a sign of illness; it is a sign of
an appropriate reaction to a bereavement. If, three years later, they
are in the same state, that is another matter. However, we have to
differentiate those people who can get better with a little help from
their family and friends and whose condition does not need to be
medicalised, as well as those who suffer from relatively moderate
disorders, from those who have very severe disorders, as the noble
Baroness, Lady Murphy, pointed out. It is clear that if we do not do
that, we will be so swamped that it 
<?notus-xml column=197?>will be impossible to deal with the problems. What
will happen is that those with the more severe illnesses will end up
being set to the side because they have illnesses from which it is

bullying behaviour in government departments? It sometimes almost
seemed to be a policy approach that the way to increase productivity

feeling that somehow things are getting worse—that we are taking
less of an interest in certain areas. I shall give your Lordships one
example and, from that, pose a question to my noble friend. In the
early 1960s, a chair of mental health was created at Queen’s
University in Belfast. For the next 30 or more years, psychiatry and
mental health was developed as a crucial component of the training of
young doctors in Belfast. There is now no professor of psychiatry or
mental health in Belfast. Massive amounts of money go into cancer
research but there is not even a professor of mental health. Will my
noble friend approach the GMC and ask it to insist that no medical
faculty trains young doctors without having a professor of psychiatry

on what is a vital issue not only for our health and social care
systems but for society more widely. I should declare my interest as
the chief executive of a health and social organisation called Turning
Point, and I will draw on some cases that Turning Point has come across
to illustrate why parity of esteem is so important. I should also
declare my interest as a non-executive director of NHS England. Many of
the points made by other speakers, including the noble Lords, Lord

strategy, <I>No Health </I><I>W</I><I>ithout Mental Health</I>, and the
subsequent implementation framework make it clear that mental health is
everyone’s business: one in four adults and one in 10 children
in the UK are experiencing mental health issues at any given time; 30%
of the 15 million people with a long-term health condition also have
mental health problems; and, as has been pointed out by the noble
Baroness, Lady Murphy, within a prison environment up to 90% of the
population experience one or more mental health conditions, often
alongside substance misuse and/or a learning disability. Given this and
the costs of mental health, calculated by the Centre for Mental Health
to 
<?notus-xml column=198?>be £105 billion, it is frankly shocking that huge disparity still
exists between those with a diagnosable mental health issue and those
without. As has already been mentioned in the debate, this results in
there being an unacceptable difference in the life expectancy of those
with a severe mental health condition and those without of between 16
and 25
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000129">I want
to illustrate my contribution to this debate from the perspective of
people who have mental health issues, and perhaps I may do so by
presenting to the House three very short vignettes. The first is a case
that has come to the attention of Turning Point. It illustrates a lack
of consideration of an individual’s whole needs. It concerns a
chap called Fred, although I have changed his name. He has a learning
disability and a history of poor eyesight, which staff assessed as
contributing towards his high levels of anxiety. Staff working closely
with Fred arranged for him to access specialist optical services. It
was found that he had a detached retina and cataracts were diagnosed,
leading to surgery. Following this surgery, a clear decrease in what
had been perceived as “challenging behaviour” was clearly
evidenced. This is someone who, because of a physical illness, had been
classed as severely problematic.</hs_para>

concerns professionals failing to work together. Alan had enduring
mental health issues when he experienced a stroke and was admitted to
the local hospital from one of our residential services. While in
hospital undergoing rehabilitation, Alan had all medication reviewed by
a ward doctor. The doctor, knowing that Alan had a mental health
condition, decided without any discussion with him, the care manager or
psychiatrist to stop his medication, even though it had a multiple
purpose. It could be used to reduce mood swings and also to treat
epilepsy. The hospital doctor stated that, as Alan did not have
epilepsy, the medication could be stopped with immediate effect. This
had a detrimental effect on his mental health—something that the
doctor appeared to be ambivalent about, having not once discussed
anything other than Alan’s physical needs with any member of his
care team.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000131">The
final case is, I think, the most shocking example and most immediate in
case we have any doubt that these issues are taking place right now. It
involves a support worker who just happened to be at the bedside of one
of our clients. They noticed that the file was open and that there was
a “Do Not Resuscitate” note in it. Luckily, the care
worker knew that no such thing had been discussed with the
individual’s next of kin. The support worker challenged hospital
staff and was told that because the individual was a mental health
patient and under a Home Office order, he had “no priority of
life”. Because our member of staff challenged this, the DNR note
was removed, but the fact that it was there in the first place
highlights the discriminatory treatment that people with a mental
health condition can face, compounded when other complex needs are
applicable, such as offending behaviours or a learning
disability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000132" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000132">The
implications of introducing parity of esteem are wide-ranging and they

will simply not achieve parity of esteem without first addressing
equality of access and experience. This means breaking down the
cultural barriers that still prohibit people from black and minority
ethnic communities receiving the support that they need. As the Mental
Health Foundation has found, people from BME groups are more likely to
be diagnosed with mental health problems, more likely to be diagnosed
and admitted to hospital, more likely to experience a poor outcome from
treatment—this has been repeated in annual surveys of people in
mental health institutions —and more likely to disengage from
mainstream mental health services, leading to social exclusion and a

at all levels of the health system, including GPs and A&amp;E staff,

ambulance would arrive within eight minutes. If I had a mental health
crisis, it is more likely that I would be carted away by the police and
it is highly likely that I would be put in the back of a police van.
Such disparity has led to the deaths of too many people, particularly
from BME groups. Responding to crisis is a whole other debate but, for
me, it is the very start of any definition of parity of esteem. If you

we have a health and care system that looks at the whole person and
designs, commissions and delivers services in conjunction with the
community to ensure that they are fit for purpose, fragmentation will
persist. People will continue to receive disjointed care where their
mental health issue is not considered alongside their physical health

mentioned them, so I will just single out three: almost half of all
adults will experience at least one episode of depression during their
lifetime, and depression affects one in five older people; about 10% of
children have a mental health problem at any one time; the UK has one
of the highest rates for self-harming in Europe—400 per 100,000
population. Perhaps I should add that only one in 10 prisoners has no
mental
disorder.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000140">These
numbers have far-reaching impact. As we have been reminded, people with
severe mental illnesses die on average 20 years earlier than the
general population. People with mental health problems often have fewer
qualifications, find it harder to find and stay in work, are more
likely to be homeless and have poor physical health. We know that
higher levels of insecurity and stress due to the recession, the poor
job market and major upheavals in the welfare system have all had an
impact on the mental health of the nation in recent years. It is no
wonder that mental health services—what my right honourable
friend the Leader of the Opposition recently called the
“afterthought” of the NHS—are straining at the
seams.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101062000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000141">As
others have noted, mental illness is responsible for the largest
proportion of the disease burden in the UK at 22.8%, larger than
cardiovascular disease at 16.2% and cancer at 15.9%. Yet only 11% of
the NHS budget was spent on NHS services to treat mental health
problems for all ages during 2010-11. While figures show that
investment in mental health services for adults of working age has
increased by 1.2% in cash terms, this in fact amounts to a real-terms
decrease.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101062000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000142">My

increasing levels of simultaneous mental and physical health problems
and, of course, funding constraints that have no end in sight. One of
its key findings was the need for mental health to be treated as a core

that people with mental health problems are treated during emergencies.
This might go some way to avoiding incidents such as those referred to
by the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale, and one that a friend of mine
recently reported to me. A colleague of hers had a husband who was
finding it difficult to manage his bipolar medication. He had gone
missing during a particularly distressing bipolar episode and the
wife’s sister, a GP, had alerted the local police about his
condition. Nevertheless, when he was found, banging on the locked door

must tackle the stigma attached to mental illness. That stigma feeds
prejudice and can lead to discrimination, particularly at work. For me,
this comes close to home. A senior member of my staff told me only
years later that she had left out her own brief history of clinical
depression on the HR department’s health declaration form, for
fear of being considered not capable of doing the job. That fear of
discrimination remains. As someone told me recently, “If you
phone work saying you’re staying in bed for a few days with flu,
employers will be understanding. You’re not likely to get the

you’re depressed, or feeling

look like. Crucially, it emphasises that there should be investment in
the prevention of mental health problems and in the promotion of mental
well-being, in proportion to need. Yet only five strategic health
authority regions were able to report increased investment in mental
health in 2011-12. Underinvestment in the mental health care system,
when those in most need often miss out on essential care, is a
disgrace. While we have heard much about the Government’s
commitment to ensuring parity between services for physical and mental
illness, it is abundantly clear that we need to do much more to bring

course, these conditions and their diagnoses are complex and highly
varied. Many conditions have both mental and physical aspects. For
example—I know that this also is a very large area of
need—difficulties with communication are not easily classified
as mental or physical, and there are many other conditions that combine
both sorts of symptom. We have to agree that there are physical
conditions—for example, disfigurement —where sufferers
may encounter reactions from others that are as harsh as those

remember that there are many conditions which people do not want to
disclose. We have very little idea how many of those we live among may
be coping on a daily basis with physical and mental conditions that are
invisible to us, that they manage more or less adequately and that they
try to keep to themselves, be it diabetes or depression, digestive
problems or severe phobias. Nor do we have much idea how much physical
or mental pain, or both, others are often managing, whether day-in,
day-out or episodically. Much of the burden of disease is invisible to
others, and much of it is not solely mental or solely
physical.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000159">We
also must not forget the cases where the conditions are all too
visible. One of the difficulties is that the person who has the

Carlile of Berriew (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Layard, has taken a long and influential interest in mental health; not
least as a leading economist, he has made a powerful economic case for
parity of esteem. We are very grateful to him for securing
this

notice that the noble Lord is sitting alongside the noble Lord, Lord
Bragg, on what I suppose one could describe as the polymath Bench this
afternoon. This morning, the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, presented a most
interesting Radio 4 programme featuring the life of Galen, the
extraordinary second century Roman doctor. Galen discovered many things
about medicine. One was that he realised that much of the variation in
physical health and in human behaviour can be explained by temperament
and stress, as he put it. He identified the inseparable links between
physical pathology and psychopathology 1,900 years ago. To some people
suffering from mental illness in this country and in particular to
those who live with them, it can sometimes appear as though little more
has been learnt in the past 2,000
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:22:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000169">Of
course, that is unfair. Generally speaking, huge advances have been
made in the treatment of mental illness. Drugs are available which, for
example, have vastly improved the quality of life for patients
suffering from bipolar disorder and, more recently, for patients
suffering from acute schizophrenia and other conditions. Therapies, not
always involving drugs, have had a remarkable and beneficial impact on
many individuals—albeit, I am afraid, with patchy availability
in this country. I had the privilege of serving as Member of Parliament
for a constituency in rural mid-Wales for some years. This is a bit
historic, but even today I understand that the availability of
therapies is very uneven in an area like that. You can get a therapy,
but not necessarily the right therapy. Providing the correct therapy is
extremely
important<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:23:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

stigma of mental illness remains an obstacle to progress. The fear of
telling an employer of a psychiatric diagnosis remains much greater
than revealing a physical illness, however serious. In my own legal

privilege of co-chairing with Professor Dinesh Bhugra an investigation
for the Mental Health Foundation into the future of mental health
services. Our report, <I>Starting Today</I>, was produced last month.
There is not enough time in a debate such as this to go into the detail
of the report, but one of its foundations was pleasure at the 2011
English mental health strategy, which rightly committed this country to
parity of esteem. However, the declaration, welcome as it is, has not
been matched by progress, which has been variable and not yet

Mental Health Foundation report has headlined a number of issues which
could develop parity of esteem in the coming years. I will refer to a
few of them. We certainly took the view that we need to look at fresh
ways of implementing known best practice alongside developing
technology. Above all, I would like to highlight mental health in
primary care. GPs should become—but in only a few cases have
become—leaders in mental health care, providing quickly
accessible services in their
surgeries.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000174">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:29:21"></hs_TimeCode>

ago introduced a psychotherapist into the health centre in a small
Welsh market town. It had a remarkable effect. It meant that the doctor
could say to the patient, “I think you need to go down the
corridor and talk to my colleague”. An intervention was made
which beneficially affected the life of the patient concerned. We need
to see more of that. By the way, a two-week wait for an appointment
with a doctor just will not do for someone suffering from a growing
mental condition.
GPs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:26:53"></hs_TimeCode> need to know
as much about mental illness as about physical illness. So far as
possible, primary and secondary mental health services should merge to
produce early treatment and the value for money that the noble Lord,

Foundation report also found that there is value in self-management. So

an excuse for not sharing information. Actually, it is near criminal
not to share information for people who have needs that are
demonstrated by mental illness. We must ensure that those who have
information to share do not sit in silos and that the ability to pool
funds from different funding streams into a single integrated care
budget, shared protocols and partnership agreements, co-location of

Dividing a person’s health into either physical or mental is a
false dichotomy and one that has for too long encouraged us to focus on

billions of pounds in resources have been poured into physical health.
We have created sophisticated cancer drugs, mapped the human genome and
surgery can be done through tiny incisions. We do not even think of
these things as remarkable any more. But the unequal allocation of
funding and resources has left mental health some way behind physical
health. Parity is not just about increasing resources for those with
serious mental illness, but about attending to the physical health of
people with mental illness or people with learning disabilities and
attending to the mental health of people with physical
illnesses.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000184">As
an example, GPs receive a payment for offering a health check to people

for some time, less than 50% of people with learning disabilities have

is something that most people have not even started to think about. The
BMA Board of Science, which I chair, is preparing a report on parity of
esteem for its members at the moment. But as a colleague at the BMA
recently commented, giving parity to mental health is a massive
paradigm shift, which will have huge effects for many years to come.
Despite the Equality Act, few healthcare staff understand that it
applies to disabled people, including those with mental disorders, who
are using mainstream health services. Sadly, discrimination is too
often alive and well with respect to mental illness and learning
disability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000186">Parity
will have an effect on the training and education of all healthcare
staff. It will have an effect on the commissioning and organisation of
whole person healthcare. Just think: the time may have come to employ
psychiatrists in acute hospitals, not just as part of liaison teams,
but on the same terms and in the same numbers as other consultants so
that more timely assessments and treatments can be offered. There could
be psychiatrists who work with children, women, pregnant mothers, older
people and adults, working alongside paediatricians, obstetricians,
physicians, in the accident and emergency department and so

leaves other aspects untreated, it makes it difficult to treat physical
illness properly. To use an analogy, it is like a three-legged stool,
which supports the physical, mental and social health of a

shorten one leg is to leave the stool unbalanced and potentially unable

working life in the field of learning disability, both as a
psychiatrist and as a parent, and I have often said that if you get it
right for people with a learning disability, you will get it right for
everyone. People with learning disabilities have complex needs and the
interplay and overlap between physical and mental health is inescapable
in this patient group. Not only that, but people with learning
disabilities have higher levels of both physical and mental health 
<?notus-xml column=209?>needs than the general population. For example, they are twice as likely
to suffer from depression and three times as likely to suffer from
schizophrenia. The life expectancy of someone with a learning
disability is 20 years less than the general population,
even when factors directly related to the learning disability are
removed. One in five people with a learning disability will
not see their 50th birthday, and half of all people with a learning
disability will die from pneumonia, often caused by choking on the
wrong type of food or drink or aspirating it and getting pneumonia as a

example, John. John was admitted to hospital for an investigation of
his physical deterioration, but in order to investigate the problems
fully, he needed some investigations, some of them uncomfortable,
unpleasant or painful. The staff made an attempt to get John to comply,

begged him, offered him chocolate and called the consultant, but they
did not make effective reasonable adjustments to facilitate his care.

back at home, John remained listless, tired and kept losing weight. His
worried carers eventually persuaded John to go to his GP where he was
diagnosed with depression. He took anti-depressives but, crucially, was

second time he went into hospital, because he continued to deteriorate,
John had a hospital passport. This is an innovative idea to give

disability are often unable to tell us in words about what is wrong and

have been set out clearly by many of your Lordships. The list of lacks
is long. Six million adults suffer from different forms of
depression; the cost of poor treatment is pain, distress and, we are
told, £60 billion. As we have heard eloquently and graphically
today, the injustice is intolerable, the neglect is shameful and the
effects are often disastrous and on many levels.</hs_para>

proposal, in my view, lies in the phrase “parity of
esteem”. That is key; it opens up several doors, some of which
lead to better prospects than others. We all agree that this parity
must be based on parity of treatment with physical illness, as has been
well said again and again. Progress depends on investment, but it also
depends on something just as important, which is a fundamental change
of attitude and the will to bring it about. The ancient stigma is
dissolving, but very slowly, and is still, I suggest, however
unconsciously, the major impediment to the parity that my noble friend
Lord Layard seeks.</hs_para>

there is a deep problem; perhaps that is the elephant in the Chamber.
We have an outstandingly good health service. I experienced it recently
through myself, my family and two of my friends over the past 18
months, in the north-west of England, in Edinburgh and here in London.
In every case we met high skills, courtesy and care—and still
free, as Bevan intended. It is an amazing asset and a flagship for this

accompanied in general terms by a rarely and uneasily articulated, yet
growing, fear that this noble ideal—this vow in our country to
deliver such a service, from however difficult a childbirth to however
lingering a death—is now under serious threat, failing, falling
and going. The extensive and inclusive nature of our health service is
both its greatness and, in some people’s view, is proving to be
its weakness. From the latest intricate and expensive surgery to
looking after dumb Saturday night drunks; from the increasing flood of
the complex ailments of old age to cosmetic surgery; and from dialysis
to a small bruise, it serves a multiplying range of complaints and
demands. As the needs increase, can we continue to afford it? Do
Governments want to afford it? We read about subtraction, but rarely
about additions: cutting is the sound of the day.</hs_para>

suggest that at present, sadly, mental health is low down on the list
of priorities. It is a very demanding aspect of national health and of
the utmost concern to all of us here, as it should be to everyone in
the country. All of us here are trying to improve the position of those
afflicted, at whatever level. Although we must keep up the pressure, it
seems that we cannot merely reach out to the Treasury. We have to find
other ways, if only as interim measures.</hs_para>

my noble friend Lord Layard points us is as much in the human as in the
economic sphere. Mind’s steady encouragement of people in the
public eye to admit to mental health problems is one useful method. I
did so myself when I became president of Mind 17 years ago; the public
reaction was one of overwhelming relief. “I found that I was not
alone”, people said, again and again. Too many people still are
alone.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101062000205" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000205">Next
to increased investment, one of the best ways to meet this challenge is
to find parity in the workplace, which gives people esteem in the eyes
of others and of themselves. The knock-on effects are extremely
encouraging. This has already been tried and encouraged by Mind. I will
give one example. As part of Mind’s employee support programme,
EDF offered psychological support—cognitive behavioural
therapy—to employees and trained more than a thousand managers
to recognise mental health problems among staff and develop support
strategies. Job satisfaction has already, over a couple of years, risen
from 36% to 68%. There also have been marked savings through increased
productivity and increased profits. All this is a reason for some
optimism this afternoon.</hs_para>

developed further and would benefit from a higher profile. Does the
Civil Service, do local authorities and do we here in Parliament take
on and help people in the workplace with mental health problems in that
way? Could we introduce

welcomed as a positive move; it could set an example. Could we not find

money, more understanding and more resources. However, we also need
more attempts to integrate people into the workforce and to educate
those more privileged in health to understand and throw out a new

at work and the respect gained by working with other people. I believe

Addington (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, this is one of those debates in
which, having put down your name to speak, by halfway through you are
convinced that you do not have much to contribute. However, the main
thing that attracted me to the debate in the first place was that it
concerned parity of esteem between mental health and physical health.
It has always struck me that the two are absolutely inseparable: you
cannot remove one from the other. This is not just about the healthy
mind and the healthy body; it is about the fact that you cannot access
either one without paying attention to the other.</hs_para>

said in the debate, we had the problem that mental health was something
that happened to other people and thus was something that did not
concern us. We removed ourselves from it as a society. It is only over
a comparatively recent time that we have started to realise that it is
a mainstream problem. The similarities between that and some of the
work I have done in other fields—for instance, on hidden
disabilities, particularly dyslexia—are many. If what I do is
normal or what I perceive to be normal, everything else will not be
addressed. There are two things going on: the perception that it is
nothing to do with me—I do not understand it, and I do not want
to understand it because it is unpleasant—and the idea, as has
been referred to in the debate, that we all know exactly what the
mentally ill are like. They are basically people running around with
meat cleavers and chasing around or shrieking at people on buses; they
are not people who are in a state of depression. I almost said
“unhappiness”, but it is being depressed, or functioning
below par. Perhaps it is making the lives of those around them
unpleasant; not fulfilling their greatest function; not interacting
with family members. With depression, the field is far too wide to
cover everything. That person is more than likely to be the standard
person who has a mental health problem; he is not somebody who is in
any way dramatic. That person is also going to be very bad at getting
over the fact that he is ill and suffering from a long-term condition.
As has been mentioned before, the life expectancy of those with mental
illness is considerably lower than those without it.</hs_para>

this? Part of the work, clearly, has already been done by the noble
Lord, Lord Bragg, who started off by saying that this is not that
unusual, please open your minds to the possibility that this could be a
very normal part of life. Furthermore, 
<?notus-xml column=213?>the rest of us will have to work a little harder, first, to take on new
ideas and, secondly, to access the potential of those people to get the
best out of it for us—the economy and the selfish principle
within it. If those people are to have an episode of depression, for
example, they will get over it, particularly if we give them the
correct help and understanding and do not decide, “Oh, they have
had a bout of depression. They will never be able to hold a job
again”. If we can get over that, we will do well. We will
benefit from that as a
society<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:50:32"></hs_TimeCode>. In my
work outside dealing with hidden disabilities, I have found that
embracing small changes in attitude and approach benefits the whole of

must make a small confession to the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Neill. When I first heard in my work with disabilities that
mental health was to be put in with disabilities, I was a little
frightened. I thought, “Wait a minute. With illness, you either
get better or you die. It is not something that is with you for
life”. I was rapidly disabused of that, because the prejudice
that goes with it will be with you for life, as with cancer, which has
been mentioned. The idea that it marks you out as different and other
is incredibly important. I came to the conclusion: “It
ain’t a perfect fit, but it—putting them
together<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:51:37"></hs_TimeCode>—is
definitely the best show in

must try to get this across and start to engage with the rest of
society about it. On the similarity between physical conditions and
mental ones, I discovered many years ago, backed up by my personal
experience, that many things that we do to prevent physical ill health
work for mental ill health. There is lots of evidence, as Mind has
recognised, that physical exercise releases hormones that help with
many conditions. If you are physically healthy, you are considerably
less likely to suffer from many forms of mental ill health. Encouraging
physical activity can help many mental health conditions. The
interrelationship between the two types of health is so close that it
is ridiculous that we have to go through this process, but we clearly
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000213">The

we are not merely travelling with the tide but trying to inject some
pace ourselves—running up a sail or putting an oar in the

Parliament becomes aware of a problem and then has to do something
about it, it tends to jump ahead on the problem. I hope that we are

here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:53:32"></hs_TimeCode>. I am

Meacher (CB):</Member></B> I should like to begin with a very brief
response to my noble friend Lady Murphy. The answer to this debate, in
my view, is not a redistribution of resources from the secondary mental
health services to the primary but, rather, to seek to focus
resources on to or into NICE-recommended treatments in both the primary
and secondary sectors. An enormous amount can be achieved if we really
focus on that objective.</hs_para>

Indeed, the evidence suggests that the incidence of emotional and

remained fairly stable since. Today, about 10% of 15 and 16

our failure to prioritise children’s mental health so important?
The answer is simple. Children with mental health problems go on to
become adults with mental health problems. Surely it is better to treat
children when the problems arise, rather than waiting for them to waste
years of their lives in misery and unable to contribute effectively to
society. That is obvious from the point of view not only of the
individual but of the taxpayer. Our failure in this field is extremely
costly. To give just one example, a child with a conduct disorder will
cost the taxpayer roughly £150,000 more than if the child did
not have the behaviour disorder. We can look at it the other way. If we
spend £7,500 on a child with a behaviour problem, the cost is
absolutely zero if a mere one in 20 of those children is helped. Of
course, the figures are much better than
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000223">Some
might think that the reason that the Government do not invest in those
treatments is that they do not work, but we now know that, for children
too, there are psychological treatments that have been shown to be
effective. The treatments are very similar to those recommended for
adults—cognitive behavioural therapy, in particular, and
interpersonal therapy—for the common mental disorders. For
conduct disorder, however—the single most common mental health
problem in childhood —there is now a well established treatment,
which is structured parent training. One of the biggest trials in
England showed that after seven years the children whose parents had
this treatment were 80% less likely to be defined as having
oppositional defiant disorder than those not treated. This is a huge
success rate. Even for the most difficult children, multi-systemic
therapy has produced good results. So there are effective treatments
available, if only they are commissioned, for our children. In 2008,
however, less than half of children’s services were implementing
NICE guidelines—hence my point at the beginning of these short
remarks. In another survey, half the therapists said they use CBT for
less than one fifth of their

mental illness have increased levels of morbidity and

between smoking and mental health is stark. For example, some 42% of
all cigarettes smoked in England are smoked by people with a
mental health condition, including alcohol and drug dependency, and up
to 70% of people in mental health units smoke. It has been
estimated that around 30% of those suffering from a long-term physical
health condition simultaneously have a mental condition. This is
equivalent to around 4.6 million people in England alone and about 46%
of people with mental health problems. People with schizophrenia may

need, as the noble Lord described it, a whole-person care approach. For
65 years we have had an almost tripartite system of meeting one
person’s need through not one service but three
services—the mainstream NHS, mental health and social care. We
have also had a different funding system between health and social
care, often with perverse incentives towards getting an integrated
approach. This cannot go
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000228">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:09:34"></hs_TimeCode>
we live longer and the demographics change, people’s needs
become a complex blur of the physical, the mental and the social.
Wherever people are in this disjointed system, some or all of one
person’s needs are being unmet. Every noble Lord brought forward
illustrations of where that need is not being met. We know, as some
noble Lords have said, that in acute hospitals social and mental health
needs can be neglected. It may explain why we have so many problems
with older people in our hospitals, how their condition can go
downhill, and how they can often get stuck in an acute hospital because
discharge becomes so much more difficult. In mental health care
settings, people can have their physical health overlooked, which in
part explains why those with serious mental health problems die younger
than the rest of the
population.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0001.htm#13101062000229">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:09:34"></hs_TimeCode>

what are the Government’s intentions about securing fast and
fair access to mental health treatment? The noble Earl’s
honourable friend the Care Services Minister has already acknowledged
that it is unfair that waiting times for psychological therapies are
not given the same importance as those for hospital treatment. The
noble Lord, Lord Layard, mentioned this in his opening remarks. We know
that long waits can do enormous damage, particularly for children and
young people, as the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, pointed out to us.
Yet clinical commissioning groups are not required to secure treatment
within a fixed timescale. There is a real question to the Government
about whether NHS England will be asked to set out meaningful standards
for access and waiting in order to place this on a par with other
services.</hs_para>

second question is about how the Government will ensure that mental
health crisis care is given the same priority as other urgent care
services. Recent reports have highlighted the paucity of mental health
crisis care. Too many people in a mental health crisis end up in police
custody. People with mental health problems also attend A&amp;E at
twice the average rate and 24/7 access to crisis resolution home
treatment teams is still patchy. I understand, and the noble Earl will
know, that NHS England is carrying out an urgent care review
which follows on from the current problems within A&amp;E. As part of
that urgent care review, will mental health crisis care be treated on a
par with other issues?</hs_para>

indeed in Birmingham, we have a system called RAID, which has been
developed to ensure that there is consultant psychiatric presence

also highlighted that, unless there is a service or a facility to which
a patient who has come into A&amp;E and is diagnosed as having mental
health problems can be referred, you are still left with the problem
about what to do with this patient. If we are going to solve the urgent

want to ask the Minister about funding. My noble friend Lord Bragg said
that funding for mental health is too far down the list of priorities.
The noble Earl will know that the recent national survey of investment

decade. This was especially pronounced in older people’s mental
health care. Of course, we do not have a tariff for mental health
services. What will the Government do about this? I have heard that the
department has discontinued the national survey of investment in mental
health services. Can the Minister confirm that? If it is true, I ask
him to reconsider. Surely it is very important for us, if we are going
to be able to indentify whether parity of esteem is actually
implemented, that we have the facts to look at the funding relativities

ask the Minister for his response to my noble friend Lord Layard and

very skewed towards medical research. Clearly medical research is very

but we have not focused very much on research in mental health
services. The point has been put persuasively here that, given the

the principle which underpins parity. As the noble Baroness, Lady
O’Neill, said, equality is not just how we think about mental
and physical healthcare but how they are valued. Parity of esteem is
not just an abstract concept. It is the subject of an active and
ongoing programme between the Department of Health and its system
partners, dedicated to closing the gap with physical health services
and to translating rhetoric into reality. We made our commitment
explicit in the Health and Social Care Act 2012, as my noble friend
Lord McColl reminded us, where we enshrined in law the equal importance
of mental health alongside physical health. My noble friend Lord
Alderdice was right to say that this explicit statement in statute does
matter.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13101062000241" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000241">The

GPs and the ability of CCGs to commission mental health services. We
have made putting mental health on a par with physical health one of
NHS England’s key priorities, as well as ensuring that everyone
who needs it has timely access to the best available treatment. The
mandate to NHS England is strong on mental health. It makes it clear
that everyone who needs it should have that timely access to
evidence-based services, and I can tell noble Lords that we are
determined that mental health should play a similarly pivotal role in
the forthcoming refresh of the mandate for 2014-15. Of course this
needs investment, a point which again was made by the noble Baroness, 
<?notus-xml column=219?>Lady Warwick. We must remember the role of government here: as she
knows, the Government set the outcomes that they expect the NHS to
achieve in the NHS outcomes framework. There are a number of outcomes
specifically for people with mental health problems and others about
the quality of services, and patients’ experience of them, which
apply equally to mental health services.</hs_para>

that of excess mortality. It is up to commissioners to prioritise their
resources to meet these outcomes for the population, based on

quality of services and outcomes for mental health patients through the
outcomes framework but it is worth noting that in 2011-12, the total

£6.629 billion, or £193.30 per head of

should be available for those who need it and we have asked NHS

Lady Murphy, reminded us that too many people with mental health
problems die prematurely. We know that people living with significant

quality of life. They live on average 16 to 25 years less

simple answers; we recognise that more work needs to be done to
establish the causes of higher rates of mental illness in some
communities and how communities access early intervention services. We
are in discussion with a number of BME leaders and influencers on this.
I recognise the concerns about incidents in recent years where someone
with a mental health condition has either died or been seriously
injured after police contact. I welcome the report of the independent

hope that the noble Lord, Lord Layard, will think I am right to
celebrate some of the achievements to date, but the scale of the
challenge ahead should not be underestimated. It will require
significant changes to the way mental health services are delivered
locally, based on a clear understanding of local needs and with the
accent firmly on delivering better outcomes for users. There are
exceptional services that others can learn from, but as we move forward
a focal point must be more effective collaboration between public
services, to enable early identification of mental health problems and
to provide more co-ordinated care.</hs_para>

about the police and their interactions with those with mental health
issues. I referred to this briefly earlier. We know that we have to
have an effective emergency mental health response system in place and
we have asked all the relevant organisations, including the Home Office
and the Association of Chief Police Officers, to draw up an agreed plan
to tackle this problem. Street triage teams, currently being piloted
around the country, partner mental health clinicians with police
officers to attend emergency responses involving those with suspected
mental health

course, more needs to be done for acute and crisis care, a point made
the noble Lord, Lord Adebowale. Improving acute mental health services
is a key priority for the Government, as identified in the first
mandate to NHS England and underpinned by the outcomes framework. As I
have said, we are clear that where someone needs an acute bed, it has
to be there for them and there has been significant capital investment
in the mental health in-patient environment in the past
decade.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000263">All<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:29:30"></hs_TimeCode>

far beyond health and social care. It requires a genuinely

substantial debate. We have had 15 excellent contributions
and somehow, miraculously, they have been almost entirely complementary
to each other, so in some way we have written a pretty good textbook on
the subject in these three hours. As everyone has said, this issue is a
massive problem, which is why we are all extremely grateful to the
Minister for the taking this problem seriously today, and indeed I know
that he takes it seriously on all occasions.</hs_para>

people have said and I agreed with almost everything, including most of
what the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said, on which I, too, would like
to comment. It is quite misleading to suppose that there is something
called the mental health budget, which is then allocated between
psychotic illness and common mental health problems. We have never
argued for more expenditure on anxiety and depression at the expense of
severe mental illness. What we have pointed out is the remarkable fact
that a mentally ill person with a physical illness of given severity
costs the NHS 50% more in physical healthcare than someone without
mental illness in the same physical condition. If we can cure the
mental illness or alleviate it, there is an awful lot to be saved on
unnecessary physical healthcare.</hs_para>

should be able to fund the extra psychological therapy out of the

particularly their references to the secondary sector. One could
document how those are affected immediately 
<?notus-xml column=224?>when someone’s mental health improves. There
is a huge amount of evidence on all that. On top of that, of course,
taking the Government as a whole, there are the savings on benefits and
lost taxes. When we can say that it certainly costs the
Government—and probably costs local commissioners—nothing
to expand treatment for people with depression and anxiety disorders,
which are extremely serious problems, it makes no sense to say that we
should be concentrating only on people with even more serious problems.

I said, there have been many wonderful speeches. I thought that the
letter read out by the noble Baroness, Lady O’Neill, really says
it all; it caught the basic point that everyone is making. I was also
delighted when the noble Lord, Lord Alderdice, raised the issue of the
comparative suffering from mental and physical pain. I have been trying
to look into that topic and have found quite a lot of research on it.
Many studies show that when people are asked how happy they are with
their lives and then record the different dimensions of their health
situation, it is found that mental pain reduces happiness more on
average than physical illness. In a way, we have to justify our
argument for parity of esteem, and I think that that is the
justification: these are extremely serious conditions affecting the
well-being of the people affected.

situation is desperate, with demand far outstripping supply. House

squeezed families currently stuck in the private rented sector unable
to get on to the housing ladder a chance to build property equity; and

community land trusts has emerged with the potential to provide a
better balance of housing supply. They work in rural and urban areas
and are a flexible tool to meet a variety of community needs. They
offer not only a number of options for rent and low-cost home
ownership, but also provide a mechanism for generating an
income stream for reinvestment by the community. In areas where a
rising population, economic investment and limited stocks of affordable
homes threaten to exclude people from the areas in which they live and

model can make a significant contribution to the supply of homes. It
separates the cost of the land from the purchase price by taking it out

individual home ownership, where residents have a personal mortgage
loan to buy a home, homes in this case are financed by a corporate loan
borrowed by the co-operative. The value of the buildings is divided
into shares. When members leave the co-operative they are entitled to
take the equity that they have built up with them. The net value of the
shares is calculated by reference to a fair valuation formula set out
in the departing members’ occupancy agreement or lease, which is
the same for all members. The valuation formula in the lease requires
resident members to look on property ownership in a new and different
way. Mutual home owners will be at far less risk of falling into
negative equity, where their houses are worth less than the outstanding
mortgage loan. They will also have the benefit of lower transaction
costs when they move into and out of their

show that housing co-operatives are good for people and society. In
particular, studies show that co-operatives outperform all other types
of social landlord on all measures of performance. They create housing
in neighbourhoods that are socially, economically and environmentally
sustainable. Housing remains community-owned and affordable for future

appropriate co-op housing legislation. In a co-op, a long-term,
enduring right of occupation of a member’s home is always
granted. This can be ended only if the member is in breach of its terms

the past 25 years the co-operative housing movement has demonstrated

co-operatives are concerned to ensure that members are educated and
informed about the principles and practices of co-operation. This can
be demonstrated in a concrete way. One example of the success of a
tenant management co-operative is in Glasgow. It dramatically
illustrates the benefits of housing co-operatives. The
Speirs Housing Management Co-operative has successfully managed its
council-owned housing at the end of one street for 20 years. It is a
vibrant community contributing to the wider regeneration of the
neighbourhood. At the other end of the street, council-managed housing,
which has received the same capital investment as that managed by
Speirs, has been vandalised, abandoned and ultimately demolished. This
is a classic demonstration of best value being delivered by a housing
co-operative.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000297" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000297">The

intermediate housing that could be attractive to those who would
formerly have been first-time buyers; development of local care and
community support networks that combat loneliness and help to support
active, independent living; and the development of local community

are a number of models of co-operative housing, some of which have
already been mentioned by the noble Lord. Ownership housing
co-operatives are co-ops that are owned, managed and controlled
democratically by their members and tenants, and usually all tenants
are members of the co-op. The majority of ownership co-ops are, at
least partially, funded through the government organisation the Housing
Corporation, which monitors them in the same way as housing
associations. Ownership co-ops are traditionally quite small, but they
give the greatest amount of control of any of the housing co-op models.
Research carried out in 1996 found that they were the most successful
housing providers in the
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:51:11"></hs_TimeCode>. We have

<?notus-xml column=230?>tenant management
organisations—TMOs—which are democratic organisations
that are formed by tenants to take on the management of their homes.
Council tenants have a legal right—the right to
manage—and access to specific funding that enables them to set
up a co-op. These regulations were simplified for everyone’s
benefit in 2012.</hs_para>

management co-op has a management agreement with their
landlord—the council or housing association, or in some cases
both—and receives a management allowance that enables it to run
the co-op. Self-build co-operatives are housing organisations where the
tenants have been involved in the building of the properties. The
labour that they put into the building of the properties gives them
equity, and they pay rent for the rest. We also have short-life
co-operatives. These take over properties that are in some way
unlettable, for a fixed period of time that can sometimes extend for
many years. The co-op does not own the properties but has a lease with
the landlords<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:52:30"></hs_TimeCode>.
Tenant-controlled housing associations also have a major contribution
to make. There are a small number of housing associations registered
with the Housing Corporation which are tenant-controlled, having a
majority of tenants on the board of the association alongside other
representatives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:52:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000301">If
your Lordships are particularly interested in specific examples of
co-operative housing, Redditch Co-operative Homes provides new-build

of the self-managed neighbourhoods in Redditch, won an award for
innovation and excellence in 2010 and currently manages 57 properties
in an area that is home to approximately 14,650 people. Kensington and
Chelsea TMO manages around 10,000 properties on behalf of the council
and is also an ALMO, which was set up in 1996. Rochdale Boroughwide
Housing, formed in 2012, took over housing formerly run by the council.

opportunities to shape service delivery and to hold the responsible
boards and councillors to account. There is a standard on tenant

particular affordable housing, and how important it is to social
inclusion. I wish her every success in her new ministerial position.
Since my noble friend Lady Hanham is sitting on the Benches, I thank

clear from opinion research that housing is moving up the list of
concerns of the general public; in a recent poll I saw it had entered
the top five. It is some years since that was the case. That reflects a
growing realisation on the part of the general public that we do not
have enough homes to meet need or demand; that owner occupation has
been in decline in recent years; that house prices are very expensive;
that it is very hard for young people to get on to the housing ladder
right across the UK; and that building for social rent has been
inadequate for many years, with a million social homes lost since
1977<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:58:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000307">I
am therefore grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy of Southwark, for
reminding us of a number of things. One is the
amount of co-operative housing in Scandinavia—some 18% of homes
in Sweden and some 15% of homes in Norway—and the
potential that might, therefore, exist in the United Kingdom, where the
figure is below 1%. There are also the statutory issues that
affect the expansion of the co-operative model here, together with the
variations possible under a co-operative model, which I do not seek to
repeat.</hs_para>

debate into its context. House prices are rising again and we seem to
be at the start of yet another housing bubble. The underlying problem
is lack of supply. Housebuilding is less than half of what it needs to
be to match the rate of household formation and this imbalance now
seems likely to continue for three years at least. Last year saw the
lowest house completion rate since 1923. However, since 1990, annual
housing completions have never exceeded 170,000 and have averaged
140,000, of which four out of five homes have been for
owner-occupation. 
<?notus-xml column=232?>At present the Government expect to increase the rate of building to
170,000 new homes in 2015, but even if they achieve that, we need to go
much
further<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:59:49"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:59:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000309">Important
as Help to Buy is, unless supply is increased prices will rise, putting
further pressure on young people and putting the potential of home
ownership out of reach for even more of them. Demand will then continue
to grow in the private rented sector, pushing up rents to unaffordable
levels for many. Despite the 22% increase in private housing starts
this year, and despite the many initiatives the Government have taken,
which are certainly helping to increase demand, there remains an urgent
need for more social housing for
rent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000310">There
are 1.8 million families on social housing waiting lists. In addition,
many people who are on low incomes and subject to the new
under-occupancy rules want to move to a smaller home but they cannot
because the smaller homes do not exist. We simply must build more homes
for social rent, and if part of the solution is the co-operative
housing sector, that is a very good thing, as would be raising the
borrowing cap on local authorities, which would also increase the pool
of rented
homes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000311">Around
a third of households will need to rent for the foreseeable future

to pay a

shared ownership proposals recently published by Shelter should be
commended, because they would help buyers to take out the maximum share

should welcome last month’s announcement on self-build, under
which more people who want to start a building project, including
affordable home projects, will receive support. It will prove an
important element of the Government’s drive to increase
affordable housing, with new grants from a budget worth £65
million, and with redundant public sector land available for self-build
projects. I understand that some 50 councils are already coming forward
with sites. In the past year some 11,000 homes were self-built. This
could double within a decade. Presumably many of these self-build homes
could be constructed on the co-operative
principle.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000314">The
Government have done a lot to promote localism, and co-operative
housing should be seen as part of their localist agenda. Devolution
comes in many forms. In housing, owner occupation is the purest form of
devolution from the state because it empowers the individual. Being a
tenant dependent on a landlord is not empowering, despite a variety of
legal protections. Co-operative housing, too, should be seen as
empowering for tenants, because those tenants would exercise control,
not a
landlord.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000315">There
are three reasons why I hope the Government will consider further
support for this sector. First, it could increase housebuilding.
Secondly, it would exist for the benefit of its members, not of
somebody else. As we have heard, a fully mutual housing co-operative
has all its tenants as members, and all its members as 
<?notus-xml column=233?>tenants. They decide equally and together how the co-op is to be run.
The third reason is that the sector is a success. As we have also
heard, it performs well in terms of member and tenant
satisfaction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000316">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:03:43"></hs_TimeCode>,
I understand from the noble Lord, Lord Kennedy, and from some of my
reading, that there is not full recognition of co-operative housing in
law, because tenure is based on landlord and tenant law, which limits
the ability of true co-operative principles to work. In law, repairs
lie with landlords because members are legally defined as tenants. That
does not seem right. A dedicated new form of tenure would help to
create a truly co-operative environment, building on the successes of a
wide variety of existing co-ops, tenant management schemes, trusts and
mutuals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000317">There

strikes me that there could be many more. Just think what that might
mean for the potential for an increased housebuilding programme. If
there were many more housing co-operatives, think of the gain in terms

their council house. But the whirlwind sown by that has now been reaped
by their children and grandchildren. Inevitably, the council house that
has been sold has then been sold on and on, and one that was bought for
£6,000 or £7,000 in Edmonton is now retailing for
£200,000. That is not a good
idea.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000324">A<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:12:53"></hs_TimeCode>
co-operative ethos is something that we ought to encourage. The
Minister will see this in <I>Hansard</I>, but I ask her and her
colleagues to reflect on what we see in the Co-operative movement and
the ways in which the Government could become more involved in
stimulating the co-operative aspect. I shall have to rattle through
these ideas. We want legislation to create co-operative housing tenure
as a distinct form of tenure in UK property and housing law. We want to
enable the creation of a financial intermediary to raise and manage
institutional investment in developing co-operatives in mutual housing

problem in co-operative housing and in other areas is the excitement
that people have when they get a little power and involvement. Very
often their heart rules their head. There needs to be some thought
given by the Government to make it possible for education, guidance or
stimulation—call it what you will—on the structures. Very
few housing co-operatives to my 
<?notus-xml column=235?>knowledge go out of existence because of bad
management, but there are some. We need to avoid the waste of public
money and other money in that

am very heartened by the debate so far. A small but select band of
parliamentarians are simply trailing their coat in front of the
Minister and the civil servants, who play a vital part in priorities,
simply to say that we have a good record in co-operative housing, and
there is better to come. The democracy of co-operative housing is very
important indeed, with one member, one vote. There is democracy in the
CDS, which I mentioned; it has a management committee of 15
members, and half of them are actual occupants of the properties, not
just committee members, and are involved in giving their ideas and

point that I have raised in other debates is about the assistance to
make land available for communities wanting to develop co-operative

made from the sale of land is obscene; no matter how you look at it, it
is awful. At the end of the day, the people who pay for that will be
either tenants or owner-occupiers. If it is possible to have land
gifted to a community on the basis that it is theirs in perpetuity, I
think that that is one of the ways in which we should go. I know which

McKenzie of Luton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, like other
noble Lords I start by welcoming the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell, to
her new role, and offering our congratulations on a promotion
thoroughly deserved. Like other noble Lords, I also say that we on
these Benches will miss the good humour and engagement of the noble
Baroness, Lady Hanham, on the Front Bench, but I have no doubt that she
will continue to play a role and deploy her expertise—born of
many years of local government service—in the cause of her
party. Let me also thank my noble friend Lord Kennedy for initiating
this debate, which has been short but excellent. It is wonderful to
hear from my noble friend Lord Graham of Edmonton, a lifelong supporter
of the co-operative movement, and somebody who has been an integral
part of its rich
history.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000329" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000329">All
families deserve a safe, secure and affordable home. Debate around any
aspect of housing is important given the undoubted crisis we face at
the present time. It is timely to focus on co-operative housing, to
examine its current contribution and what further contribution it might
make to alleviate that crisis. We know that the number of households in
England is projected to increase to 5.8 million by 2033, an increase of
232,000 each year. Yet in the year to 31 March 2013, this
Government’s policies led to only 108,000 completions, just
matching a similar dismal output in 2010-11. This is significantly
below the 170,000 completions achieved by the previous Government in
2007-08, which was still too low, as I think was intimated by the noble
Lord, Lord Shipley. Moreover, a report last year identified that
English local authorities are planning some 270,000 fewer homes than
were provided for under the 2010 regional spatial strategies; a
worrying prospect
indeed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000330">The
lack of new houses being built combined with the biggest squeeze on
living standards in a generation have meant that home ownership has
moved out of 
<?notus-xml column=236?>the reach of many families. It is difficult to see the Help to Buy
scheme—details of the second phase of which were announced
earlier this week and greeted with underwhelming
enthusiasm—doing much to help, other than to push up prices in
the housing bubble referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, so we
have the rise of generation rent, with more and more people living in
the private rented sector, which is now bigger than the social sector,
where too many lack security, have to pay ever increasing rents and
suffer poor-quality
accommodation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000331">The
inevitable consequence is that homelessness is on the rise, as is rough
sleeping and the number of families living in temporary accommodation.
Nearly a third of privately renting households are families with
children, almost half are over 35 and for many of them the sector does
not provide the stability they need. It is inevitable that for the
foreseeable future the private rental sector will grow and will play an
important part in meeting housing need. However, there must be a system
of a national register of landlords, with powers provided to local
councils to drive up
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000332" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000332">Of
course, on coming to office the Government cut the budget for new
affordable homes by 60%, leading to the collapse in affordable housing
starts. They fell to under 16,000 in 2010-11. Funding from an 80% of
market rent programme has exacerbated housing benefit numbers, but is a
formulation which is simply not affordable in many parts of the
country. As the Co-operative Party points out, the housing crisis is
particularly acute in London, with the added dimension of overseas
buyers pushing up the cost of buying and renting. It says that the
majority of Londoners are being squeezed out because house prices and
rents are increasing faster than incomes, and not enough houses are
being built. With high rents in the private sector and so-called
affordable rents for new homes and re-lets in the social housing
sector, a growing number of working households depend on housing
benefit to meet their rent. This is of course at a time when such
benefits are being cut, and the horrors of the bedroom tax are played
out on a daily
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000333" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000333">It did
not have to be like this. We have set out how an enhanced affordable
homes programme could be funded, and Labour councils are now leading
the way in building new council houses for rent, providing not only
homes but jobs. The crisis in the supply of and access to affordable
housing is a major political and social issue facing our country. I
think the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, referred specifically to it moving
up to number five on the list of public concerns. The reality is that
it will require action on a number of fronts, and we are strongly
supportive of the approach which embraces co-operative housing models.
As my noble friend Lord Kennedy explained, we are of course
instinctively supportive of co-operative principles. The Co-operative
Party is our sister party, and we share its values and its commitment
to social justice as well as its
history.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000334" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000334">We
have been greatly helped for this debate by information from the
Co-operative Party itself and by the House of Lords briefing material.
The latter in particular contains key extracts from the independent
Commission on Co-operative and Mutual Housing, 
<?notus-xml column=237?>which was launched in 2008 to research the English
co-operative and mutual housing sector and to draw conclusions about
its relevance to national housing strategy. This research showed that
the sector in England is tiny—less than 1% of housing
supply—in stark contrast to a number of other European
countries. This is attributed, among other things, to the dearth of
information and support for those who would be minded to adopt a
co-operative
model.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000335" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000335">There
are of course different models of co-operative and mutual housing,
about which my noble friend Lord Kennedy and others including, the
noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, have spoken knowledgeably. However, the
common factor is that they are democratically and legally owned and
controlled by a service-user membership. This has a fundamental
benefit: by taking responsibility, people develop a sense of belonging
and identity, as well as ownership, and this leads to high levels of
satisfaction. The co-operative model gives residents democratic control
of the property in which they live and a greater say over its
management and maintenance. The noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, spoke
strongly about the benefit of that ethos. It is acknowledged that the
Government see this approach as in tune with their localism agenda,
with powers being returned to communities and local neighbourhoods.
However, like so much of that agenda, we need to see it working in
practice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000336" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000336">Like
the commission, we do not consider that co-operation and mutuality are
the only routes to a community-based approach, but we acknowledge the
powerful opportunity that they present. Other benefits which it brings
include stimulating individual and community resilience through active
and democratic citizenship, and enabling collective influence over what
happens beyond the immediate boundary of an individual while supporting
the individual household interest in
housing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000337" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000337">What
seems clear is that the proposition that housing policy can develop
only along one of three routes—ownership, social rented housing
or private sector renting—is too restrictive in the current
environment. Where people are priced out of ownership and cannot afford
escalating private rents, and where the wait for social rented housing
can be interminable, there needs to be another
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000338" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000338">What has
to happen to enable a co-operative and mutual housing sector to play a
greater role? It certainly needs the co-operative movement itself to be
more focused on housing possibilities. The commission refers to housing
remaining the poor relation of the co-operative family, and it looks
that way. There is a strong English co-operative and mutual sector,
with nearly 5,000 businesses democratically controlled and owned by
some 11 million people, but this strength has not yet manifested itself
in the housing sector. Perhaps more can be done by the movement to use
its financial, organisational and political strength to encourage the
development of co-operative
housing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000339" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000339">That
should obviously entail embracing new developments, be they community
gateway associations developed in response to the large-scale
voluntary  
<?notus-xml column=238?>transfer of local authority housing stock, community land trusts or
mutual home ownership, as well as the existing models of rental housing
co-ops and co-ownership associations. As well as support from the
co-operative movement itself, it requires national and local government
to develop supportive frameworks. It is particularly suggested that it
requires legislative change to create a co-operative housing tenure as
a distinct form of tenure in UK property and housing law. Several noble
Lords referred to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000340" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000340">The
Minister will be aware of the debate initiated in the other place by
Jonathan Reynolds MP following his unsuccessful introduction of a
10-minute rule Bill. That debate, in July last year, focused on the
consequences of the Berrisford decision, which, it was suggested,
undermined the type of tenancies commonly available in housing
co-operatives. The problem arises because co-operatives cannot grant
secure or assured tenancies, and the Supreme Court determined that the
periodic tenancies could in fact be treated as tenancies for life. In
responding to that debate, the Minister in another place put forward
the view that legislative change was unnecessary and advised that, if
the guidance of the Confederation of Co-operative Housing were
followed, tenancies could be structured in such a way that they could
be brought to an end. Can the Minister give us an update and say
whether this is still the Government’s
view?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000341" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000341">Can the

Chartered Institute of Purchasing and Supply has stated that homes are
now being built at the fastest rate for 10 years. More homes are being
approved through planning. The latest quarterly figures show a 45%

co-operatives in resolving issues that may have been raised by the

within national fiscal policies as well as locally, which the
prudential borrowing rules do not address. Additional local authority
borrowing could have broader macroeconomic implications for the

doctor to a young woman in a cold, damp and 
<?notus-xml column=244?>overcrowded flat at the top of a tower block on the Ocean estate in
Stepney. The report went on to detail the housing conditions that the
family was living in. Despite the heating being on constantly, everyone
suffered from the cold in the winter and frequently fell ill. There
were no drying facilities and clothes had to be dried in the bathroom
and hallway. There was severe damp which produced black mould and the
windows were always dripping wet. The three eldest children had asthma
and used inhalers; the youngest boy had heart trouble and had suffered
from persistent colds and coughs since birth. The doctor warned the
family that asthma attacks could be precipitated by fits of
laughing—hence the doctorly advice.</hs_para>

in north London. She had already seen plenty of run-down housing before
becoming Labour’s candidate in Bethnal Green and Bow in 1997.
Families on low incomes are as proud as anyone else and always tried to
put on a good show when visited during that first election campaign.
The intense and grinding daily impact of living in such conditions was
really only truly brought home to her for the first time on reading
that report. In surveys of 100 families on the Ocean and Limehouse
Fields estates, it calculated the number of days lost in work or school
through sickness and described the extent of damp throughout badly
constructed and poorly maintained tower blocks. It revealed that many
buildings were running alive with mice and cockroaches; exposed that
the lifts were constantly broken and took weeks to repair; and showed
that the stairwells of those blocks were plagued by drug users. Most of
all, it painted a vivid picture of how bad housing affected the health,
education and well-being of children and undermined their long-term
life chances. At that moment my noble friend became a complete convert
to the central importance of decent, secure and affordable housing in
ending child poverty.

London County Council built the Boundary estate out of its
desire to improve the squalid and overcrowded housing conditions in

supported far too long to rediscover that objective. However,
rediscover it they did, especially after the 2004 spending review, to

England in 2010-11 —more than 1,000 of them in Tower Hamlets

Professor Peter Ambrose. Some of your Lordships may know Peter through
his tireless work and support for the Zacchaeus 2000 Trust campaign on
behalf of families in poverty. Sadly, Peter passed away last summer.
His passion and compassion are sadly missed, especially in Stepney, but
I and my noble friend are confident that his work 
<?notus-xml column=246?>will continue to inspire a new generation campaigning on behalf of
homeless and overcrowded families. Over the summer, my noble friend
received a briefing note from the Zacchaeus Trust reminding us that 2
million children still live in bad housing. They live in cold, damp
homes that result in their missing far too many school days off sick
and falling behind in their studies, or growing up in overcrowded
conditions of three or four children to a bedroom, with no quiet place
in which to study. For those children who go on to secondary school,
the overcrowding at home will make it almost impossible for them to
find the quiet space that they need to concentrate on their homework
properly and study for
exams.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000384" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000384">The
cuts to housing benefit mean that homeless families are again spending
months on end in totally unsuitable bed-and-breakfast accommodation,
cooped up in single rooms where babies do not have even the space to
learn to crawl and toddlers are at risk from all sorts of hazards in
the communal areas, as well as inside the room. The previous Labour
Government banned that practice for a reason, but the coalition
Government allow it to arise again and again. Mr
Pickles’s offer of £1.9 million to all councils
struggling with the pressures of increased homelessness was totally
inadequate. It was no surprise that Ministers gave Tower Hamlets not a

quality of the home has a substantial impact on health. A warm, dry and
secure home is associated with better health. In addition to basic
housing requirements, other factors that help to improve well-being
include the neighbourhood, security of tenure and modifications for
those with disabilities. Poor quality housing, which could include
overcrowding, dilapidation or dampness, can impact on children’s
development in a range of ways—on their physical and mental
health and educational attainment—and can have a knock-on effect
in adulthood as well as causing them problems in childhood.</hs_para>

list of health conditions associated with bad, damp housing is indeed
distressing, and a reason why we should all be committed to the

risk of severe ill health or disability by up to 25% during
childhood and early adulthood. Children in overcrowded housing are up
to 10 times more likely to contract meningitis than children in
general. Children living in overcrowded and unfit conditions are more
likely to experience respiratory problems such as asthma and wheezing.
Overcrowded conditions have been linked 
<?notus-xml column=247?>to slow growth in childhood, which is associated with an increase in
coronary heart disease in later life. Almost half of all childhood
accidents are associated with physical conditions in the home. Mental
health issues such as anxiety and depression have been linked to
overcrowding and unfit housing. Children living in bad housing are more
susceptible to developing behavioural problems such as hyperactivity
and aggression.</hs_para>

there were 2.1 million houses owned by local authorities and housing
associations which did not meet the decent homes standard. By the end
of 2010, 92% of social housing met the standards of being warm and
weatherproof with reasonably modern facilities. The Local Government
Association, working with ARCH and other housing providers, surveyed
local authorities with their own stock last year. Councils reported
that their top priority was investment in their existing stock to
ensure that it meets and maintains the decent homes standard. In many
cases, local authorities are going beyond this standard. In the private
rented sector, energy efficiency has improved in recent years, but
11.4% of properties received F and G ratings for energy efficiency

They also have a high incidence of damp problems, linked to the age of
the stock. Where quality standards reach unacceptable levels, local
authorities have regulatory and enforcement tools available with regard
to the private rented sector. Using these tools is often a last resort
with a focus on engagement with good quality landlords through forums,
accreditation schemes and training. Councils will seek a dual approach,
where good behaviour is encouraged through licensing and support to
follow enforcement processes. The other side of this is action against
poor behaviour, for example by using powers under the Proceeds of Crime

family circumstances. A child from a family that works hard to provide
a good home with good parenting will develop less well if the
neighbourhood is a bad one than where a child from a bad or
dysfunctional family lives in a good neighbourhood. Of
course, housing conditions are very important. I am in no
way understating their importance, but other things seen and observed
can be as, if not more, damaging to a child. Bad neighbourhoods where
there is a gang culture, low educational attainment, high levels of

are complex links between housing and education; however, disentangling

political decisions and allocation of resources. The work established
by the current Government, working with troubled families, is showing
many ways in which society can help families which have found the
provision of a stable and health background for their children

the secondary school exam—I was going to an elementary school
then—but could not go because my dad was out of work. I finally
made it to a degree through the Open University, for which I say very
many thanks. The fact that one is born into poverty or lives in poverty
does not exclude you from rising above your poverty, by one means or
another, and making an impression in some place or another. All I can

the two youngest children share a room with their parents, while the
teenaged children have to lie on their beds and do homework in a

space at school early in the morning or before it is locked up in the

classmates who have the simple benefits of a desk, a work surface or
some quiet space in their own home? How can they properly develop the
skills and knowledge required to compete in a difficult job market when

serious implications for their well-being. Beyond the immediate human
impact of this, it is a concern that there has been little or no
official analysis of the costs that will be incurred by the public

some of the cost-saving measures under way at present may in fact be

therefore essential that as further changes to housing and welfare

long-term impacts on children are properly accounted for. The impact of
low quality housing on the health, well-being and education of children

Proper accounting is morally and economically sound, and I hope that
today’s debate will underscore the urgency of taking it into
consideration. The Government must do more than take note. They must

Sherlock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a pleasure to respond to

but in the country as a

pleasure to engage with the noble Baroness, Lady Stowell of Beeston, on
her first day out. She has certainly been put to work on day one of the
new brief. I am sorry not be facing her across the Dispatch Box on DWP

she will be assiduously reading <I>Hansard</I>. When she next goes

the House of Lords those issues that she saw so early on in her

the heart of this debate is a moral issue. We are a developed country,
rich by global standards, whose children should be able to live in
homes that are fit for human habitation. It is, or should be, part of
the social contract that we have with our citizens that families can
expect to have a secure, warm, decent home to call their own is or
should be part of the social contract that we have with our citizens.
Thinking about this debate, I was reminded of the promise made by Lloyd
George, almost 100 years ago, of “homes fit for heroes”,
and I am sorry to see the Lib Dem Benches empty today. I was thinking
of that coalition a century ago and wondering whether today’s
coalition might have aspirations even a fraction as ambitious as those
of that coalition Government so long ago.</hs_para>

think that we are still hearing so many horror stories, as my noble
friend Lord Graham of Edmonton put it so well, of children’s
home lives. We have heard a compelling case today from all the speakers
about the impact of poor quality housing has in damaging outcomes for
children. Many speakers have developed the themes that describe
graphically the impact on children’s physical and mental health,
their educational outcomes and their aspirations for the future. The
noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, and my noble friend Lord Touhig were very
clear in setting out the impact on a child’s mental as well as
physical health. This is something that we need to take very
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000422">My
noble friend Lord Graham gave us those very worrying statistics from
that rather impressive Shelter report about the risks to children. They
are twice as likely to have poor health and
asthmatics are twice as likely to live in a damp house. The
report looked at the impact on children who live in
temporary accommodation and at how much they suffer. The worry must be
not just that these illnesses affect these children in childhood, but
that these conditions follow them through into adulthood. There is a
scarring effect on both the physical and mental health of children, and
on their achievement, that goes right through into their adult
lives.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101062000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000423">We
have also heard some horror stories about the impact on parents and
children of living in an overcrowded home. I was shocked by the
statistic from Caritas shared by my noble friend Lord Touhig. The idea
of 20,000 families in London living in single rooms should be genuinely
shocking to all of us. The noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, and my noble
friend Lord Touhig looked at some of the impacts of living
in crowded accommodation: disturbed sleep, poor diet, and we know that
children are more likely to have behavioural difficulties such as
hyperactivity or aggression. Living in a tight space is stressful;
children are more likely to have stress-related problems such as
bed-wetting and soiling. Overcrowding affects family relationships as
well as the mental health of both parents and children. It is
challenging to keep happy and cheerful when your housing is insecure or
your home or succession of homes is inadequate, damp or simply
inappropriate.</hs_para>

common for children in poor housing. I take the point made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton, about how complex it is to understand the
inter-relationship of factors. However, the evidence is pretty strong
about the connection between housing and aspirations and outcomes. Even
if we think about ourselves, how many of us would be confident that we
could maintain morale and raise the aspirations of children if we were
one of a couple raising two kids in a one-bed flat in a high rise
building in a very hostile environment? I was also very glad to hear
the comments made by various noble Lords, my noble friends Lord Kennedy
and Lord Graham in particular, about the impact on children’s
educational development and standards. I was very worried to hear the
idea that children are five times more likely to have no quiet space
for homework. Has anyone told Mr Gove? This must be rather worrying. We
put such an emphasis as a country on the importance of homework and of 
<?notus-xml column=254?>children being given homework, and yet some of our own children are
unable to do it because they do not have the
space.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000425" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000425">Children
are missing school because of the ill health that is associated with
bad housing, as we heard earlier. I also wish to highlight the
difficulties caused by children who experience disruption to their
schooling caused by moving homes, a point that was touched on by my
noble friend. It is a particular problem for the 1.2 million families
who live in the private rented sector, where the tenancies tend to be
short. Moving repeatedly can cause children to miss more school, and as
we heard earlier, parents can become depressed and the children
insecure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000426" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000426">We
have heard some real horror stories, but I was very moved to hear my
noble friend Lord Graham describe how he was unable to go on to
secondary school because his father was unemployed. Like my noble
friend Lord Touhig, I find it a real privilege to hear him share his
experience with us. I can only say to him that if his father
is looking down now he must be so proud of what he has done and what he
has come to, as indeed we all are to be sharing these Benches and, I am
sure, this Chamber with
him.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000427" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000427">As well
as hearing horror stories about specific cases, the truth is that we
are living through the biggest housing crisis of a generation. Families
are struggling to afford decent homes because of the combination of the
crisis in living standards and the simple lack of housing. This debate
has surfaced two or three key issues which I will be grateful if the
Minister would respond to. First, on the point I just raised about the
insecurity for children and families, tenancies in the private sector
last on average 19 months. Many of them, of course, as a condition of
the mortgages given to those who own them, are limited to a maximum of
12 months. However, families with children now make up a third of
renters, so some solution has to be found to enable families with
children to have longer tenancies, because the welfare of their
children depends upon it. Will the Minister tell the House what the
Government propose to do to ensure more secure tenancies for
families?</hs_para>

Lords raised the issue of the quality of the housing stock, again,
especially in the private rented sector. The consequences—the
outcomes for children—have been very clear. However, we also
know that some landlords are making plenty of money but are failing in
their responsibilities to invest in maintaining their properties to a
decent level. With so many new people entering the buy-to-let market,
what are the Government doing to inform them and to enforce the
responsibilities of landlords, and what are they doing to ensure that
rogue landlords are tackled properly?</hs_para>

the role of local authorities in this area was raised by the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton. I shall be interested to hear how the
Minister responds to her. I also wonder whether she has had the
opportunity to look at the work of local authorities such as Newham,
which has sought to tackle the problem of rogue landlords and poor
quality housing head on, by measures such as establishing licence
arrangements, fining unlicensed providers, setting clear expectations
and standards and 
<?notus-xml column=255?>improving enforcement. Newham has found that families moving into the
borough seeking cheaper housing has caused quite a lot of churn, so it
has also been trying to find ways of supporting stability in those
communities, to improve the quality of life for families. However,
those problems cannot be tackled locally, so will the Minister please
tell us what the Government are doing at a national
level?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000430" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000430">Finally,
the biggest question is: what are the Government doing about the
desperate shortage of housing in this country? I arrived at the end of
the previous debate just in time to hear the Minister share a positive
barrage of housing statistics, and I am sure that she will not want to
repeat them. However, I shall simply put one statistic on the table:
the number of households in England is projected to rise by more than
230,000 each year, yet David Cameron has presided over the lowest level
of house building of any peacetime Prime Minister since the
1920s.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101062000431" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000431">I know
what the next Labour Government will do to turn that round; we have
been very clear about this. We are committed to increasing the supply
of new homes by 200,000 a year by the end of the next
Parliament. We will give councils “use it or lose it”
powers to stop land hoarding, we will build the next generation of new
towns and we will support communities that want to grow. We have asked
Sir Michael Lyons to chair a housing commission to draw up a road map
for delivering on these promises. But for the sake of this country, and
of all those children we have heard about, I do not want to wait until
May 2015 to see some action. I look forward to hearing from the
Minister what the Government will do right
now.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/29E59E8524E2720CA9D42DD6F2BC24176017086D" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 October 2013">Thursday,

I said in the previous debate, I always listen carefully when the noble

certainly reflect on the points that he made about those who have
experienced poverty but have been able to go on and enjoy great
success, and about how we must support people in their escape from
poverty and acknowledge their achievements. I can tell the noble Lord

is no doubt that low-quality housing can have a terrible impact on
child development. In 2006 Shelter conducted some powerful research
that conclusively demonstrated the links between poor housing and poor
outcomes. It is intuitive that that should be 
<?notus-xml column=256?>so, but Shelter provided evidence—much of which others have
already mentioned, so I shall just mention a couple of points. Children
living in damp housing are more likely to develop respiratory
conditions, unsafe housing is linked to greater numbers of accidents
and injuries, and children who become homeless are more likely to
suffer with mental health problems and to struggle at school. None of
this has any place in a modern society today. Every child deserves the

is much that the Government are doing to address the problems of
endemic and intergenerational poverty that forces people to live in
poor housing, whether by addressing the factors that trap people on

education that have meant that the children who most need the best
schools have instead been let down for too
long<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:34:33"></hs_TimeCode>. There are
also steps that we are specifically taking to ensure that every child
grows up in suitable housing, and the first and most important is by
simply building more homes. The noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock,
mentioned the detailed summary that I provided in the last debate about
what the Government are doing in this area. We are doing a huge amount
to increase the supply of new homes, both in the private sector and in
the social housing sector. I shall not take time by going over them all
in great detail. But while I take on board what the noble Lord, Lord
Graham, said about housing and poverty not being political
issues—and I agree with him on that—I still think that,
if we are going to trade statistics, as we do in these debates, I have

is worth reminding the House that the numbers for social housing fell
under the last Labour Government and that, under this Government, we
are taking big steps to reverse that decline. I shall not go through
all the numbers and the stats again in detail, but that is an area in
which we are reversing the trend substantially and making it a huge
priority. As was mentioned in a previous debate, this is something of
huge importance and great concern to

has also been acknowledged, we do not just have to build new
homes—we also have to improve the standard of the existing homes

We have invested £2 billion in this spending round to bring the
remaining 127,000 of what were rather shockingly 217,000 non-decent
homes up to standard. I note that my noble friend Lady Eaton referred
to the efforts in this area that the local authorities are making. The
funding that has been made available so far has led to more than 58,000
homes being upgraded which means that, outside of London—and
London is slightly different—we are now nearly at 100% of
council homes meeting the formal standard of decent homes. There is
more work to do in London, and we have announced additional funding for
London in the next spending round. Clearly, the noble Baroness, Lady

the quality of existing stock will not alone address the immediate
problems of demand and overcrowding. It is worth noting that
overcrowding is quoted extensively in the latest Shelter briefing,
to which the noble Lord, Lord Graham, referred. Overcrowding
is perhaps referred to more than anything else as one of the main
factors for children suffering from a wide range of concerns and
conditions. It was highlighted by all noble Lords, especially the noble
Lord, Lord Touhig, in his contribution. It is important to recognise
the facts here; waiting lists for social housing have doubled since
1998; there are now 1.8 million households on waiting lists.
Nearly 250,000 of social homes in England are overcrowded, while nearly
390,000 are underoccupied by two bedrooms or

very important issue—was behind two important new measures in
the Localism Act 2011. The first gives councils more freedom
to innovate and develop local solutions, and make the best use of
limited stock by using the private rented sector when it makes sense to
do so. This gives councils more flexibility. Part of this involves
making sure that we get the best use from what is available to us. The
second measure gave councils powers to match the length of tenancy to
the household need, and made it easier for social tenants to move house
as their needs
change.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000440" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000440">It
goes without saying that housing is a complex issue. Clearly, I am
discovering this personally, having just taken over responsibility for
the DCLG in your Lordships’ House. It is clear that there are no
easy solutions, and we need a range of measures. It is fundamental to
make the best use of all that is available, and to treat everyone
fairly. I must say that, because of noble Lords’
focus on the issue of overcrowding, I am somewhat surprised that as far
as I can recall no noble Lords have raised the Government’s
decision to remove the spare room subsidy. That decision was very much
part of a range of measures to tackle overcrowding, and the Opposition

it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101062000441" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-0002.htm#13101062000441">It is
probably worth placing some facts on the record, not least because this
is the first time that I have raised this in my new role. The housing
benefit bill doubled between 2000 and 2012-13, and we are now spending
almost £24 billion per year. There are approaching 1 million
extra rooms paid for by housing benefit for working-age social sector
tenants. The removal of the spare room subsidy applies only to

private rented accommodation have not enjoyed the subsidy that those in
the social sector have had for more than 20 years. This has not been
tackled before. We believe that it is appropriate to do so, because it
will reintroduce the important aspect of fairness between people in
different kinds of housing. This must continue if we are to make the

noble Baroness, Lady Sherlock, raised an important point
about the range of housing available and the effect on some families of
what she described as insecurity through being housed in private rented
accommodation as opposed to social sector accommodation. I would say
two things to her on that. First, we recognise that, where possible,
people want to own their own home—it provides the security and
stability that is so important to families. That is why we are very
committed to the right-to-buy scheme. Secondly, we have also introduced
a new scheme called the right-to-rent fund, which is about providing
£1 billion of investment for the building of
specifically designed accommodation for rent. This new accommodation
will be for rental and will not be subject to subsequent on-sale.
Something that we have not done in this country until now is to create
a market that people can take advantage of where renting is the only
option for them, or indeed an option that they choose, but we have to
make sure that it is done professionally and that it is never seen as
second rate compared with owning the

Luce (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, this debate provides an opportunity
to focus on the Government’s relationship with members of the
Gulf Co-operation Council. I look forward to the contributions of noble
Lords and to the Minister’s response. Much of the Middle East is
in serious turmoil at a time when Britain’s role in the world
has become more modest. It makes sense, therefore, to concentrate on
areas and issues which best serve Britain’s interests.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:00:19"></hs_TimeCode> stability

Gulf is of major international economic importance. It is likely to
remain so, even as international flows of oil and gas change with time.
The GCC states possess 30% of the world’s crude oil reserves and
23% of natural gas reserves. Their sovereign wealth funds hold up to
$1.5 trillion of assets. GCC investment in Britain was more than $2.25
billion in 2012. Our exports to these countries are more than
£10 billion per annum and are increasing steadily. We have
166,000 British ex-patriots in the GCC working to strengthen our links
in many areas. There are tens of thousands of students from the GCC
studying in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:01:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

East, GCC states are now playing a major and influential role. Saudi
Arabia, the UAE and Kuwait are key backers of the new Egyptian regime.
Saudi Arabia and Qatar have provided vital support to elements of the
Syrian opposition. Oman’s dialogue with Iran has recently taken
on new significance. Britain’s relationship with these six
states remains unique. We have historic connections going back, in some
cases, more than 200 years. When Britain finally withdrew from
responsibilities in the Gulf in 1971, there were many who forecast a
quick demise of the new Gulf states, and that Iran under the Shah would
be the strong, stable nation in the Gulf. As we know, the out-of-touch
Shah was overthrown in 1979, to be replaced by a theocracy. The rulers
of the GCC have not only survived, but remained reliable allies
safeguarding the flow of oil and recently providing vital staging
facilities for operations in Iraq and
Afghanistan<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:02:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

in the world. It is as though they had jumped like a grasshopper out of
an historic Middle East into the modern world. In recent years, my only
interest in the Gulf has been as patron of the Sir William Luce Trust
at Durham University, where we have worked since 2005 with Chatham
House and Ditchley Park to try to understand the pressures for change

accompanied Richard Muir, the chairman of the trust, on a tour of Gulf
countries. This visit, two years after the Arab spring, reinforced many
of our conclusions since 2005. These monarchies and peoples are our
historic friends; for the most part the rulers still command the
confidence of those who live in their state. We must continue to give
them our strong support. However, this should not be uncritical,
provided we speak as friends to friends and with an informed
understanding of the task and dilemmas these rulers face in bringing
about change.</hs_para>

need at the same time to acknowledge that each Gulf country is
different. The events of spring 2011 sent a shockwave through the Gulf.
Some have called it a “youthquake”, as 50% of GCC
citizens are under 30. These events were a catalyst for
these young people for the first time openly to question, criticise,
challenge and aspire to play a role in their
countries<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:04:27"></hs_TimeCode>. Each
Government had their own reaction. A combination of political, economic
and, in some cases, repressive moves has for the time being preserved
order, and these states remain basically stable. Saudi Arabia has
injected $130 billion into its public sector and offered funds to help
Bahrain and Oman take similar action. However, the underlying
challenges for Governments are today greater than ever before.
Resources of oil, gas and water are finite and being rapidly depleted,
while subsidies drive up demand. Low-cost imported labour, mainly from
Asia, is becoming controversial. At the same time, there is still high
unemployment among the indigenous population, particularly the young,
with a sharp contrast between wealth and poverty, job discrimination
and some
corruption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:05:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000010">Money

faces a challenge as to how its Government and lively Parliament can
reconcile their respective roles constructively. In Saudi Arabia, 30
women have been appointed to the Shura Council, and women will
participate in the next municipal elections. Qatar might benefit from a
little less foreign venture and more constitutional development, led by
its new ruler. The UAE, in addition to constitutional development at
state and federal level, faces the need to develop a fully independent
judiciary and transparent mechanisms for handling human rights cases.
Oman continues to evolve its two-chamber Parliament, which can now 
<?notus-xml column=59?>propose legislation and review audits. Oman has given its judiciary and
national human rights commission independence and

is at a most critical stage and perhaps provides the real litmus test
for peaceful evolution. That country has an historic tradition of
tolerance between religions and sectarian groups, but faces a major
challenge to remove discrimination against the Shia majority to enable
all political parties in its Parliament to play a constructive role
and, above all, to complete implementation of all the recommendations
of the Bassiouni Independent Commission of Enquiry, so bravely set up
by King Hamad. Its national dialogue between government, political
parties and civic society must continue to be strongly encouraged by
the British. I invite the Minister to comment on those
developments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000013">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:07:48"></hs_TimeCode>
GCC states cannot be immune to the cross currents of the Middle East,
ranging from turmoil and civil conflict in Egypt and Syria, historic
Sunni-Shia tensions, the Persia-Arab rivalry, particularly between
Saudi Arabia and Iran, and the broad struggle between political Islam
and theocracies and secular forces. Inevitably, all these events may
strengthen the voices of those who are opposed to further change.
People in the Gulf value stability and are aware that they are living
in young states never previously at peace within stable borders and
which have moved within a generation from tradition to modernity and
from poverty to great wealth. They know, too, that they are an integral
part of a region still full of raw, secular, sectarian and tribal
tensions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000014">But
things cannot and do not stand still. During my tour of the Gulf states
in February, I was impressed by the quality of some of the key
institutions that have already evolved—including elected and
appointed assemblies—the recognition by some key Ministers,
parliamentarians and officials of what needs to be done, and the
frankness of many of them, including some in very senior positions, in
private discussion about the enormous challenges they face and their
need to face up to
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000015">As we
have recently seen elsewhere in the region, change when it comes can be
violent, and violent change does not guarantee a democratic outcome. I
share the view that successful transformation requires a long haul.
After all, we have experienced our constitutional development over 500
years and it is hard to disagree with those in the Gulf who advocate
continuous dialogue as the only means to make progress, and that this
must take into account at all stages the Arab experience of the tested
Majlis or Shura system of consultation. Our interest is to support this
approach along a path of relentless and constant constitutional
evolution and to seek to assist wherever we can with ideas,
encouragement and practical help.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:10:34"></hs_TimeCode>, we
should also recognise that our action will be far more effective if it
is against a background of strong friendship built on mutual respect
and confidence, and that the most valuable advice may be that given in
private. An absolute key is to develop a personal rapport with the
leadership in all these countries and to be constructive in our
relationship. The Foreign Secretary has set a good lead on this and our
Arab Partnership Fund is a 
<?notus-xml column=60?>good framework within which HMG can work positively with our friends. I

seminar with a group of young Arab PhD scholars, because I sit on an
advisory board which is facilitating higher education from these
regions into the UK. It is led by President Martti Ahtisaari, the Nobel
prizewinner and former President of Finland. When we started on this
venture a few years ago, at the time of the Arab awakenings, we wanted
to build capacity for leadership. The need for that was evident in the
countries we were looking at in the MENA region—Tunisia, Libya,
Syria, Egypt—rather than in the Gulf, where we thought that
state finances were such that they did not need help. In this area we
were looking to instil leadership through education, by opening
mindsets.</hs_para>

morning, as we were talking to the 20-strong group of scholars from
universities across the UK—though principally London
ones—what came home to us was that two and a half years ago,
when we started this venture, these countries were in transition to
democracy. Today they are all in a state of actual or impending
conflict. I share that observation because it leads me to the three

UK’s relationship with countries in this region, following our
colonial past, has been seen through the prism of three substantive
issues. One is energy: our energy needs, and their economic
productivity through the output of oil wells and so on. The second is
the region’s economics and in particular trade. The third is its
security needs, and that comes back to our trade with them in terms of

is all very good, although there are problems lurking in all three
areas, which I will touch on briefly. However, it is because we have
these narrow silos in our approach to the region that we fail to see
the need for strategic depth in the most important and overarching
issue in this region, which is political and constitutional governance
and the requirement for reform in those
areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:14:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000022">In
energy, particularly after its early, and I would say easy, phase of
development—when infrastructure, roads, airports and so on were
built—the region has failed to invest its enormous oil wealth in
strategic development. Yes, you have glittering towers, but the
substantive development of social and economic capital—investing
in people—has not happened in the way that 
<?notus-xml column=61?>it might have done, given that the region has had 40 years of the
enormous largesse of oil coming out of the
ground.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000023">The
region is incredibly hungry in terms of its own consumption of
hydrocarbons. People’s lifestyles are predicated on many
gas-guzzling cars, air-conditioned public buildings and private homes,
and so on. According to a House of Lords research paper, the UAE and
Qatar have the highest per capita energy consumption in the
world.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000024">If
Saudi Arabia continues with its current hydrocarbon needs, given the
developing energy self-sufficiency of the United States—which,
through fracking and further oil exploration, is moving closer than we
expected—there will be a real budgetary crisis in the region.
All countries reacted to the Arab spring or awakening—whatever
word you use to describe it—by hugely increasing public
subsidies and public expenditure. If one were to be kind, one would say
that it was an attempt to ensure that their populations did not become
restive. Some might say, more cynically, that it was an attempt to buy
off unrest. The result of the dramatic increase in public expenditure
is that by 2030 Saudi Arabia will require an oil price of $320 a
barrel. Bahrain, which has far more significant problems—as the
noble Lord, Lord Luce, mentioned—would require an oil price of
$112 per barrel to break even. The oil price over the past six months
has been in the range of $100 to $105 a barrel. Therefore, this is
clearly not a sustainable method of continuing to evaluate
development.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000025">On
the economic needs of the region, the demographics suggest an emerging
crisis—an iceberg, if you will—with 50% of the population
between 25 and 30 years old. Those in the 50% are far better educated
than their predecessors, are accustomed to modernity and have access to
information in a different way to the old, hierarchical systems that
existed in the region. Coupled with this demographic time bomb is the
budgetary problem of the lack of an income tax base in the region, and
the problem of citizens’ employability in the private sector,
which is fairly low, for a less than entirely obvious reason. It is low
because it is easier to hire in the experts you need than to grow your

is also the issue of ghost jobs, where quotas are put in place by some
of these countries to ensure that employers have to hire a certain
number of nationals. That is done in terms of bookkeeping, but the
nationals are not really hired; they are paid money to stay at home.
The incentives are focused on numbers, which tends to distort the
results. A good example was given in a Chatham House paper of a Saudi
student who chose to read philosophy in order to sit on a waiting list
for a public sector job. He could show that as a philosopher he could
not get a private sector job but would wait for a public sector job,
which would give him a better lifestyle: one-third more generous in
terms of salary, and with far more time off, security of tenure, and so
on. Moreover, the legal system, which requires nationals to act as
agents for international companies, results in pure rentier behaviour
in economic  
<?notus-xml column=62?>terms. Why would you engage in productive employment if family
connections enabled you to get the contract to allow a foreign firm to
be based in that

final issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:19:38"></hs_TimeCode> is
the prism through which we see the region as a security dilemma. Iran
has been mentioned but I wonder if too much weather has not been made
of the threat from Iran. My own view is that Iran has been used as a
means of ever greater defence purchases rather than as a real attempt
to find peace. Surely if we do get a de-escalation of the crisis in
Iran the peace dividend should result in these countries being able to
look towards improving some of the other things I have

conclusion, I would argue that the region appears superficially to have
a veneer of stability, indeed a gloss of prosperity and well-being, but
a clearly defined path of economic and social development is critical.
I accept the need for incremental moves and I understand that Arab
society is evolutionary and not revolutionary. Unless we have moves
towards better governance, greater constitutionalism and, above all,
the rule of law and a respect for human rights—again, I am not
asking for something revolutionary—alongside the things that
these countries have pledged through the Arab charter on human rights,
we will not see a stable future in the

family’s involvement is well known. I also congratulate him on
his timing. Everybody who knows the Gulf Co-operation Council and our
many friends within it, with whom we have had the pleasure of working
over the years in many different roles, will recognise that this is a
critically important time for it. I also congratulate the Government,
including the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and the much
regretted Alistair Burt. I am sorry to see that he has moved because I
think he was extremely energetic in the work that he did but I wish
Hugh Robertson well in the new responsibilities that he takes on. The
Prime Minister gave a lead when he became Prime Minister in recognising
and improving the contacts that had lapsed a little too much with this
vital
region.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000030">It is
impossible to overstate the seriousness of the present situation. One
of the leaders, who had better be nameless, of one of the countries
involved said that his worry was that there would be a conflagration
that would split on sectarian grounds all the way from Beirut to
Mumbai. Actually, I think he was wrong because the threat runs from
Mali to Mumbai. The situation in Libya, echoed in the news today with
the kidnapping of the Prime Minister, and the chaos in Egypt with the
suggestion that ex-President Morsi might be executed, show what a
tragically difficult situation those countries face. And the situation
in Syria looks increasingly awful in terms of the refugee numbers,
which are becoming overwhelming. They pose a real threat to Lebanon and
to Jordan—not just the question of whether you can feed and
nurture and provide health cover for the enormous number of refugees,
but the fact that many of the refugees coming 
<?notus-xml column=63?>over the border into Jordan are taking any jobs they can get at any
price and thus causing unemployment in Jordan to rise quite sharply.
There are obvious tensions in that area. We have lost the stability of
a major regional power in Egypt. Iraq gives us not much cause for
confidence at the present time. At the moment, by and large, the GCC
countries have managed to maintain their stability but they obviously
face very real pressures—both the demographic pressure of the
number of young people there and the threat of unemployment. I recall
that when the original demonstrations took place in Tahrir Square in
Egypt a huge number of people there were demonstrating about
unemployment and the lack of jobs. Of course, we know that the chaos
and confusion since have made their prospects vastly worse then they
were even then. That will be reflected across other countries as their
populations and the number of young people have increased. They face
major
challenges<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:25:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

demographic challenges, and then the challenges of what we might call
social networking. Now, for the first time, whether it is Facebook,

background that this country has an important role. There is no
question that the relationship of some of these countries in the Gulf
with the United States has changed. I do not know whether one is
reading too much into the refusal of Saudi Arabia to make a speech at
the United Nations or whether it is a sign of great displeasure with
the United States’ failure to, as Saudi Arabia sees it, support
it both in Egypt and in Syria. That is a new development. Of course, if
it is true that the effect of shale gas and oil discoveries will be
that the United States is exporting more oil than Saudi Arabia by 2020,
and given the fact that China has now become the major customer for
Saudi Arabia, there will undoubtedly be some change of commercial
interest. It is against that background that our position and
long-standing relationships give us a particularly important role to
play. We must support serious reform, as my noble friend has said, but
we must try to ensure that it comes without the catastrophic collapse
that has imposed such great hardship on the people of the countries
affected.</hs_para>

can take many forms and mean different things to different peoples.

too heavy a hand when dealing with the internal affairs of
another nation can have unintended and quite counterproductive
consequences. We need to tread warily. On the other hand, I do not
accept the argument made by some that democracy, even in its loosest
definition, has no place in certain societies and cultures. If, by
“democracy”, we mean a stake in and some degree of say in
the governance of a country, it seems that this is a near universal

concern, I believe—over Iran. The status of Iran’s
nuclear programme is very much in the news, and is certainly the wolf
closest to the sledge. It is, however, a symptom of a wider regional
tension over the perceived development of a Persian hegemony. Religion
plays into this and increasingly manifests its role through a
burgeoning Sunni-Shia cold—and sometimes not so cold—war.
However, that is not the only fissure between Iran and the
GCC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:33:32"></hs_TimeCode>. For the

through a different prism from us—and, indeed, in many cases,
from one another. It is important that we understand this. We all hope
that recent developments within Iran, and between Iran and the
international community, will produce positive results—although
we would be wise not to get carried away by the more acceptable face

however, we should remember our partners in the Gulf and recognise how
much more closely all of this touches them. I hope that we are talking

listening to them. We have expended much effort over recent years in
trying to persuade our friends in the region that we have their
interests at heart, that their security matters to us and that we take

are many other issues on which we should be, and frequently are,
engaging with the GCC countries. However, the final point I should like
to make takes my earlier plea for a more strategic approach to
political development into the wider arena. It probably seems quite
clear to most of us that our crucial national interests are not only
closely engaged in this region today but have been so for a great many
decades. But if we were to examine the practical handling of our
relationships within the region over those decades, would we reach the
same conclusion? Far too often we have sent conflicting signals in this
regard. We have engaged, disengaged and re-engaged. We have busied

has been shown by some recent LSE studies, and the members’
external trade relationships outside the energy sector remain very
difficult. Perhaps the discussions between the European Union and the

the ways in which international trade relations could be improved. Is
it the Minister’s view that this country’s best interests

Union’s attempts to get a common arrangement; and does she think
that that will have an impact on the way in which sovereign wealth

divided on what its common interest is and how that interest could be

Minister have a view on that and on whether the tensions which I
observe between, for example, Saudi Arabia and Qatar about who they
should involve themselves with in Syria are not creating greater
division than co-ordination? The possibilities for discussing political
reform referred to by the noble Baroness, Lady Falkner, and others seem
to me very important. They have proved to be a source of difference.
The shape of reform is obscure but what is plain, as has been said

view should we take? A stronger organisation would be of great benefit
to the United Kingdom. It would also be of great benefit to the
European Union if we think of it in terms of the broader economic
circumstances. For the strategic reasons that have been identified this
afternoon, I suspect that we would all wish to see further steps taken
in modernising and evolving, particularly in constitutional
arrangements, which may in the long term and with a much younger
population help create the circumstances for greater stability. Young
populations often do not respond as well to repression as they do to
understanding what their status and location are in the organisation of
the country in which they live. I hope that the Minister 
<?notus-xml column=68?>will identify the top few objectives of the United Kingdom Government.
As I said earlier, would they be best handled by the United Kingdom or
would they be handled more appropriately by the EU? I am not making
this point to reawaken our discussions on the European Union but rather
to consider what gives us the best opportunities to create the
circumstances in which we might all advance. Without seeking to
interfere in the affairs of these countries, are there areas where we
could more appropriately offer friendly advice on security
co-ordination or economic co-ordination? What might we learn from the
countries? I do not think that giving advice is a one-way street. You
often get a lot of advice, which is just as valuable if we take it as
seriously as the advice that we might tentatively offer to
others<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T13:44:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000056">I
conclude by saying that I hope that we can make real progress. I do not
know whether the ambassadors from the Gulf states get together in
London. There is a great depth of experience. The Kuwaiti ambassador
has been the Dean of the Diplomatic Corps for a great many years and is
a very knowledgeable ambassador. It may be that some of the fora in
this country might help us in these developments. I certainly hope so,
and I believe that that would be to the benefit of us all.</hs_para>

(Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I should like to start by thanking the
noble Lord, Lord Luce, for calling this debate. It has provided a
welcome opportunity to take stock of the UK’s relationship with
a region that is of enormous importance to this Government, and with
which we are very close friends and partners. I pay tribute to the
noble Lord for his constructive engagement with countries in the
region, and my noble friend Lady Falkner and the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Stirrup, for contributing so insightfully to today’s
debate. I also thank my noble friend Lord King for his warm words for
my colleagues, especially Alistair Burt, who we shall all miss. This
debate is also timely for me personally, having recently returned from
a visit to the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait and Qatar, which
served to highlight again that our relationships with the Gulf
countries are as strong and diverse today as they have been for
generations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000058">The
debate has also served to demonstrate the complexities, contrasts and
opportunities that the region presents. Over 160,000 of our nationals
currently call the Gulf their home. We work with our Gulf allies on
energy security, we value their help in the fight against terrorism,
and they represent one of our largest global export markets. The region
is home to over a quarter of the world’s sovereign wealth, a
significant portion of which is invested in the UK. This
shows the strength of the bilateral relationship, but of course we
support discussions with the Gulf Co-operation Council at the EU level
to benefit trade between the two blocs. However, our bilateral
relations remain strong and important.</hs_para>

noble Lord, Lord Triesman, we meet regularly as a bloc. In fact, my
right honourable friend the Foreign Secretary hosted his GCC
counterparts 
<?notus-xml column=69?>at a lunch at the end of September, and the GCC ambassadors meet on a
regular basis to connect with each other and with parliamentarians. I
have been invited to a number of those occasions. We also work with the
Governments of the Gulf to help us achieve our foreign policy
priorities in Libya, Syria, Egypt and Yemen, to name just a few
examples. So ours is a multifaceted relationship and, as the variety of
issues raised today shows, one to which an hour-long debate can hardly
do justice. However, I shall try to deal with some of the broader
issues.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101071000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000060">The UK’s
engagement with the Gulf is at a high point. Through the
cross-Whitehall Gulf Initiative, launched by my right honourable friend
the Foreign Secretary in 2010, we are expanding our co-operation to
unprecedented levels across the full range of issues, from culture to
defence, commercial interests to education, and of course on regional
security issues. We are engaged at the highest levels, with over
150 royal and ministerial visits to the region over the past
two years, and frequent visits by our Gulf counterparts in the other
direction, not least of which have been state visits to the UK by the
President of the United Arab Emirates in May this year, the Emir of
Kuwait in November 2012 and the then Emir of Qatar in October 2010. Our
engagement with the region has been strengthened by the launch of
formal dialogues with the UAE, Kuwait, Oman and Bahrain as part of our
Gulf Initiative. Visits and dialogues are a substantial commitment, but
they are a vital investment and I am pleased that they are already
bearing fruit. In a highly competitive global landscape we are building
strong links between our businesses, our educational institutions and
our militaries. I have taken note of the words of the noble and gallant
Lord, Lord Stirrup, who said that we have to take a long-term
approach.</hs_para>

heard today that the Gulf states represent a growing market for our
goods. Since 2010, our trade in goods with every country in the region
has increased by up to a quarter. It was worth over £11 billion

building their infrastructure, improving their healthcare and investing

companies. I should add that it is over and above the normal day-to-day
business support campaigns that UKTI teams in our embassies are working
on to deliver British business success in that region. Inward

allies at times of crisis and need, most notably in Kuwait in 1991. We
have strong defence relationships, with military assets and personnel
based across the region. The UK continues to provide expertise and
equipment. We value the contribution that Gulf countries make to our
security too, particularly through our close co-operation on
counterterrorism issues. We share a common threat from international
terrorism, which we deal with together. Gulf countries are showing
leadership in countering the threat. Both Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi

strong friendship with Gulf nations enables us to have open and honest

issue of human rights and democracy. We are always ready to speak out
as a matter of principle, and the Foreign Office’s annual report
on human rights pulls no punches. We continue to press, at every level
of diplomatic engagement, for practical, realistic and achievable
reforms to improve the human rights situation across the region. Gulf

of stability based on the building blocks of democracy: a voice, a job,
an independent media and the rule of law. We are constantly pressing
for progress—I know because I have done so myself—and we
are supporting our Gulf colleagues when we see it. However, we also
understand that reform takes time. We are seeing Kuwait building a more
vibrant Parliament; Saudi Arabia has, for the first time, appointed 30
women to the King’s advisory council, and we are helping Bahrain
by training the police and supporting the judicial system.</hs_para>

is of course far too short a time in which to do justice to the
importance and complexity of the issues involved. Nor would I expect
the Minister to disclose the detailed nature and status of the ongoing
Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, even if the UK was aware of them,
which I rather doubt. We must trust that the US Secretary of State and
his team will do their utmost to secure a successful outcome,
recognising that we have little direct influence on the
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000074">However,
if that is so, then what purpose might we set ourselves in this debate
here today? We could, of course, remind ourselves of the many
difficulties involved: the delineation of boundaries, the settlements,
the status of Jerusalem, the right of return and so on. For my part,
however, I will focus on three issues where I 
<?notus-xml column=72?>think we could and should go beyond just enthusiastic support for
Secretary Kerry, where UK intellectual effort, advocacy and, in some
cases, practical involvement might add value to the whole
endeavour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000075">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:01:59"></hs_TimeCode>
first of these issues concerns the fundamental proposition that there
should be a two-state solution. This has been questioned in the past,
and there continue to be voices, perhaps increasing in number, arguing
against it. The Foreign Secretary has himself suggested that time may
be running out for a two-state solution. That must of course raise the
question of what happens if time does indeed run out: what comes next?
Some suggest that the time for such a solution is in fact long
past—that some sort of single-state solution is the only
realistic way forward. Many of these voices, although by no means all,
are in Israel. But is it conceivable that an Israeli state that
incorporated the present Occupied Territories could remain both Jewish
and
democratic?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000076">If
the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their previous homes is
a device to undermine the state of Israel through demographics, as some
would argue, then surely a one-state solution would achieve the same
end, perhaps even more decisively. The UK Government remain committed
to a negotiated two-state solution. This leads me to two conclusions.
The first is that the UK needs to engage intellectually with those who
argue against such a proposition. We should add our voices to a
continuing international effort in this regard, rather than just
assuming that the argument has been won for good and all. The second is
that we need to do all we can to ensure that the window for a two-state
solution remains open for as long as is necessary. While of course we
want to engender a sense of urgency, we should be careful about
suggesting the existence of cliff edges—or closed windows, if
you prefer—lest we paint ourselves into an intellectual
corner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000077">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:02:40"></hs_TimeCode>
all hope that something substantive emerges from the current
negotiations, but long years of weary experience counsel us to rein in
our expectations. In situations such as this, one has to combine
long-term optimism with a grimly realistic short-term outlook. However,
if the UK view is truly that the window for a two-state solution will
soon close, then long-term optimism becomes Panglossian, and we should
therefore be thinking now about alternatives, unpalatable though they
might be. Is this truly the ground on which we wish to stand? I rather
doubt it, and I certainly doubt the wisdom of even hinting at such a
thing. The lessons of history suggest that, in cases such as this, one
must never give up, never despair, no matter how dark the road might
become.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000078">The
UK’s position, and therefore its message to others, should
surely be that no matter how long it takes, no matter the setbacks, the
international community must and will keep coming back to the issue,
will keep bringing the parties back together, and will keep banging
their heads against the brick wall until the wall one day starts to
crumble.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000079">The
second issue that I want to raise concerns an important precondition
for any enduring agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians.
In political negotiations such as these, it is not sufficient for the 
<?notus-xml column=73?>leaders to agree upon the terms of a solution. They have to be able to
carry with them sufficient of their constituents to enable them to turn
any agreement into political reality on the ground. They will never
convince everyone, but they need sufficient popular support to sustain
them through what will no doubt be difficult and controversial
times.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000080">Much of
this task will of course fall to the politicians on either side, but I
suspect that they will need all the help they can get. So we should
think hard about which international actors could wield the kind of
influence necessary to condition the debates within both Israel and
Palestine. The United States certainly has a role to play here.
However, it no longer, I suggest, has quite the economic and moral
strength that in old days might have helped it move heaven and earth.
The UK is certainly no better placed in terms of direct influence; but
perhaps our influence with third parties might be of some use in such
an
endeavour.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000081">The
contribution of the Arab League nations, even when somewhat divided,
was an important factor in the recent resumption of talks. They and
other countries in the region will continue to be important in the
development, and particularly in the acceptance, of any solution. We
have many friends among these countries with whom we might
constructively engage over the coming months, in support of both the
peace process itself and the means by which any agreement might be
implemented.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000082">With
regard to the Israelis, I regret that we have even less direct
influence than with the Palestinians. We seem to have allowed relations
between our two countries to enter a sort of limbo. Indeed, it took me
most of my tenure as Chief of the Defence Staff to persuade the Foreign
Office that I should be allowed even to visit my Israeli
counterpart.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000083">I
am pleased to say that things have improved somewhat in recent years
but we are still playing catch-up, and we are seeing today the
difficulties that playing catch-up presents for us when we seek to
influence invents within the world. We do, though, have many
individuals in the UK who maintain important contacts within Israel.
Perhaps we need to think about mobilising this community in support of
the current process, and exploring how it might contribute to the
debate in Israel. This is no doubt already happening in an ad hoc
fashion, but is there not some way we can mobilise this important
resource to make up, at least in part, for our lack of direct national
influence?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000084">The
third issue that I want to touch on is the question of security. One
does not have to be a military genius to understand that
Israel’s pre-1967 borders were a strategic nightmare. If we were
simply to return to this situation, give or take elements of land swap,
without providing a greater degree of defensive depth for Israel, then
we would be putting in place an inherently unstable
arrangement—one that in time would be highly likely to fail. On
the other hand, Israel’s demand to exercise unilateral control
over Palestinian airspace and in the Jordan Valley does not sit
comfortably with the notion of Palestinian
sovereignty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000085">Some
have suggested that the answer is to involve NATO. However, the
Israelis are very sceptical about such an arrangement. They view with
an understandably 
<?notus-xml column=74?>jaundiced eye the international community’s record in the
Lebanon, and would be loath to put their security in the hands of such
a force in the Jordan Valley. I believe that the question of airspace
control can be worked out relatively easily. There are many examples of
allies—which is what Israel and Palestine would have to
be—pooling responsibility for air defence and putting in place
the necessary arrangements for unified
airspace.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000086">With
regard to the Jordan Valley, only a degree of international involvement
is likely to soothe Palestinian sensitivities. However, international
involvement has to be what the Israelis are prepared to accept, even if
reluctantly. This is an issue on which General Allen, the previous
Commander of US Central Command, is currently working for Secretary
Kerry. It is also an issue in which the UK has great expertise and to
which it might make a significant long-term contribution. With that in
mind, has the Ministry of Defence undertaken any discussions on the
subject with the Pentagon? Has the ministry begun any assessment of the
likely contribution that the UK might make to an international force?
Of course these are early days, and we would not want to get ahead of
ourselves, let alone of the negotiations. However, it is an area where
some preliminary analysis could be of value, and certainly it is an
issue on which we should be liaising closely with the
Americans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000087">There
is much else to be said about the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations, but
I will close with a wider observation. We seem to be
witnessing—finally—the unravelling of the San Remo
decisions and of the other attempts to tidy away the detritus of the
Ottoman Empire after the First World War. The UK played a major role in
that process. Although we may now be somewhat diminished on the
international stage, we have an obligation to do all in our power to
help address the consequent problems. Practical support for a
continuing and enduring effort to resolve the Israel-Palestine issue
must surely be the cornerstone of such
efforts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:11:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/4CEF4D315F3C56E25DCA97A2EB29569126331E86" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 October 2013">Thursday,

constructiveness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000089">I
declare an interest as chairman of the Middle East Committee of the
Inter-Parliamentary Union, where we try to bring together Palestinian
and Israeli politicians for dialogue. I have just returned from one
such meeting. It also gives me the opportunity to visit the region,
which I have done several times in the past year, meeting a good
cross-section of parliamentarians, and indeed of political leaders,
both in Israel and the Palestinian
territories.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000090">I
will make a couple of observations. The first is that we should have
learnt by now that enduring peace cannot be imposed, and that the
danger is that if outside interests, however powerful, significant and
critical to the outcome, slip into the error of thinking that they can
manage the situation and manage a solution, we will be making trouble
for the future. I think that the noble and gallant Lord was arguing
that 
<?notus-xml column=75?>a solution has to belong to a sufficient cross-section of people; it
must be owned. I look no further than Northern Ireland, where we have a
very good example from our own history of putting that principle into
practice. There is a difference between facilitating and masterminding
negotiations; we forget that at our
peril.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000091">The
second thing to remember—again, Northern Ireland is an extremely
good example—is that if you are to have a successful outcome, a
lot that is going on at ground level is important. It has often been
overlooked, but in the lead-up to the initiating of the peace process
in Northern Ireland, a lot of work went on among women, for example, at
community level. This was terribly important in drawing more
people—we have never been able to draw everybody—into a
feeling of positive participation in the process, and in enabling them
to influence events. Therefore, if we are to make a
contribution—the noble and gallant Lord was absolutely
right—we must not sit around agonising like a Greek chorus but
must get on with offering practical advice and
help.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000092">One
thing that we should facilitate is round-table discussions on issues
such as women’s issues, climate change and its implications, and
the problems of youth, into which we should draw, as far as we can,
representative people from key elements in both communities. That could
be immensely helpful, but, again, it can be done properly only if we
have an endorsement of the process by the leaders in both countries,
otherwise it looks as though we are just meddling and
interfering<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:14:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000093">An
interesting thought I have heard expressed recently is that we might
try to encourage, in third countries, scholarships and support for
youngsters from Israel and the Occupied Territories in order that they
can experience higher education mutually and together in the same place

contribution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:15:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000094">I
have made these observations, but of course there are many other issues
such as human rights, the treatment of youngsters in the conflict and
so on, which are acute problems that have to be resolved because they
are aggravating everything. However, I suggest that the contextual
elements in the process are
indispensable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:10:00"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:15:41"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13101071000355" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000355">2.15

Palmer of Childs Hill (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have just come
back from a visit to Israel and the West Bank, visiting many places
including Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Ramallah and Rawabi. I thank
the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup, for tabling this debate and
for his forensic analysis and detailed strategy which I unhesitatingly
agree with. It is extremely positive that the two sides are back in the
room. This is the first time that there has been a formal and sustained
bilateral negotiation since 2008. Both sides have expressed their
commitment to bringing about a final resolution to all aspects of the
conflict. Although the parties face considerable challenges, there are
reasons for hope. This is the feeling I have brought back from Israel
and from the Palestinians. Both sets of negotiators are experienced in
the process. Israel’s lead negotiator, Tzipi Livni, is
Israel’s leading advocate of reaching an 
<?notus-xml column=76?>agreement with the Palestinian Authority. Her party’s election
campaign stressed the importance of finding a solution to the conflict
based on two
states.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000096">Prime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:17:12"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister Netanyahu has, not always but repeatedly, spoken of his
commitment to a two-state solution, which was so well advocated by the
noble and gallant Lord, Lord Stirrup. He has spoken increasingly of the
threat to Israel arising from the emergence of a binational state that
could threaten Israel’s existence as a majority Jewish state.
That is the clearest indication yet that he believes in an agreement
based on two states for two peoples. It is in Israel’s best
interests as well as those of the Palestinians. I must also acknowledge
the work of the US and the personal commitment of US Secretary of State
John
Kerry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:17:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000097">An
example of how a viable Palestinian state is being created came in a
heartwarming visit last week to Rawabi, the first Palestinian planned
city. It is the largest private-sector project ever to be carried out
in Palestine. Initially, it will be home to 25,000 residents, and
ultimately to 40,000 people. It is located 9 kilometres north of
Ramallah and it needs a wider access road and a more assured water
supply—points that I took up with the Israelis and our own
helpful embassy in Tel
Aviv<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:18:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000098">A
much improved atmosphere between the Israelis and the Palestinians has
been created by the resumption of talks. A joint press conference was
held following a meeting at the end of September of the Ad Hoc Liaison
Committee on economic support for the Palestinian Authority at the
United Nations in New York. It was attended by Israel’s Minister
for Strategic Affairs and the finance Minister for the Palestinian
Authority. The cordial nature of the joint press conference would have
been unimaginable just a few months ago. Israel announced a number of
measures to assist the Palestine economy, which included 5,000 new
permits for Palestinians to work in Israel, bringing the total number
of Palestinians earning a living from the Israeli economy to 100,000.
It has extended the opening hours of the Allenby crossing between the
West Bank and Jordan for goods and people, and it has already
implemented 4 million extra cubic metres of water for the West Bank and
had promised 5 million cubic metres more a year for Gaza. It has also
agreed Abu Mazen’s request to allow the import of building
materials to
Gaza.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000099">There is
much more, which I will probably not have time to list even though our
three minutes has been extended. However, I agree with the noble and
gallant Lord that three issues exist and that we must all continue
emphasise a two-state solution, not allowing anyone to get off the
track, wherever in the world they are, whether in Israel or among the
Palestinians. It has to be an enduring agreement, and I hope that my
noble friend the Minister will reply with a cautious, positive
assessment of prospects for a lasting
peace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:20:09"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:20:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101071000356" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000356">2.20

Hannay of Chiswick (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, ever since President
Obama’s new Secretary of State, John Kerry, began, as his top
priority, to reassemble the well-worn components of that oxymoron known
as the Middle East peace process, he has been subjected 
<?notus-xml column=77?>to a deluge of denigration, disparagement and weary cynicism from the
serried ranks of pundits, many of whom have broken their teeth on that
problem over the years. Now, with the removal of Syria’s
chemical weapons and the convening of a Geneva 2 conference aimed at
ending the Syrian civil war taking centre stage, that chorus is, if
anything, louder. Is that disparagement justified as simple,
common-sense realism, or is it a short-sighted unwillingness to
recognise an opportunity where one really exists? I unhesitatingly
argue the latter, which is why I welcome the noble and gallant
Lord’s initiative in initiating this
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:21:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000101">One
reason for thinking that there is an opportunity, oddly, is because the
Arab-Israeli dispute is not, for once, the focus of diplomatic
preoccupations in the Middle East. That could be an advantage. In the
past, excessive public focus on the issue has often led to the
rhetorical radicalisation of the respective negotiating positions of
the parties. Perhaps all concerned should reflect on whether they can
be quite so sure that the outsiders on whom they rely will be ready to
pull their chestnuts out of the fire in some future
conflagration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000102">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:24:27"></hs_TimeCode>
thought could concentrate the minds of the Israelis, whose US backers
seem increasingly dubious about any direct military involvement in the
Middle East. It could also concentrate the minds of the Palestinians,
whose Arab backers are focusing their efforts on other
problems—domestic in the case of Egypt, and international in the
case of Saudi Arabia. It could also influence Hamas, which is
increasingly bereft of external
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:22:16"></hs_TimeCode>. If
those trends get the direct parties to the dispute to focus on their
own negotiating positions, and on compromises that they will need to
strike if a peace deal is to be achieved, the prospects for progress
could be
improved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:22:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000103">Then
there are more classical arguments for giving this renewed effort to
reach a negotiated solution a real chance. We should not delude
ourselves; the fact that the Arab-Israeli dispute is not currently
centre stage does not mean that it has lost any of its explosive
potential. Indeed, the fact that we almost certainly face several
decades of instability in the Middle East, as the aftershocks of the
Arab awakening work themselves out, only increases that potential.
Meanwhile the continued Israeli settlement building on the West Bank
inevitably pushes the situation towards insolubility and drives Israel
towards something that it is no hyperbole to call an apartheid regime.
These outcomes must surely be avoided if they possibly can
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000104">Are<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:23:29"></hs_TimeCode>
there any new elements that could usefully be injected into the process
without destabilising it? One such idea might be to give more serious
consideration to the guarantees that could be entrenched, both for
Jewish minorities in a future Palestinian state, and for Arab
minorities in Israel. This aspect has been neglected for far too long.
Does it really make sense to think that every single Jewish settler
will need to be removed—by force if necessary—from the
territory of the Palestinian state, and that the substantial Arab
population of Israel should be treated for ever as second-class
citizens? I doubt it. That said, the logic of the situation is that
outsiders—influential as they inevitably are and will be, and
necessary as effective supporters and perhaps guarantors of any
negotiated solution—should be less 
<?notus-xml column=78?>prominent than they have been in the negotiating process. Rather than
negotiating, they should be talking with all those who will need to be
party to any settlement. I urge—as I have done an awful lot of
times—that we should be ready to talk to anyone who is prepared
to operate within the scope of the Arab peace initiative. That should

gallant Lord in his theme of “never despair”, but it was
sad to learn that the Foreign Office tried to put obstacles in the way
of him visiting his Israeli counterparts. The broad lines of a
settlement are clear; the logistics are not. The international

First, is there any serious alternative to a two-state solution?
Surely, one state based on the federal principle or a parallel state
structure is politically unrealistic. Nor is the status quo a long-term
alternative. I recall sitting recently on a beach in Tel
Aviv witnessing families enjoying the good life. One can see
the short-term attractions of that, but demography puts a major shadow
over the longer term. For Israelis, any alternative has major risks.
Golda Meir said something like, “If our enemies
destroyed their weapons, there would be peace. If Israel did so, there
would be no Israel”. Israel points out, of course, the divided
Palestinian groups, the reaction to the Gaza withdrawal and the
constant Palestinian anti-Israel propaganda. Palestinians see the
settlers increasing their stranglehold on both the West Bank and
Israeli

what, then, are the difficulties in making progress? Last year, Tom

there any signs of hope? Clearly at the margins, there are indeed such
signs. Negatively, the PA has not, as threatened, taken Israel to the
International Criminal Court after the authority’s victory at
the UN. Secondly, President Netanyahu has released some prisoners and
promised more investment, both in the West Bank and 
<?notus-xml column=79?>now in the gas fields in Gaza. There are welcome developments in the PA
economy. The signs that Iran is coming in from the cold, an

Williams of Baglan (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome this debate
and commend the noble and gallant Lord Stirrup for tabling it. Like all
Members of the Committee, I welcome the efforts of Secretary of State
Kerry in taking forward this process. One is conscious, however, of the
many other crises he is handling—above all, the Syrian civil war
with all its appalling ramifications throughout the Middle East. For
progress to be made on a Middle East settlement, President Obama will
need to use substantial political capital, which may be depleted as a
result of the current congressional and budgetary crisis.</hs_para>

remember that we have been here many times before. I myself
participated as part of the British delegation at the Annapolis
conference called by President George W Bush in November 2007. Talks
subsequently followed, led by the then Secretary of State, Condi Rice,
with the Israeli Government of Ehud Olmert coming close to a temporary
agreement in its dying days in office. I am conscious of the fact that
none of the speakers before me have mentioned the quartet—the
body which is seen to oversee and support the Middle East peace
process. I wonder if that is the right body to do so any longer. It is
one which curiously excludes one member of the P5, namely China, and
also Arab countries. I believe that if Arab countries were involved in
a remodified quartet, it would lock the Arab peace initiative of 2002
into the negotiation
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000114">I
take this opportunity to welcome the prisoner releases that have been
made by Prime Minister Netanyahu, which were truly painful for him and
for the Israeli Government, and I look forward to a further 26 releases
on 29 October. I welcome, too, the economic progress that is being made
in the wake of the reinvigorated peace talks. This is long overdue. We
have been here before and the outcomes have not always been what we
would have hoped and certainly fall far short of economic
transformation. This morning’s edition of the <I>Financial Times
</I>carries very welcome news that a long-stalled project which
involves a British company, BG, off the shores of Gaza, has now
received positive support from the Israeli Government. I would welcome
any news that the Minister might have in that regard. If this is
confirmed, I would see it as a strong signal and I would encourage the
Israeli Government to be more generous on economic and social measures
that it could make on the West Bank.</hs_para>

is often said that time is running out on the Middle East peace
process. My own view is that time is running out for Israel on this.
Earlier this year we lost a Palestinian Prime Minister, Salam
Fayyad—a former IMF economist and a man of extraordinary
stature—who resigned. Abu Mazen, President Mahmoud Abbas, is now
well into his late 70s. How long will he remain as Prime Minister? It
is doubtful whether any significant Palestinian leader after these men
can command the political presence to push forward a peace agreement, a
process which will be as painful for the Palestinians as it will for
the Israelis. A future leader will not have the political strength to
do this. Now is the time to move forward and this will require great
political courage on all sides, above all from the Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:33:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101071000359" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000359">2.33

Turnberg (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, according to the polls, most
people in Israel and Palestinian territories strongly believe that a
peaceful two-state solution is highly desirable and, although
expectations are very low, there may be one or two reasons to be
slightly less pessimistic. First, talks are going on in secrecy and so
far there have been no significant leaks, so that gives no one an
opportunity to start sniping. Secondly, expectations are very low so no
one will be too surprised at failure. Thirdly, the Arab League seems
keen to see some resolution to the terrible impasse that has bedevilled
Middle East politics for so long. Fourthly, Hamas might be in a less
strong position to undermine any peace deal as they have been
significantly weakened by the recent actions by the Egyptians to block
their arms-smuggling
tunnels.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000117">However,
there are very many problems, of which I shall mention just a few:
Israel is distracted by the greater danger to its survival from Iran
and Syria and may not be giving these negotiations their full priority.
It is also painfully aware that its experience of withdrawal from Gaza
was not a complete success. Its demands for security on its eastern
border with a new Palestine will be very tough—they may indeed
be too hard for the Palestinians to swallow. Withdrawal from the
settlements and re-housing of huge numbers of settlers will not be a
trivial task. Optimism in Israel is not running
high<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:35:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000118">On
the Palestinian side, they are in an even more difficult position. The
population desperately needs peace and a land of its own, but the
leadership has not always shown willingness to accept a Jewish state.
Its rhetoric in the state media has been all about a return to the
whole of the land occupied by Israel as well as the West Bank. Perhaps
significantly, it cannot be unaware of the impact that a peace deal
with Israel would have on its relations with its Arab neighbours to the
north. All those regard Israel as the sworn enemy that they seek to
remove from the map of the Middle East. Mahmoud Abbas must know how
dangerous a peace deal would be to him personally as he remembers the
assassination of Sadat when Egypt signed a peace deal with Israel.
Hamas is unlikely to make life comfortable for him even in its weakened
state<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:36:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000119">Against
this pessimistic background, what might the UK usefully do in support
of a two-state solution? We are of course very limited, but there are
some 
<?notus-xml column=81?>things that are worth our effort. First, we should exert what influence
we can on the Arab League to support Abbas and convince him that it
will stand by him if he strikes a deal—here, I echo the noble

and we have some influence with those

we should encourage the USA to keep at it despite its Syrian and
Iranian distractions, and make sure that it impresses on the Israelis
how it important it feels it is that they should do a deal now. It
should explain that America’s interest in the Middle East may
not be so strong in the future as it becomes less dependent on its oil.
The opportunity for American support for Israel may not last all that
long. Meanwhile, we should refrain from levelling unhelpful criticism
at either side while they are in this tricky phase of discussion. We

influence the course and outcome of the talks between the leaders of

can have only an adverse effect. The European boycotting of Israeli
goods, remotely traceable to beyond the Green Line, is a great mistake

Israelis feel that that their gesture of releasing 26 Palestinian
prisoners serving long, enduring life sentences has so far been
accepted without reciprocation or appreciation. A closer look at the
biographies and charge sheets of the released prisoners reveals a roll
call of the most heinous crimes, resembling some of the horrors to
which we have now, alas, become accustomed on the Syrian

Abbas in his recent speech to left-wing members of the Israeli Knesset
on a visit to Ramallah said remarkable, reassuring things about the
current negotiations. He thought that peace could be achieved within
nine months; he tactfully avoided such themes as settlements, right of
return or an international campaign against Israel at the United
Nations. These are all very good things, but it is important to
remember one thing—here, I must disclose that I have all my life
been very much involved with Israel. At a very early stage, I was even
involved as the chef de cabinet of President Weizman and had a
ring-side seat at some of the negotiations with Abdullah of Jordan, who
came very close to an agreement then.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>I can say that
the idea of a two-state solution was a dogma of the Zionist redemption.
One of the great tragedies was that after the 1968 war, which was
imposed on Israel, there was an absence of any agreement on the part of
the Arabs about what they wanted. There were the three
“noes” in Khartoum—no to peace, no to recognition,
no to negotiation—that created a sort of no man’s land at
the beginning of the settlement issue. On the other 
<?notus-xml column=82?>hand, General Sharon’s remarkable feat in getting all the Israeli
settlers removed from Gaza shows what can be

think that Prime Minister Netanyahu, who I know extremely well and who
has been on an ideological odyssey, is now absolutely determined that a
two-state solution is the only possibility. I think that this country
and Europe could alleviate the situation by being much more lenient and
understanding of the affairs of Israel. The initiatives now being
undertaken in Ramallah and the negotiations between Tzipi Livni and the
Palestinians’ opposite numbers have a chance of success. We have
to stand by and be genuine neutrals and sympathetic, not partisan

have tried in the past few days to get a careful, hard-headed
assessment of current prospects from those who are most closely
involved. I want to focus on two elements, one political and the other
economic. On the political one, it is hard not to say anything other
than it is great to see the three-year hiatus in the peace negotiations
finally broken by the efforts of Secretary of State John Kerry and his
intention to reach a deal—comprehensive, as he described it,
rather than interim—by April 2014 and to know that there are
more frequent meetings taking place in which the United States has a
far greater involvement and is very pro-active. Those who are closest
to the process have described John Kerry as being plainly, personally,
deeply committed in driving the process. I use the words that they have
used to me, and I applaud and congratulate
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T14:42:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000128">Of
course, it may fail. The point has been made today that past
predictions of breakthroughs have not always come on stream as we would
have wished. Condoleezza Rice expressed that view, as many of us will
remember, in 2008. But this is a serious United States push. That is
what we demanded they should do, and that is where we should offer our
encouragement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000129">On
the economic front, which is being led by Tony Blair on behalf of the
quartet, it may very well be that the quartet’s role is now
being expressed more in the economic construction, and that is a very
useful thing to do. Any political success will have to be underpinned
by economic advance. People will feel an ownership of a new kind of
economy. They will have an interest in each other’s success.
That is vital. The eight-point plan in the economic
initiative—and I strongly recommend it to the noble Lords: it is
well worth reading—covers construction, including the
institution of personal mortgages; agriculture; tourism; telecoms;
power; water and light manufacturing. These are all building blocks of
a viable economic future. They have been drawn up with the active
engagement of the Palestinians and the Israelis. They have been
supported by the global investment 
<?notus-xml column=83?>world and by international donors. The United Kingdom has a proud record
of being a significant international donor in that environment. We
should be proud of
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000130">Building
two states will, of course, focus on land, boundaries and security, but
it should also focus on economic and other institution-building. That
is where there is going to be a chance of designing a real future and
resilience in that future. The plan that has been guided by the work of
leading global consultants is perhaps the most serious that we have
seen yet. It is a plan: it is accomplishing a plan which is the hard
thing; making one is often the easier part of the process. It is
absolutely critical, however, and I hope that in our Parliament we will
be cautious about any further name-calling or unhelpful criticism,
rather than putting our shoulders behind what seems to be the most
serious effort that we have seen in a very long

the only way to secure a sustainable end to the conflict, and it has

they have had several rounds of direct bilateral talks, and the US

economic growth in the West Bank. We also welcome the steps taken by
Israel referred to by my noble friend Lord Palmer and the noble Lord,

Maintaining the status quo is neither desirable nor practical. The

Bradshaw (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all noble Lords for their
magnificent punctuality, which should be the precursor of this debate.
It is my great pleasure to welcome my noble friend Lady Kramer as the
Minister. I am sure that her advent here will be warmly welcomed
throughout the House. It is also a good thing to note that the
Department for Transport has today issued a statement about the Better
Bus Area Fund, with new additions to it in Merseyside, York, Nottingham
and the west of England. This money has been competed for and is to go
towards improving bus services according to those proposals put forward
by authorities which were deemed to be the best.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101071000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000143">I shall
start by talking about the reimbursement of concessionary fares. This
is still a bone of contention. I remember when the noble Lord, Lord
Adonis, was the Secretary of State, he invited a party of bus operators
to see him. We had a full and frank discussion, but unfortunately it
did not actually result in anything. The consequence is that there is a
lot of ill feeling among bus operators that they are not getting a fair
return for the services rendered. They should be neither any better off
nor any worse off, but some of them are in fact considerably worse off.
Unfortunately, that disadvantage is felt most severely by small and
medium-sized operators, not the big five. They have the opportunity to
cross-subsidise and utilise the swings and roundabouts. However, I have
received a letter from a bus operator in Norfolk who is quite adamant
that his operation is not getting adequate reimbursement. The letter
states, “Certainly in my area, now with the highest proportion
of over-60s among its population of anywhere in England, there are
longer routes where the scheme comprehensively underpays any
reimbursement, and this is causing services to be reduced or cut
entirely”. I think that we are all conscious of the fact that it
is not fair or reasonable to offer elderly people bus passes on the one
hand and to remove their bus services on the other.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101071000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000144">I want to
ask the Minister whether she will take another look at what is going on
and possibly meet with some more bus operators with, I hope, a better
result than was the case after my last meeting. This is an important
issue. I know that all the political parties are gearing themselves up
to offer, at the next general election, to do something about young
people’s fares. There is much justice in that, particularly
following the raising of the school leaving age and so on. However, bus
operators will not co-operate unless they feel that they are being
treated fairly in respect of concessionary fares. Again, it is
important that something is done about this because we should be
reaching out to people when they reach the age when they can buy 
<?notus-xml column=87?>motor cars. It is rather important that they do not buy them because of
the congestion that affects many of our towns and cities. This is the
first issue I want to bring home, and I hope that the Minister will
agree that we should have some discussions with
operators.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000145">The
second issue that I wish to debate is profitability. The word
“profit” has been bandied about recently as a thoroughly
dirty word, yet any enterprise that is progressive needs profit to
invest money. The bus companies have not been slow to invest money.
They have much more modern, environmentally friendly and cleaner
vehicles than they had a few years ago, which—thinking of the
next debate—cannot be said of all train operators. However, some
people are now describing “profit” as a dirty
word.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000146">I have
been involved in the management of bus companies. I know that bus
companies in both the public and private sectors have to earn a profit,
otherwise they will not have money to invest. Where profits are at a
reasonable level and companies are investing money, we should not
pretend that allowing the public sector to take over the routes, which
was more or less set out by Maria Eagle at the Labour Party conference,
is a way forward at all. Reducing the bus operators to penury is not a
very good policy. I can remember—because I am very
old—what Greater Manchester buses were like when they were in
public ownership. The buses ran late; they were filthy-dirty; the staff
were thoroughly disobliging; and the service cost the ratepayers a lot
of money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000147">We
know that the authority in Tyne &amp; Wear, for example, is trying to
go forward with a quality contract scheme. The arithmetic of it seems
to be very faulty. I know that there is a procedure that has to be gone
through to convince the senior traffic commissioner that a scheme is
good and will benefit taxpayers and bus users. The Government should be
very careful that they get good, sound reasons for any change that
takes place. I fancy that it will be a long struggle. The bus companies
believe that their rights are being sequestrated without compensation,
and the likelihood is that the case will go right to the Court of Human
Rights in Strasbourg if the scheme is not properly
formulated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000148" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000148">Competition
is necessary, but all attempts to regulate it through competition
authorities have proved very expensive and ineffective. If the Minister
looks back through the records of the Office of Fair Trading and the
Competition Commission, she will see that they investigated the bus
industry probably more than all the other industries in the country put
together. It cost a huge amount of money and took up a huge amount of
management time, and I do not think that any result was worth a row of
beans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000149">Could
not the traffic commissioners have a more active role in regulating any
predatory behaviour that arises? The commissioners have to accept a
registration. Before they accept that registration, they will know that
Bill Bloggs proposes to run a bus three minutes in front of Bill
Smith’s, after which there will be a long gap. That sort of
thing does not need a genius to spot, and is extremely destructive of
the network and public confidence.</hs_para>

very active role in keeping streets clear of obstructions, be they
parked cars or road works which seem to infest all our roads. I believe
that when a traffic commissioner calls in a bus operator for not
operating within the margins—margins which are going to be
tightened up to mean no minutes early and nearly 100% on time, which is
a very high target—the traffic commissioner should also summon
the local authority at the same time to make sure that it is playing
its part in the bargain because, unlike with the railway, the streets
are separate from the operator. At least with the railway they fall
within one armful with the Office of Rail
Regulation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000151">There

Scott of Needham Market (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I start by
thanking my noble friend Lord Bradshaw for tabling and introducing
today’s debate, which has become a sort of annual fixture. It is
a real pity that the importance of buses to the public is not reflected
in the interest that the House takes in public transport generally and
buses in particular. It is not just a courtesy at this point to say how
much I welcome the presence of my noble friend Baroness Kramer at the
Dispatch Box. I have known the noble Baroness for many years and I know
that her hands-on experience of transport, particularly the financing
of it, is going to be of real benefit to the House, to the department
and to the Government, so she is very welcome.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101071000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000153">I wish to focus my few
remarks today on the question of rural bus services, which is a topic
close to my heart. Like many Members of this House, I split my time
between my home in the country in a village of fewer than 200 people,
and my flat in London, which is close to a main road along which around
a dozen services run about every five minutes during the day
and then continue to run through the night, so the contrast
is very stark. About seven years ago when the gentleman who is now my
husband first came to see me in Suffolk, he asked the Londoners’
question: “When is the next bus?”.
“Thursday”, I told him. “We don’t need
real-time passenger information; we just need a calendar”. Now
my village does not have a bus service at all and I do not have a
problem with that. When I was first elected to the county council in
1993, I recall looking at bus routes where the per-passenger subsidy
was greater than a taxi fare, and that is clearly untenable. However,
people who live in small villages still need to access services and not
everyone can run a car. In my village the answer has come in the form
of demand-responsive transport. It is called Suffolk Links and it is
run by a not-for-dividend-profit organisation called Optua. Using a
mixture of paid and volunteer staff it provides a very good service to
villages like mine and, while it is not as convenient as a car, it is
very much better than a weekly bus and much cheaper than a
taxi.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000154" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000154">These
demand-responsive services are suffering from a combination of local
authority cuts, regulatory burdens and an unhelpful financial regime,
so I would appreciate 
<?notus-xml column=89?>it if the noble Baroness could perhaps write to me setting out what the
Government’s current thinking is on the demand-responsive
transport sector. It is becoming quite urgent as there is now very real
pressure on these services because of the withdrawal of bus services
from larger communities which in my day on the council would not have
been considered marginal. Central government cuts to local authorities
and to the bus operators’ support grant, along with changes to
the concessionary fares scheme, have meant that many services are no
longer seen as viable. Close to us in Suffolk is the village of
Stowupland. It has a population of around 1,800 so it is a decent size.
Due to its previously good bus links—it had an hourly
service—it has a large population of retired people. There are
also quite a number of people in the village living in socially rented
housing. Having lost their weekend and evening services some time ago,
First has recently announced the withdrawal of all bus services from
the village. This is a terrible blow to the many people who rely
totally on buses will have a major impact on the fabric of the
village.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000155">Lest
noble Lords think that I am focusing too much on Suffolk, North
Yorkshire County Council is consulting on a proposal to cut a further
25% of bus support, and Dorset 28%. In Norfolk, the popular Coasthopper
service is to be cut by a third; that is perhaps what my noble friend
Lord Bradshaw was referring to. These are all rural counties and many
small communities will be badly hit by this level of cuts. We need to
remember that 10% of the rural population does not have access to a
car. Those people will suffer increased isolation and have real
problems trying to access essential services.
It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:15:24"></hs_TimeCode> is all very
well for the Chancellor to stand up at his conference and say that
jobseekers are going to have to go to the jobcentre daily, but how on
earth are rural claimants to get there? There is a desperate lack of
joined-up thinking in all of this.</hs_para>

most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:15:35"></hs_TimeCode> Suffolk
villages, even the smallest, have a group of a dozen or so council
houses which were built after the war. They were built at a time when
land was cheap and families were larger, so on the whole they are quite
big. It is therefore not always easy to find tenants for them. Having
no access to bus services is not going to make it any easier to find
tenants for these houses, especially when you couple that with the
changes to housing benefit, which are making larger properties much
harder to let.</hs_para>

Baroness to outline for us how the Government’s role in bus
policy is currently being defined. Is there still a role for government
or is it simply being left to a combination of market forces and
cash-strapped local authorities to deal with? I wonder whether the
Department for Transport is aware that there is a real perception that
the Government are no longer supportive of the bus industry and its
needs. We have heard the questions about the changes to the
concessionary fares scheme and the Bus Service Operators Grant, which
have not helped the bus industry one
bit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:16:50"></hs_TimeCode>. The mood
music really is important. For example, Eric Pickles’ proposal
that people should be allowed to park on the road for 15 minutes is
just plain daft. A succession of cars parking for 15 minutes is as bad
as one being parked there for the whole day. If it
blocks  
<?notus-xml column=90?>the road and makes the smooth running of buses and cars and safe
pedestrian crossing more difficult, it is a very silly idea. Billing it
as a pro-high street measure reveals a failure to understand the
dynamics of people and traffic on high streets.</hs_para>

about which I am concerned, and I would be interested to know whether
the department has had consultations and discussions with the
Department for Education and the Department for Transport on
home-to-school transport. In rural areas this has always been provided
by a combination of large and small operators using the same buses on
the school runs and the service runs. As the services are disappearing,
the school runs by themselves will almost certainly not be viable for
the operators. This is particularly key where there are smaller
operators in the rural areas, because they are the ones who are finding
the going tough and withdrawing from the industry altogether. Councils
have a statutory obligation to provide home-to-school transport, so
they could, ironically, end up having to run a bus fleet in order to
get children to school, which would be very much more expensive than
subsidising transport. I would like to know a little more about
that.</hs_para>

course be churlish not to welcome the Government’s Better Bus
Areas programme, particularly the announcement today. My heart sings
for Merseyside and so on. However, my plea to the Government,
particularly to the noble Baroness, is not to forget rural areas.

opportunity to say a few words in the gap. It is extraordinary hearing
the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and the noble Baroness, Lady Scott, talk
about rural bus services. Where I live in Cornwall, exactly the same
thing is happening: buses are being cut. I do not have a car; I have a
bicycle, but not everybody who does not have a car can go by bike. The
problems are the
same<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:19:12"></hs_TimeCode> in my

also comes back to the debate we had on the Question in the Chamber
yesterday about new roads, the problems of resurfacing existing roads,
filling in potholes and so on. The Minister who answered for the
Government, the noble Lord, Lord Popat, said that local authorities
have got a big budget for this. However, the problem is that local
authorities’ budgets are being cut all the way round and that
applies to the budgets for buses and road surfacing. I do not buy into
this continuing mantra, which comes not just from this Government but
has been going on for years, that everything central government does is
perfect whereas everything done by local authorities is rubbish and
should be cut down or given to somebody else because they can do it
better. We have a long way to go in this regard and the problem with
rural buses is extremely
serious<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:20:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000162">I
also want to refer briefly to bus lanes, particularly in the context of
city centres. I do not think that we have discussed them recently, but
there has been a lot of debate over the summer, particularly in London,
about cyclists being killed by trucks and trucks being 
<?notus-xml column=91?>required by the mayor to put extra safety equipment in place. I refer
particularly to tipper trucks as opposed to articulated lorries. The
safety equipment is a good idea and may possibly help to prevent a few
accidents. However, the real problem is enforcement. These trucks are
allowed into London and I believe that they can be fined £200 a
day if they do not have the right equipment fitted. How will the mayor
ensure that the enforcement is sufficiently rigorous to make the owners
of these trucks comply with the regulations? How will he ensure that
bus lanes are kept free for buses, and for cyclists if they are allowed
in
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:22:58"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000163">Pedalling
or driving round London, whether in a bus or a car, you see endless
examples of cars, vans and trucks being parked in bus lanes when they
should not be there. They may be 24/7 bus lanes or they may apply just
in the morning and evening rush hours, but illegal parking in them
dramatically constrains the reliability of buses. The bus drivers are
very good and do their best, but the whole point of bus lanes is to
provide greater reliability for passengers, drivers and operators.
However, that does not exist. Before we bring in too many more
regulations in this area we should have a strong go—government,
local authorities, police; whoever’s job it is—at making
sure that the existing regulations are properly enforced and are seen
to be enforced by the public. I would love to see a car illegally
parked in a bus lane have a ruddy great big ticket put on it and be
subject to a big fine. The driver would not do that again, but at the
moment, most people think, “Well, what’s the
point?”. I shall be very interested to hear what our new
Minister has to say. I warmly congratulate her on her appointment and I
look forward to working and debating with her in the

Rosser (Lab):</Member></B> I start by thanking the noble Lord, Lord
Bradshaw, for securing this debate. His comments seemed to have as much
to do with Labour Party policy as government policy. I agreed rather
more with the thrust of the comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Scott
of Needham Market, and, of course, with those of my noble friend Lord
Berkeley. I also take this opportunity to congratulate the noble
Baroness, Lady Kramer, on her appointment as Transport Minister, a
subject on which she has considerable knowledge and experience, not
least through the prominent positions she has held over a number of
years as a Liberal Democrat in London. If, by any chance, the Minister
feels that she has had to wait a long time since becoming a Member of
this House to speak in a debate from the government Dispatch Box, then,
like the proverbial comment about the arrival of buses, she now finds
that, after the wait, two debates have arrived together one behind the
other. In warmly welcoming the Minister to transport debates, I take
this opportunity to express my thanks to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee,
who, as a Whip, has spoken for the Government up to now on transport
matters, and who in my experience has always been a very courteous
and approachable person with a genuine sense of
humour.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=92?><hs_para UID="13101071000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000165">Some
questions have already been raised in this brief debate about the
Government’s policy and their approach to the bus industry, and
we wait to see whether the Minister’s arrival is likely to mean
any change in approach. I should like her to confirm that there will be
no change in one area: that neither party in the coalition Government
has any plans to withdraw the current concessionary bus passes for
senior citizens. It would be helpful if she could confirm that that is
the position.</hs_para>

London, local bus passenger numbers fell again last year, this time by
2.5%, with bus mileage outside London also falling again, this time by
just under 1%. Mileage on services financially supported by local
authorities, accounting now for 20% of the total, has fallen even
further: by an estimated 8% over the latest year and 17% in the past
two years. There is no need to guess which government policy has led to
that state of affairs. If you make cuts of a quarter in local transport
funding and a fifth in direct subsidies to support essential routes, it
is bound to have an adverse impact, as has already been said in this
debate.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101071000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000167">The
Campaign for Better Transport has said that a great many local
authorities have looked or are looking to buses as an area in which to
make cuts, with some councils planning to lose all their supported
services. A fifth of such services have already gone. The position in
London is different. Around half of all bus journeys in England are
made in London, where the 2012-13 total was broadly unchanged from the
previous year at approximately 2.3 billion, following years of growth.
Likewise, vehicle mileage is up in London. In London, bus services are
operated by private companies but regulated by Transport for London. In
England outside London, services are operated on a purely commercial
basis or with financial support from transport
authorities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000168">The
Department for Transport produces regular statistics on the bus
industry. The most recent statistics, I think dated last month, appear
to tell us that total costs in 2012-13 were at broadly the same level
in real terms as in the previous year, and that operating costs for
local bus services in England outside London have fallen by 2% since
2008-09. However, the next paragraph in the document, unless I have
misread it, tells us that, despite this, the latest figures show that
bus fares continued to increase at a rate greater than inflation in the
year to March 2013. The heading for this very brief paragraph on bus
fares is, “continued above-inflation increases”, which
may of course be the explanation for why the paragraph on fares has
been kept so brief by the Department for
Transport.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000169">What
the official statistics also tell us is that women are more likely to
use buses than men, that males and females aged between 17 and 20 made
more bus journeys than any other age group among the categories within
the DfT’s statistics in 2012, and that those in the lowest
household income group make the most bus journeys, accounting for more
than half all bus journeys in Great Britain. It is therefore not clear
on which groups who are not qualified for free concessionary travel the
impact of—I use the Department for Transport’s own
wording—“continued above-inflation increases”
falls most heavily at a time when we continue to have the cost of
living increasing at a faster rate than wages.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=93?><hs_para UID="13101071000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000170">The Government also
claim that they are trying to get young people into work or full-time
higher education, while ignoring the fact that the Government have
trebled university tuition fees, scrapped the education maintenance
allowance and hammered the Future Jobs Fund. The Department for
Transport statistics also tell us that the “continued
above-inflation increases” in bus fares have a
disproportionately greater impact on the very group—namely, the
17 to 20 year-olds who the Government say they want to get into
education, employment or training, and who may well need to travel by
bus to do so—than on any other age group. If bus fares are too
costly, the opportunities for young people to take up opportunities in
education, work or training are going to be reduced and restricted.
That in itself imposes further costs on the nation and on taxpayers.
The Government can hardly claim that bus deregulation outside London
has been successful, except perhaps for the five major bus companies
who control more than 70% of the UK bus market and do not appear to be
feeling the pinch to the same extent as many of their passengers. I
note, however, the comments by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, about the
position of smaller operators and concessionary fares, and await with
interest what the Minister has to say in
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:29:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000171">The
noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, has given his views on Tyne and Wear. Tyne
and Wear is pursuing quality bus contracts to get a better deal for
passengers. Contrary to the tenor of the comments of the noble Lord, I
believe that they should be encouraged, as should other local transport
authorities who want to go down the same road: planning the local bus
network, raising the level of services and tackling the issue of fares,
including fares for young people.</hs_para>

local transport authorities may prefer partnerships with local bus
companies, and there are examples of where this has been very
successful. However, it should be for the local transport authorities,
who are accountable, to decide which road to take. The Government
should not appear to side with bus companies, who do not seem to like
quality contracts, through funding arrangements which militate against
local transport authorities that want to go down that

taken advantage of me and talked about my facing two debates today
already. Instead, I will make just one statement, because I want it to
be absolutely clear: this Government have no plans to withdraw
concessionary fares for older and disabled people. They are enshrined
in law and that remains the position. I want to make that clear before

can all agree that buses play a vital role in our economy: 4.6 million
bus journeys were made on local buses in England in 2011-12. They are
essential for people to get to work and to education. They are a
lifeline for many people, enabling them to socialise. Over half of
those outside London who rely on the bus do not have access to a car.
Studies such as those from the University of Leeds have reinforced the
importance of buses to a healthy and growing economy, and that is
surely something we all support.</hs_para>

there has been some suggestion, particularly from Lord Rosser, that the
situation is bleak, I suggest that there is evidence to the contrary.
Customer satisfaction with bus journeys is high: 84% of passengers are
satisfied with their service. We all want to see that figure improved,
but let us not deny that that is a mark of success, particularly
compared to the past. Under-21s make up a third of bus passengers; as a
group they are often fascinated by the car, yet they are accepting the
bus as a way to travel. Use among the over-60s is also increasing,
especially as a result of the national concessionary pass.</hs_para>

the Government remain committed to improving bus services, and
expenditure on buses reflects that. This year the Government spent
£1 billion on the concessionary travel entitlement and
£340 million on direct subsidies to bus operators in England. We
have allocated over £300 million to major bus projects in the
last year, and we have provided £70 million, through the Better

pick up the issue of demand-responsive transport, raised by my noble
friend Lady Scott of Needham Market. We have allocated £20
million to support community transport. This is an area of real
interest and challenge because it is going to take an intelligent and
innovative approach to work out how to provide transport to areas where
demand is irregular and sporadic. It means that local authorities will
have to bring together the community, so that many others in the
community—the voluntary services and stakeholders—can try
to look for answers to this. It is one of the reasons why the
Government have said that the answers have to be found in the local
community, which understands the local problems, rather than imposed
constantly from Whitehall. She also raised the home-to-school transport
issue. I need to understand that better, and I promise to try to do

include reforming bus subsidy, improving competition, improving local
authority capability in tendering—and

is no doubt that we are operating in challenging economic times. The
Government must ensure that the bus market is still attractive to all
operators, large and small—precisely the point raised by my

bus service operators grant, paid to bus operators, has historically
been provided in a blunt, untargeted way, related to fuel consumption.
But from January 2014, the bus subsidy previously claimed by operators
of non-commercial services will be devolved to local authorities. I
hope that that will drive forward that kind of innovation and new
thinking. That money will be ring-fenced until 2017 to ensure stability

several noble Lords around this table have said, some local authorities
have argued that they can make the bus subsidy deliver better value for
money by working in partnership with their bus operators to grow the
bus market. We can all agree that Reading and Nottingham are fine
examples of the sort of excellent bus service that can be achieved
through that kind of partnership. The noble Lord, Lord Rosser,
acknowledged that. It is precisely what the four new Better Bus Areas,
which I announced today in a Written Ministerial Statement, are
intended to test; I thank my noble friend Lord Bradshaw for his kind
comments on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:37:46"></hs_TimeCode>. The policy

the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, has said, Better Bus Areas are quite
distinct from quality contract schemes, where, in effect, the local

strongly that local authorities and local communities should be making
the decision about which way they should go on this. If I understood
the noble Lord, Lord Rosser, he took that position as well. Some will
go one way and some will go another, but I believe that it is
absolutely vital that Whitehall does not try to pretend that it
understands the needs of each local community. Providing that
flexibility to go in two directions seems to be something that we
should see as a strength, not as a weakness.</hs_para>

the reimbursement of concessionary fares, the underlying principle, as
the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said is: no better off and no worse off.
It is an EU regulation and there is plenty of guidance around all this.
I am very happy to meet those who think that it is not working
effectively, but I should point out that, at the end of a process, bus
operators can appeal to the Secretary of State on this
issue—indeed, during the past two years, the number of those
appeals has fallen, so this may be less of a problem than we might

such as in York, which has employed enforcement officers. This is
another area where we must look to local communities to work out how it

that I would start with a Michael Caine moment. Not a lot of people
know this, but the east of England is one of only two regions that make
a net contribution to the Treasury. That is quite interesting, because
when people talk about English regions, they talk about Leeds,
Manchester and Newcastle. They do not think about Norwich, Chelmsford
and Ipswich. It is a really impressive feat, particularly when you
consider the rather poor investment in road and rail infrastructure
that the east of England has had for the past half-century.</hs_para>

wish to focus my comments today on just part of the region: the
counties of Norfolk, Cambridgeshire, Essex and of course my home county
of Suffolk. I am really pleased to see that those areas are all
represented by speakers in today’s debate. Hertfordshire and
Bedfordshire are of course within the eastern region in government
terms, but in rail terms they are quite a separate region, so I will
leave them to one
side<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>. I want to
try to make the case for more strategic investment in our region. Given
her background, I know that the Minister will bring a real

investment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000195">Many
parts of our regional rail infrastructure have had no modernisation in
the past half-century. Much of the rolling stock is now 40 years old.
Recent problems with the franchise holders and now with the franchise
process itself have resulted in a miserable passenger experience for
far too many people in our region. Passengers are being asked to pay
higher fares every year, but experience a worse service overall. The
award of an interim franchise to Greater Anglia, which has now been
extended for a short period, has meant that investment in rolling
stock, which is so desperately needed, cannot be made. It has improved
the reliability of the service, but faces an uphill struggle against
problems caused by poor infrastructure; notably signalling, 
<?notus-xml column=98?>which brought the entire line into London to a complete halt on Tuesday
this week. I would appreciate an update from the Minister on the
question of the franchise for our region.</hs_para>

this. A few years ago, one of the very worst areas in our region was
the misery line from Southend to Fenchurch Street, which has now been
transformed by new investment. Right through the region and
particularly on the main lines, keeping costs down in the old BR days
resulted in a number of inadequate stretches of track. I am really
pleased that some of these false economies have now been rectified. It
is not on the tip of everyone's tongue, but the completion of the
Beccles loop, which cost £4 million, has been transformative. On
the East Suffolk line, usage has gone up 12% since December, because
the Beccles loop and the associated signalling have enabled an hourly
train service to
run<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T15:59:59"></hs_TimeCode>. That

eastern regional economy is driven by centres of growth in Cambridge,
Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Chelmsford and Southend, supported by the
market towns and their rural hinterland. Our region also plays a key
part in driving forward the capital’s economy. That is
especially true of Essex. At its most basic, without the tens of
thousands of people who endure a daily commute into London from Essex,
our entire economy would grind to a halt. Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich,
Colchester, Chelmsford and Harlow are already hubs of science,
innovation and new technology.</hs_para>

Anglia’s ports have an unparalleled opportunity to develop the
offshore energy industry. Felixstowe is already the fourth largest
container port in the world and has created around 40,000 jobs in the
area. If it is to compete with Antwerp and Rotterdam, it needs
infrastructure that is fit for purpose. Some improvements have been
made, but further improvement to the Felixstowe to Nuneaton freight
corridor is an essential part of ensuring the continued growth, given
the congestion on the adjacent A14. Investment in the Ipswich chord is
another good start but we need to continue investing. I am very pleased
to see the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, in his place today and speaking
in this debate. He has done more to keep rail freight on the agenda

longer-term aspiration for the region, and one which has been talked
about since long before I first came into local government in the early
1990s, is the east-west rail link, a link between Cambridge and Oxford.
It is not about linking the two old rivals but about providing access
between the south-west and south Midlands to the east of the country in

average age of 25 years. Greater Anglia has made some improvements in
cleanliness which are greatly welcome, but, with the uncertainty of the

much promoted by thriving community rail partnerships, such as the
Crouch Valley, the Gainsborough, Mayflower, Wherry, and Bittern lines.
There are 11 community rail lines in Suffolk which have been really
successful in raising the profile of the railway locally and in some
cases doubling the number of passengers using them. Just to echo the
point made by the Minister in the previous debate on buses, they really
show the value of harnessing local involvement, because community rail
partnerships are harnessing this enthusiasm, recruiting volunteers to
work with local authorities in the rail industry, securing improvements

friend for securing this debate and for giving us the opportunity to
explore some important issues. My interest in this debate is that of a
passenger—a regular passenger but thankfully not a
commuter—on the London Liverpool Street to Norwich line. My own
station is Hatfield Peverel between Chelmsford and Witham. As my
husband is the Member of Parliament for Harwich and North Essex, I am
even more acutely aware of what a big issue this is for all MPs and
commuters on this line. The annual season ticket from Hatfield Peverel
is now £4,696, which out of taxed income is a lot of money for
an unreliable and very overcrowded
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000211">The
eastern regional economy is driven by the centres of growth in
Cambridge, Norwich, Ipswich, Colchester, Chelmsford and Southend and
supported by smaller market towns. This burgeoning economic strength is
increasingly threatened by the hopeless gridlock, congestion and
capacity shortfall on our transport network. Local businesses and
quality of life are undermined. Commuters on the Greater Anglia
franchise who commute on the Great Eastern main line have long been let
down by underinvestment and the whole of the east of England has
suffered for too long from the effects of this underinvestment. These
commuters are effectively paying to subsidise rail services elsewhere
as the franchise hands £110 million a year over to the Treasury.
They also suffer from frequent delays and problems on the line as
congestion and signalling problems impact on them on a regular basis.
Indeed, I was in the Clerk of the Parliaments’ office earlier
this week and was told by the PA who travels from Hatfield Peverel of
the terrible delays on Tuesday  
<?notus-xml column=101?>due to signalling failure, as mentioned by the noble Baroness. The

pay.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000212">Investing
in infrastructure and services—such as improvements to tracks to
boost capacity and to reduce delays and congestion, new trains, and
better passenger services such as wi-fi and refreshments—could
potentially unlock £3.7 billion of economic growth for the
region. This economic analysis was put together in the GEML capacity
study report. I congratulate the region’s MPs who have all got
together to publish a rail prospectus to further the campaign for
investment in rail services and infrastructure. The prospectus outlines
the measures needed to support economic growth and job creation in the
region through the railways. These measures are intended to deliver
regular services between London and Ipswich with journey times brought
down to 60 minutes and between London and Norwich with
journey times brought down to 90 minutes—also known as the
“Norwich in Ninety” campaign. The prospectus has been
supported by councils, business groups and rail user groups in the
region and I understand the Secretary of State for Transport has been
engaged with this process, meeting MPs and organisations to discuss the
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000213">In
Network Rail’s strategic business plan for control period
5—investment period 2014-19—it has committed to spending
around £2.2 billion in the east of England. The infrastructure
improvements include works to signals, new switches and crosses, and
the remodelling of Bow Junction near Stratford to increase capacity.
The region will also benefit from Crossrail coming to Shenfield. All
these investments are welcome but further investment is needed to boost
this economic corridor. In particular, commuter and freight capacity on
the GEML will be enhanced considerably by introducing four-tracking
north-east of Chelmsford. I am sure my noble friend Lord
Hanningfield<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:13:43"></hs_TimeCode>

This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:13:43"></hs_TimeCode> new

Essex County Council, Chelmsford City Council, the Essex chambers of
commerce, Network Rail and Abellio Greater Anglia to develop a strong
economic case for this new infrastructure, recently holding a meeting
with them in Chelmsford. Other improvements that are being pressed for
include: new, refitted or fully refurbished rolling stock; an increased
frequency of services; improvements to branch lines; increased parking
capacity at train stations; and track upgrades throughout the GEML to
enable services to travel at 110mph to speed up journey times. The new

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> I am very grateful to the noble Baroness
for achieving this debate. For me, the East Anglia rail network is one
of the most important parts of the network in our country. I declare an
interest as chairman of the Rail Freight Group. I will not talk just
about freight but about Sizewell, which is in the region. Most speakers
have commented on the lack of sufficient track on most of the network.
Most places are two-track, except the Felixstowe branch which is a
single track. As the noble Baroness has said, Felixstowe is a very
successful
port<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:16:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000216">In
spite of that—I say “in spite of”, although there
is an hourly passenger service on the Felixstowe
branch—Felixstowe is achieving 30 trains in each direction on
the single track, which is a credit to the port, Network Rail and
others. The noble Baroness mentioned the chord that allows the trains
to go straight from Felixstowe to Peterborough and Nuneaton without
reversing. I call it the bacon factory chord which is a much nicer
name. It will make a great difference to the
volume<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:16:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000217">It
is a lovely challenge to have all the jobs at Felixstowe but the
intermodal traffic by rail is forecast to at least double, probably
more, in 20 years. Whether it will go to Felixstowe, London Gateway or
Southampton is a matter for debate. I know that the port will work very
hard to get a good market share of that. A new rail freight terminal
has just opened at Felixstowe. I do not know whether any noble Lords
went to the opening. I could not go myself but I was told that it was
very good.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:17:12"></hs_TimeCode>, there
Felixstowe is, connected to a single track, which needs to be doubled
quickly. It is not a difficult job as it goes mostly through fields. A
lot of improvements have already been done to the bacon factory chord,
Ipswich, Nuneaton through Peterborough. The gauge has been enhanced to
take the nine-foot six-inch boxes on standard wagons and the signalling
is being improved. A few other things also need
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:17:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

next stage is to have the line electrified. Around six months to a year
ago, the Government announced an electric spine from Southampton, which
will be very useful for freight and which we all welcome.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:17:58"></hs_TimeCode>, there
should also be an electric spine from Felixstowe, which would improve
the capacity. It would obviously reduce the emissions that there are
from the diesel trains. It would also enable more freight trains from
Felixstowe to the Midlands and the north-west to avoid going along the
North London Line in London. Our colleagues in London are not very
happy about having all those freight trains. It is rather odd to have
freight trains going through virtually the centre of a major capital
city. That suggestion would help a great
deal<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:18:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000219">Electrification
needs to be on the agenda in a firm programme, whereby the train
operators will invest in the electric locos necessary. It is really
good news that in the past month Direct Rail Services announced the
order for the first new electric locomotives probably for 25 years. The
beauty of them is that they also have 
<?notus-xml column=103?>a diesel donkey engine in them so that they can do the last mile into
terminals. It needs doing, and it needs doing properly and planning in
advance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:19:04"></hs_TimeCode>. For me,
freight is a very important part of the East Anglia region. I am sure
that those who are keen to see better passenger services will be
pleased that more freight in the future will probably go a different
way rather than through
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:19:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000220">As
regards Sizewell, a big nuclear power station will probably go ahead
and will employ a large number of people. I have been talking to EDF,
the developer, about whether it could try to avoid too much damage to
the local roads in Suffolk and the area by making more use of the
railways. I know there has been an improvement in Beccles, which is
good but it probably needs double tracking, where there is none, from
Woodbridge or somewhere around there.</hs_para>

are two reasons for doing this. One is to get the workers to work. Why
cannot they go by bus or car? Of course they can, but in a great big
traffic jam, which would be very bad for all the other users. Why could
there not be a bit of a link? It would be the old, original link to
Aldeburgh, extended into the Sizewell site to run passenger services
for the workers—the commuters, if you like—from Ipswich
or wherever. I see that as a big Section 106 improvement, which I hope
the local authorities will push for. I think they
will<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

second reason for making more use of the railways is, of course, to try
to stop too many deliveries coming by road. This was done very
successfully in the construction of terminal 5, and it was done
reasonably successfully for the Stratford Olympics. All the bulk
materials can come and go—they can go by sea as well now. In the
construction of terminal 5, when it came to bringing things such as
desks, basins and all the smaller things that you would not necessarily
bring by rail, there was a series of consolidation centres
around the country, wherever was convenient for the manufacturing or
supply. The contractors called up for what they wanted the day before,
and the goods were sent down by train overnight. It just needed a rail
terminal in the
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:21:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000223">The
combination of passenger and freight benefits for Sizewell and for the
residents who live around there would be immense. I hope the Government
will encourage EDF to look at that very positively when it comes to the
planning process, and make it all part of a Section 106 agreement.
Again, I am very pleased to welcome the new Minister to this debate and
I look forward to what she has to

Bradshaw (LD):</Member></B> I do not live in East Anglia, but because
one of my grandchildren has recently gone to University in Norwich, I
have sampled the passenger service. It was really quite a shock: it was
so shabby—I think that is the word I would use to describe it.
It did not seem to be like an inter-city service at all. The point I
want to make is that the new franchise is due to be let in 2016. It is
important that plans are made to find new rolling stock. Rolling stock
off the east coast, which is called mark 4 rolling stock, 
<?notus-xml column=104?>is pretty good and would be very good if it were refurbished. It could
be used to revolutionise the East Anglian service and the electric
locomotives could go there as well, because the Department has ordered
the IEP trains—the express inter-city trains from
Hitachi—to work the east coast services. I will not go into that
saga—it has been much discussed—but whichever this
franchisee is, it should be in the position where it negotiates with
the suppliers of the rolling stock. This is not a process in which the
Department for Transport need to be or should be
involved<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:23:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000225">Rolling
stock companies were set up and they were supposed to own or provide
the rolling stock. The train operator was supposed to be what is called
“asset light”. It was supposed not to own the track and
not to own the rolling stock. Therefore, it could make decisions about
hiring the rolling stock which was best for that route. I hope that the
franchising process can be put in train sufficiently early for the
potential franchisees to agree with the rolling stock companies what
they want to do the job. There will be surplus rolling stock which they
will be able to use. It is not the sort of thing for which the
department has the skills necessary to actually make this happen. I am
sure that these trains, if refurbished, would be a huge lift to the
area because they have half their life
left<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:24:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I know
that is not as good as new trains but it would be an
improvement.</hs_para>

urge the Minister to get the franchising process moving and, when the
franchise is let, to let it for a longish period. Particularly in
recent years, franchisees have been given short-term extensions during
which they cannot possibly be expected to invest. They might apply a
coat of paint, clean the trains and hire a few staff, but they cannot
invest. The problem is the disjuncture between the long life of railway
assets—40, 50, 60 or 70 years—and the very short
franchises. The franchise should be long enough for the franchisee to
see some return on his money.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:26:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:26:22"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:26:22"></hs_TimeCode>,
the franchise should not be extended unless there are means in place by
which the franchisee is held to account for punctuality, cleanliness
and reliability. Reliability is particularly important, because it is
the long delays that upset people. Let us have a sort of quality
partnership, whereby the franchisee gets a long franchise in return for
achieving what is expected, both in return to the Treasury and in
quality.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101071000374" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000374">4.26

am getting on a bit in years, and I have probably been using the
railways in the eastern region longer than anyone in this Room. My
mother came from a little town called Holt in north Norfolk. The only
rail service in Holt today is a steam engine you can take from
Sheringham to Holt. I used to go regularly to Holt with my mother
during the war, and I have cards 
<?notus-xml column=105?>sent by my mother to my father saying: “Paul and I will be at
Chelmsford station at two o’clock on Saturday afternoon”;
I was a two year-old at the time. Since then, I have been using the
trains very frequently, coming to London to attend meetings of the
National Farmers Union, local government—as most people
know—the Association of County Councils, the Local Government
Association, and now the House of Lords. I have been a regular user of
the railways in the east for 70

do not think the railways are as good now as they were when I was a two
year-old. The service is very unreliable at times. Most people have
mentioned the signalling problems. I was one of those caught up in them
on Tuesday; the delays were initially an hour. Most Lords have
mentioned reliability, and we do not have reliability in the eastern
region. Every week there is a disruption to the train service. On
Tuesday it was pretty bad because the signals problems were not just in
Chelmsford, but in Rochford as well. The whole of Essex, and right up
to Norwich, was at a standstill for a long while on Tuesday
morning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T16:28:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000230">It
seems to me that in this day and age improving signalling should not be
beyond us. Surely, given the technology we have now, signalling could
be improved, and virtually all these delays are due to signalling. If
some investment could be put into signalling now, we might have a
better and more reliable service without billions of pounds of
investment. As noble Lords have said, the eastern region is a net
contributor, so money spent on signalling now might solve the problems
in the short term.</hs_para>

noble Baroness, Lady Jenkin, mentioned the station at Chelmsford. That
is another improvement that could solve a lot of problems. The
developers will build the station, at no cost to the national Exchequer
or even to the rail companies serving the station. There needs to be is
a loop just north of Chelmsford back towards Witham. Then the trains
could sit in the loop while others came up and down the line. There
will be a large car park there which will stop the enormous congestion
in Chelmsford at peak times. That could solve a lot of the problems in
the eastern region, so I hope that the Minister will take that one up

noble Lords have mentioned rolling stock. I agree with the noble Lord,
Lord Bradshaw, that our service is pretty shabby, but we could do with
a few more shabby coaches rather than none at all. Often, the trains
are very short. I now often catch the train at Ingatestone. This was
not first thing in the morning, it was about 10 am. The lord-lieutenant
and I were standing on the platform, two elderly Peers. We got on the
train and there was nowhere to sit down, so we both had to stand up. I
felt ill and collapsed on the floor and the lord-lieutenant was holding
me up, trying to support me. Initially, no one gave us their seats or
anything. Then we were offered a seat and, fortunately, I was helped
off the train at Stratford. I must say that the attendants at Stratford
station were very good. It was because of the size of the train at
10 am that we had to stand up. So it seems that we could do
something better with rolling stock now, rather than waiting years for
it.</hs_para>

Lady Jenkin, said, the whole of the county is buoyant. At 6 am, the

Brinton (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble
friend Lady Scott of Needham Market on securing this debate, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Kramer, on her appointment as Minister. It has
been fascinating listening to noble Lords who are much more expert on
the complex technical issues of the rail network than I am or will ever
be. However, there is one area in which I have become more experienced
than I might have wished over the past few years, and that is
disability access to trains and stations, where more investment in the
rail network is essential. But it is not just about money; it is also
about attitude at the top of the train operating companies. I hope that
your Lordships will allow me to stretch the scope of the Question for
Short Debate today to include the train operating companies that cover
the east of England region, despite the earlier comments of my noble
friend Lady Scott, not least because my experience is over the whole of
the east of England and I think that some points bear
comparison.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000235" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000235">I
shall start by saying that the staff of whichever train operating
company I have had to ask for assistance have been unfailingly helpful.
Sadly, the services offered are somewhat mixed. Starting with
wheelchair access, the east of England train operating companies all
set out their offer on their websites and are proud to say that most of
their larger stations are step-free and have barriers suitable for a
wheelchair to go through, but that is only as good as the lifts at the
station. Intermittent faults on a lift are an irritant to someone with
a stick and a case, but to someone with a wheelchair, that station
becomes a no-go zone. At Watford Junction, a lift went out of service
10 days ago and we were told at the time that it would be mended within
three days. It is still out of service. We have been told that someone
has written off for a part, but we have no idea when service will
resume. The alternative route to that platform, which is the main west
coast line down to London, means that you have to come out of the
station, go all the way round it and under a tunnel, climb up a steep
hill into the car park, and then get a member of staff to unlock the
gate for you in order to access the
platform.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000236">Then
there is the vexed issue of ramps on to trains. Disabled passengers
travelling home in the evening can usually find support at the London
terminus, but people tell me that they have occasionally arrived at
their destination and there is no staff member to meet them, certainly
not to put up a ramp. A staff member pointed out to me that it was
helpful that I lived at a 
<?notus-xml column=107?>main station with 24-hour staff. What people do when staff are there for
only part of the day or, worse, at unmanned stations, is a real issue.
At another station that I have had occasion to use, if you are in a
wheelchair you have to wait until the train has left the station to be
escorted down a ramp, across the rail track and up the ramp on the
other side. That is clearly not safe in this day and age.</hs_para>

are in wheelchairs. I tend not to use a wheelchair on trains unless I
have to. Many disabled people rely on sticks and crutches. The modern
trend for beautiful forecourts—King’s Cross, Watford
Junction and, just out of the region, Birmingham New
Street—rightly addresses the issue of flat surfaces and wide,
automatic doors. However, the amazing new hall at King’s Cross,
which I use frequently, has positioned the disabled priority seats for
waiting in a place where you cannot see the departure boards. The seats
are right underneath them, so you have to get up and move to find out
the platform your train will arrive at. They have not thought about the
walking disabled and how they will get to and from the station. The
taxi drop-off at King’s Cross is great, but if you want to get a
taxi once you have come off a train at King’s Cross, you have to
stand and queue with everyone else. I have done that for up to 15
minutes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000238" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000238">The
recently opened forecourt at Watford Junction had neither a disabled
drop-off point nor a pick-up space near the station. The new provision
removed the disabled spaces beside the forecourt and put them on the
other side of the bus station. When I first inquired about that, I was
told that all disabled people use wheelchairs, and that wheelchairs and
access do not matter as long as there is a path. Let me tell you that
after four months they now have a disabled drop-off and pick-up point,
but they had real problems in understanding that people with blue
badges carry the badges with them, so people coming to pick them up do
not have the badge. When they are accosted, they have to say—my
husband is expert at this—“My wife will be along in a
minute and will show you her badge then”. Good practice in this
area includes Euston and St Pancras, where they have separate queues
and priority access for disabled passengers, and it is well
signposted.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000239" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000239">I
will move briefly to access on trains. The old rolling stock seats are
really difficult for people who have difficulty getting up and down. If
you use a mobility buggy rather than a wheelchair, some companies ask
you to move into a seat. I would be in real trouble if that
happened because I find getting up and down difficult. All companies
now have priority seat arrangements. However, they rely on the public
understanding the little sign behind the seat that says, “Please
give up this seat if available”. More often than not, I have to
ask people to give up their seat. Southern Trains and London Midland
labels are easily accessible. Those on Greater Anglia and First Capital
Connect services are a disgrace. In the rush hour, it can be even
harder. The commuting public do not want to look at you if you need a
seat. I have been reduced to tears on two occasions. Staff were
brilliant at helping, but, again, often on a crowded train they are not
there. The TOCs feel better because they offer priority cards, but they
need to do more than publicise where the seats 
<?notus-xml column=108?>are and they should have advertisements to encourage people to give up
their seats if they are needed. The @nogobritain campaign, run by
Channel 4, has been brilliant at exposing these
problems.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000240" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0001.htm#13101071000240">The
report card on access is very mixed. Where is the accountability? Can

producing good franchises. When considering who you should give a
franchise to, it is necessary to look at the management and the targets
that they are prepared to set themselves. Let them be judged by those
targets. Interview the management. We all know that if you are in the
advertising world and you decide to hire an advertising agent, you do
not just see the agency, you see the person who is going to handle the
account, so insist on that. It is a matter of buying a good franchise

am grateful to my noble friend Lord Berkeley for ensuring that in this
debate about rail we have discussed the issue of rail freight as well,
because it is particularly important to the eastern region. After all,
there is the obvious claim that the eastern region is a net contributor
to the Treasury, and Felixstowe bears a considerable responsibility for
that. That is why we should cherish that area of the developing economy
and the successes of recent years, and ensure that it goes from success
to success. My noble friend is also right to identify how important the

reinforce the point that additional investment in our rail service is
necessary. Difficulties on many lines have been identified today, along
with the inadequacy of the service that is provided at present. Anyone
who travels in East Anglia will be all too aware of those difficulties.
In a moment I shall comment on an area that has not thus far been
commented on, but I have every sympathy with the points that have been
made. The expectation is that rail passenger numbers will increase by
more than 40%, which makes one realise the level of necessary
investment that we have to make just to stand still. The trouble is
that at present the trains do stand still on occasion, which is not
much help to any of us. We want an improved passenger service and we
want the trains to run on time.</hs_para>

have to say that one despairs. In the area where I am, which I would
guess in comparison to Suffolk, Norfolk, Broxbourne and the East Anglia
area would be looked upon as Hertfordshire, the line up through Harlow
might be considered to be somewhat blessed. After all, Stansted is a
crucial dimension of the line. Any idea that having an airport as one
dimension of the line improves the service on it has to be thought
about again. It certainly sets a benchmark which the noble Lord, Lord
Marlesford, identified. He said that it is a benchmark for service to
the airport, which makes very great demands upon the service. After
all, it is the only airport in Britain where over 50% of its passengers
arrive by public transport. We need to  
<?notus-xml column=110?>build upon that. While we realise just how significant the rail is, if
you have a line to Stansted that is not a dedicated one—far from
it—but has to give considerable priority to the Stansted
Express, the implications for the other areas along the line are quite
critical. Mention has been made of the significance of places such as
Harlow, which is an important economic development area of the eastern
region. However, Harlow finds its service affected, as do so many
others, by the fact that many trains which are destined for Stansted do
not stop there.</hs_para>

that where there is the possibility of additional capacity, we should
exploit it. The great bottleneck, as ever for East Anglia, is access to
the London terminals for so many of its operations. All the London
terminals were created in the 19th century and the bottleneck problem
is reflected in them all. Yet it is the case that, coming out of
Liverpool Street into the area over which the Stansted line operates,
there is extra capacity in the form of land that is spare and owned by
the railway. Surely we could follow the pressure of local authorities
and communities to bring an extra line or two into that area that would
lead into Liverpool Street and thus free up Stansted. It would
certainly give priority on a line which serves not just Stansted but,
of course, King’s Lynn. I was on a train heading for
King’s Lynn the other evening—mercifully, I was only
going as far as Bishop’s Stortford—when I heard the
classic apology that you get on really good trains: “We
apologise for the fact that this train is running late. There is a slow
train in front of us”. Wow—what a delight it was for us
all to have a slow stopping train in front of a supposedly important
express that was going quite a good distance. Liverpool Street to
King’s Lynn is one of the longer journeys that one can make in
East Anglia.</hs_para>

Minister recognises that real issues have been raised in this debate. I
say to the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford, that if it is a question of
good management, then how about looking at this test? The directly
operated railway on the east coast main line—the one which is in
fact being run by the department after that franchise
collapsed—has returned a very significant profit. Yet there was
no consideration by the Government that that should be used for the
two-year period which emerged once the franchise collapsed as far as
National Express is concerned. I wonder why? If the Government took the
management issue and the targets referred to by the noble Lord, Lord
Marlesford, to heart, it might be that they could learn a lesson from
them. They could then do a better job on franchises in the future than
has been done in the recent
past.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/03B8A6D70F1EF94AA7060D4C841BB4ABBC44FDDD" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 October 2013">Thursday,

of these issues. I wish to commend the work that went into <I>Once in a

way in which so many different stakeholders came together to support a
united vision around that document. It is now being updated, and I hope
that it can be an important mechanism for raising some of the capacity
issues that we talked about today. It will be the basis for continuing
engagement between the department and stakeholders in East Anglia. The
noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, brought up issues around the quality of
service and, more specifically, around rolling stock; I am not sure to
what degree it will look at rolling stock in quite that technical
sense, but quality of service should be very much embedded in that
discussion. As others have said, the Secretary of State has been to
Ipswich and been very engaged in this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000258" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000258">I
understand the concerns that investment in rail in East Anglia has been
delayed because of the pause in the rail franchising programme last
year. The important result is that the Government have a full timetable
covering all rail franchises for the next eight years, and it will let
us get that programme back on track. To allow the programme to be
robustly delivered, and following the recommendations of the Brown
review, the timetable contains a number of direct awards that let us
stagger the start of the new franchise competitions. The Greater Anglia
franchise will receive one of those direct awards. It will be important
as we look in the short term and the long term and have those
discussions with the rail network to determine whether an economic case
can be made for infrastructure improvements to expand capacity. The
Greater Anglia direct award goes from the current contract in July 2014
to the start of the next competed franchise in October 2016. We do not
yet have the term for the long-term franchise; that is still under
discussion. We are concerned that the direct awards do not become a
rationale for delay in the long-term franchise. That will be an
underpinning issue; it is not expected that the direct award would be
required to extend beyond October
2016.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000259">Any
improvements will be assessed for affordability and the level of
value-for-money that they provide. They must also lay a suitable
groundwork that will support the terms of the competition for the next 
<?notus-xml column=112?>franchise. It is key that the franchise competition remains free from
preset obligations so that it can achieve the best possible long-term
deal for both the passenger and the taxpayer. But I take on board the
comments made about rolling stock; the Government are not necessarily
the party to make rolling stock decisions, and I will feed that back
into the franchise discussions, although I am not the Minister directly
responsible for those. But the need for short-term improvements in
rolling stock has been expressed very clearly in this conversation. I
want to confirm that we are actively working with the operator,
Abellio, to see what improvements can be made to the rolling stock
during the short-term direct award period. I do not think that anyone
can make any promises; it is certainly unlikely that initiatives will
provide the level of improvement that everybody would like to see. But
we may be able to get some meaningful and positive changes that
generally improve the passenger environment as a whole. I know well
that there clearly are issues in the prospectus that was put forward
such as power points on the trains, which have been underscored as
being very critical to the passenger experience, and we have tried to
take those kinds of issues on
board.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000260" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000260">I will
move on to the issue of freight, which has been raised by many people,
primarily by the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, who is one of the great
experts on this in the House. The growth of Felixstowe and Thamesport
places renewed pressure on rail freight services, so that is a good
reflection of growth in the economy. I know that he is appreciative of
the changes that mean that freight can now move from Felixstowe through
to Peterborough rather than coming down and going through London. As a
Londoner who lives fairly close to the North London line I can see the
benefits of that. I also say to the noble Lord, Lord Davies, that
preventing freight coming down into London increases passenger capacity
in many ways, so it is one of the mechanisms that provides something of
an answer. Electrification clearly has to be considered for this part
of the route. It will be part of CP6—it will be considered as
part of that—but obviously, as we are only beginning that
process and the consultation I cannot comment on what the conclusions
will be. However, I want to assure noble Lords that that is being
recognised and is definitely one of the issues that we will look at
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000261" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000261">I
have to admit that my knowledge on the issue of Sizewell C is very
limited, particularly compared to the knowledge of the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, so I will write to him on that issue. I am struck by the
canny approach that he suggested, which sounded like a win-win, both
for the community, for the rail services, and in the end for Sizewell
C, so we will take a look at that. I will have to write back to those
noble Lords who raised the issue of an east-west rail link and also on
community rail partnerships, which are areas that I am less familiar
with.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000262" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000262">The
issue of disability is such a serious one, and I want to spend
significant amounts of time looking at disability issues. Again, I am
very conscious, from my background in London, that attitude is
extremely important in the culture of the organisation. It affects the
kind of services that people have. As we go forward  
<?notus-xml column=113?>into the franchising process it is critical that the issue of disability
is at the forefront of people’s minds. By planning around the
needs of people who have disabilities and recognising how important
their mobility is, we deliver a better system rather than constantly
retrofitting, which has been one of the pains and suffering of much of
the rail system here in the UK. The noble Baroness will be aware that
rolling stock must be compliant with persons with reduced
mobility—that is a regulation that comes into effect by
2020—so that will definitely help drive the improvements on the
trains. The department is committed to trying to deliver accessibility
both on trains and in stations. She might be interested to know that
the department is working with Network Rail on the delivery of specific
schemes under the Access for All programme. It will not answer all
problems but it could try perhaps to deal with issues such as ramps,
which she pointed out are absolutely key in this
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000263" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000263">Noble
Lords have made various comments about the station at Chelmsford. That
is an area on which I will choose to write to a number of noble Lords
as I have to confess a lack of familiarity with it. I was going to say
to the noble Baroness, Lady Brinton, who talked about disability, that
perhaps she might be willing to meet with me to talk more extensively
about this issue, and perhaps we might even take a trip or two together
so that I could see the situation first-hand with someone who goes
through some of these awful experiences and find out what could be
done, particularly in this
arena.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000264" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000264">The
Brown review into franchising recognised the benefits of setting clear
franchise specification outputs and giving franchisees flexibility in
how they are achieved. That picks up a lot of the points that the noble
Lord, Lord Bradshaw, made, so I want to give him that reassurance. We
must take into account the views of stakeholders—I am glad that
the stakeholders have been so articulate—although I would
perhaps have wished to have been more knowledgeable about the system
before I had to face them in debate. That has been very good and
salutary for me. When we consult on the new franchises in late 2014 I

and we will make sure that they are listened to. We want to ensure that
the passenger is at the heart of rail services in the east of England;
that has to be right in terms of the community, economic growth and the
success of our increasingly improving and very important rail system. I

Roberts of Llandudno (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I appreciate the
opportunity to bring up the question of residency and access to the
United Kingdom, and to ask the Government to look again at the
requirements of those seeking UK citizenship: residency conditions;
evidence of their good character; English language ability; and a
matter that I have raised in the past, the Life in the UK test. A
friend from Texas took this test several months ago. These were the
questions she was asked: first, whether Elizabeth I handled her
Parliament badly or had good relations with the legislature; secondly,
whether UK citizens were renowned for backing individual liberty,
intolerance, inequality or extremism; and thirdly, was it true or false
that in 2002 Sir Winston Churchill was voted the “greatest
Briton of all
time”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000266" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000266">I
should like to take the Minister up on an offer he made during
Questions in February to meet interested groups in order to devise a
more relevant and practical set of questions. As he will know, Dr. Thom
Brooks of Durham University makes a number of recommendations for
change. First, the handbook should make it clear which sections are to
be tested. It contains about 3,000 facts—far too many for anyone
to memorise—and the whole matter could easily become a pub quiz.
There are inconsistencies and omissions that need to be rectified. The
Government should decide what the rationale is for the test. Is it to
be a stumbling block or a ladder in the immigration process? It appears
totally unfair that it is used as part of the Government’s plan
to reduce immigration. That is not what the test is there
for.</hs_para>

of the current questions could be omitted. It does not help us at all
to know when wives were granted the right to divorce their husbands.
Let us make the test far more local: on the basic history of the
community where the applicant lives, on where local schools, pharmacies
and hospitals are, and so on. It would be interesting if we set up a
parliamentary citizenship quiz—perhaps the Commons versus the
Lords—on the <I>Life in the UK</I> handbook. If it succeeded
here, we could then roll it out across the UK to see how many
long-serving, ordinary UK citizens could answer the questions asked.
Perhaps the Minister could set up a ministerial team to tackle these
questions. The answers to irrelevant questions should play no part when
one is making decisions about a person’s suitability for
citizenship. I ask again: where is the necessary information about the
NHS, how to report crime, or which subjects are taught to our children?
We have to have someone looking at this new set of questions, and
perhaps Dr Thom Brooks could do just that.</hs_para>

2008 the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, said of the test that
it created a deep impression of unfairness among those who had to sit
it. I agree with him but I would go further. I suggest that an accurate
impression of the UK’s current immigration system is one that is
deeply unfair and riddled with inequalities. I know many folk
representing immigrant societies, trying to help them in their present
situation, and the general impression is that the whole situation is
shambolic.</hs_para>

that done by restricting our immigration further? I have a Bill before
the House to

26 of the 193 countries in the United Nations have an average personal
income of more than £18,600, which is the sum called for before
people can take up their place in our community. You see families with
far less than this. In Nigeria the average income is £1,022 and
in India it is £935. We are setting impossible targets. How on
earth can people raise this sort of money? How can they send their
children to somewhere where they can fulfil their dreams? We rely so
much on people from India, Nigeria and other countries in order to run
our National Health Service. I looked at the list of consultants in the
three north Wales general hospitals and a third of them come from
outside the UK and outside Europe. If we had these sorts of limits when
they were struggling in their own countries, our health service would
have gone a long time ago. There could be a very real crisis and if we

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I feel that I am a
strange person to be speaking in this debate because I am not a British
citizen. I have thought about it a few times, but in the days when I
thought about it the Australians would have revoked my Australian
citizenship. Because I was here before the immigration laws, I had the
right of abode. However, I can tell you that that right has become a
bit of a nightmare, because you have to renew it every time you renew
your passport. You are required to send in an unbelievable number of
documents, all in their original form, including my husband’s
parents’ birth certificates, his birth certificate, our marriage
certificate—there is a whole list—and they must all be in
their original form. Some of them are now so old that if I live long
enough to get another passport, I am not sure that they will be in any
state to be sent to the
office.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000281" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000281">I have
spoken to the department about this. The man dealing with it is in
Liverpool. He said, “I can’t imagine why we have to have
originals every time”. Clearly they do not want someone forging
all the documents, but Germaine Greer told me that when they told her
that they required 10 documents a year and that she had been here for
many years and therefore needed 40 documents, she told them that she
could not produce 40 originals, and in the end gave up and became
British. I thought that it was interesting that that seemed to be the
easiest way out; but surely it would be easier to say, “Once we
have a document, we will keep an official record of it”. I can
see that you have to be sure that someone is not forging documents, but
these things should be simple and they are not.</hs_para>

interesting thing. I have helped some people here get British
nationality. One woman from Colombia had been illegally here for 27
years. In the end, we were very fortunate. Originally she came legally
as an au pair. You did not have to have a visa but came as a guest of
the people who invited you to come and be part of their family. I know
that well because at one time I ran an au pair agency. I was at home
with my own children and could not get anyone to help, so I set up the
agency and discovered that all you had to do was invite someone. This
woman was fortunate because in her then illegal years she had looked
after the parents of one of the very well known Lords here. She told me
about this man—“Sir” someone—but it never
occurred to me that he was a famous Law Lord until she brought a photo.
Then we were able to get going, he supported her, and she got her right
to be here. She legally stayed here for five years 20 years ago.
However, the five years have to run since you received your permit to
be here. Now she has two more years to go, and I want to live so long
to help her.</hs_para>

resents terribly, and so do a lot of other people, all the people who
come in, supposedly as asylum seekers. They go to the same English
classes and are not interested in learning anything at all. All they
want is to be here. A lot of people who want to become British citizens
feel cheated because they feel there are quick ways in which people are
getting in without any of the bookwork that was referred
to—learning.</hs_para>

apart from anything else, costs more than my Australian passport. The
other situation I found through the woman I helped is that of moving
the goalposts. I have raised this at meetings that Mrs May has
attended. You arrive here at a time when there is four years or six
years to wait or whatever it is. By the time you present yourself, it
has moved up two more years. By the time you have waited another two
years before you can apply, it has moved up another two years. So in
cases that I came across, applicants from Latin America had found that
the goalposts had moved three or four
times<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. That does

few other matters should be mentioned because time is very short, such
as retention of passports. I know that there is a big backlog but
people who are here on specialist visas are highly talented people who
we want. Their passports are taken to some department and hung on to up
to for a year before they are returned. No matter how big the backlog,
something has to be done about that. If they need to go abroad during
that time, they have to apply to get their passports back. They can get
them back, but then they go back to the bottom of the queue and start
another year. It should be possible to have the equivalent of what they
used to give out in cinemas, a thing that let you reserve your place,
and you could leave and go back in. I think there are so many
departments all involved in citizenship—the Border Force, the
Passport Office, the Post Office for your passports—and so many
tests, many of which are quite unrealistic. It is time that people
looked at the actual wording of these forms and simplified them so that
people could understand the procedure and the ball game did not change
by moving the
goalposts.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/84C7C0913DC06F347B3CB2A2A0F21B9B97D37A5F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 October 2013">Thursday,

am always impressed how, within a broad sweep of history in Britain,
each wave of immigration has added to the vitality of our life. There
are difficulties, but it takes time. If we are determined to narrow
ourselves down into a small group of people and to limit ethnic
variety, geographical and other backgrounds, we will be shooting
ourselves in the foot because previous generations have made a
tremendous contribution. One looks at the public services. We
encouraged people to come and be part of us. My God, there are large
parts of the public services that would never have survived if those
people had not been here and provided their service and in many ways
become cheerful, positive members of our community.
Yes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:19:48"></hs_TimeCode>, there are
difficulties, and it is no good looking at these things just in terms
of five or 10 years—we need to look at them for longer than
that—but, looking at the broad sweep of history, I am certain
that the outcome will again be positive.</hs_para>

should look not only at the public services but at higher education, in
which I am involved as a university member of court and an emeritus
governor of the LSE. Some members of our ethnic minorities, as we like
to call them, are doing incredibly well in higher education and are
adding to the quality and prowess of our society. What is all this
about? Is it about putting obstacles in the way of citizenship or is it
about encouraging people to become citizens without bearing a grudge or
feeling exasperated, having been through a sensible, rational process
of learning how you become a citizen? We used not to have all these
arrangements. I think that it is clear to anyone outside that they are
not about learning about citizenship but about limiting the number of
people who obtain citizenship. We need to separate out these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:21:03"></hs_TimeCode>. I do not
believe that it is possible to have an open-door immigration policy
leading to citizenship; that is just not rational or possible. Ideally,
it would be lovely but it is just not possible. However, what we should
not do is aggravate and alienate people as that leads to dissension and

am very worried about the financial barrier, as is the noble Lord. If
it is a mix, it is a mix. What may seem hardly petty cash to many
Members of this House is a very heavy cost indeed to many ordinary

What are we doing with that? As regards the test, what I worry about is
how we will assist integration, harmonisation and the future well-being
of our mixed society if we indulge in hypocrisy. I ask 
<?notus-xml column=119?>noble Lords to please go to an average football match, cricket match,

“You claim to be a British citizen. How many wives did Henry
VIII have?”. How many unquestioned members of our society would
be able to say how many wives Henry VIII had just like that? However,
we expect newcomers to our society to answer questions that we know a

noble Lord, Lord Roberts, put my next point extremely well. It seems to
me that if we are to have a citizenship test—in many ways I wish
that we did not have to have one—it should ask questions about
the character of our society. It should ask imaginative questions which
test people’s understanding of our society and the stresses and
strains within it rather than simply asking technical questions. My
wife has spent her professional life teaching history at an advanced
level. When she heard the question about how many wives Henry VIII had,
she hit the roof. She said, “What does that tell us about the
story of British life and British citizenship?”. It is not an
essential dimension. From that standpoint, I ask that we please do not
base our policy on
hypocrisy.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-10?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_10_PT_1/AE3E5DD8BAB4B642545CF2EBEBF3BFA3978109C7" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 10 October 2013">Thursday,

proud record of supporting the rights of people who are entitled to
British citizenship. I am grateful to him for this opportunity to talk
about citizenship. He has seen the Long Title of the forthcoming
Immigration Bill, but he cannot tell me whether it contains anything
about citizenship. I understand that it does not, and that after
several years in which there have been no Bills to revise citizenship,
we are again not to be given an opportunity in this

are some residual problems left over from measures agreed by Parliament
in 2002 onwards to equalise the transmission of citizenship between
fathers and mothers, with which we have dealt before. Citizenship is
automatic for children of a British father, but it requires
registration while the child is a minor when it is the mother who is
British. If the mother forgets or dies, the right is forfeited. This
could be rectified by providing that, where the mother has not
registered the child during the child’s minority, she has the
right to register herself on attaining her
majority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:25:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

example was given by Wesley Gryk solicitors. It concerns a client, Mr

23(1) of the British Nationality Act 1981 and a British

overseas, mainly in Mauritius, are not. In some cases, a member of the
family who is British may come here, but can only bring in members of
his family if he can demonstrate that the dependents will have no
recourse to public funds immediately on arrival. This results in split

unable to transmit his or her citizenship to the next generation or
bring the children to the UK without surmounting major obstacles. In
addition, there are the children of people living in a foreign country
who acquire British citizenship after the birth of their children,
where the state of residence prohibits the acquisition of its

mention the British overseas citizens who renounced their Malaysian
citizenship when advised falsely by solicitors that they could then
claim full British citizenship. After they found this was wrong, they
languished here stateless, destitute and without the right to work for
many years. After much correspondence and many meetings with the
Minister for Immigration, he said that he had negotiated an agreement
with the Malaysians for these people to return there and reclaim their
former Malaysian
status<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:29:37"></hs_TimeCode>. When
pressed for details, the Minister wrote yesterday saying that the
persons concerned will be allowed a five-year residence pass to return
to Malaysia, and that at the end of that period they could apply for
permanent residence. However, he did not say how much longer they would
have to continue stateless or explain what conditions they would have
to satisfy before they could regain their original citizenship. The
Minister says that he will publicise the arrangements only after at
least a couple of successful returnees have demonstrated that the
process is running smoothly, but even if that happens, I imagine that
most of the people concerned would sooner have another five years of
statelessness here in this country than return to Malaysia and face a
10-year period of statelessness there.</hs_para>

Noon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am very grateful to be speaking
today and I thank the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, for securing this
important Question for Short Debate. I am myself a immigrant to the
United Kingdom, having come here in the late 1960s to set up a
business. I started with very little except for my drive and ambition,
and a determination to succeed. I worked hard and grew a successful
international business that now has a wide range of foods in most of
our major supermarkets. This success was possible because of the
opportunities that the UK provided, and I remain proud and grateful to
be a UK citizen, able to take advantage of the opportunities that this
great land gives everyone. It is a wonderful aspect of life in the UK
that, if you come here and work and integrate into society, you will
have the opportunity to become a British citizen. So it saddens me and
makes me angry to see some people trying to abuse these opportunities.
We must cherish and protect our citizenship from those who come here
but do not intend to work hard and contribute, or worse, those who come
here to do harm. We must also ensure that our borders are monitored
properly and that we know exactly who is coming in and going out of the
country.</hs_para>

requirements that you must comply with before you can apply to become a
British citizen. In the short time available, I want to talk about one
of these requirements: that people must be of good character. Let me
quote from the UK Border Agency website on what it means to be of good
character:</hs_para>
<hs_quote UID="13101071000343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000343">“We consider
you to be of good character if you show respect for the rights and
freedom of the United Kingdom, have observed its laws and fulfilled
your duties and obligations as a resident”.</hs_quote>

character, as the UK Border Agency states, means fulfilling your duties
and obligations as a resident. Those duties and obligations include
working hard, paying taxes and giving something back to society. I have
spoken before in this House on the need to ensure that we protect the
values and freedoms of the UK. Immigration controls are an essential
part of how we do that. We need to ensure that the requirements for
gaining entry and citizenship to the UK are strong and robust enough to
work as they are intended
to.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101071000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000300">For
example, a number of noble Lords have spoken before about the
ineffectiveness of the citizenship test. I agree; how can knowing at
what age you can be asked to serve on a jury or where Father Christmas
comes from possibly show whether you are of good character or even
understand the values and culture of this country? These questions tell
us nothing about the character of the person. We should be asking
people to demonstrate their commitment to the UK’s values and we
should be expecting people to have at least a reasonable command of the
English language and the prospect of a job waiting for them. Can the
Minister tell us if there are any plans to review the citizenship test
once again in order to make it more applicable? At the moment, the test
is made up of questions about a range of obscure facts that do not have
much to do with the day to day experience of living in the UK.
Citizenship is something that is attained by birth or earned over time.
It is then retained by being a contributing 
<?notus-xml column=122?>member of your community. Allowing and embracing immigration ensures the
future of our dynamic and interesting country.</hs_para>

more helpful if the citizenship test focused on people having a
knowledge of our laws, customs, history and culture, and also accepting
our way of life. It should be focused on the practical things that
immigrants should know to help them navigate living in Britain.
Someone’s level of historical knowledge should not be a
determinant as to whether they are a good or a bad citizen. What
matters is the character of the individual, not only their general
knowledge of the British
Isles.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000302">It is
my belief that we must enforce these requirements much more strongly.
There are too many people coming to the UK who expect the benefit but
not the hard work that goes with it. They take advantage of our system
but forget their obligations. If people cannot prove their good
character through their family, friends and behaviour, they have no
right to be here. Why not ask people to state their beliefs and how
these concur with the values of the UK, or even to explain what they
will contribute to the United Kingdom? The vast majority of immigrants
to this country come here to make a better life for themselves and
their families, and they bring a lot of knowledge and experience which
help this great country to grow and prosper. We should welcome
hardworking immigrants who wish to become British citizens, and we
should make the Life in the UK test focus on real questions of how to
navigate living in the UK rather than asking questions that most
indigenous Britons may have difficulty in answering. I thank noble
Lords for listening to me and I look forward to hearing more on this

Watson of Richmond (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, international students
account for almost half of current immigration into the United Kingdom.
I wish to focus on the impact of UK immigration policies on the student
population, postgraduate and staff. I declare two interests. From
2007-11, I was president of the British Accreditation Council which,
during those years, acted along with the British Council as the
principal accreditation agency for Tier 4 entry into the United
Kingdom, assessing colleges and offering education to foreign students
against very stringent criteria. In 2011, this role was taken over by
two other agencies—the QAA and ISI. This was a costly
reorganisation and it has effected little change, with both those
agencies reaccrediting 99% of the colleges which we had accredited
originally. This is relevant because if the Government are to effect
their aspirational cap of no more than 100,000 immigrants a year into
the United Kingdom, there is a real risk of a significant further
reduction in the number of foreign students. The other interest that I
declare is that I am high steward, or deputy chancellor, of Cambridge
University which both attracts substantial numbers of foreign students,
especially postgraduates, and needs to attract researchers and teaching
staff from
overseas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000304" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000304">As
we all know, in 2011 the Home Secretary broke up UK Border Agency as
unfit for purpose. It has been replaced by Border Force. This successor
agency 
<?notus-xml column=123?>is now headed up by Sir Charles Montgomery who is currently appearing
before a number of parliamentary Select Committees. He is already
grappling with the demands of his agency, demands of such complexity
and tenacity, including the establishment of e-borders, that I am not
surprised that his predecessors heading up the Border Force did not
stay for very long. Sir Charles Montgomery is, however,
crystal clear on the strategic aims of Border Force. As he said before
the committee, they are to provide security and to promote British
prosperity. There is, to put it mildly, a creative tension between
these two objectives. Security is, of course, the priority and must be
provided, although how best to do this, given the complex multifaceted
terrain of insecurity, will continue to vex not only Border Force but
all our security agencies. But Sir Charles’ second strategic
objective of promoting British prosperity is also vital, and this is my
focus.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000305">While
the case for the value of immigration to our economy is well made,
including by the CBI, the value of immigration to Britain’s
economy by the international student education sector is much less well
known. This sector contributed £17.5 billion last year and BIS
quite rightly wants to increase this by 20% in coming years. It is not
only the revenue raised but the significant value added, in skills,
research and teaching, as testified to by the universities. Cambridge
University, for example, is somewhat frustrated by the residential
qualification for a visa application, which applies to T4 entrants with
their dependants. We are losing very important people to universities
abroad because the dependants cannot come here if the course is under
12 months
long.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000306">Therefore,
we encounter a truly dangerous dilemma: if the Government are to
achieve their overall cap of 100,000 they will have little option but
to further curtail international student immigration into the UK. I
urge great caution on the Government in this matter. We need
international students—economically, intellectually,
academically. Striking the right balance is not only a challenge for
the Home Secretary and for Border Force, it is also a challenge for our
society because we will harm ourselves if we succumb to the rhetoric of
an island fortress submerged by waves of immigration—rhetoric so
beloved by some of our newspapers and
politicians.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101071000385" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000385">5.41

congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, on his persistence with this
issue, and welcome his efforts to secure today’s debate. The
excellent speeches we have heard do great credit to your
Lordships’ House. The noble Lord, Lord Taylor, and I have had a
number of debates over the years we have been in our respective
positions on the issue of immigration and citizenship, and that
reflects the public and political interest in this issue. It also
highlights the great responsibility of government.</hs_para>

today’s debate is interesting as it is against the backdrop of
this week’s news that the Government’s “ad
van” campaign on immigration was banned, not because it was an
ill-judged political 
<?notus-xml column=124?>stunt, but because the facts it deployed were wrong. Then there is the
highly critical report by the independent Chief Inspector of Borders
and Immigration on the chaotic failings of the e-borders programme. The
Government have refused to allow the Home Affairs Select Committee to
see that report in full. Then today we have the publication of the
Immigration Bill. After the comments by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, I
look forward to seeing what amendments he puts forward to that
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000309">Those
events set today’s debate in the context of the wider interest
and show how difficult and complex these issues can be. Clearly, it is
a key government responsibility to ensure that immigration is good and
beneficial to the UK and its citizens. I think that the noble Lord,
Lord Noon, used the phrase “of good character”. In the
case of asylum, the Government are under a moral imperative; the
Minister has made that clear on a number of occasions, and I thank him
for it. However, the Government have a right—I think that the
noble Lord, Lord Noon, referred to this as well—not to grant
citizenship, or leave to remain, to those they consider will not
contribute appropriately or will pose security problems.</hs_para>

context and to make just two points. One is about responsibility and
policy. We should recognise that when we talk about immigrants we are
not talking about a cohesive, identifiable group but a whole range of
people of different nationalities who for one reason or another are
seeking permission to live, and possibly work, in the UK. They include
students—as the noble Lord, Lord Watson
mentioned—together with people involved in businesses, and
workers and families. There is the separate issue, which concerns us
all, of those who enter the country illegally and have no right to live
here.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000311">It is
therefore right that we have a genuine debate about the kinds of
immigration that we need and can sustain. Policies on this issue must
be evidence-based and define the boundaries and the benefits or the
disadvantages to the UK. Like the noble Lord, Lord Watson, I struggle
with the Government’s test of success as being a fall in the
level of net migration. It is a crude measure which, bizarrely—I
am sure this was not the Government’s intention—means
that if more UK citizens leave the UK than immigrants enter the UK, the
Government will have succeeded. The noble Lord, Lord Watson,
highlighted an alternative way the Government could achieve their aims
which I think would be equally damaging to the UK. That is not success,
and the Government’s current policies can lead to all kinds of
problems and concerns. The Minister has heard this many times during
questions and debates in your Lordships’ House in relation to
universities and businesses. For example, the Government’s
approach does not even start to address the different kinds of
immigration, and the different impacts they have for the immigrants and

other crude measure that gives me cause for concern—I have
raised this with the noble Lord before, and other noble Lords have
raised it—is the income threshold for British citizens who want
to sponsor their spouse or family to live with them. I say at the
outset that I fully agree that if an individual wishes to 
<?notus-xml column=125?>bring their family to settle in the UK, they should never assume that
they will have state support. That is why there is already an absolute
requirement for them to show that they have sufficient funds to support
their family. There could have been greater clarity around that because
it requires discretion and investigation on the part of entry clearance
officers. We do not propose greater clarity there, but a blanket
threshold that does not take into account any other relevant factors
will not have the effect that the Government
intended.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000313">I
recall a conversation with a gentleman who lived with his parents in
the New Forest. He did not earn £18,600. In order to earn that
in his profession, he would have had to move to London. In that case,
his housing costs would have increased to such an extent that his
disposable income would have been significantly less—but he
would have fulfilled the Government’s requirements for allowing
his wife to enter the country, even though it would have been much more
difficult for him to support his
family.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000314">On the
issue of asylum, the noble Lord himself said that there was no question
of the UK not being a safe haven for those who genuinely face
persecution in their native country. The example of young Malala from
Afghanistan, whom many of us will have seen on “Panorama”
this week and who is currently living in the UK with her family, should
be a source of great pride. We should take pride in the fact that a
woman of this amazing capacity—a quite exceptional young
woman—is living, being treated and learning in the UK. Some 70%

close to my time, but perhaps I may direct noble Lords to the report
from Dr Thom Brooks of Durham University, which makes it quite clear
that the citizenship test is not fit for purpose. The Prime Minister
failed it on national television. I am sure that I would fail it, and I

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Home Office (Lord Taylor of
Holbeach) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lord
Roberts of Llandudno for securing this debate, which has been
wide-ranging. Indeed, to some extent we have ranged beyond the strict
subject of the debate. I hope that noble Lords will forgive me if I
focus to some degree on the essence of the debate, which is nationality
and citizenship. I assure noble Lords—it is important that the
noble Baroness, Lady Smith of Basildon, accepts this—that the
core of the Government’s policy is that the UK should continue
to welcome individuals coming to work, study or join their family, and
to provide a place of safety for
refugees.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000319" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000319">Reducing
net migration is not about encouraging more Brits to leave than
foreigners to come; it is about achieving a sustainable level of
migration. All political parties are working towards a consensus on
this issue. The Government are succeeding because the levels of non-EU
migration are at their lowest for 14
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000320" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000320">My
noble friend Lord Roberts of Llandudno pointed out that today we have
published a number of important reforms to the immigration system
through the new Immigration Bill, which is going to be a subject to
which we will all be returning, I have no doubt. Everyone who has
spoken in this debate, I am sure, will be back to talk through that
Bill. It is a common starter, so we have got a bit of time to limber up
for it. I hope noble Lords will not object if I try to answer
specifically the questions and points raised on the questions of
citizenship and nationality. They are all set out in the British
Nationality Act of 1981, so it is quite a long-standing act. It has not
been particularly changed. The citizenship test has changed. The one
introduced by the previous Government has been brought up to date.
Although there has been some criticism, notably from Dr. Thom Brooks at
Durham, about that test, it has been designed to make it much more real
to the people who are sitting the test, and it has been widely
welcomed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:50:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000321" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000321">The
1981 Act reflects the principle that citizenship should be acquired on
the basis of a close and continuing connection with the United Kingdom.
Although there are some registration routes for those who already have
a link, and we will perhaps discuss areas where they have worked and
where they perhaps do not work so well, the majority of those seeking
to become citizens will do so through naturalisation. We are rightly
proud of our British citizenship. It is a privilege, not a right. We
expect those applying to naturalise as British citizens to have
demonstrated a commitment to the United Kingdom through a period of
lawful residence of five years, coupled with knowledge of the English
language and of our culture, history, and democratic
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:51:55"></hs_TimeCode>.
Those living in Wales, as my noble friend will know, being a Welsh
speaker, will already be able to demonstrate a knowledge of Welsh or of
Scots Gaelic. Additionally, they should be of good character and, in
most cases, intend to make the United Kingdom their permanent home. The
Government consider that these remain the right criteria, although
changes to particular
requirements<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:52:24"></hs_TimeCode> are
planned.</hs_para>

have looked at the way in which applicants for naturalisation
demonstrate the required knowledge of language and life in the UK. If a
person wishes to make the United Kingdom his or her permanent home and
to become a British citizen, it is reasonable to expect that an
individual will show, among other things, that they are committed to
learning English and have an understanding of British history, culture,
and traditions. The ability to speak English and an understanding of
the traditions and democratic principles underpinning UK life are
essential for successful
integration<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:53:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000323" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000323">The
noble Lord, Lord Noon, is nodding. There is no better example than
himself of somebody who has done just that and contributed so much to
British life. This can be demonstrated by taking the Life in the UK
test in English, Welsh, or Scottish Gaelic, or by obtaining an English
for Speakers of Other Languages qualification, which can be at a very
basic level. This means that some individuals have been able to
naturalise without sufficient English to communicate and integrate with
the wider community. The new Life in the UK test, to which there has
been much reference today, places the emphasis on British history,
culture, and democratic government. Despite what some noble Lords have
said, the vast majority of feedback on the new test has been positive.
I cannot agree that the questions asked are irrelevant or that the test
should concentrate on more practical
matters.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000324" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000324">The
test is being taken by individuals who have been in the UK long enough.
They have to be resident here for at least five years to qualify for
this test and they should know about day-to-day practical issues. The
aim of the test is to help new residents appreciate British traditions
and understand how democracy developed in this country. The new test
was informed by a user survey of 664 people who had taken the previous
test. Most respondents were already aware of the practical aspects of
UK life, but wished to have more information about history, government
and the legal system. The test was designed to meet that
request<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:55:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000325" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000325">My
noble friend Lord Roberts said that it should be made clear in the book
which sections should be studied. It is intended that the
whole book should be studied, but it is made clear that readers need
not remember dates, including birth dates, or things of that nature. It
is designed to inform, but the companion publication assists
individuals in becoming familiar with the type of test that they are
likely to face. With any book of this nature, it is possible for some
details to become out of date, but we have deliberately moved away from
the inclusion of statistics or similar information that could become
irrelevant<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:56:05"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
said, the test is generally taken by people who have been in the UK
long enough to know about practical issues. The handbook aims to
provide information on British history, culture and 
<?notus-xml column=128?>democracy in an accessible, interesting way. Questions are no longer
asked about dates: for example, “When did it become possible for
wives to have the right to divorce?”. Instead, the questions are
about principles, such as the principle that men and women have equal
rights.</hs_para>

into force on 28 October. From that date, applicants will be required
both to pass the Life in the UK test and to have a speaking and
listening qualification in English that shows that they can communicate
at an independent level. Nationals of the majority of English-speaking
countries will not be required to show a formal speaking and listening
qualification. However, they will still be required to pass the Life in
the UK test. This revised knowledge of language and life requirement
will apply to all applicants unless they are exempt on the basis of
their age or physical or mental condition. I say to the noble Lord,
Lord Judd, for whom I have the greatest regard, that the whole point of
the test is that it should be fair, reasonable and just, as he asked
for it to
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:57:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000327" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000327">It
may interest your Lordships to hear a few figures about how many people
have taken the test and what the pass rate was. In 2012, 201,087
applications were decided. Of these, 97% were successful. Clear
guidance limits the number of people for whom the test would be
inappropriate. Of the 678 cases that were refused, 103 were refused
because the applicant had insufficient knowledge of English or life in
the UK. The failure rate is very small. The whole point is that
candidates should prepare themselves by reading the publications that
are made available for
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-10T17:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101071000328" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010-gc0002.htm#13101071000328">We

will open with an exchange of views on a proposal to amend
Regulation (EC) No 1013/2006 on shipments of waste. The
Commission is concerned by the uneven standard of enforcement across
Member States against illegal shipments of waste and would like to
strengthen the requirements for enforcement. The Commission has issued
a proposal to amend the Regulation to require competent authorities to
prepare and publish inspection plans. The amendments would introduce
provisions for competent authorities to request proof from an exporter
where it was suspected that they were exporting waste in the guise of a
product in order to evade the controls, and also to request evidence
that material exported for recovery had been recovered in an
environmentally sound manner in the destination country. The amendments
would also allow the Commission to adopt delegated acts on technical
and organisational requirements for the practical implementation of
electronic data interchange for the submission of documents and
information. The UK supports the principle of strengthening the
enforcement of the Regulations, but has concerns about some of the
detail in the proposal.</hs_para>

are a powerful tool for wide-area detection of millimetre-scale ground
movements associated with earthquake mechanisms. Similarly, navigation
satellites can be used to detect movement in stations placed near

all existed to prevent schools putting school buildings on playing
fields. Schools could build over playing fields without seeking consent
and with impunity. This led to the disappearance of thousands of
playing fields—Fields in Trust (formerly The National Playing
Field Association) estimated 2,540 playing fields, or 26 sites a month,
were lost between 1997 and 2005. This Government has introduced
protections on playing fields where there were none before, so that
schools and local authorities now have to seek permission if they want
to change the use of public playing fields by putting school buildings
on them. We now require schools to apply for consent even where the
buildings are being used for education or recreational
purposes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101060000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131010w0001.htm#13101060000038">When
