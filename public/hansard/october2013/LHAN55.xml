confirming the Government’s opposition to oppressive new laws in
Russia. What assessment have the Government made of the impact of the
new laws on the lives of ordinary homosexual people and on the working
of the civil organisations dedicated to promoting their welfare and

countries in the region from enacting similarly oppressive

individuals and communities, in the way in which these communities feel
that they can exercise their right to freedom of expression and
peaceful assembly. The NGOs on LGBT issues with which we 
<?notus-xml column=776?>have been working in Russia and other regions say that this has led to
concerns of an increase in homophobia and homophobic attacks. It has
also meant that the operating environment for NGOs that work in the
LGBT field is much more difficult. We have been raising this matter for
a number of years, since these laws first started to be enacted on a
regional or provincial level, before it became national law. During
2013-14, we have invested £1.3 million specifically into NGOs
working to protect human rights, of which LGBT is one

matters incredibly seriously. The subject was raised by the Prime
Minister at the highest level at the G20 in St Petersburg, and it was
also raised at the margins. It was raised a few weeks later by my right
honourable friend the Foreign Secretary with Foreign Minister Lavrov at
the UN General Assembly in New York. We also have an annual human
rights dialogue; in fact, we are one of the few countries, if not the
only country in the European Union, to have that particular dialogue
with Russia. We had our latest dialogue in May of this year and, in
that, we raised the issue of LGBT issues. So it is a matter that we
continue to press on, and one that we have raised at both a political
and an official

report, <I>Freedom under Threat</I>, which I am sure the noble Baroness
knows well, highlights the provocation and discrimination sustained by
those in Russia who are protesting against the recent legislation which
has just been referred to. Does the Minister believe that the
representations made by Her Majesty’s Government have had any
effect whatever on the Russians, and what do the Government intend to
do next about it? Is the noble Baroness aware—I am sure that she
is—of the very strong feeling not just in this House but in the
country which expects the Government to use every opportunity to point
out to the Russian Government that their behaviour in the field of

rights I can assure the noble Lord that this is an area that I not only
cover as part of my brief in my job but take incredibly seriously. He
will also be aware of my right honourable friend the Prime
Minister’s personal commitment to these issues. This is not a
matter on which we just make submissions in the margins of another
meeting, it is something that we put to the front and centre in our
meetings, which is why the Prime Minister has raised it at the highest
level. I think that noble Lords will accept that it is our job to
communicate and stress the strength of feeling not only in this House
but across the country, as the noble Lord said, as well as to do the

the “Arctic Sunrise”—it has been in the headlines

The Foreign Secretary raised the issue with Foreign Minister Lavrov at
the UN General Assembly and subsequently wrote to him in October. The
Foreign Secretary has also met Greenpeace’s executive director,
and officials are in regular contact. I can assure the House that
extensive consular assistance and support has been provided to these

increase. Clearly we have to work extremely hard to make sure that the
pledges to which countries have committed themselves are delivered. We
are pleased that the figure has reached the £1 billion mark but
it is not sufficient and it is extremely important that humanitarian

Council presidential statement issued about three weeks ago seeking
better humanitarian access and putting particular responsibility upon
the Syrian Government. There are a number of things which the Syrian
Government could do to make sure that visas are granted more readily
and that travel permits are granted so that humanitarian aid can get
in. Efforts are being taken forward to try to bring forward the peace
process and I am sure he will know that UN Special Envoy Brahimi is
leading an intensive period of preparation to try to ensure that there

is obviously encouraging that the chemical weapons inspectors have been

quite striking that humanitarian aid has not necessarily been able to

that we want the Royal College of Surgeons to look at specifically. In
the coalition agreement, we committed to limiting the application of
the working time directive in the UK, including in the NHS.
Nobody wants to go back to the bad old days of tired
doctors, but it is important for the working time 
<?notus-xml column=781?>directive to have more flexibility for a health service that operates on
a 24-hour basis. Increased flexibility for the NHS would allow it to
take account of local needs and practices, while at the same time
ensuring the health and safety of the workforce. We stand
prepared to work with partners in Europe to that end. I

although flexibility has been introduced into their working so that
trainees nearing independent practice can work more flexibly
and for more hours. As 80% of surgical trainees currently work more

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department for Work and
Pensions (Lord Freud) (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, social landlords
had more than a year to design, develop and deliver strategies to
mitigate the effects of under-occupancy and were advised to start
building responsibly to avoid driving people into arrears.
Prior to implementation, the Government, working collaboratively with
the Chartered Institute of Housing, produced specific guidance for
landlords, <I>Making It Fit</I>, and continue to fund its
Making Best Use of Stock team, which assists landlords to find suitably
sized accommodation for tenants. Fact sheets containing advice on home
swaps, money management, payment options and how to look for and find
work have also been issued. To be clear, 60% of those
requiring social housing are single or couples without children, but
over the last decades landlords have ignored this fact, resulting in
larger homes being built, even though the greatest need is
for smaller properties. Finally, £190
million has been provided this year to help vulnerable
claimants.</hs_para>

Hollis of Heigham:</Member></B> My Lords, a recent sample shows that
half of all affected tenants are in arrears and that three-bed houses
are now hard to let. Do we move tenants to smaller accommodation? It
cannot be done because there is none. Do we increase income with
discretionary payments? For the 90% who are ineligible, it
will not be done. Do we allow arrears to soar? As this could send us
into the red, it should not be done. Or do we evict vulnerable families
from their three-bed homes into temporary accommodation, back into an
unwanted, hard-to-let, three-bed house? That cannot be done. If we

conclusions as to the level of arrears. We will, of course, provide
that information when we have the kind of reliable
information that this House requires me, as a Minister, to deliver.
There have been various surveys, but the samples are just too narrow.
There are 1.4 million one-bedroom properties in the social rented
sector and we are looking to have those managed more efficiently. I
remind noble Lords that the scare stories about what would happen to
our LHA reforms were very similar to the kind of stories that are being
propagated now and we have not seen any poor reaction in terms of
homelessness as a result of those

will, of course, be pleased to talk to the noble Lord about the

the Government wish to give the House the opportunity to amend the
order in which we take our Report stage debates today. Last week, I
became aware of some concern that my Amendment 168A, relating to trust
special administration, would have fallen for debate at a rather late
hour this evening. I assure the House that this was not by design and
that the Government are more than happy to facilitate an earlier
debate. Clearly, the issue of trust special administration is an
important one. I understand the wish of some noble Lords to debate it
fully in prime time. Accordingly, the Motion in my name would allow the
debate on Amendment 168A to be taken at the start of today’s
proceedings on the Bill. I should also indicate to the House that in
response to the request put to me last week by the noble Lord, Lord
Hunt of Kings Heath, I would have no objection to relaxing the rules of
debate that normally apply at Report so that this amendment can be
debated in full if that, too, is the desire of the House. I beg to

Lordships will know that the regime for trust special administration
was introduced by the previous Government under the Health Act 2009.
The aim of the regime has always been to provide, with a tight
timescale, a sustainable future for the services provided by a failed
trust. The regime is only ever used as a last resort, when all other
efforts by a trust and its commissioners to develop a viable model of
care have been unsuccessful. There comes a point when time has to be
called on local efforts to resolve the situation. Problems should not
be allowed to fester, and it is not right that taxpayer resources could
be diverted away from patient care to bail out failing
organisations.</hs_para>

failed trust to be put into administration. The role of the trust
special administrator is to take charge of the trust while the board is
legally suspended and to develop and consult on recommendations in a
draft report, before making recommendations in a final report that
secure a sustainable future for services. The unsustainable
provider regime for NHS foundation trusts was amended in 2012 to make
it compatible with the extended regulatory role given to Monitor to
operate the new licensing regime. The regime is used only on an
exceptional basis at the most seriously challenged NHS providers, where
other solutions or interventions have failed. It is time-limited, to
focus efforts on delivering a sustainable solution with statutory
deadlines for each stage of the process.</hs_para>

South London and Mid Staffordshire suggests that two stages of the
administration process need to be extended. The administrator would
benefit from having more time to produce its draft report, and it would
be better to have a longer consultation. The clause would therefore
extend the time that the administrator has to complete these two key
stages by giving 65, rather than 45, working days to produce the draft
report and allowing 40, rather than 30, working days to undertake
consultation on that report. The existing powers to extend the various
stages of an administration beyond these statutory time limits will
remain, as there will always be cases where an extension is
appropriate.</hs_para>

would put beyond doubt the Government’s existing position that
the remit of a trust special administrator is to make recommendations
that may apply to services beyond the confines of the trust in
administration and that the Secretary of State, for NHS trusts, and
Monitor, for foundation trusts, have the power to take decisions based
on those wider recommendations.</hs_para>

prolonged problems exist, the administrator appointed must be able to
propose a viable solution. It was always the Government’s
intention that the interpretation of the words “in relation
to” could include wider actions where necessary and
consequential on primary recommendations about the trust in
administration. This clarification of the scope of the administrator
does not constitute a change of

uncertainty for the

trusts, foundation trusts and other providers do not exist in isolation
from each other. They are part of a complex, interdependent, local
healthcare economy. Issues of clinical and financial sustainability
nearly always cross organisational boundaries. Parliament must surely
have intended originally that the legislation would enable an
administrator to fix the problems that it was appointed to fix. If the
only way to do this is to look beyond the confines of the failing trust
then that is what it must
do.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000069">Thirdly,
the clause would strengthen requirements for a trust special
administrator appointed to an NHS foundation trust to seek the support
of commissioners affected by their recommendations. A trust special
administrator appointed to an NHS foundation trust is already required
by statute to seek support for its draft and final recommendations from
all commissioners of the trust in administration. This clause would
extend that requirement so that the administrator would also be
required to seek the support of commissioners of services affected by
the administrator’s recommendations that are provided by other
trust providers, with NHS England’s support being sought in the
event that all commissioners did not
agree.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1310214000212" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000212">3.30

this clause would require the Secretary of State to produce guidance
for trust special administrators appointed to an NHS trust about
seeking commissioner support for their proposals and to involve NHS
England. It is intended that the guidance would set out arrangements
for a trust special administrator to seek support from NHS England for
its recommendations if the trust special administrator was unable to
secure the support of the commissioners affected by the
recommendations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000071">Fifthly,
this clause would clarify that the statutory obligations of
commissioners to involve and consult patients and the public in
planning and making service changes do not apply in respect of the
trust special administration regime. It would also clarify that the
disapplication provisions apply whether the trust special administrator
process relates to a failing NHS foundation trust or an NHS

have already set out, one of the principal benefits of the
unsustainable provider regime is the speed with which it delivers
recommendations for clinically and financially sustainable services.
This accelerated process includes a specific consultation period, with
no provision for referral for local authority scrutiny. We want to
clarify that there is no potential conflict between the statutory
obligation placed on commissioners and the requirements of the trust
special administration regime.</hs_para>

special administrator should not be compelled to consider only some
solutions, but, rather, the best solutions in the interests of

contention that the amendment is nothing short of a major change in
policy on the reconfiguration of NHS services. Your Lordships are being
asked to agree to it even though the case, or one of the cases, on
which it is based—that of Lewisham hospital—is subject to

this not as a clarification of the law but as a major policy change

services: I support the major reconfiguration of services where
clinical evidence supports it. Indeed, I should like to see much faster
progress. When I and my noble friend Lord Warner argued this during the
passage of the Health and Social Care Bill, the Government ploughed on
with their extensive and fragmentary changes. The Government have
belatedly come to realise that the structure they imposed is actually a
barrier to progress—hence the amendment. It is also clear that,
given the dire financial straits of 
<?notus-xml column=791?>many NHS organisations, the special administration process is likely to
be used on an increasing basis. My concern is that giving so much power
to trust special administrators is the wrong way to go about it.
Indeed, evidence from Lewisham and Staffordshire suggests that it will
often provoke widespread opposition and slow down

the noble Earl has said, the key change that the Government want to
make is to ensure that the Secretary of State can act on
recommendations that affect other NHS trusts, NHS foundation trusts or
other providers and commissioners outwith the trust to which a special

How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:36:43"></hs_TimeCode> this would
happen has been graphically illustrated in the case of Lewisham.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:36:43"></hs_TimeCode> South London
Healthcare NHS Trust was a badly performing trust with an accumulated
deficit of £196 million. Consequently, a trust special
administrator was appointed. In his draft report of 24
October 2012, he recommended that University Hospital Lewisham should
no longer provide emergency care for critically ill patients who did
not need to be admitted to hospital and that it should lose its
obstetrics-led maternity unit.</hs_para>

not at the expense of well run trusts. Of course there need to be
changes in the local health economy beyond just the trust that is
failing; a trust does not fail in isolation but is part of a complex,
interconnected system—change one bit and you impact on the other
bits. However, the legislation was intended to deal with a simple case
in which a trust had failed and was then broken up, with its assets
being transferred or sold off. My contention is that this type of
approach 
<?notus-xml column=792?>is not suited to major reconfiguration processes and should not be a
back-door way to achieve unpopular

the government amendment seems to introduce a major anomaly around
commissioning. A clinical commissioning group that commissions services
from a failing NHS foundation trust is entitled to define and protect
essential NHS services, but a clinical commissioning group that
commissions services from a successful NHS trust can now see local
services removed, even if that clinical commissioning group considers
those services to be essential.</hs_para>

proposed by the amendment appears to be legally ineffective. Neither a
clinical commissioning group nor a foundation trust is subject to the
direction-making powers of the Secretary of State—both are
independent corporate bodies with boards which are responsible for
making their own decisions. It is unclear to me how the boards of the
clinical commissioning group and a foundation trust are supposed to be
legally required to carry through any decision which is made within a
special administration process relating to another body.</hs_para>

happens if the commissioners do not wish to commission services against
the model that the special administrator has proposed. That is the case
in Mid Staffordshire, where the special administrator’s
proposals have not found favour with either the public or the clinical
commissioning group. There appears to be no limit to how far
recommendations might stretch to be “necessary” and
“consequent”. It is clear that one trust could have many
commissioners, and changes in services could impact upon many other
trusts. The special administrator is being given a free hand to cast
his net as widely as he wishes.</hs_para>

serious defects in the special administration process which
the noble Earl’s amendment does little to resolve; indeed, it
brings further anomalies and inconsistencies. However, my key concern
about the amendment is that it removes the requirement to go through a
properly defined and structured reconfiguration process, with extensive
consultation with the local community. From all that we have learnt
about successful reconfigurations, we know that they need to take a
special form of open and honest leadership, a patient process of
engagement and consultation, and proper consideration of the wider
impact. The Government really should think again about this and my
amendment gives them the opportunity to do
so.</hs_para>

over as we go into some of the processes involved here. At the heart of
this there is a fundamental problem which is much deeper and more
serious than when the 2006 Act was passed. That was seven years ago.
This procedure of trust special administrators was set up to deal with
a relatively small number of cases that might come along. It was not a

David Nicholson, the outgoing chief executive of NHS England, it will
be £30 billion. A number of noble Lords may be shaking their
heads because they do not wish to believe him, but he says £30
billion. If you want to believe the Nuffield Trust, it will be
somewhere north of £40 billion. If you want to consider the more
measured estimate last week from the chief executive of Monitor, it
will be £12 billion, but that assumes a level of efficiency
savings which seem somewhat like fantasy football in terms of their

Government have a real problem that they are trying to tackle. However,
I suggest that this particular way of tackling it is not the best way,
because it is trying to adapt a system which was produced for a
relatively small number of cases into a whole system set of
arrangements. It has some curious quirks. It seems to treat clinical
commissioning groups which are commissioning from foundation trusts
differently from those commissioning from non-foundation trusts. I am
not going to risk eyes glazing over by talking about this, but this set

engage the public in the scale of changes that will have to be made to
the NHS in order to make it sustainable. It is not just that black hole

Kennedy of Southwark (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, although I sit in
this House as Lord Kennedy of Southwark, I actually live in Lewisham,
very close to the hospital. I agree with the comments made by my noble
friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. This is a major change of policy being
sneaked through the door by the Government. I am amazed that the
Minister has brought his amendment today when we are just a few days
away from the case being heard in the Court of Appeal—it will be
heard next week, I believe.</hs_para>

hospital and I refer noble Lords to my declaration of interest that on
a voluntary basis I chair a small committee in the hospital. Whatever
the problems of the South London Healthcare NHS Trust, I cannot
adequately describe to noble Lords the sense of injustice, unfairness
and hurt about what is being imposed by the administrator. We have a
good local hospital, which is supported by the local community,
delivers on its targets and objectives and is financially solvent, but
the administrator came along and ripped the heart out of the
hospital.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1310214000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000100">I
contend that the purpose of this amendment is to try to stop the
campaign that we have seen in Lewisham over the past few months. The
campaign has united the community like never before. We had more than
25,000 people on our march. Streets are plastered with posters to save
the hospital. Any political party would be envious of the posters up in
people’s windows about this campaign. Our local campaign is
chaired by a local GP and has brought together health professionals and
the local community.</hs_para>

the House whether he has visited Lewisham hospital? I asked him that
question earlier this year; I know that he had not been then and hope
that he has been there since to see the amount of local support and
what a good local hospital it is. More important, there is no support
at all for what the Government propose today. I hope that the House
will support the amendment of my noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath

Earl that we need to find a way of reconfiguring NHS services. That
reconfiguration cannot just be done through dealing with failing
hospitals. It must include other hospitals which currently seem to be
delivering good-quality services. We have to find 
<?notus-xml column=796?>a way out of that. The question is therefore whether the amendment
allows us to move forward with reconfiguring NHS services. This is
where I find myself more in tune with the suggestion of the noble Lord,
Lord Warner, that it may not and that more is
required.</hs_para>

is that the commissioners may express views. I would like some
explanation of why the commissioners of the NHS foundation trust are to
be treated separately from those who commission services from other
hospitals. Another issue is that, if the commissioners disagree, NHS
England would make the decision. That means that, ipso facto, they will
agree with a special administrator—or they will not. In that
case, what happens?</hs_para>

consultation. Clearly, none of the configuration can occur smoothly
unless the public are consulted. At what point will the special
administrator consult both the public served by the failing hospital
and the public served by the hospital that is not failing but whose

there is a need for amendments that will allow us to move forward with
the reconfiguration of services throughout England. In that respect, I
am with the noble Earl, but I wonder if he needs to go a bit further.

at a later stage.</hs_para>

Mackay of Clashfern (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, there is of course
quite a long process still to be gone through on the Bill. As the noble
Lord, Lord Warner, has said, it seems clear that there is a serious
problem. It occurs to me that the special administrator’s
primary emphasis will be on the trust to which he or she has been
appointed. It is also obvious that changes to one trust may affect
neighbouring trusts. Some solution to the problems in the special
administrator’s trust may rely on something done in a
neighbouring trust.</hs_para>

that situation it is extremely important that concentration on the
problems of the neighbouring trust is given considerable emphasis.
Otherwise, the situation may be distorted by too great an emphasis on
the special administrator’s trust at the expense of neighbouring
trusts brought in to try to help. I wonder whether the wise course
might be for us to accept the amendment, in so far as it goes, with an
undertaking that, as the Bill proceeds in the other place, that matter
would be seriously
considered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000109">This
may be an opportunity for legislation that will not quickly arise
again. As the noble Lord, Lord Warner, said, there is a serious problem
and it might not be wise to put it off indefinitely. I can see the
difficulties and understand the situation of the noble Lord, Lord
Patel, but it is very difficult to see how to sort this out today. On
the other hand, it might be unwise to lose the opportunity to take a
step forward in the hope of improving the situation in later stages of

Barker (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, during the deliberations on the
Health and Social Care Bill, we spent a considerable amount of time
discussing the details of the trust special administration
arrangements, not least because it was the first occasion on which a 
<?notus-xml column=797?>legal process of that kind had been in legislation. We were aware then,
and perhaps even more so now, that there has to be some power to bring
these decisions to a conclusion. I find it remarkable that people have
demonstrated in favour of keeping open Mid Staffordshire hospital, but
they have. That is the power of emotion in respect of hospital care in
particular.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000111">However,
I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that this amendment is not
quite what is needed, although there are some things in it which are to
be welcomed. The process that needs to be gone through whenever a
hospital is to be closed is to reassure the public that there will be
access to alternative services. That is the absolutely critical point
and it was with that in mind that I was somewhat taken aback to hear
the Minister say that this procedure—and I bear in mind that, as
he said, this is the last procedure in a very long process—takes
away from the trust special administrator the requirement to involve
the public and the patients. It seems to me that that is the very last
thing that you would want to do if you were trying to have a process
involving political engagement. I therefore ask him how the department
came to that
decision.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_21_PT_1/E516150307C81484B46A8C1E258C4524BBEE3881" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 October 2013">Monday,

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the matters we have debated today are of
great significance. Of course—and I need to make this
clear—we do not want to see any NHS trust or foundation trust
fail, but equally we cannot shirk the responsibility to take action if
and when that happens. In our taxpayer-funded health system, every
pound counts and every pound should be put to best use, providing
high-quality, effective care. Failed organisations squander resources.
I do not want to be derogatory about them in other ways, but they
usually take for themselves an unfair proportion of resources in
relation to the local health economy more
widely<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:03:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Failed
organisations, if nothing is done, have to be propped up by government
bail-outs. That cannot be right, particularly at a time when resources
are as constrained as they are now. We need an effective regime for
tackling these issues.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1310214000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000113"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:03:53"></hs_TimeCode>The
House has agreed with this on two previous occasions, passing
legislation in 2009, during the time of the previous Government, and
again in 2012 to provide failure regimes for trusts and foundation
trusts respectively. We thought that those regimes would be effective,
but experience now shows that they need clarification. The noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, suggested that this amendment represented a major change of
policy and the noble Baroness, Lady Warnock, characterised it as an
arbitrary overturning of the decision of the court in the south London
case. The Government’s policy has been consistent. It is
entirely unchanged. It is self-evidently not a change of policy. Had it
been so, the recommendations made by the trust special administrator in
south London would have been ones that we would have questioned as
legally dubious in the department. On the contrary, we believe that the
administrator’s recommendations fell squarely within the wording
of the 2009 Act, which, as I mentioned earlier, used the phrase,
“in relation to”. That was the phrase around which the
judge’s ruling revolved, and it was a different interpretation
of that phrase that the judge took.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=798?><hs_para UID="1310214000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000114">The noble Lord, Lord
Hunt, is very knowledgeable about the heath service, but I am afraid
that on this matter he is wrong. His amendment would render the failure
regime quite useless. Five years is too long for a failed hospital and
the patients it serves to wait for an effective remedy, to say nothing
of the cost to the public purse. One of the provisions that the noble
Lord has tabled would require the Secretary of State to justify making
the power operational after the end of the five-year period, but is
that not the debate we should have now? In any event, the effect of
accepting his amendment would lead to an incoherent muddle. Either the
House believes that a trust special administrator must be able to take
the action necessary to resolve serious and prolonged problems at a
trust or it does not. A long wait and a report will make no difference
to the issues of substance. I urge the House to be decisive on this
rather than doing what is effectively kicking a can down the
road.</hs_para>

been expressed that the clause we are inserting would enable the
Government to make free with every hospital around the country. That is
not so. In fact, I submit to your Lordships that that suggestion is
scaremongering. The powers could have been used for a long time if it
were the Government’s intention to close down every hospital or
lots of hospitals. The regime was designed by the party opposite, lest
we forget, to deal with the specific circumstances of a trust in
failure. It enables an external expert to be appointed as administrator
to take a fresh look at the situation and, working with the trust and
its commissioners, to develop recommendations for the future.</hs_para>

say this particularly to the noble Lord, Lord Warner—to
recognise that trust special administration is only ever invoked when
the normal processes for agreeing a reconfiguration have hit the
buffers. In normal circumstances commissioners and providers in a
locality get together and very often agree about the way services
should be reconfigured to make them clinically and financially
sustainable. In the case of south London and in the case of Mid
Staffordshire that process has been going on for a long time. It is
only because we reached an intractable position that administrators
were appointed in those instances.</hs_para>

some aspects of our amendment provoke strong feelings, particularly the
clarification—and it is a clarification—that a trust
special administrator can make recommendations that include other
providers where those recommendations are necessary for, and
consequential on, his core recommendations. I bring noble Lords’
attention to those key words. Of course I recognise those views, but I
do not share them. The clarification is vital for the failure regimes
to be effective. It may be possible for the solution to the problems
faced by a failed organisation to be found within the boundaries of
that organisation, but it may not. Indeed, it is quite likely that it
will not be. The health service is
formed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:09:59"></hs_TimeCode> of a
complex network of interdependent providers, all influencing one
another. It is plain that making changes to one has a knock-on effect
elsewhere. The amendment is a reflection of that reality.</hs_para>

this could be unfair on the successful provider impacted by the failure
of a neighbour. Such a step would, of course, be taken reluctantly. But
I argue that it must be possible to take such a step if, and when, that
is the only way of resolving the problem. The amendment would not apply
retrospectively. The date of the court hearing in the south London case
is therefore not

be, as some noble Lords have suggested, that additional things need to
be done. We do not believe that to be the case but I have heard the
arguments put by a number of noble Lords that the amendment might need
additions at some time in future. Our minds are open to that. But I beg
noble Lords not to lose this opportunity of passing my amendment, as it
matters a very great deal, not just in local areas but in the health
service as a whole, in the interests of equity and fairness, which,

agree with the noble Earl that failed organisations squander millions
of pounds. He is absolutely right to say that the need for them to
be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:12:37"></hs_TimeCode> propped up by
others has a deleterious effect on the NHS as a whole. We know that at
least 20 NHS trusts or foundation trusts are in severe financial
difficulty at the moment. It is likely that that number will grow in
future. That is why there is considerable doubt that the special
administration provisions will apply to only a very small number of
cases. There is every possibility that, over the next two or three
years, it will have to be used in many cases. That is why I am
concerned that the provisions that the noble Earl is asking us to agree
to today will be used to lead to configuration of services in which the
interests of the failing trust will be put at the heart of the process
rather than interests of the health service as a whole in a given area.
That is the crux of the issue and that is why Lewisham is so important.
It is a very good hospital—it was minding its own
business—and then, suddenly, a special administrator came along
and said that to solve the problem of the trust that it was dealing
with it would have to reduce Lewisham hospital services. That is the

the other government amendments in this group, Amendments 143, 145,
146, 148, 149 and 150. This group relates to the ability of the Care
Quality Commission to operate free from day-to-day intervention by
Ministers. The amendments that I have tabled will place the CQC on a
new footing of greater operational autonomy. They also clarify some of
the arrangements for the new system of ratings to be operated by the
CQC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>. I will
outline the principle guiding the Government in tabling these
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:32:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000129" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000129">Last
year we passed legislation that placed a duty on the Secretary of State
to promote autonomy in the way that other bodies exercise their
functions in relation to the health service. The changes that we are
proposing build on this. They remove nine separate powers that the
Secretary of State currently has to intervene in the day-to-day
operation of the CQC. Additionally, they place the new chief inspector
posts on a statutory footing, ensuring their longevity, with a specific
duty to operate in a way that ensures the independence of the
CQC’s judgments.</hs_para>

special review or investigation of commissioning—both of health
commissioning by NHS England and NHS Clinical Commissioning Groups and
of local authorities’ commissioning of adult social services.
Such reviews

the independence of the CQC. My instincts are that this will do the
absolute reverse of what the Government are seeking to do in terms of
the CQC’s independence, which is why my Amendment
143A seeks to remove subsection (4). I do not disagree in any way with
the other provisions in this set of government amendments and will
explain my thinking. Subsection (4) effectively prevents the
CQC investigating, of its own mere motion, the extent to which local
authority commissioning practices and decisions on adult social care
damage user interests and
well-being.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000136">In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>
effect, if the CQC considers, after looking at the results of its work
on providers of services, that there is a major stumbling block to
good, sound provision of services that promote the well-being of
users—the provision in Clause 1 of the Bill—it has to
seek the approval of the Secretary of State before it can do any kind
of generalised or thematic review of local authority commissioning of
services. It has to seek the approval not only of the Health Secretary
but of the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.
That seems a step backwards from the position we have now, where the
CQC, as I understand it, could actually undertake these kinds of
reviews. I do not see how the new subsection (4) helps the CQC to get
to the root of a problem that may be affecting thousands of users of
services. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:39:47"></hs_TimeCode>
have already seen that the providers were not the instigators of the
policy of 15-minute home visits—it was the commissioners of
services who instigated that policy. They required the providers to do
that; they almost drove them along the path of not paying for the
travel costs of the healthcare assistants who were making those visits.
The institutional behaviour that has grown up and caused so much
concern among the public and in Parliament has been driven by
commissioners.</hs_para>

have other kinds of such issues as we move through a decade of

why we need to take out subsection (4), which seems to be incompatible

concerns about some commissioning practices, which were found to put
the human rights of older people in particular at risk. Accordingly,

Government intend to remove clauses requiring the CQC to conduct these
reviews through Amendments 145, 146 and 149, in the name of
the noble Earl, Lord Howe. Taken together, these amendments
would remove the proposed new requirements for the CQC to
conduct regular performance assessments or periodic reviews of local
authority social care commissioning, and amend existing provisions
relating to special reviews and investigations by the CQC. That would
leave it able to review providers and to ask the Secretary of State for

such reviews? I believe that the Government have tabled this amendment

Cheshire Disability is worried that these amendments risk reducing the

I ask the Minister to reconsider. I leave him with a question because,
from the tone of these amendments, it appears that the Government do
not see a role for the CQC in improving local authority commissioning

Amendment 147. While I fully understand that Ministers do not wish to
be too prescriptive in the Bill, I feel it cannot be left entirely up
to them and the contingencies of the moment. The CQC’s remit
covers a wide range of care delivery settings including hospitals, care
homes, dental and GP surgeries and all other care services in England.
It will have a wide range of quality domains to supervise and it would
be very easy to migrate the quality standards for an acute hospital
into elder care where both the conditionality and capacity of the
patients may be widely different. I feel that the CQC should be
mandated to include indicators of the quality of services provided for
the identification and treatment of those conditions that most
frequently occur in a particular care setting. For older people this
would include those conditions from which they are most likely to be
suffering such as dementia and continence
issues.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000145">Continence
care should be established as an essential indicator of high-quality
services across all care. I have declared my interests in the
register—I am chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on
Dementia and the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Continence Care. A
number of recent assessments have demonstrated that continence care
remains a low priority across NHS settings, with poor treatment
resulting in escalated and more costly care needs and poorer patient
outcomes. Indeed, the Francis inquiry included an entire chapter
outlining the scale of failures in continence care. Given the expected
rise in the prevalence of incontinence and the impact that poor care
can have on patients and the NHS, continence care must be seen as a key
indicator of high-quality care provision across care settings. An
explicit requirement within the Care Bill for the CQC to assess
providers for the quality of their continence care would directly
respond to the failings in continence care identified by Francis, the
stated purpose behind Part 2 of the Bill. This would encourage
providers to 
<?notus-xml column=808?>actively address how they manage incontinence by assessing their local
protocols and policies about the condition, taking steps to improve
awareness among staff about incontinence and undertaking internal
audits to continuously improve care
standards.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_21_PT_1/9F9D08CB54DCB8635D868D4EF8E2ADA4B38EB0A9" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 October 2013">Monday,

parts of the localism agenda of the Government have likewise seemed to
have devolved in order to encourage people to take responsibility. I
agree that there is a problem of prescription—if I may use that
word in the context of the health service—because we all want to
add in to any freedom the particular issues about which we have a
special concern. I have real sympathy with those for whom dementia is
one of those issues; it certainly is for me. However, we have to guard
against that because, in the end, it may produce an artificial series
of priorities. In this case, it is much better for the Care Quality
Commission to make its own mind up, because it is going to be
responsible<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:52:15"></hs_TimeCode>. I

the Secretary of State for DCLG calling in a locally agreed solar

this is real devolution; that the powers which have been given will not

the CQC to conduct investigations into local authority practices,

when the CQC was set up, was that that was a particularly important
function. Surely it has become more so, given the commitment to
integration between services provided by the health service and those
provided by local authorities. Was that not a key feature of
establishing the CQC? The timing of this seems to be very
odd—perverse, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, said—given the
current huge concern about the way in which services are commissioned,

an important part of its function. The amendments appear to reduce the

the question of 15-minute visits and zero-hour contracts last week. I
have no doubt that part of the problem is that it is local authorities
that are commissioning the 15-minute visits, and that the amount of
money they pay has an influence on the kind of contractual relationship
that private-sector providers have with their staff. That is how
zero-hour contracts come into being. Therefore, how on earth can we
deal with the scandal of 15-minute visits unless we look at the way
local authorities are
commissioning?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000158" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000158">I
was interested that the Care and Support Minister, Norman Lamb, was
reported last week as saying that the length of home care visits could
be monitored by the Care Quality Commission. He said that, with the new
independence of the CQC, from next April it proposes to look at whether
home-care visits are long enough to respond to people’s needs.
Some independence, my
Lords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310214000159" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#1310214000159">The CQC
will also consider how staff working commissions might impact on the
care issues under consideration; whether the service is able to respond
to people’s needs in the allocated time; whether care is
delivered with compassion, dignity and respect; how many staff have
zero-hour contracts; and the levels of staff turnover. This is all
true; it is from Community Care. Apparently, the Minister said that the
CQC will use the information to drive its regulatory activity so that
it will know when, where and what to inspect, and will be alerted
quickly to the risk of poor-quality care in home-care settings. I put
it to the noble Earl that that is all fine, but, given that often it is
local authority commissioners who are responsible for the poor quality 
<?notus-xml column=811?>of provision, surely the CQC should review and inspect the performance
of local authorities. Therefore, I very much support my noble friend
Lord Warner and other noble Lords on

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I set out in my opening remarks the
principle that lies behind the amendments that I tabled: namely, that
the CQC should have more operational autonomy in its day-to-day
activities. I sense that the principle is not inimical to many noble
Lords. The amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, are in contrast to that principle and
seek to tie the hands of the regulator and commit it to considering
specific issues in all
circumstances.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000002">I
say straightaway that the issues raised by the noble Lords are
important: namely, how providers deal with the most commonly recurring
conditions in specific settings, and how hospitals are implementing
NICE guidance on the use of medicines. I do not argue that the CQC
should not consider these issues. It has made clear in its consultation
document, <I>A New Start</I>, that NICE guidance will play an integral
role in its new performance-assessment methodology. That shows that we
can trust the regulator to set its own priorities and to change them in
response to new challenges. However, I submit that they should not be
in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000003">Noble
Lords questioned the CQC’s role in the oversight of
commissioning of both health and adult social care. The noble Lord,
Lord Warner, tabled an amendment that would have the effect of allowing
the CQC to carry out a study of the efficiency of commissioning without
seeking the approval of the Secretary of
State.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000004">I will
explain the approach that we are taking. We are maintaining powers for
the CQC to carry out reviews of commissioning in both health and social
care. However, where this happens, we believe that it should be a
special rather than a periodic review. My noble friend Lady Barker
asked why. The main role of the CQC is to inspect and regulate service
provision. The very name, CQC, reflects that. Where this leads the CQC
to believe that there are problems with local commissioning, it will
have the power to look into this further. However, any review of
commissioning will impact on the CQC’s capacity to regulate
service provision. Therefore, it is only right that this should be
carefully considered and subject to ministerial
agreement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000005">If
a noble Lord were to ask me in what circumstances such agreement would
be withheld, I would be in some difficulty because it is hard to
imagine circumstances in which, if there were clear evidence of poor
commissioning practices in an area, that agreement would not be
forthcoming.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000006">Special
reviews can be tailored in all sorts of ways. They can be tailored to
look at how commissioners are delivering specific policy
objectives—for example, personalisation or service integration.
The special review powers could be used to target the poorest
performers, conduct thematic reviews across all local
authorities—and I shall mention that again in a second—or
perform reviews of a cross-section of local authorities. These reviews
are a sophisticated power that allows the CQC to get to the heart of an
issue in a way that periodic 
<?notus-xml column=812?>reviews cannot. If there is a good case for it conducting
a review of that kind, it will not be stopped from doing
so.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000007">The noble
Lord, Lord Warner, questioned the whole principle of ministerial
sign-off for these special reviews. In fact, all special reviews and
investigations by the CQC under Section 48 of the 2008 Act currently
require the approval of the Secretary of State, so, in that sense, we
are not doing anything radically new.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102116000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000008">As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:06:33"></hs_TimeCode>
I said, the CQC will be able to carry out a special review of
commissioning where there is evidence that commissioning practices are
contributing to the provision of poor care for patients and service
users. A prime example of where the CQC could be tasked to conduct an
investigation would be if it had evidence that 15-minute commissioning
was taking place. That applies to any area where poor commissioning is
identified as a contributory factor to the poor provision of care,
either in terms of the quality of services or where access to services
is raised as an issue by people who use them. I hope that that is
reassuring. We are absolutely clear that the CQC will play a leading
role in making sure that people receive acceptable standards of care.
Indeed, only last week we announced that the CQC was considering the
use of 15-minute care visits to vulnerable and elderly people. That is
entirely appropriate and I emphasise that it will still have the power
to carry out special reviews of that
kind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000009">The
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, went further and said that it was
counterproductive to remove the periodic review power for
commissioning. She referred to statements about this made by my
honourable friend, Norman Lamb, the Minister for Care and Support. I
would simply say to her that retaining Section 46 functions—the
periodic review functions—would offer the CQC nothing further in
terms of enforcement powers against local authorities. Regardless of
whether a review is undertaken under Section 46 or Section 48 in
relation to an English local authority, the follow-up action remains
exactly the same, with the CQC able to issue an improvement notice in
the event of a local authority failing to discharge its functions and
to recommend special measures to the Secretary of State in the event of
substantial failings.</hs_para>

the CQC to focus its efforts on those areas where there are concerns
about commissioning, rather than on all commissioning, including
commissioning where the normal oversight arrangements have revealed no
overt problems. I should now like to come to those oversight
arrangements, because the noble Baroness asked me who is responsible
for the oversight of commissioners if it is not the CQC. We need to
remember that commissioners are already regularly overseen, in a number
of ways, in the new system. In the case of the commissioning of health
services, the new NHS architecture has NHS England taking the central
role in performance-managing the commissioning of NHS services. It
ensures that clinical commissioning groups deliver the best possible
services and outcomes for patients. The CCG assurance framework has
been developed precisely to ensure that the CCGs are working to improve
services and the quality of care for patients.</hs_para>

more transparent. The CCG outcomes indicator set will support CCGs and
health and well-being partners in improving health outcomes by
providing comparative information on the quality of health services
commissioned by CCGs and the associated health outcomes, and it will
support transparency and accountability by making this information
available to patients and the public. That is new. The first quarterly
assurance conversations have now taken place between NHS England and
CCGs. We expect that CCGs will want to make the outcome of these
conversations available publicly as part of the commitment to
transparency. The board will publish an annual assessment at the end of
2013-14, as required by legislation.</hs_para>

England has its own governance processes in place, including the
development of the direct commissioning assurance framework to
demonstrate that it meets the standards required. As this is developed
further, elements will be introduced to bring external scrutiny to its
board and function. Ultimately, NHS England is held to account by the
Department of Health for its commissioning activity against its
delivery of the priorities set in the mandate.</hs_para>

there is no independent scrutiny of NHS commissioning. Health and
well-being boards and local Healthwatch will ensure that the public
voice is heard where there are concerns about the design and
commissioning of services. Where local Healthwatch identifies concerns,
it can raise these with Healthwatch England, which can in turn request
the CQC to take action. Where the CQC has strong concerns that
commissioning is having an impact on the quality and safety of
provision, it can initiate—with ministerial permission—a
special review or investigation. This is a much richer tapestry than
perhaps some noble Lords have portrayed
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000014">On local
authority commissioning, other measures in the Bill will strengthen the
duties on local authorities in exercising their care and support
functions. These include a new express duty to promote people’s
well-being and a duty to shape local care markets to ensure that they
are sustainable and diverse and that they offer high-quality care and
support. They will not, as the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, fears, be left to
themselves. To start with, the department will work with the local
government and adult social care sector to produce statutory guidance
on local authority commissioning of care and support. As well as this,
the Government are committed to ensuring that there is a clear link
between local authority commissioning and the outcomes and experiences
of service users. That will be achieved through the adult social care
outcomes framework, which will give local people, local Healthwatch and
others robust and comparable information on councils’
performance. The Government are committed to making information on
adult social care outcomes even more accessible and readily understood
by people who use care and the wider public further to enhance
transparency.</hs_para>

commissioning, local Healthwatch and health and well-being boards will
be able, through Healthwatch England, to raise concerns with the CQC

will be driven by the views of those with

themselves. Although this system is in its early stages, I genuinely
believe that the mechanics are in place to ensure that local authority
commissioning is scrutinised regularly and in a way that it has not
been

legislative proposals or any other means.</hs_para>

Barker asked why we are stopping the CQC doing what it does now, and
whether there is any evidence that the power has been misused. As I am
sure my noble friend will agree, the CQC plays a very important role in
regulating and inspecting health and care services. It is the
nation’s chief whistleblower on health, but to do its job
properly it must be able to act without fear or favour from the
Government of the day. In a nutshell, we want to make it a stronger
organisation by ensuring that it has the freedom and independence
always to speak out about patient safety concerns, irrespective of who
is in Government. The removal of the need for the CQC to gain the
approval of the Secretary of State for its programme of inspections and
so on will particularly complement the role of the CQC’s new
chief inspectors in providing an authoritative and independent judgment

I turn to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, about the
regular interaction between the CQC and my right honourable friend the
Secretary of State. I hope he will bear in mind that the Department of
Health and the Secretary of State act as system stewards, overseeing
the work of the CQC and other arm’s-length bodies. It is
essential as the regulator of providers that the CQC is independent in
its judgments. That is not to say that Ministers and the department
should not keep a regular watching brief over what is—he will
acknowledge—a very active scene out there, not least in the area
of the quality of care delivered by certain hospitals.</hs_para>

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I listened carefully to the points made
in this debate, particularly those made by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I
find this brave new world that we are moving into—of which he
painted such an attractive picture—a bit puzzling. In the
previous debate on the trust special administrator, we heard that the
trust special administrator comes into play when this wonderful piece
of architecture around commissioning has failed to deal with the job.
The CCGs, supervised by NHS England, have simply not been able to
deliver the changes that are required through the commissioning
arrangements. In that area, the fall-back position which the Government
insist that we have, is a trust special administrator, often to make
good the deficiencies of an unsatisfactory commissioning set-up. The
Government do not seem to have quite as much confidence in their new
architecture for commissioning as the noble Earl
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:18:13"></hs_TimeCode>suggested.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000022">I
turn to my amendment, which in effect maintains the status quo and the
ability of the CQC to decide, in the light of the evidence it has had
from its reviews of performance by providers, that there is a systemic
problem with commissioning, the making of arrangements for adult social
services. It seems odd that we should 
<?notus-xml column=816?>just leave this, in effect, to all 152 local authorities and put in
place another hurdle to be got over, which is the approval of two
Secretaries of State, before the CQC can actually act in the area of
commissioning. We have to bear in mind that in the good old days, when
I was a director of social services in local government, I had to look
over my shoulder at the Audit Commission as to how we were behaving and
making our arrangements. The Audit Commission, however, has gone the
way of all flesh, so that is the end of another watchdog that was there
to make sure, without being too obtrusive, that there could be thematic
reviews of the way local authorities carried out their commissioning
behaviour<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:19:33"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:19:36"></hs_TimeCode>.
I do not think that this architecture is robust enough to safeguard
patients, and I wish to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_para><Division><hs_time UID="13102116000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000075">5.20

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, we come to an important
amendment that relates essentially to staff ratios and guidance. I
refer back to the Francis report, which focused very much, among many

given the financial strain currently on the health service there is a
large concern about whether there are enough staff on the wards to give
appropriate care. Much of the concern around the quality of nursing
care and the quality of care by healthcare assistants has related to
essential aspects of care, including feeding, caring and all those
things associated with what we would regard as appropriate caring.
Underlining those things has been a concern as to whether enough staff
are employed on the
wards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:33:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

know that the Francis report recommended that NICE should benchmark
issues around appropriate staffing levels. He will also know that since
the Francis report came out we have had the Keogh report into 14 trusts
with outline mortality rates. It is interesting that one of the
important conclusions of the Keogh review was the need to look
seriously at staffing numbers. There seems to be a direct relationship
between outline mortality rates and staffing levels on the wards and in
clinical areas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:34:02"></hs_TimeCode>.
We have also had the Berwick review, which the Government established,
looking more generally at staffing levels within the health service.
The review identified staffing levels as being one of the most
important areas on which to focus when it comes to reviewing quality of
care.</hs_para>

amendment relates to ensuring that in its responsibilities the CQC has
sufficient focus on staffing levels. This is a very important matter at
a time when the health service is being presented with an increase in
the number of patients and an increase in technology and complexity at
the same time as having to operate on a budget that is just above a
level budget. Things

70% of the budget of NHS organisations is spent on staffing and
expenditure on nursing and healthcare assistants forms perhaps the most
important element of the staffing budget. Therefore, in some way we
need to protect staffing levels in such circumstances. My amendment

Emerton (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment 159
standing in my name and in the names of the noble Lords, Lord Willis
and Lord Warner, and of my noble friend Lord Patel.
Amendment 159 is about safeguarding patients. I championed
safe staffing levels during the proceedings on the Health and Social
Care Bill and during the proceedings on the Care Bill to date but
failed to get my amendments accepted following a firm rebuttal by the
Minister. Therefore, it was with a slightly doubtful mind that on 29
July, before we left for the Summer Recess, I put my name to the
amendment before us
today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:38:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000032">I
then began nine weeks of reflection on whether I should or should not
withdraw my name. I want to share the experiences of those nine weeks
that have 
<?notus-xml column=821?>left my name on the amendment. I resolved to try to convince the
Minister and noble Lords that if we wish to meet the challenges of
high-quality, safe care acceptable to patients and their families in
hospitals, we cannot ignore the contents of this amendment, set out
under four headings. It recognises that it is only a small part of a
very comprehensive Bill focusing on the acute hospital provider but it
is nevertheless important that patients should be assured that all the
measures that are taken will ensure their safety and the high quality
of delivery of care to their satisfaction, resulting in a short length
of stay, less likelihood of infection, reduced readmission rates and
lower mortality rates.</hs_para>

cost-effective and care-effective way forward, despite the challenges
it brings with it. The need to consider staffing levels in the
community is equally important if we are to achieve an integrated
service from primary healthcare and community care as well as from the
acute providers in hospitals. Before the Recess I was involved in
discussions about staffing levels with a number of very senior nurses,
academics, the Royal College of Nursing and other organisations. The
Bruce Keogh report focused on the seriousness of the situation,
identifying 14 hospitals with high mortality rates and low staffing
levels. That was quickly followed by the publication of the report by
Professor Don Berwick, also just mentioned, on the safety of patients,
which again referred to low levels of nursing staff as being a problem,
but not measured against an evidence-based
level.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102116000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000034">The
group of senior nurses formed themselves into the Safe Staffing
Alliance, chaired by Elizabeth Robb, the chief executive of the
Florence Nightingale Foundation, who had personally experienced
introducing care bundles for five long-term conditions, which led to a
dramatic reduction in mortality rates, and who was a member of the
Keogh commission. The alliance busily engaged itself in examining the
research evidence available internationally, and within the UK, on
staffing levels. Its statement
says:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102116000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000072">“Under
no circumstances is it safe to care for patients in need of hospital
treatment with a ratio of more than 8 patients per registered nurse

in care for older
people”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13102116000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0001.htm#13102116000054">Very
soon after that, Robert Francis spoke to the CQC and referred to his
original recommendation on staffing levels. He said, “So much of
what went wrong in our hospitals is likely and indeed was in many
regards the case in Stafford, due to there being inadequate numbers of
staff either in terms of numbers or skills. The evidence given to my
inquiry however was not sufficient to persuade me that there should be
a minimum across the board staffing level, and I know not everyone
agrees with that conclusion. But I could only act on the evidence I had
and I was after all only dealing with the event arising out of a
particular hospital so the inquiry for all the breadth in the end had
limitations. However, evidence has been put forward to me since from
the Safe Staffing Alliance to suggest there is a level below which it
should be regarded a service is not safe, not that’s the
adequate level of staffing but the level below which you cannot be
safe. It does seem to me that it’s evidence that is worth
consideration and therefore ought to be considered somewhere with
regard 
<?notus-xml column=822?>to whether there is some sort of benchmark which at least is a bit like
mortality rates an alarm bell which should require at least questions
to be asked about whether it is possible for a service to be safe given
whatever the staffing situation is. I just ask you to consider that as
being a potential way to show real support for staff, some of whom are
working in really challenging
circumstances”.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102116000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102116000055">In

September, I met directors of nursing from the teaching hospitals
called the Shelford Group, who were grappling with staffing problems

and NHS foundation trusts. I also discussed the issue with the director
of nursing at Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust, Elaine Inglesby, who
gave evidence to the Health Select Committee that demonstrated clearly
that the whole hospital was engaged in the safe staffing project. She
had been able to implement the suggested staffing levels by using the
acuity and dependency tools supplied by the Association of UK
University Hospitals and using the ratio of one registered nurse to
eight patients as a minimum, based on the evidence from Southampton
University, King’s College London and the National Nursing
Research Unit. Evidence suggested that there was a need for three
registered nurses on night duty.</hs_para>

This is posted so the patients and visitors can immediately identify
how many staff at what grade are on duty at any time. There is a daily
safe staffing teleconference on daily rotas meeting each morning at
8.30. This looks at the morning, late and night shift and presents a
true picture of ward and department nurse staffing. Obviously this is
an ongoing development project involving the board members and the
staff of the whole hospital. To date it is working to the satisfaction
of patients, families and, above all, the staff

also noted the media and varying reports of events demonstrating
failings in service delivery because of low staffing levels, including
the reports of warning signs from the Royal College of Nursing and
other organisations. I also listened to patients’ experiences,
where shortage of staff appeared to be a major concern. The need for so
many trusts to seek overseas recruits because of shortage was reported
last week. There are also records from the Patients Association, which
has received many complaints on staff shortages during this

went on holiday myself and reflected back over the eight weeks. I came
to the conclusion, while declaring that I am a long-retired nurse not
on the NMC register, that I could do nothing but support the amendment

have persuaded the Minister. Although this amendment is only a very
small part of this large Bill, because of the ramifications for the
safety of patients in hospitals who rely on 80% of their 
<?notus-xml column=823?>care being given by nurses, we owe it to the nurses and to the patients
they serve at least to acknowledge and accept the words of the
amendment so framed to allow the flexibility required to meet patient
need but avoid high risk to the delivery of care. I trust the Minister
will respond accordingly to the

having read the Francis report and the Winterbourne View report, one
suddenly realises that, certainly from 2009 but far back in time as
well, the department under successive Governments has offered guidance
about safe staffing levels. It has done that in everything, but
particularly in acute settings, I appreciate that. The fact that that
was not taken into consideration makes the noble Lord’s
amendment absolutely appropriate. I cannot see for the life of me why
my noble friend would not accept it as a very sensible addition for

not do; nobody on either side of the House has sought to impose

prefer, as I am sure colleagues on all sides of the House do, to have
strong statutory guidance with good inspection, which is what we have
had in the past. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, does
this—it completes the circle. I am very concerned that this
House and the department spend too little time addressing the question
of safe staffing. What does that actually mean? I declare an interest
as an honorary fellow of the Royal College of Nursing. The
RCN associates safe staffing with nursing because nurses,
together with healthcare assistants under their supervision, do most of
the care. But safe staffing is about the total product, not simply
about nursing. It is also about the ward managers and everything else
that goes into ensuring that when patients go into any setting, whether
it is domiciliary, a care home or an acute hospital, there is an
appropriate level of staffing.</hs_para>

Willis Commission report last year, one of the things that came up over
and over again was a demand for mandatory staffing levels. I spent some
time looking at the literature on safe staffing levels to see whether
there was a correlation between having the right number of
staff—registered nurses, care assistants, doctors or
consultants—and outcomes. Frankly, it is very difficult to find
empirical evidence to support it one way or another, simply because
nobody in the healthcare system works in isolation from their
colleagues. You are only as good as the team that works around you and
their skills and training mix. I looked up what was happening in
California where for more than 10 years they have had mandatory
staffing levels for registered nurses. No other state has followed
that. In April Senator Barbara Boxer introduced a Bill in the Senate to
try to establish a federal system of ensuring that all hospitals had
particular staff levels but nobody has followed that

being done in the UK, such as Anne Marie Rafferty’s 2007 study,
with which Members are familiar. It was a really good piece of work
which showed a 26% higher mortality rate in the cases of very high
patient to nursing ratios. Kane’s meta-analysis in 2007 of all
the literature indicated an emerging consensus that there are
particular staffing levels beyond which the situation becomes
dangerous. It is an issue for the department to constantly keep that
under review. The amendment does not go over that ground but makes it
clear in terms of safe staffing that there would be a duty on the
provider, such as the hospital or the care home or those providing
domiciliary care, to ensure that staff levels were appropriate and that
staff competence is such to carry out safe care.
After<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:54:48"></hs_TimeCode> all, there
is nobody in this House who does not want to see safe staffing within
all NHS and other providers of health and care. That seems to be a
basic starting point for a high-quality health and care system. We need
to be able to ensure that that is the case. You will only find out what
safe staffing levels are in a particular scenario and setting if you
monitor them. That is why there is a requirement in the amendment to
report on it. We are not talking about a report every three or five
years, but there should be a continuous report so that when the CQC
goes into a setting, it can look at the correlation between safe
staffing levels, acuity and mortality rates and other factors, to see
whether outcomes are dependent on particular mixes of

saying that there should be annual reports. The Secretary of State
would decide how often the department should be able to look at those

who are being cared for is fundamental to healthcare. I hope that the

144 does not go far enough. I am sure that the point of the noble Lord,
Lord Willis—that the Care Quality Commission should be capable
of thinking of these things for itself in any case—is right.
However, the phrase “the skills mix” concerns me. There
can be huge differences in the skills mix. I was concerned that the
Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, having waited for perhaps as long as
10 years, at last got a specialist nurse for neurological conditions.
The hospital was delighted because it had had huge demand for such a
service. I am a great supporter of specialist nurse

came along and poached that nurse from the Chelsea and Westminster,
which then looked at what it could do. I was informed by word of mouth
that there was no question or even thought of a replacement because
there was a long list, and it was a case of “the first cab on
the rank” as to who was deemed to be most needed. It could have
been an ordinary nurse, it could have been a surgical nurse or anyone.
You moved on and did not replace the person with the skills that you
needed and wanted. You had to replace your missing person with whatever
the next thing on the waiting list was. That seemed to be a serious
cause for concern.</hs_para>

is essential to know what skills mix is needed. The amendment mentions
“official guidance”. It would have to go much wider than
official guidance. It has to be attributable to the particular hospital
or service that is involved. Although the amendment covers many of the
important points, it does not cover the need for every facility to have
cover within that department and not to then find that they have lost
it because someone left—they could have gone off on maternity
leave, they could have left for any reason, but in this instance they
were poached by another NHS

is important. The relationship between the staffing levels is hard to
assess and has to be individually done. The Care Quality Commission
should be capable of having an indication of what it should be looking
at, and needs to be aware of all these problems. Of course, not one of
us could oppose having enough staff on the wards, which the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, said was necessary. However, we are now faced with positions
where budgets are limited and they have to look at and work out what
they need most. I do not agree at all that it should be just a
progression from whoever has been waiting the longest; it should be
whatever the hospital, or a particular department, needs the most.
Although I support the principle, perhaps it needs more than this. I am
hoping that the Minister will be able to assure us that he can
incorporate some words within those he already has to make it clear
that there must be this obligation. I strongly support Amendment 144

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I support both the amendments. They are
not alternatives but complementary. I want to start briefly from where
we are. The issue of staffing numbers, ratios and skill mixes is just a
black box as far as the public are concerned. It is something that goes
on within the NHS. This has some relationship to our earlier debate
about failure. It is often very difficult for outsiders—and I
include regulators as outsiders—to understand what is going on
in institutions, particularly acute hospitals. This issue is not
peculiar to hospitals; it is even more of an issue for community
services, in some ways.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102134000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000002">I would like briefly to
share my experience as the chairman of the provider agency in London.
If your Lordships think that things are bad in some hospital services,
try the community services. When we started to poke around in the
community services, we found huge variations in the staffing levels for
populations with particular conditions. There were massive variations
in the face time that clinical staff spent with their patients. We have
issues in community services which are often probably more dangerous
and less reassuring than we have in some of our hospitals. If we are to
have such amendments to the Bill, it is clear that they must relate not
just to acute hospital services.</hs_para>

public understanding about when hospitals are failing or unsustainable
without a better sense of public education about what a safe level of
staffing is to give the reassurance that you are going into a facility
which is safe. I added my name to Amendment 159 because it opens up the
issue of putting into the public arena some data and reassurance about
what a safe level of staffing is for some of these services. It can
then be prayed in aid by both commissioners and providers when there
are issues about whether a unit is sustainable. We often talk about
unsustainability as a financial issue, but it is often about staffing
issues—the sheer inability to get a safe group of staff together
to run the institution. One acid test of why a place is unsafe is the
number of bank or agency staff in a unit, who come and go at
ever-increasing frequencies. Public understanding of what is going on
in these hospitals seems critical to public
reassurance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:04:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

staff numbers into the Bill, but we need something better than we have
now to give the public some idea about the staffing levels and skill
mix in what are, at the end of the day, relatively closed institutions.
It is difficult for the public to understand what is and is not safe
without more data, and that would make it much easier to hold boards to
account. Amendment 159 would make it clear that the boards of trusts
need to come back continually to what they are providing to the public
in the safety of their staffing levels. Amendments 144 and 159
certainly do no damage to the Bill. They strengthen it and it is much
more in the interests of the public to have this data available
locally, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gardner of Parkes, has said,
relating to specific establishments and
institutions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord MacKenzie of Culkein" PimsId="1615" UID="13102134000759" xid="1822" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000759">Lord
MacKenzie of Culkein (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I also support both
amendments. It seems to me, as a nurse, to be a self-evident
proposition that having safe staffing 
<?notus-xml column=827?>levels and the correct skill mix, taking into account dependency and
acuity, is the right thing do. Anyone who has listened to the debates
in this House on various Bills dealing with health and social care over
the past few months knows that it is an enormously complicated issue.
However, we must bring it back to this level of patient safety and the
duty of providers to provide safe staffing levels and the correct skill
mix. If that is not done, all the other things we talk about will be in
vain and we will end up with more reports, more inquiries and more
problems.</hs_para>

said, it is incumbent on Governments to take account of all these
things: the Francis report, the review into Winterbourne View and some
of the recommendations in the excellent report produced a few months
ago by the noble Lord, Lord Willis. It is vital that we get this right.
At a time when financial pressures will force authorities to look at
diluting the numbers of trained nursing staff and trained staff in the
community and replacing them with healthcare assistants or support
workers with hugely varied levels of training and experience, it is
absolutely right that we get the correct level. As has already been

nothing away from
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13102134000760" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000760">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that I can give noble Lords
considerable reassurance on the Government’s position on these
important issues. It is almost axiomatic that safe, high-quality care
is dependent on people and that right-staffing, in terms of numbers and
skills, is vital for good care. The importance of having the right
staff with the right skills and in the right numbers is central to the
delivery of high-quality care. Where staff are stretched because they
are too few in number, corners will be cut, with inevitable adverse
consequences for patient care. Equally, where staff do not have the
right skills to carry out their tasks, the quality of care will
suffer.</hs_para>

first priority, and safe staffing levels really matter. The quality of
care provided to patients is ultimately the responsibility of the
leadership of provider organisations. It is their responsibility to
ensure that they have the right staff with the right skills in the
right place at the right time in order to provide high-quality care. In
the final analysis, it is for hospitals themselves to decide how many
nurses they employ, and they are the best placed to do that. Nursing
leaders have been clear that hospitals should determine and publish
staffing details and the evidence to show that staff numbers are right
for the care needs of the patients that they look after.</hs_para>

providers are best placed to do this based on local need, we expect
them to look to authoritative guidance and evidence-based tools and
learn from best practice to deliver cost-effective and safe care. We
recognise that there is a need for national action to ensure that local
organisations meet those expectations. As a result of the national
nursing and midwifery strategy and vision published in 2012,
<I>Compassion in Practice</I>, a considerable amount of work is going
on across England to ensure that providers use evidence-based tools,
using acuity and dependency measures to set staffing levels, and for
boards to publish these staffing levels on a regular basis.</hs_para>

we are now doing to build on that work. First, the Chief Nursing
Officer, supported by the National Quality Board, is developing
guidance for the system, including a set of expectations, to support
provider organisations in securing the appropriate staffing capacity

developed with the intention of ensuring safe patient care and that
patient outcomes are not compromised. It will include expectations on
transparency and publication of information on
staffing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000011">This
guidance is being developed jointly by the statutory organisations
responsible for quality across the NHS, which are brought together as
part of the National Quality Board and which include the Care Quality
Commission, Monitor, the NHS Trust Development Authority and NHS
England. It will be published next month. I can therefore only agree
with the intention behind the amendment that providers need to be open
and transparent about their staffing numbers. The positive news is that
action is already in place to ensure that this
happens.</hs_para>

it carries the risk of unintended consequences. It could lead to other
important factors, such as innovation and service improvement, not
being given sufficient weight and providers becoming unduly risk

That is always justified by benefits for the wider system. We do not
want clinicians to become reluctant to take risks if this amendment

which the chief inspectors are planning to bring in. Proposals for that
will be announced very shortly. We attach great importance to that kind
of transparency, not only in the NHS but in the care sector. On my
noble friend’s question about whether all this would cover the
care sector as well as the NHS, as he will know, the CQC issues
sector-specific guidance on how to meet staffing registration
requirements. Obviously NHS England would only provide guidance that
relates to the NHS. As I already said, the Chief Inspector of, say,
Adult Social Care would inspect regularly against CQC
guidance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:17:42"></hs_TimeCode>. The

noble friend spoke about an emerging consensus on a minimum level of
staffing below which care is unsafe. I understand his point, but I am
sure he will 
<?notus-xml column=830?>acknowledge—and did, implicitly, in his remarks—that
staffing is not simply about crude numbers; it is not just about
nurses. Healthcare assistants and other members of the team all have a
key role to play. My noble friend Lady Gardner was absolutely right to
point out that the skill mix is relevant in these circumstances.
Patient safety experts agree that safe staffing levels should be set
locally. It is not for Whitehall to set one-size-fits-all staffing
rules. That is exactly why we have asked NICE and other nursing experts
to review the evidence, to help organisations to make the right
decisions on staff numbers at a local level and then, essentially, to
govern
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:19:01"></hs_TimeCode>. I
make it absolutely clear that we fully agree that safe staffing should

reassured that action is already being undertaken in a combination of
ways, through <I>Compassion i</I><I>n Practice</I>, the CQC

Inspector of Hospitals. That will ensure that providers are open and
transparent about their staffing numbers and that they assess these
staffing levels, not just on the day of an inspection but on a regular
basis, using evidence-based tools, and by taking into account local
factors that relate to local patient needs and outcomes. I therefore

Howe, has listed a number of ways in which we could be assured that
staffing numbers and skill mix will be okay both in the NHS and the
care sector. The fact is that, however much information is published
and however much this might be part of the licensing regime of CQC,
these organisations have been around for some time. There is consistent
evidence that staffing levels are not sufficient. We have already had
the Francis report, which said that NICE should undertake benchmarking
on staffing levels. The Keogh report on the 14 hospital trusts
said:</hs_para>

Berwick report goes over the same ground. At the end of the day, I do
not think there is enough beef in the system to ensure that we have
adequate support staff. If NICE is going to carry out the benchmarking,
which is a very good thing, we need to make sure that the
regulator actually has some beef in terms of ensuring that we get
adequate staff levels in clinical areas. I think that my Amendment 144
ensures that that will happen. I should like to test the opinion of the
House.</hs_parafo>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments 152B to
152F. These are amendments to the clauses that establish a new offence
and penalties where care providers provide certain false or misleading
information. Together with the new duty of candour on providers that we
considered last Wednesday, this measure is key to supporting openness
and transparency among care
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000029">We
are making two substantive amendments. First, Amendment 152F extends
the offence to directors and other senior individuals who consent to or
connive in an offence committed by the care provider, as well as to
cases where the negligence of senior individuals has led to the offence
by the care provider. This amendment brings the offence into line with
a number of other offences that are committed by organisations, such as
Health and Safety at Work etc. Act offences and offences under the CQC
legislation, where senior individuals are also liable for the offence.
This will 
<?notus-xml column=835?>encourage directors and other senior individuals leading organisations
to take greater ownership of the provision of
information<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000030">Secondly,
since Committee, the Government have reflected on the penalties for
this offence. The provision of accurate information is central to the
safe functioning of the health and social care system as it provides
the intelligence on which commissioners and regulators form judgments
about the quality of care. Where that information is wrong, it can
result in delays in taking action to protect patients and service
users. Falsifying such information is a serious matter that can
frustrate attempts to provide safe care for patients and service users.
In the light of this, we believe that a custodial sentence is warranted
in the most serious cases. I am therefore bringing forward Amendment
152E, which introduces a maximum penalty on indictment of two
years’
imprisonment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:37:31"></hs_TimeCode>. I
emphasise that the Government are not of the view that the custodial
penalty will be used with any frequency. The aim of the offence is not
to punish directors and other senior individuals but, rather, to drive
improvement and
performance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:37:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

address a number of concerns that were raised in Committee. There was
some debate about the scope of the false or misleading information
offence. I should like to make it as clear as possible that the false
or misleading information offence will apply only to the provision of
publicly funded care. We will specify in regulations—a
preliminary draft of which we have shared with noble Lords ahead of the
debate—which information this will relate to, starting with
information provided by hospitals. We are making a small number of
amendments to clarify the scope of the offence. First, we are amending
the definition of a care provider to make it clear that this does not
include commissioners or regulators. We are also amending the wording
so that the offence could apply to sole traders and all types of
partnerships, such as GP practices, and to care providers who are
funded by service users under direct payment arrangements. I beg to

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I want to ask the noble
Earl just one question. Why does it not apply to commissioners? We know
from events that have happened in the past few years that in many cases
commissioners have been responsible for issues by sins of omission or
by not being completely open. It is a puzzle to me why all the emphasis
is on providing and not on the way that commissioners actually operate.
There is evidence, for instance, that the way some commissioners
operate can have a direct impact on the quality of provision. We have
already discussed this in relation to 15-minute visits. I am puzzled as
to why so little attention is being paid to the way that commissioners
themselves should
operate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:39:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> That is a perfectly reasonable question. The short
answer is that, in determining the scope of this offence, our focus was
and is on information that is closest to patient care, where inaccurate
statements can allow poor and dangerous care to continue. That approach
responds directly to the Francis report concerns about the manipulation
of patient safety information. We believe, therefore, that the
proposals are focused and proportionate. We are targeting this offence
on 
<?notus-xml column=836?>the key patient safety and quality data that commissioners and
regulators use to assess performance. We think that we have the balance
right.</hs_para>

building on what we have been putting in place since your
Lordships’ House last discussed this issue during the passage of
the Health and Social Care Act 2012. Common induction standards have
been in place in social care since 2005, but the sector skills councils
jointly published a code of conduct and national minimum training
standards in March 2013. The standards place dignity and respect at the
centre of the knowledge required to provide safe and effective care.
The sector skills councils engaged comprehensively in the development
of both the NMTS and the code of conduct across the health and social
care sectors, including NHS and social care providers, the Health and
Care Professions Council, the Royal College of Nursing, the Royal
College of Midwives, the Nursing and Midwifery Council, and patient

healthcare support workers. I notice that the noble Baroness, Lady
Gibson<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:52:05"></hs_TimeCode>, is

there is an overwhelming case for appropriately training the 1.3

should like to ask some brief questions. Camilla Cavendish recommended
that the certificate of fundamental care be a baseline on which there
would be an advanced certificate. That would lead directly into nurse
training so that there would be no glass ceiling for healthcare support
workers, particularly since nursing has moved on to being an
all-graduate profession. When the Minister responds, I hope that he
will be able to say whether that is within the psyche. The idea of
having student nurses working alongside healthcare support workers,
particularly those training for the advanced level, is a good one, so
that you know the skills mix that you are working
with<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:54:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

noble friend is right that there are some excellent training

support workers at John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford within the
hospital setting. I know that many care homes give superb training to
their staff because that leads to good patient outcomes which sell the
product. Has any thought gone into existing training being recognised

trained to approved standards, how on earth do you have a regulatory

want to draw together Amendments 153, 158 and 160. Given that in future
when employers wish to take on care workers they will expect a
certificate of fundamental care, does the Minister not think it
inevitable that there will be a list of people who have been awarded
the certificate? Does he not also think it inevitable that once you
have that list, if you then have a person with a certificate and they
transgress and there is concern about the way they care for people,
there will inevitability be a drive to ask how you get that certificate
off them? I believe regulation is inevitable now. There is no way away
from the fact that once you have a certificate like this, there will
have to be a list or a register and people will have to be evaluated. I
for one very much welcome what the Minister has announced because it is

it is NVQ level 1, 2 or 3—which I am sure my noble

have one or two very quick questions. He knows that I have a thing
about Skills for Care and Skills for Health. Who is going to decide the
membership of those groups? I am concerned that in teaching skills each
individual care worker will want to have the background knowledge to
support their skill. It is no good just teaching someone a simple skill
without having the knowledge behind it. It reminded me that 63 years
ago I was a St John Ambulance cadet. I did an elementary first-aid
course where a doctor taught elementary anatomy, physiology and
treatment of first aid. I then went on to home nursing and was taught
by a registered nurse how to look after patients in the home, provide
good nutrition and prevent bed sores. I think probably what I knew at
the age of 11 is more than what some of our healthcare professionals
know today. What will be the professional input into Skills for Health
and Skills for Care? Who will do the syllabus, the curriculum and the
teaching? Presumably Health Education England and the NMC will give the
backing to that. If we could have that assurance, it would keep me
quiet for a little

the issue of where this stands in the pecking order is vital. Is it

from the degree-level professional qualifications? In some ways, the
title that has been given to this rather diminishes its standing up the
food chain, so to speak. A certificate of fundamental care sounds a bit
basic, and I am not quite sure what signals are given about the level
that Health Education England should strive for in overseeing this

I may also pick up the point that my noble friend Lord Hunt hinted at.
At the end of the day, if employers are to make this operate, they need
some kind of register of who has the certificate. They also need to
know what happens when they fire somebody and take disciplinary action
against someone who has this certificate. Who do they tell? That seems
a quite critical issue, because this is a very large workforce and it
would be quite surprising if each year we did not get a steady flow of
bad cases where an employer has fired someone for a breach of good
practice of one kind or another. This would all be set to nought if
there was no record of where these cases of disciplinary action 
<?notus-xml column=843?>have been taken, and people with a certificate were still floating

extremely important that that happens if at all possible. For me,

properly regulated to safeguard the public. I hope that an open mind

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very pleased that noble Lords have

part of the workforce.</hs_para>

answer the questions that have been put to me. First, I pay tribute to
my noble friend Lord Willis who has made a very important contribution
to the debate on healthcare assistants in the Willis Commission on
Nursing Education. I acknowledge his long-standing interest and
expertise in this area. While the government position on a
recommendation such as regulation is different from his—I will
come on to regulation in a moment—we share his concern that
healthcare assistants and social care support workers need to have the
training to do the tasks that they are asked to do. I am well aware of
the recommendations that he has made in that area and we will not lose
sight of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:11:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000073">My
noble friend asked about government Amendment 153 and why it
does not say “must” instead of “may”.
First, I can commit that we will make regulations in this area. The
amendment provides an expressed power to delegate the standard-setting
function to another body if we so choose. It is in the Secretary of
State’s power to delegate. The amendment states
“may” because the Secretary of State may in the future
wish to set the training standards which he would be able to do under
his existing powers. The Secretary of State would not be able to do
that if regulations had been made that delegated this function to
another
body<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:12:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000074">The
noble Lord, Lord Warner, asked what the care certificate will look
like. It is a little too soon for me to answer that in any detail.
Health Education England is still considering that issue because of the
range of settings in which healthcare assistants and social care
support workers operate. We have asked Health Education England to
ensure that the approach to the care certificate is flexible so that it
is meaningful in every setting. As Camilla Cavendish recommends, they
will need to build on the best of the training and development practice
which is out there, and the good work that is being done on the code of
conduct and the national minimum training standards. A key requirement
is to ensure that the skills and behaviours are taught so that we move
away from the tick-box approach identified in some instances in the
Cavendish review. I know that that is a particular
concern—rightly—of the noble Baroness, Lady
Emerton<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:13:17"></hs_TimeCode>.
Equally, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, was right to say that we have to
think about the mechanisms which would allow, in appropriate cases, the
withdrawal of a certificate where an individual had been found wanting
in their caring
skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:13:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Emerton, asked who will be involved in the development of the
certificate. As I have said, Health Education England has been asked to
lead this work. It will engage with sectoral bodies, including the
sector skills councils, but also more particularly the NMC, the RCN and
providers of care. The department will be involved as well. I can
reassure her that the code of conduct and the national minimum trading
standards were not solely the product of the 
<?notus-xml column=845?>sector skills councils but were very much the result of consultation and
cross-sector working with a number of professional
bodies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:14:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Willis asked whether there would be an advanced certificate. An
advanced certificate, bridging into nursing qualifications, certainly
needs to be considered as part of the wider response to Camilla
Cavendish’s report and we may have more to say about that when
we make our official response. However, we agree that any work done by
Health Education England must look at the broader picture and the other
recommendations made by Camilla Cavendish.</hs_para>

asked about recognising existing high standards of training, where

Lady Wall, asked what we do about healthcare assistants and social care
support workers who are already working in the field. That is a point

someone is already working as a healthcare assistant or social care
support worker and meets the standards there should be some way for
them to demonstrate this without having to undergo unnecessary repeat
training.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102134000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000079">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, suggested that, if we have gone this far, it is
almost inevitable that we should proceed to regulate this sector of the
workforce. I do not agree with him, but, in answer to the noble Lord,
Lord MacKenzie, our minds are still open to the possibility of
regulation at some time in the future. However, we need to bear in mind
that statutory regulation is not just about training: it is a much
broader process and we do not currently view it as appropriate or
proportionate for healthcare assistants and social care workers.
Statutory regulation involves setting standards of conduct required
within a scope of practice; protecting commonly recognised professional
titles; establishing a list of registered practitioners, which is quite
an onerous process; providing a way in which complaints can be dealt
with fairly and appropriately and allowing a regulator to strike off an
individual from a register. We must make no mistake about how complex a
business this is. I emphasise that we will continue to review this
whole question as we go along but we do not think it is appropriate at
present.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102134000080" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000080">The
noble Lord, Lord Patel, asked what sanctions there will be for people
who do not meet the standards described in the certificate and the
noble Lord, Lord Warner, asked a similar question. Unfortunately, I do
not have a detailed answer for him today. However, it is a pertinent
point that, as the development of the certificate continues, we will
need to bottom out. Managers and the CQC will play a big role and are
important in ensuring that the certificate is an effective way of
evidencing people’s
skills.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000081">The

disclosure and barring service also provides a further layer of
assurance by helping employers make safer recruitment decisions and

this stage, basic training but full details have not been finalised and
I hope noble Lords will understand that if I go any further on this
point I am in danger of pre-empting our formal response to the
Cavendish report. Currently, the national minimum training standards
cover issues such as how to communicate effectively with stakeholders,
how to ensure that care is person-centred, how to handle patients, and
infection control and prevention. However, no doubt those issues will

noble Lords will feel reassured that there is already in place a
proportionate system and process to provide public assurance, and that
these measures, in addition to the commitments that I made today in

Aberdare (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, My Lords, I shall speak to
Amendment 160A, which is sandwiched in the middle of this group of
government amendments. My amendment seeks to add an additional matter
to which Health Education England must have regard when publishing its
objectives and
priorities—namely,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102134000330" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000330">“the

promptly”.</hs_quotefo><hs_parafo UID="13102134000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000093">This
is intended to promote the interests of patients suffering from
diseases that are hard to diagnose but where early diagnosis can be
critical. There are, of course, a number of such conditions, but the
Minister may not be surprised to learn that the particular condition on
which I shall focus is pancreatic cancer, for which early diagnosis is
often literally a matter of life and death. This amendment is based on
my work with the charity Pancreatic Cancer UK. I am also a member of
the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Pancreatic Cancer, chaired by my
noble friend Lord Patel, which has been conducting an inquiry into how
survival rates can be improved. Speed of diagnosis is critical and
depends largely on the level of awareness of pancreatic cancer and its
symptoms in primary
care.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102134000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000094">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:27:13"></hs_TimeCode>
2010 National Cancer Patient Experience Survey found that 40% of
pancreatic cancer patients visit their GP three times or more before
being referred to hospital for investigation. The National Cancer
Intelligence Network has found that half of all pancreatic cancer
patients are diagnosed only as a result of an emergency admission to
hospital. Patients diagnosed via this route have far lower one-year
survival rates—only 9%, compared to 26% for patients
diagnosed as a result of GP referral. A 2012 survey of GPs found that
half said that they were not confident that they could identify the
signs and symptoms of possible pancreatic cancer in a patient.
Education and training are needed to give them enhanced skills and
tools in order to improve their ability to recognise and diagnose the
symptoms of conditions such as pancreatic cancer, and to help prevent
the sort of shuttling between GPs and a range of different secondary
care providers that some patients undergo before a firm diagnosis is
made. That needs to be a clear part of Health Education
England’s
brief.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000095">The aim
of this amendment, therefore, is simply to ensure that such a
responsibility is formally included among matters to which Health
Education England must have regard. It would require it specifically to
recognise that time is of the essence in diseases such as pancreatic
cancer, and encourage HEE to identify, share and promote best practice
in achieving earlier diagnosis. It might, for example, lead to
initiatives such as conducting case reviews with experts from the Royal
College of General Practitioners to determine why cases identified
through emergency admission could not have been diagnosed earlier. I
hope that such initiatives would help to close the gap between the UK
and other leading countries that do significantly better in terms of
survival rates and other outcomes.</hs_para>

Patel:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to support the amendment in the
name of the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare. He is extremely knowledgeable
about issues relating to pancreatic cancer. While the principles of
early diagnosis and related outcomes are important for all diseases,
this is particularly so for cancers and especially for certain cancers,
such as pancreatic cancer. I have spoken before in this House about how
two members of my family—my mother and my
mother-in-law—both died of pancreatic cancer. Emphasising the
need for early diagnosis of any disease is important in the training of
doctors and
nurses.</hs_para>

Wheeler (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, we very much welcome this
important group of amendments. If one reads back over the debates on
the Bill in Committee, there can be little doubt that the provisions
for HEE and LETBs have been considerably strengthened and improved by
your Lordships’ detailed scrutiny and deliberations. These
amendments consolidate that work.</hs_para>

encouraged by the progress that HEE has been making under the
leadership of Sir Keith Pearson. The website demonstrates
this, and the HEE leadership team has been highly visible at
conferences and forums, setting out its proposed strategic priorities
and consulting on the way forward. In particular, HEE seems to have
taken up the key message that, in educating and training staff for NHS
and public health, it must have a strategic understanding of the
workforce requirements across the boundaries of health and social care
and of the need for staff to work in an integrated way. This has been a
major concern. I was pleased, for example, to hear the HEE medical
director, Wendy Reid, emphasise this at a recent Westminster Health
Forum workforce conference that I chaired.</hs_para>

strengthen the role of LETBs by emphasising that HEE duties under
Clause 89 to ensure that quality improvement in education and training,
promotion of research—as the Minister has stated—and the
NHS Constitution all apply to LETBs. This is an important provision and
reflects concerns expressed in Committee that LETBs must pay attention
to the maintenance of standards and quality in education and training,
as well as ensuring that sufficient numbers of staff are trained
locally. This was a point made by my noble friend Lord Turnberg and
which the Minister addressed earlier.</hs_para>

representation, we join other noble Lords in expressing our relief at
the government amendments, which ensure that people with clinical
expertise are appointed to both bodies. This was a serious omission and
its inclusion now greatly strengthens the Bill, as does the
Government’s commitments that regulations will place a specific
requirement on HEE and LETBs to include a nurse and a doctor. It is
particularly important, as my noble friend Lord Hunt underlined in
Committee, for the people in the driving seat on education and training
requirements, standards and future needs at local level 
<?notus-xml column=850?>to be those who provide the services. HEE and LETBs must understand the
pressures that the service is under in relation to staffing and to
ensuring that education and training is flexible and responsive to the
rapidly changing face and needs of health and social care. The
implementation of the Francis recommendations for a lay patient
representative on the HEE board and LETBs is also a key change to the
Bill, which we strongly welcome and which will only enhance the work
and effectiveness of those bodies.</hs_para>

of HEE as we are, it is hard to see in HEE work to date a clear
strategy for developing the vital cadre of NHS managers that is needed
to lead the NHS in the coming months and decades. There was a strong
concern about this in Committee and the need for close working with HEE
and the NHS Leadership Academy was acknowledged by the Minister. The
Joint Committee wanted to see a statutory commitment for HEE to work in
partnership with the academy, to ensure that managers in training work
alongside their clinical colleagues and to increase the number of
managers in the future who have clinical experience. Does the Minister
not agree that this needs to be an explicit, upfront priority for HEE,
which translates through to the work of LETBs? How will the Government
ensure that this vital issue is
addressed?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000104"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13102134000791" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000791">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I turn first to the amendment in the name
of the noble Lord, Lord Aberdare. He has, of course, raised a very
important matter. I think that it would be too ambitious for me to
offer him complete comfort on this issue at the Dispatch Box, but I
hope that I can give him some. It is essential that patients have their
conditions diagnosed promptly and effectively. Both Health Education
England and the other responsible bodies, such as the professional
regulators and royal colleges that are involved in setting the
standards and content of education and training, must work together to
ensure that the latest best practice is followed to deliver the best
possible outcomes for patients. That is fundamental.</hs_para>

reassure the noble Lord that in delivering its education and training
functions, Health Education England will be very focused on doing so in
a manner that supports the efficient delivery of NHS and public health
services and the achievement of the best possible outcomes for
patients. Health Education England has a clear duty in Clause 89 to
exercise its education and training functions with a view to securing
continuous improvement in the quality of health services. Those are not
idle words; they are
significant.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000106">It
is also important to remember that the NHS constitution includes
pledges on access to NHS services, including the right to access
services within maximum waiting times. The Government are clear that
bodies in the new health system must support the NHS constitution,
which is why in Clause 89 there is a clear duty for Health Education
England to promote the NHS
constitution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000107">Finally,
the list in Clause 91 of matters that Health Education England must
have regard to includes the Government’s mandate to NHS England.
I reassure the noble Lord in that context that the mandate already
contains an explicit objective for NHS England to make progress in
supporting the earlier diagnosis of 
<?notus-xml column=851?>illness as part of preventing people from dying prematurely. I
acknowledge that this is a very important matter. I hope that for the
reasons I have set out the noble Lord will feel somewhat comforted and
reassured, at least enough not to press his amendment. I have no doubt
that this is a debate that we will continue to have at reasonably
regular intervals.</hs_para>

Lady Wheeler, asked what role Health Education England will play in
developing NHS managers and whether it should be a priority for it.
Health Education England is working closely with the Leadership Academy

Health Education England’s

research, thereby maximising the health benefits for patients and the
public from research undertaken and thus maximising the return on our
investment in research. Amendment 166 makes it explicit that the Health
Research Authority’s objective of facilitating the conduct of
safe and ethical research includes promoting transparency in research.
Amendment 167 lists some of the ways in which the HRA must promote
transparency.</hs_para>

health authority is already making great strides in promoting
transparency in research. The Health Research Authority published an
action plan in May 2013, which received widespread support from a range
of stakeholders including researchers, research sponsors, funders,
professional bodies, stakeholders and members of the public with an
interest in transparent research. Since 30 September, registration of
clinical trials in a publicly accessible database has been a condition
of favourable ethical approval from a research ethics

ensure that the Health Research Authority continues to promote greater
transparency in research when it becomes a non-departmental public

participate in research that research is not duplicated unnecessarily

promoting transparency in research is specifically included within its
objective under Amendment 166, the Government would expect that the
annual report would cover the authority’s measures to meet this
section of its objective.

those made with the Academy of Medical Sciences, Cancer Research UK and
the Wellcome Trust. On behalf of all those organisations, I can say how
much we welcome these amendments and the way in which the HRA has so
quickly become embedded into the research psyche. The work that it is
doing ensures that on each of the major obstacles—of which
ethics was the first, particularly in local ethics committees, but
going right through to the regulation that it is starting to
streamline, particularly with the Human Tissue Authority—we are
really seeing a march forward. Frankly, the progress that has been made

HRA itself is concerned that expectation about transparency could get
ahead of itself. For instance, on the provision of data and tissue, the
research authority itself does not in fact have access to or grant
permission for any tissue or data that is in the possession of
researchers themselves. I hope that that does not become a blind
expectation. Looking at the first of the ethical
requirements—paragraph (a) in Amendment 167 on the need for
registration of research—while we welcome the announcement that
ethics approval for 
<?notus-xml column=854?>clinical trials will be conditional on trial regulation, the
HRA’s remit extends beyond clinical trials to include all forms
of research, including that with human participants. There is clearly
no expectation or mechanism by which all research should be registered,
so this requirement as tabled is currently not feasible or
proportionate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:46:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

indicated that it is giving further consideration to the registration
of other studies, and I wonder whether the Minister—when this
Bill goes back to the Commons, which is probably the most appropriate
time—could suggest an alteration. Instead of saying, “the
registration of research”, it perhaps should read, “the
registration of clinical

(c) on the provision of access to data, we again support the emphasis

therefore, whether the words “appropriate access” would

Kn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:49:03"></hs_TimeCode>aresborough,
just said. All of the research councils and charities support these
amendments. There are the caveats to which he referred, particularly
related to clinical trials and data. There is another important issue
about the summary given at the conclusion of the research, which not
only has to protect the confidentiality of the patients but also needs
to be brief, because otherwise it is too cumbersome. On the whole,

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></hs_speaker> I also agree with the view
that these are important headings. The precise detail has been
mentioned by the noble Lord. Regarding paragraph (c) of Amendment 167,
I think that access to the data is quite important although it requires
consideration. It is important that the experiment or trial can be
repeated. One of the difficulties in the past has sometimes been the
announcement of research findings. When those in the same area tried to
find out exactly what the findings were based on, there was some
difficulty in repeating the experiment and 
<?notus-xml column=855?>occasionally there was something seriously wrong with the research.
Therefore, access to the data certainly has to be kept in view if one
is going to have proper transparency. However, I accept that, like
paragraph (c) of Amendment 167 and the other paragraphs, it
requires an amount of restriction in certain
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Wheeler:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I welcome the
Government’s decision in Amendment 167 to support the
recommendation of the Joint Committee on promoting transparency in
research and ensuring full publication of the results of research
consistent with patient confidentiality. It is right that this should
be a statutory objective of the Health Research Authority. The
arguments in support of this at the Committee stage from noble Lords
were very compelling and, since then, have been strongly reinforced by
the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee report into
clinical trials and, indeed, the strategy and ongoing work undertaken
by HRA itself.</hs_para>

HRA’s September announcement requiring registration of clinical
trials in a publicly accessible database as a condition of ethical
acceptance—taking up a longstanding recommendation of the
Association of Medical Research Charities—recognises the
overwhelming support for this agenda. The HRA has much to do in the
coming months to develop its guidance into practical measures, but the
Bill now gives clear and explicit direction to its work. The HRA has
stressed that it expects the vast majority of researchers, sponsors and
funders to embrace the plans to realise greater openness, responsible
data sharing and publication of all results, and this is very welcome
news.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000127">It is so
important for patients and the public to have confidence that the
research they have been involved in will be used in the best way to
improve understanding and health outcomes for the groups involved.
Improved transparency is vital if more patients are to be encouraged to
become involved in clinical research—one of the key ambitions of
AMRC’s excellent vision for research in the NHS. The noble Lord,
Lord Willis, referred to reservations. I was going to raise them and I
am glad he did. I look forward to the Minister’s response. He
may need to write to us in detail about those reservations and his
response to that, or there might be a need for some small rewording of

that the HRA is strongly committed to working with other bodies to
overcome the barriers to transparency and create
a culture of openness. Changing culture is, however, a tough call in
the NHS. We also know from the AMRC research survey covering
both doctors and nurses that we have a long way to go to get NHS staff
to take part in research in the first place, let alone sign up to the
transparency agenda. GPs are an important gateway for getting patients
involved in research. However, although a majority of GPs surveyed
believed it very important for the NHS to support research and treat
for their patients, only 32% of those surveyed felt it was very
important for them to be personally involved. Will the Government
ensure that HRA and HEE work closely on this very important issue of
buy-in to research and transparency by NHS staff? How will they ensure

shall try to cover the questions raised. Anything I do not cover, I
undertake to answer in a letter. My noble friend Lord Willis asked a
number of questions about how he should interpret the provisions in
Amendment 167 in particular. Incidentally, it is important to point out
that the way Amendment 167 is framed means that the HRA may do other
things to promote transparency and research, not just the things that
are listed in the amendment. The HRA should do what is set out in
paragraphs (a) to (e), but it is not an exclusive
list<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:55:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000130">My
noble friend asked me whether we should not be talking about
registration of clinical trials instead of research. The amendment
requires the HRA to promote the registration of research because we
want to encourage transparency in all health and social care research.
Greater knowledge about what research is under way or has already been
undertaken is essential, so that new research can build on it,
minimising the risks, intrusions and burdens for patients. We think
that that applies to all research, not just clinical
trials<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:55:44"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment requires the HRA to promote registration of research; it does
not create a requirement for all research to be registered. I hope that

delivering its objective of facilitating safe and ethical research, I
would expect the HRA to take into account what databases are available

regards access to tissues, my noble friend made a good point. Human
tissue is a valuable resource for research. Disposal should be a last
resort. Making tissue available at the end of a study allows other
researchers to make use of material already collected. Maximising
potential for research from tissue collected helps to reduce the risks,
burdens and intrusions placed on people by minimising the need to
collect further tissue. Making tissue available at the end of a
research study might involve the tissue being transferred to an
appropriately licensed tissue bank, for example. We recognise that
tissue has a limited life, and, through quality and assurance systems,
tissue that should be disposed of is identified by either the tissue

arrangements for claiming and payment of the personal independence

payment arrangements for universal credit. Of course, these regulations
are only one set of a raft of regulations that we have considered
concerning universal credit and other benefit changes. Some may 
<?notus-xml column=859?>be a distant memory in terms of the legislative process, but they are a

the September NAO report uncovered the truth, describing how the Major
Projects Authority raised concerns about the DWP having no detailed
blueprint and transition plan for universal credit, which must
therefore be reset. It recites that the Government will not introduce
universal credit to all new out-of-work claimants nationally from
October 2013, but will add a further six pathfinder sites this month.
The NAO report emphasises that the pathfinder systems have limited
function and do not allow claimants to change details of their
circumstances online, as was originally intended. The department does
not yet know the extent to which the new IT systems will support
national rollout. In its October 2011 business case, the DWP expected
the universal credit caseload to reach 1.1 million by April
2014; that reduced to 184,000 in the December 2012 business case. What
is it now? Can the Minister tell us when the Government will set out a
detailed plan for the full rollout of universal

a time when some of the poorest families in the land are being forced
into debt by the bedroom tax and other measures, it is a scandal that
the Government are writing off tens of billions of pounds of wasted
expenditure because of their incompetent management of the universal
credit programme. It is against this backdrop—where the
department has delayed rolling out universal credit to claimants, has
had weak control of the programme, is not achieving value for money,
has been overoptimistic about timescales and has demonstrated lack of
openness about progress—that we are obliged to return to some of
the basic architecture of the scheme, to challenge whether it, too, has
lacked the rigour of full analysis and, in particular, whether some of
the protections against the worst impact of monthly payments are fit
for
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000143">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:05:32"></hs_TimeCode>
cannot yet look to the April pathfinders for help as their scope is
very narrow, covering where universal credit is applied to those who
are single, are without children, are not claiming disability benefits,
do not have caring responsibilities and are not entitled to housing
support, but have a bank account and national insurance number.
Clearly, these pathfinders will not tell us much about the impact of
universal credit on low-income families and those who rent. The
characteristics of those admitted to the further October pathfinders
are not clear. Perhaps the Minister will tell us what those
characteristics are and especially whether they will involve those who
rent their homes. If not, at what point will universal credit be
applied to those that do?
So<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:06:13"></hs_TimeCode> far as
monthly payments are concerned, has the payments exception policy been

substantive issues we raise tonight are not new—we raised them
throughout our deliberations on the Welfare Reform Bill, and the
Minister will doubtless hear from noble Lords with the same force and
passion as was evident then. As our Motion sets out, our concerns are
about the impact of monthly payments of universal credit on low-income
families and about putting the clock back to the days where support for
children did not go directly to the main carer and where the default
position of rent support going directly to tenants increased the
prospect of poor families losing their homes. We know that the
justification for making monthly payments direct to claimants is that
it will encourage personal budgetary responsibility and mirror the
world of work. This is despite the fact that only half of those earning
less than £10,000 a year are paid on a monthly basis. Life on
benefits is not a comfortable existence for anyone who has tried
it—and not just for a week here or there. There is the grinding
awfulness of the poverty it brings, where there is simply no margin for
error and where hanging on for the next payment date and juggling the
cash to meet the next most pressing bill is the routine stuff of life.
The temptation is to skip a payment here to meet a pressing payment
there and risk becoming trapped in a cycle of
debt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000145">How<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:08:15"></hs_TimeCode>

research outlined the budgeting methods that many households adopt to
see them through, which inevitably involve debt of some sort, whether
formal or informal. The households that it researched cited, in
particular, the fact that more frequent payments served as a method to
help them ration their income and restrain their spending. They feared
that the larger payment might be spent too quickly, given the competing
demands on their low
income<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:08:42"></hs_TimeCode>. On the
exceptions policy, the Social Market Foundation expressed concern that

Action Group focused on the “rough justice” that can
ensue from monthly assessments where benefit claimants receive
increased entitlements but which disadvantage claimants whose
entitlement reduces. All of this is happening at a time when the
discretionary social fund has been abolished along with crisis loans,
community care grants and budgeting loans. They are to be replaced by
payments on account or short-term advances and local welfare provision
to be provided by local authorities. Short-term advances are much more
restricted in scope than crisis loans and are only payable to benefit
claimants in very tightly prescribed circumstances. As CPAG points out,
that will not cover situations where a person has no, or insufficient,
money to meet basic needs. Budgeting 
<?notus-xml column=861?>loans will continue to be payable to universal credit claimants, subject
to strict criteria, on a discretionary basis with no right of

for local provision, a recent Children’s Society report
identified that money given to local authorities to replace community
care grants and crisis loans is only a little over 50% of the
equivalent spending at 2010 levels. Hard-pressed local authorities are
in no position to make up any shortfall. Have any universal credit
claimants under the current pathfinders been eligible for support for
local welfare provision, short-term advances or budgeting loans, and

know that low-income families are poorly placed to cope with the
current economic challenges. Some 10 million low-income households are
in unsecured debt; three-quarters of those in the lowest income
quartile have no cash savings. The cost of living squeeze is not only
hitting the poorest, although it bears more heavily on them. Current
levels of inflation will mean that universal claimants endure a real
cut in their income at a time when energy bills are soaring and
childcare costs are rising at almost 6% a year.</hs_para>

For those who currently struggle to make their benefit receipt last
until the end of the fortnight, the temptation to resort to payday
lending will be enormous. For irresponsible payday lenders, the
temptation to exploit an expanded market created by monthly payments
will be irresistible, and with it the risk that continuous payment
agreements will drain bank accounts as soon as benefit payments arrive.
We applaud the work that the Minister is doing in encouraging the
expansion of credit unions, but note that he is on record as seeking to
restrict continuous payment agreements to accounts of benefit claimants
until utility bills and rent have been accounted for. Could we have an
update on that work? Will the Minister support the call that Ed
Miliband has made for a special levy on these payday lenders, so that
further moneys can be channelled into credit unions?</hs_para>

payments going directly to landlords, because those have all been
covered in their proposed alternative payment arrangements. As far as
it goes, that is to be welcomed, but it raises a number of issues about
how it will work in practice. The main concern is that this is a
centralised system. Jobcentre Plus will decide whether an individual

Lister of Burtersett (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, there are many
issues raised by the claims and payments regulations, but I plan to
focus on the two that I raised in our debates on the Bill itself:
monthly payments and payment into single accounts. These are lumped
together in the guidance on personal budgeting support in a way that is
not very helpful, because there are different issues at stake—a
point to which I will return. Nevertheless, some questions relate to
both matters: most fundamentally on both, the Government have rejected
the arguments made by many noble Lords for choice about payment
arrangements in favour of a convoluted system of personal budgeting
support, which I suspect is going to be pretty difficult and
staff-intensive to
administer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000156" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000156">The
clear injunction in the guidance that alternative payment arrangements
are not available through choice would appear to contradict the earlier
claim in the guidance that they would be claimant-centric—that
is, done with, rather than to, the claimant. While I am pleased that
the policy is no longer couched in the language of exceptions and
vulnerability, designed to make a claimant feel different, this still
appears to be the underlying philosophy.</hs_para>

in the argument that alternative payment arrangements should be
temporary, to avoid labelling claimants as financially incapable.
However, it is the Government who are in effect labelling them as such,
by requiring claimants, who may be managing as well as can be expected,
to adapt to payment systems that might simply be inappropriate for
their 
<?notus-xml column=863?>circumstances. This determination to change claimants’ behaviour
smacks of the kind of social engineering that sits uneasily with both
traditional Conservative and liberal philosophy.</hs_para>

the Minister confirmed in a Written Answer, the problem with this is
that it requires claimants to withdraw the whole amount, and not part,
of each benefit payment at the same time, up to a limit of £600.
This is potentially a lot of cash to withdraw in one go and leaves the
claimant vulnerable to both robbery and temptation. Although it is
estimated that only about 60,000 working-age claimants will be paid in
this way, it is a cause for concern. Why is it not possible to draw

it not occurred to the noble Lord that there is a connection here? As
the demonstration projects show, many people on low incomes use
fortnightly or weekly budgeting strategies as a means of managing their

said earlier, the question of payment into a single account versus a

in cases of financial abuse or domestic violence. Can the
Minister confirm that they will not necessarily be

question and, even more importantly, the initial decision to make a
split payment? Will it be both partners, and if so, will it be
discussed separately or together, or will it be just the partner in
need of diversion? If the latter, what will the other partner be told
about the interview? How will advisers negotiate with gendered power

study of the implementation of JSA DB easement revealed a reluctance to
disclose domestic violence to advisers, a concern that was raised by
SSAC. This is likely to be the case here too. How will advisers detect
domestic abuse, particularly when it is not manifested physically?
Where a male partner uses the threat of abuse of various kinds to
control a female partner, it could well be kept hidden. What steps can
be taken to ensure that a split payment, which reduces the money paid
to the perpetrator, does not provoke further domestic violence? Will
the Minister indicate what training in financial abuse and domestic
violence is proposed for universal credit advisers? More generally,

things. It is about where the balance lies. Is it in devising, on the

told in the information with which we have been provided that claimants
will be referred to online, telephone or face-to-face support with
expert providers at a national or local level, depending on the issue.
I understand that this money advice has to be readily available but
will it be available to people locally? Will the people making
decisions on the back of the advice that people have been given be able
to take those decisions and treat people differently? There are
concerns about vulnerable people moving on to a monthly payment. It
matters that we as a Government are able through Jobcentre Plus to
manage the whole process in a local and flexible manner. That goes back

thought as to how the need to be flexible regarding who receives the

household? If the household makes a nomination, how will we be certain
that that is correctly the view of the whole household, given that

Lord Bishop of Ripon and Leeds:</Member></B> My Lords, I am very
grateful to the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, for bringing this matter to
our attention again, and for the three powerful speeches which we have
already heard. First, I want to emphasise my concern about that part of
the Motion which speaks of the way in which universal credit awards
paid in respect of children will not necessarily by default be paid to
the main carer of the children and the disproportionate impact this
will have on women. Through my work, I have become increasingly aware
of the mother’s crucial role in the sorts of situations that we
have been discussing over the past few minutes and indeed over the past
few years. The mother needs to have proper control of the money which
is coming for the benefit of the family and in respect of her children.
I hope that in our discussions and the way in which the regulations and
the whole universal credit system are worked out we shall be able to
pay attention to the mother’s role, which in many circumstances
is crucial when the whole family is under severe
stress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:41:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0002.htm#13102134000184">Secondly,
I share the concerns which have been expressed by all previous speakers
about the impact of the monthly payments system. It is already
beginning to make it more difficult to control the finances of the
family and, as the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, said, there is the danger
of opening the way for payday lenders. We are already seeing
considerable growth in the work of payday lenders. That in itself is
not yet 
<?notus-xml column=869?>due to universal credit but my fear is that universal credit will become
a factor as the monthly payment system comes into
being<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:42:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

particular detail of the regulations which fits in with the monthly
payment concerns but is also specific. Regulation 26 of Part 2 speaks
of the back-dating of universal credit and limiting that back-dating to
some very narrow categories. This contrasts with the present situation
for tax credits, which can be back-dated for up to 31 days so long as
the claimant meets the rule of entitlement throughout that
period.</hs_para>

raise that question for two reasons. One is that many people will
become eligible for universal credit at the birth of a new
child—a particularly difficult moment to be making your claim.
Secondly, the regulations acknowledge the possibility of the failure of
systems. However, it will be hard to prove that failure if a claim is
delayed or not made until three or four weeks after the claimant is
entitled to make it, especially if that reason involves the inability
of the claimant to access the system, whether due to a fault
in the system itself or due to the claimant’s online
skills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:43:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Minister to say to us is that one-month’s back-dating would be
legitimate without a particular reason needed for it. That would reduce
bureaucracy and would reduce the complexity of making claims. If he
cannot do that, then at least there should be a back-dating for
families who have become eligible for universal credit because they
have had a new child and are busy with the celebration of its birth.
That should happen without the requirement for “medical
evidence” to demonstrate the incapacity to claim. Not getting
online at the point when you are having a child seems to me to be a
self-evident reason for delay in making your claim. There are far more
important things to be doing on the day of the birth of your child, are
there

the Minister clarify the circumstances under which a claimant is

Hollis of Heigham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I will follow the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and Leeds in his point about going
online. First, I want to say, as others have said, that I very much
support universal credit and I am watching with wry horror now the
number of people being taken to court for failure to pay the £2
or £2.50 owed on their council tax bills by virtue of the
localised council tax system. One wishes that some other parts of the
Government had listened to some of the debates that we had in Grand
Committee on that subject.</hs_para>

others, I am concerned about where some of the cuts are going to fall.
In particular, I remain worried by the disincentives to second earners,
usually 
<?notus-xml column=870?>women, in couples whom we want to encourage to go back into the labour
market. We increasingly make it less financially worth while that they
should do so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:46:42"></hs_TimeCode>. I

concern has been not just the payment problems, which my noble friends
Lady Lister and Lord McKenzie have mentioned, but the assessment issues
associated with them. Perhaps I may remind the noble Lord that, as far
as I am aware, most of the pathway schemes and experiments so far have
been with younger people in urban areas. They are more likely to be
IT-literate and more likely to have access to IT facilities.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:47:15"></hs_TimeCode> am chair of a
housing association that runs across a rural county. A substantial
proportion of my older tenants have no access to WPs. Of those who do,
only 14%, when I had my last tenants’ conference, actually used
them for financial matters, such as the handling of bank accounts and
so on. In order for those other tenants to be able to claim universal
credit, they have somehow to access a WP.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:48:05"></hs_TimeCode> have four
centres across the county of Norfolk—in King’s Lynn,
Norwich, Dereham and Great Yarmouth, and possibly North Walsham, but we
will see—in which we will set up local offices. There will be
terminals and there will be people to guide people through their
applications. That is fine, except that people may have to go on
something like a 15-mile bus ride to make their application. Because it
is a paperless system, they will not be able to correct any mistakes
online. They will not be able to answer any queries about the
information. They will not be able to follow it up because they will be
back home.</hs_para>

tried to see whether there was any way I could bring IT facilities to
people in that situation. I considered, for example, whether I could
provide terminals in people’s homes inexpensively, possibly
through a leasing system. Yes, I could, except that those same tenants
cannot afford to pay the broadband or dial-up charges. So I cannot put
them online in their homes. I then thought about whether I could in
some way get them smartphones to give them some online access. No, they
cannot afford the charges of smartphones. So they cannot afford to go
online. Indeed, in some parts of Norfolk you cannot even get access to
broadband, but that is another matter. We have only 90% coverage, so
sod the 10%. No doubt they will get their money somehow. None the less,
in large parts of Norfolk, there will be a large number of people who
have no access to terminals in their home or to a smartphone, who have
no computer skills, who have to go into a local centre, and who, if any
mistake is made, will have no ability to correct
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T20:49:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

assessment will be only once a year or once every six months and
therefore this is a minor problem compared with the payment issues. I
hope that is right, but one of the crucial reasons why the old CSA
computer toppled over, which was at the core of the failure of the CSA
to deliver the service it should have delivered, was that half of all
lone parents had more than 12 changes of circumstances in a year. They
were largely associated with changes in childcare at each holiday
period because it did not fit the school’s working time or the
mother’s work patterns. You can get real-time information from
an employer about income, but you cannot get real-time information in 
<?notus-xml column=871?>the same way for ever-changing childcare bills. That means that that
lone parent or that couple will have to reassess, reclaim and adjust
their UC online as it is going to be paperless. Will the Minister tell
me how I should respond to this? I have hundreds of tenants who at the
moment have no IT skills, no access to gaining them, although I am
trying to do crash courses where people are willing to take them, no
terminals at home, no ability to afford dial up if it were to exist and
no access to phones. How are they going to input the information they
need to input to get the money they are entitled to? I would be glad of
some help on this

Kirkwood of Kirkhope (LD):</Member></B> I shall make a short
contribution to this important debate. I am grateful to the noble Lord,
Lord McKenzie, for introducing it. Using a Motion of Regret is clunky,
but this is important. I shall start with a question about
parliamentary process. Things have changed since the old days. In my
experience of parliamentary change of this kind, Bills were much less
far reaching and were implemented over a much shorter timescale. After
the six-month period of purdah, Ministers could always explain the
unfolding of the regulations that flowed from the primary Act. We are
getting to a stage where we are paying more attention to guidance
rather than to statutory instruments. Statutory instruments are
becoming almost as skeletal as the primary legislation. Therefore, how
are parliamentarians able to keep up with what is going on,
particularly when this is at least a five-year implementation phase? I
think it would be a good trick if the Government could achieve it in a
five-year period.</hs_para>

The SSAC has done a remarkable job and I hope that the Minister will
continue to involve it. Although it does not have any statutory control
over guidance, if we get to the position where guidance is needed, such
as in the definition of what is vulnerable, and we cannot get that
clear with the stakeholders that the SSAC knows and works with so well,

like to thank everyone who has spoken today. I want to emphasise that I
listen very closely to what noble Lords say in this House and, without
shame, steal as many of the good ideas as I can. This is not just with
a long nose, using SSAC, which has done an extraordinary job in helping
us to sort out not just the regulations on universal credit but a lot
of other things, too. I shall describe some of what we have been doing
since we went through that committee and some of the ideas that we
debated together then which I have tried to use and
embed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000207">I
hope also to allay some of the concerns expressed by noble Lords. When
one has a new canvas, as we have here, one can worry about absolutely
everything. It is important to be alert to the issues that one needs to
worry about and then, as the evidence comes in, to see what the real
problems are and to be able to move. We have laid out this evening a
range of possible things that could go wrong. Some of them may go wrong
and we will need to do something about them. Others may not emerge as
issues, so it is important that we are watching this like a
hawk.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102134000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000353">9

this opportunity to remind noble Lords of what we are trying to do with
universal credit. It is replacing not a good system but a flawed
system, which has a lot of problems. It is designed so that claimants
can better understand what their benefit is and so that their
incentives are improved. It is dynamic and responsive and it influences
claimant behaviour—we make no apology for that—by helping
to ensure that they can see that work is always a better option. It
brings together in-work and out-of-work support into a single payment,
in a way that is not the case today. That is at the heart of what we
are doing to break down the barriers that stop many people taking work
in the first
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000209" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000209">I will
first touch on where we are with universal credit. A lot has been said
about it in the press and by the National Audit Office,
which the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, talked about. The National Audit
Office said that further work and investment were required for full
rollout; we know and acknowledge that. We are doing a pathfinder, which
people are able to do online. Many more people than we
expected as a proportion have done so, although noble Lords will not be
slow to point out that they are a particular type of people. We have
accepted the recommendations of the Major Projects Authority to review
the IT and make it more flexible and secure, and we are looking very
hard with GDS—the Government Digital Service—to see how
we can get best value out of
IT.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000210">I need to
clarify a point that has confused some people. When the NAO said that
there was no clear idea how the system would work, it is very clear
that it was not referring to the policy. We have done an enormous
amount of work—indeed, noble Lords in this Chamber have done a
lot of work—in making that clear. It was about the IT technology
underlying it; that is where the issues
are.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000211">We have a
pathfinder, which is up and working well. We go national this month. We
start in Hammersmith 
<?notus-xml column=874?>in a few days and we will go forward with a further five jobcentres in
the period up to next spring. Just as important as the pure universal
credit is the rollout of key elements of universal credit, so every
jobcentre will be using the claimant commitment by next spring. We are
installing internet-access devices in 6,000 jobcentres across the
country, which may be a solution to the problems that the noble
Baroness, Lady Hollis, talked about. We have 11 in-work progression
pilots up and running, which test ways to help claimants on low incomes

are right to go for a phased rollout to ensure that we test universal

complete our rollout plans and we remain committed to delivering UC

noble friend Lord Kirkwood said about what was more important. I am not
allowed to say that timetables are not important, because they are, but
it is far more important that we do this safely and reliably and do not
cause the kind of problems that noble Lords are worrying about when
they think back to the CSA, for instance. We will make another

partnerships between the Local Government Association, Scottish local

authority representatives generally and third sector groups. We are
really beginning to develop a plan and will issue the next iteration of

we need to trial and test—detailed trialling and testing of all
these different elements about which noble Lords are rightly concerned.

we are encouraging claimants to take responsibility for their financial
affairs, particularly in relation to those issues that act as a barrier
to work. About 75% of people have their wages paid monthly and that
figure has been rising steadily over the past decade. In addition, more
than 60% of those earning more than £15,000 per
annum—which is where the majority of the UC working population
sits—are now paid monthly. So this is about building a system
for the majority with, as my noble friend indicated, support for those
who need help to manage it. As noble Lords have pointed out, many
claimants are currently paid multiple benefits: different amounts,
different paydays, different frequencies, and that makes budgeting
difficult. They may have learnt how to manage round it, but the cost of
it is often the poverty
premium.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000220">The
poverty premium is, essentially, paying more for essential goods and
services because you are unable to commit to monthly direct payments or
take advantage of offers and discounts. Let me give some examples. Some
energy companies offer a discount of up to £100 for customers
who pay using a monthly direct debit plan and mobile phone bills can be
up to three times more expensive if using a pay-as-you-go plan.
Financially excluded households also pay more for essential household
goods because they are less likely to have savings to cover unexpected
spending or be able to access affordable credit. As a simple example,
the price of a washing machine shows that I could pay £317 if I
bought it today from a major online retailer but if I went instead to a
weekly hire-purchase scheme I would end up paying more than
£1,000 for exactly the same
product.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000221">The
poverty premium takes money away from the people who can least afford
it. I know that the noble Baroness, Lady Lister, worries about the
poverty premium as much as any other factor for these groups of people.
If we can get it right, that is one of the most important and
attractive features of paying people a proper amount of money monthly.
It will help them change how they pay their bills; it will allow them
cheaper tariffs for gas, electricity, mobile phones and other bills; it
will help them develop financial capability and confidence and it will
allow low-income households to build or improve credit ratings and gain
access to affordable credit.</hs_para>

responsible for children and housing payments are supported where
necessary. Couples will decide which bank account their universal 
<?notus-xml column=876?>credit payment will be paid to but, in cases where couples cannot
decide, we will make payment either to the main child-carer or, if
there are no children, to the person responsible for paying the bills.

more frequent payments. I remind noble Lords that child benefit will

budgeting pressures and housing, I will emphasise why this is
important. Monthly housing costs paid direct to claimants are a key to
building up financial capability. Clearly, we cannot have a situation
in which a barrier for someone moving from being out of work to being
in work is the fact that they have to transform the way in which they
pay their landlord. For claimants who genuinely cannot manage to pay
their rent, we can make managed payments of rent to landlords to
protect the tenancy. At the start of a claim, we will review the
claimant’s financial capability, and we will look at it again if
the claimant accumulates one month’s rent arrears as a result of
persistent underpayment. At that stage, we will make an early
intervention, reviewing what financial support they may need and making
managed payments of rent to their landlord if necessary. If the
claimant goes on to accumulate two month’s rent arrears, we will
automatically pay the housing-cost element direct to the landlord, and
cover the arrears through deductions from the universal
credit.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000227">The
noble Baroness, Lady Lister, referred to the way in which the payments
were made. A budgeting advance can be made, but clearly it is just an
advance; it is not a question of getting half early and
another half 
<?notus-xml column=877?>at the end of the month. It is half early, the full amount at
the end of the month and then a very gradual repayment of the early
advance. Therefore, the position is not the one that the noble Baroness
envisaged.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000228">On
part-payment, we will have the ability to issue universal credit

this will not be the right method of payment for the majority of

already.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000229" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000229">On
demonstration projects, my noble friend Lord German made the point that
the average collection rate was 94%, and that the rates were improving.
I believe that most claimants will be able to manage their household

protect the household’s tenancy and the landlord’s
financial
position.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102134000230" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-0003.htm#13102134000230">We
recognise the importance of safeguarding the welfare of tenant
claimants who have incurred debts. Therefore, under universal credit,
there will be a co-ordinated approach to making deductions, aimed at
protecting the most vulnerable from financial hardship. Safeguards have
been introduced, such as an overall maximum amount that can be deducted
from someone’s universal credit each month, which equates to 40%
of their standard allowance. This rate aligns with the
amount that a claimant could receive under a hardship payment. If you
look at the proportion of a standard payment, that boils down to a
typical family of two parents and two children living in the rented
sector seeing their overall payment decrease by a maximum of
13%.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_21_PT_1/1F5FEF12435F6D7AEBDDD6DBD7039B553ADDF406" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 October 2013">Monday,

universal credit was when we went on holiday and the rather rude

the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood—we do not want
this to be rushed; we want it to be right. As I understand it, some of

talked about arrears in the demonstration project. As I understand it,
these are demonstration projects about monthly payment of housing

universal credit because alongside the housing benefit payment there is
the usual sequence of other payments. Now, how much one learns from

amendments to this important Bill are about the problems of
dysfunctional families and disadvantaged children. Although this Bill
suggests many important ways in which current practice could be
improved—and I support many of the changes in the Bill—it
does not address the possibility of reducing the number of
dysfunctional families and disadvantaged children in our society. It
fails to address prevention. Prevention could and, in my view, should
be an important part of this Bill. My Amendments 56 and 57 explore just
two of the many possible ways in which we could reduce the number of
dysfunctional families and disadvantaged children in our society in the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310218000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000005">Amendment
56 is about defining the duties of a parent. We all know, alas, that
too many young people become parents without thinking about what their
child will need of them or what parenting will involve for their own
future life and lifestyle. We all know that in good schools PSHE and
SRE teachers do their best to teach young people these things but they
need more help than we are giving them. The relevant law on this is the

to tackling dysfunction. His amendment takes note of supporting the

only once the child gets into trouble. Frankly, that is too late. Early
intervention should start with parents but they are sometimes
bewildered. Perhaps the Minister or somebody else knows how many
parenthood schemes exist in this country to teach parents or future
parents to be better parents, not when the child gets into trouble but
as an education scheme for all parents. After all, not everybody has a
super nanny, as in the television programme of that name, to iron out
horrendous problems once the family has dug itself into a hole. Parents
are often not well supported. I worry about austerity measures which
hit poor families hardest and about child poverty policies, which may

brought up by their mothers on their own, and how guilty they felt
about the burden they had put on them. The honourable Andrea Leadsom

Armstrong of Hill Top (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support the
overall aim of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, that the Bill should
address the importance of engaging people in what parenting means
before they become parents. When I was Minister for Social Exclusion I
had the enormous privilege to have a look at some of the evidence-based
programmes around parenting. I recommend that Ministers have a look at
a programme called Teens and Toddlers, which I encouraged local
authorities to adopt. Young people identified by their teachers as
probably vulnerable to becoming young parents were put on to this
programme, which lasted for about 12 weeks. The youngsters thought that
the programme was quite good because they got out of school for one day
a week. In the morning they would care for a particular child in an
early-years setting, week in and week out, so they got to know that
child and discovered that the process was not as simple and
straightforward as it might have been made out to be. They found that
some children were really quite difficult, even at that very early age.
I met two or three groups of young people who were engaged in the
programme, as well as some who had done it some years before, and they
said things like, “It was very clear that no one else spent any
time with this child, so the child never looked at me for
weeks”. They learnt an enormous amount. They learnt that
children need feeding regularly, that they make a noise, and that they
are expensive. After the session with the children in the early years
setting, there would be group sessions with their peers and the tutors
who were running the course. They would explore what it was all about.
Many of them had never been parented; they had been parented by
siblings. In particular, some of the young women involved had to look
after their own young
siblings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:45:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

fascinated by the sessions. I met some of the young people who had been
on the first course to be run in this country around eight years
earlier, in the London Borough of Greenwich. Of the dozen young people
who had been on that course, not a single one had become a parent. They
all said, “We have learnt so much from doing the course and we
knew that we had choices. We made the choice to be sensible and that we
would not have a child early”. I remember one young black woman
saying, “I will be 24 before I have a child because I want that
child to succeed and I want a life as well”. She had learnt that
from this programme, and it is exactly what the Government should be
encouraging. Young people should learn about the seriousness of being a
parent. Yes, it can be joyful, but it is expensive, it restricts what
you can do, and it takes real knowledge and understanding of what you
are doing to be a good parent. When we do not take that seriously, we
are colluding with the 
<?notus-xml column=289?>issue of children being born into dysfunctional families. We know what
can be done, so it is about time that we took the steps to ensure that
things are done so that fewer children are born into families where the

Howe of Idlicote (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am particularly glad
that the debate on the probing amendment moved by my noble friend Lord
Northbourne did not take place at the end of the Committee session last
Wednesday. We are being allowed to take a much deeper look at this
important area. Reducing the number of dysfunctional children needs a
lot more attention paid to it. On prevention through early
intervention, Frank Field and Graham Allen have said it all. Parental
responsibilities are enormous, and children need to feel safe and
loved, as my noble friend rightly

that today families are beginning to share the bringing up of children.
Fathers are often much more practically involved in their
children’s upbringing. It used to be the case that mother would
say, “You wait until your father gets home. He’ll deal
with you”. Not any more. Fathers themselves gain great enjoyment
from this sort of relationship, and that is very pleasing to see. Young
people have to learn about what is needed to bring up today’s
children. They have to know about the substantial dangers that children
have to face as they grow up. There are new communications techniques
and things that can be found on the internet. Also, with fellow
children at school, there are things like sexting and sending pictures
that no one would want to have shown

I very much support this amendment. I have been an officer to the
Parents and Families Group for a long time. The noble Lord, Lord
Northbourne, is chairman of the group. I fully agree with the remarks
made by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, on the importance of family
relationships on how children emerge. As the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said, it seems absurd that the only law we
have in this country relates to property and not to responsibilities.
In all conscience, we are keeping responsibilities on local
authorities, on schools and on all kinds of people in this Bill.
However, to some extent, those who have prime responsibility for
bringing up children should be made to recognise that they have such
responsibilities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T15:51:01"></hs_TimeCode>.

plethora of legislation. I have worked in this field and I could list
it but I will not do so because it would take all the time in the

the name of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is how vital it is that
we should do what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, has been saying for
so long. We still are not doing well in terms of PSHE and helping young
people and children to understand as early as possible what it is to be
a parent, to be part of a community and all that you have to do as a

which we need to face if we are to deal with some of these issues. The
young men I deal with, and I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord

attractions of his proposal that we should get this

lateral benefit for people in custody. Some of them benefit from
instruction in parenting, but many do not. If parents’ duties
were more codified, it might enable better structure to be given to
parenting instruction, which seems to be a crucial part not just of
education in custody, but of education in school as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310218000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000027"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Benjamin" PimsId="5763" UID="1310218000098" xid="2043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000098">Baroness

within families, helping them fully to understand the importance of
parenting and family bonding, and about relationships and

levels. We know that support services for couples at key transition
points such as moving in together, getting married and becoming

relationship support services at these important transition points. We

custody, on which the Children Act 1989 was based, indicated that the
meaning of “parental responsibility” would need to change
according to changed circumstances. This is not in my brief, but I am

clause may cause difficulties as it may be interpreted to mean that the
duties of parents are limited only to the factors set out in the

responsibility for protecting and maintaining a child is considered to
be among the most important components of parental responsibility. So,

are not persuaded that a more detailed statutory definition would serve
a useful purpose, and no evidence has been put forward that
demonstrates that to be the case. However, what has become clear in
this debate is that early and focused intervention on specific problems
works and should be supported.</hs_para>

to the Minister. I am not trying to lay this thing down in law as
something to punish people for. I am trying to get a clear statement
that can act as a guide. For instance, suppose that
the Minister were standing up in front of a class of 20
teenage boys and said to them, “One of the things you’ve
got to realise is that you mustn’t have sex without a
condom”. The boys would say, “Why shouldn’t I? If
I have a baby, what does it matter? It’s her job, isn’t
it, to make sure that she doesn’t get pregnant?”. That is
about the state of many young people’s understanding of this
matter, and we should do something to support the teachers who are
trying to put across a rather more sensible message. If possible, I

Northbourne:</Member></B> My Lords, in a child’s life there are
two periods of rapid brain development. The first is during the first
three years of life, while the second is around the time of puberty, in
the early teens. That  is scientific fact. If we want to reduce
the number of dysfunctional families and disadvantaged children in our
society, we must do more to prepare young people in their early teens
for their future task of forming and bringing up a family. Many young
people will learn these skills from their own family, of course, but
sadly others will not be so lucky.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="1310218000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000043">Statistics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:11:25"></hs_TimeCode>
suggest that only 50% of children born today will be living with both
parents by the time that they are 16. The statistics show that
lone-parent households are 2.5 times more likely to be in poverty than
couple families, and today in the UK there are over 3 million growing
up in lone-parent families. I have one more statistic: in a recent
report, the Centre for Social Justice found that 89% of people agreed
that if we wanted to have any hope of mending what they called our
“broken society”, family and parenting was where we had
to start. The role of schools in developing personal, social and
emotional skills must therefore remain very important for many young
people today; I think we all agree on that. A great deal of this has
been said already, so I shall try to skip through it.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=295?><hs_para UID="1310218000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000044">Preparation for family
formation and parenthood is not just about knowing
the facts of life; it is about recognising that having a child is a
serious responsibility; about learning to be the kind of person that
you want to be to your child and that your child will need; and about
requiring the interpersonal and emotional skills that your child will
want in order to create a secure home and for the children to develop
in a healthy
manner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:12:53"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
an important point: young people in puberty, or around that time, are
keen to find out more about what it means to be an adult, what adult
life is about and what the challenges and opportunities of adult life
are. It creates an opportunity for schools to help them, because they
are in school at that age. In doing so, of course, schools must work
with parents. Schools can and often do have a huge influence on a
child’s personal and social development, particularly the soft
skills, which we seem to have forgotten in our education system but
which are so important, both for family formation and for the
workplace, and indeed in society as a whole.</hs_para>

course the best schools are already doing a wonderful job but, alas,
many schools are not doing that job well. Recent Ofsted reports make
grim reading. Far too many secondary schools are still treating
personal and social development as an unimportant subject, and there is
a chronic lack of well trained specialist PSHE and SRE teachers. The
Government’s policy today is—rightly, I suspect—to
give more freedom to schools to develop their own curriculums. Outside
the core curriculum, the Government will not prescribe a
school’s curriculum. This puts a lot more responsibility on the
schools themselves to get it right. In an area of learning as sensitive
and important as PSHE, it is essential that parents, Parliament and the
wider public should be able to know what each school is doing, what
their policies are and whether they are actively pursuing those
policies.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1310218000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000082">4.15

of your Lordships may say that schools already have an obligation to

I got the Library to make inquiries about six secondary schools around

details. Of those six, five made virtually no mention of PSHE or the
personal and social development programme. The sixth, which I am proud
to say was in Deal, my town, has done an absolutely brilliant job, with
six pages. So it can be done. I have brought this copy for the Minister

noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, for tabling this exciting amendment.
Amendment 231 in my name asks all schools to ensure that children are
educated and protected through school policies, pastoral care, linking
with outside agencies and the curriculum. It goes wider than that in
the name of the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, but is of a similar
tone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:30:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310218000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000052">The
reason for my amendment and, I think, for the amendment in the name of
the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, is that pupils, teachers, parents and
governors need clarity about what policy and practice is in a school.
Otherwise, how can they be clear about what it is and how do they know
how to operate? How do children know how to operate? For example, as
regards behavioural policy in a primary school, pupils know how to
behave because it is in the policy. Policy and practice should give
clarity and
security<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:31:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310218000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#1310218000053">We
have talked about the duties and responsibilities of raising children,
and the importance of enabling young people, in an ideal situation, to
learn about parenting long before they become parents, or perhaps later
if they are in difficulties such as those that the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, mentioned relating to the criminal justice system. I
remember seeing a young man in jail being taught how to read to a four
year-old with all the interaction that is necessary. It is never too
late but it is preferable for that to happen
earlier<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:31:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

with the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, in two instances. First,
education about social and emotional development and responsibilities
should happen before and after key stage 3. For a start, it should come
from parents to children but, when talking about schools, it should
happen from a young age through to when the child leaves. Schools
should develop a spiral of curriculum and pastoral care which matches
the age and stage of a child’s development. It should not be
just at a particular age, and I do not think that it is. The issue is
about a child’s right to an
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:32:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

think that the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, talked about the
importance of teacher training. That is right but it is not always
teachers who deliver personal, social and emotional education. I have
seen many excellent school nurses giving sessions in the classroom to
encourage pupils to think about issues around their own health. I have
seen first-aiders talk about issues around helping others to be safe. I
have even seen a teenage parent come into a class to talk about the
experience of having a baby at a young age, which was a quite dramatic
experience for the pupils
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:33:49"></hs_TimeCode>.
Therefore, I say yes to all this about personal and social health
education, and yes to policies and practice in schools being well
advertised. However, I should like to look at just those two issues

Lord Northbourne, and will link what  I am going to say to my

young offender institutions are to be classed as mainstream schools as

and in so doing I should declare an interest as vice-president of the
charity Relate. I am very supportive indeed of schools playing a full
role in preparing children for all aspects of life, and those must
include the importance of personal relationships, family relationships
and parenting responsibilities. From my experience of running an
organisation that helped to deliver relationship education in a large
number of schools, as the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said, it is not
always teachers who do the teaching in the classroom. I know of many
schools that ask experts in relationship matters to come in from
outside because they are trained to do this work. I recall seeing a
report from Ofsted which suggested that trained relationship
practitioners are more confident and better able to deal with some
aspects of relationship education, particularly the more intimate and
sexual issues. If teachers have not had the appropriate training,
teachers can feel a little less than confident about it. I wanted just

and have been shown to be extremely valuable not only to meet
challenges better, but also to maximise their potential academically.
Why else would some of our best fee-paying schools have extensive
programmes of such activities? They have them because they are aiming
to produce rounded individuals by developing these important aspects of
character and resilience. It is a great pity that the Government have
taken away much of the funding that schools had been provided with for
extended activities, as well as reducing the emphasis being placed by
the department and the current Secretary of State on these and other
extracurricular work. As the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, said, Ofsted
has highlighted the huge variation in provision, with much of it being
of very poor

amendment is so novel and neat is that it is not prescriptive. It
simply asks schools to discuss and debate these issues, and to review
them every year. That will involve a conversation with parents and with
the pupils themselves. They should then publish what they intend to
provide. It will not cost schools any money to do that, but it will put
this issue on the agenda and make it more transparent for parents and
pupils alike. I am therefore very happy to support the

There is something close to my heart that noble Lord also supports.
Twenty years ago my production company tried to get a schools programme
on parenting commissioned. I was told that could not happen because it
was not part of the national curriculum. Thankfully it now is. Some
schools are attempting to address this important issue. Parenting is
not about sex education, but about teaching young people about life
skills, relationships, respect for one another, responsibilities, basic
money matters, social policies and solving domestic problems. That
applies to everybody’s family life, no matter what their
background is. All schools should promote parental responsibility and
make it an essential part of delivering holistic education to all our
children. That is why I support this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000002"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Howarth of Breckland" PimsId="1029" UID="13102123000159" xid="1642" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000159">Baroness

support this amendment, and to ask for it to be looked at in a broader
context of social policy. The 
<?notus-xml column=299?>noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, talked of young men in prison. I want
to give one example—something I heard last
week—which relates to how young people can learn. I was told of
a hostel for young women with their babies that was closed, probably
for financial reasons. The young women and their babies were dispersed.
Six of them were at university, and no consideration was given to this
fact, to the support they received at the hostel or to what would
happen to them in future. If we are thinking about how we can ensure
that each generation gets the support they need, that story is a good
example of how broader policy could make a
difference.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000003"><hs_speaker><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Butler-Sloss" PimsId="5111" UID="13102123000160" xid="1959" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000160">Baroness

is clearly essential that governors, sponsors, head

this—others have made it too —is that there are a lot of
amendments dotted all over this paper referring to different aspects of
what we are discussing, so we are going to come back to this again and
again. The ear-bashing and encouragement that the Minister has had will
help to indicate the right way of making these important issues

sound framework for sex and relationship education in schools. Sex and

organisations and professionals have an essential role to play, but
this does not require the Government to revise the existing guidance.
However, I agree with the noble Baroness that there are problems from
school to school and this is an issue that we must continue to pursue.

is vital that schools prepare young people for later life, and
especially the responsibilities of parenthood. However, the Government
strongly believe that teachers need flexibility to use their
professional judgment to decide when and how to provide SRE in their
particular local circumstances, and to do so in an appropriate manner.
We believe that it would be inappropriate to introduce a requirement
for pupils in key stage 3, including those as young as 11, to be taught

hope that I have covered most of noble Lords’ concerns in that

kind of education in young offender institutions. I agree that it is
absolutely essential that it should be provided there. The noble
Baronesses, Lady Tyler and Lady Massey, referred to the use of outside
experts. Again, schools are free to use outside experts, and some to
very good effect. But the head teacher should have final responsibility
for which outside experts are brought in, and that is important. The

teaching wider life skills and
relationships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T16:52:50"></hs_TimeCode>.

“That’s comedy—that ain’t reality”.

matter for the court where the child is taken to, where the other
parent goes to that court through the arrangements in this country and
says that this parent has lost the child because the child, in respect
of which he or she has a right of custody, has been removed from this

the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, has said, these are complicated cases.
It is very often difficult in some countries to get that country to
accept that nationals of that country were resident in this country.
Therefore, while they may have been in Germany, they may not
particularly want to send their children back although they had been
resident here. Guatemala is a country that I particularly have in mind.
Under the Hague convention, they should come back but if there is some
uneasiness about what is meant by “arrangements”, it is a
marvellous opportunity for the foreign court to say, “We are not
satisfied on rights of custody, so we will keep the child here”.

fairly major players in this sector including, as I said, the Family

while obviously the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, is
an expert in her own right. This is not a political point but a
practical one: it is about what is in the best interests of children
and what can best protect them in international custody disputes. As I
understand it, “rights of custody” has a particular
resonance and respect around the world, and I am not sure that the new
phraseology that we are putting in its place does that. I still need to
be persuaded of all that, but maybe we can do that in a meeting with

detailing how a mother and her seven month-old baby were doing
extremely well in the community. The CISWA had provided a report in
this case. The mother had a very poor history of parenting, with her
previous children placed for adoption. The local
authority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:16:38"></hs_TimeCode>
planned for adoption for this particular baby; however, the judge
wanted an assessment to see whether the mother’s plea that she
had changed had any foundation. The assessment indicated that there had
been change, and there was a good prognosis. Without the independent
social worker expert report, that child would now have been
adopted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:17:04"></hs_TimeCode>. One has

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> Since this issue has been raised, I am going
to jump on the bandwagon just to say that very difficult cases are
tried by designated and senior judges and family judges of the High
Court where expert evidence is absolutely crucial. I have to say that I
have tried cases where I have ended up with 11 expert witnesses on
shaken babies with subdural haematomas and so on, asking whether it was
the parents or a parent, or whether it was an accident. These are
extremely difficult cases. We were greatly assisted by CAFCASS and
sometimes assisted by 
<?notus-xml column=309?>social workers, but even in these difficult cases, the social workers
came and went. In some cases there was no consistent social worker to
put in a consistent, high-quality report from their point of view.
Again and again, High Court and senior circuit judges have asked for an
independent social worker, which the local authority has been only too
grateful to agree to. That is because the authority knows that in these
difficult cases it has not actually been able to do the job
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:33:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

course, independent social workers are not needed, but we live in a far
from ideal world with children at extraordinary risk of physical injury
as well as sexual injury. Here it is physical injury with which I am
concerned. Again, as the noble Earl has just said, we need the doctors.
I am not sure what the doctors are likely to be paid, but from the
point of view of a senior consultant, it is derisory. There is a limit
to pro bono, particularly if a doctor has to be in court for a day or
two days. Quite simply, these really difficult cases will not be
properly tried if they do not have the right experts.</hs_para>

of time that children were waiting for decisions in their cases, and

vital role in many care proceedings. Their evidence can be necessary to
assist the court in resolving a case justly and in a child’s
best interests. It is the Government’s intention to ensure that
where the court considers that expert evidence is necessary to assist
it to resolve the proceedings justly, including evidence provided by
independent social workers, that evidence should be

reason for the measures in Clause 13 is simple: the family justice
review found that, too often, expert reports were being commissioned in
care proceedings when they added little real value to the
decision-making process and contributed to delays. In many cases,
expert evidence was provided where the evidence could be obtained from
a party already involved in the proceedings. The Government believe
that most social care evidence in cases could and should be supplied by
local authorities and CAFCASS guardians, and I know that that view is
strongly held by the present president of the Family Division, Sir
James Munby. However, where a judge considers that it is necessary to
have expert evidence, including an independent social work report, to
resolve the proceedings justly, then that evidence will still be
permitted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:41:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

improvements to social work practice will be needed to deliver these

practice in this area and how it may be replicated. In addition, CIB
and RiP also recently ran a series of “train the trainer”
workshops aimed at those responsible for training within local
authorities. The workshops focused on the practical skills that social
workers need to progress cases without delay. We have also funded new
research distillations to assist social workers when assessing children

regard to legal aid fees, which the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth,
raised, the hourly rate for independent social workers was introduced
in May 2011 following consultation. As the response to that
consultation recognised, independent social workers undertake a variety
of work for different organisations but the qualifications and
experience of those undertaking that work, plus similarities in the
work undertaken, meant that it was not considered an effective use of
public money for the Legal Services Commission, as it was then, to pay
higher rates than those payable by CAFCASS for similar

services that are significantly different from those normally expected
of other social workers, significantly higher rates are
payable—for example, when acting as an expert risk assessor in
cases where there is a substantiated relevant criminal allegation in
the immediate background of the case, or where a finding of sexual

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, Amendments 62 and 63
concern the issue of time limits for court proceedings. We very much
welcome the Government’s aim of reducing delays in care
proceedings as set out in the clause. As we have discussed in the past,
there have been unjustifiable delays, which have had serious
consequences for the welfare of the children involved. We are pleased
that, in anticipation of the new timescales, court proceedings are
already being completed over a shorter period. However, we believe that
in trying to set absolute time limits the Government may be going too
far and putting at risk the best possible outcome for the child. Our
amendments attempt to redress that balance by reasserting a focus on
the best interests of the child.</hs_para>

have a major concern that as it currently stands, Clause 14 would
curtail effective interventions with children and their families that
last longer than 26 weeks. We need to differentiate clearly
between delay caused by unacceptable process issues on the one hand and
time extensions which really are in the best interests of the child on
the other. Our amendments would allow longer timescales, specifically
to meet the interests of the child. They would also enable the court to
set out a timetable from the outset of proceedings rather than 
<?notus-xml column=313?>continually having to add eight-week extensions. This would give
practitioners more clarity about how long they have to work with the
child before a court decision is
made.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000076"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:48:30"></hs_TimeCode>We
agree that delay in decision-making can have an adverse effect on
children. However, there is a real danger that limiting the proceedings
to 26 weeks would result in court decisions being made to meet the
deadline, rather than to secure the best outcome for each child. We
have to acknowledge that, in practice, some assessments and
intervention programmes take longer than others; for example, where
parents are seeking treatment for substance misuse. Care proceedings
must enable opportunities for meaningful change in parental behaviour
and those working with the family need to know that they will have the
time to enable a successful intervention to take place. The
NSPCC’s infant and family team model is a good example of such
interventions, which can and often do require longer than 26 weeks but
have shown improved outcomes for both the children and the adults
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000077">We
believe that there are a range of circumstances where a period longer
than 26 weeks may be essential for the child’s needs to be
addressed, including to allow a robust support package to be developed
in special guardianship cases. This may include: support for difficult
contact arrangements; preventing significant financial hardship; or
where the proceedings work with the family has not been done or the
situation has changed at the last minute, such that a family member
needs to be considered late in the day. We are already hearing
anecdotes of family members being denied an assessment once the case is
in court. Parents who are consistently demonstrating to the Family Drug
and Alcohol Court’s intensive support team that they are turning
their life around need sufficient time to prove to the court that they
can sustain such an improvement. A longer period may also be needed
when potentially suitable family carers live abroad. In the case of
older children, an emphasis on a fast timescale may be
counterproductive, and particular care, sensitivity and dialogue will
be necessary to allow the child’s long-term welfare needs to be
met<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:50:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000078">This
list is not exhaustive but gives an illustration of cases where a delay
could well be in the child’s interest. I am grateful to the
noble Lord, Lord McNally, for addressing these concerns in his recent
letter. He explained that a number of pilots are taking place and that
in due course the Family Procedure Rule Committee will consider whether
to make court rules on these issues. However, we do not feel that this
goes far enough. There are important issues here affecting the welfare
of children at stake. The FPRC is under no obligation to make rules on
time limits, and in any case we will not have had sight of the rules
being made; meanwhile, we believe that a commitment to greater
flexibility in the application of these rules is essential. Without
taking away any of the good intent of the clause, which attempts to
speed up court processes, we believe that our amendments, which would
give the courts greater flexibility to extend deadlines where it is
explicitly in the interest of the child, strike the right balance. We
hope that noble Lords will support this

amendment because the NSPCC has raised huge concerns with me. It feels
that the implementation of a 26-week time limit could make the
operation of evidence-based interventions that take longer than the
specified time limit more difficult; for example, in situations where
parents are seeking treatment for substance misuse or domestic violence
or when family members come forward late in care proceedings when the
real risk of a child being taken into care becomes apparent. The NSPCC

appropriate assessments to take

noble Baroness has already mentioned programmes such as the
NSPCC’s infant and family team. That programme is significant as
it informs professionals and helps courts decide whether maltreated
children can be reunited with their birth family or should be placed
for adoption with their foster family. It also assists parents in
addressing the problems that they might have had as children. However,
this important and emotional work requires between 12 and 15 months
before a final recommendation is made. Although the Bill provides for
eight-week extensions, continually adding these on to the six months
causes a large amount of uncertainty for parents whose own early
traumatic experiences are being explored to help them reflect on the
origins of their present difficulties, and ultimately may have an
adverse effect, not to mention increased administration
pressure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000081">When

began working with the Infant Team I had a bad attitude, but soon, I
loved it. We had parenting sessions that really helped me, and I
watched videos of parents and kids which helped me understand my
kids’ needs more and how to meet them and build a sense of
security so they know they can come to me. The Infant Team also asked
me about when I was young. It felt like my mum leaving at a young age
meant I couldn’t trust people. They helped me to be myself more
and start trusting people, and I began to open up to my kids more, and
my relationships with them got better. The Infant Team want you to get
your kids back. I didn't want my children to have to grow up without

cases cannot be forced into a prescribed timeframe, as the NSPCC

how the Government will address this potentially negative impact and

Butler-Sloss:</Member></B> My Lords, I regret to say to the noble
Baroness, Lady Jones, that I do not agree with her amendment. I have
discussed this with the President of the Family Division and with Lord
Justice Ryder, who has been leading the modernisation of the family
courts over a number of years—even when I was there, which is
now eight years ago. This is one of the major planks of the Norgrove
report. The president and Lord Justice Ryder, together with other
judges, are extremely concerned about the idea that the 26-week limit
should be breached. They see it as an opening for some judges simply to
take longer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>.
Certainly until very recently, we know that decisions have been taking
48 to 50 weeks. For a child to have to wait for a year for a decision
on whether it can stay with the family or should go into care is half a
year too long. This is what Norgrove wanted: dramatically to reduce the
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

lobbying me as well and I have heard the touching story, but I am
afraid that I sent an e-mail saying that in this particular
instance I do not agree. If one looks at Clause 14, which is
the subject of this amendment, one can see that under new subsection
(5) onwards, there is an opportunity for extensions of eight weeks.
However, if there is an open book, there will be judges who allow it to
remain open, whereas if you have to be ready to go back after each
period of eight weeks, that has a marvellous effect on getting on with
what needs to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T17:58:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

under new subsection (9) the Lord Chancellor can change the 26-week
period, while new subsection (10) states that the rules of court may
provide for changes. I have absolutely no doubt that the rules
committee and the senior judiciary, particularly the Family Division
liaison judges on each of the circuits, will check on the designated
family judges in the care centres. If there are cases where the
decision has been too speedy, I have no doubt at all that the system
will be able to see that, which provides an opportunity to decide at
that stage whether there needs to be an extension. But, for the moment,
I ask the Minister to stand firm on this one.</hs_para>

it would send would not be the right one at this stage. I have heard
the president talking about this, and I think that at the moment his
mantra is, “It can be done, it will be done, it must be
done”. It is all about turning around the culture from one of
delay to one of urgency, with all parties involved in this—that

reinforced in this recently. I attended the National Children and
Adults Services Conference in Harrogate on Friday. It was
a very good three-day event with a number of
Ministers and others speaking. I went to a specialist workshop all
about completing care proceedings in 26 weeks. Several academics,
particularly from the University of East Anglia, presented some initial
findings from the research that they have been doing into the impact of
the new public law outline to try to move to a 26-week time limit, and
particularly the impact of what is called the tri-borough project with
Kensington and Chelsea, Westminster and Hammersmith and Fulham. I have
been to visit that project myself and the results, frankly, are
extremely impressive: already 50% of cases are being resolved in less

supports the 26-week time limit but also agrees that there should be
specific extensions for eight weeks where people can apply to the
court. It would probably be most helpful if I raised the questions that
the Magistrates’ Association has raised in the brief that it
sent me. Before I do so, though, I want to make the point that the
examples of exceptions that my noble friend Lady Jones gave are very

questions that the Magistrates’ Association raised in its brief
to me is really a concern that an application for an eight-week
extension should resist that extension being a contested hearing, and
obviously the decision of the court should be final. If there is to be
a contested hearing on an eight-week extension, though, it should be as
short and focused as possible. The second point that the
Magistrates’ Association made was that it is not clear, from the
association’s understanding, that there is any limit to the
maximum number of successive extensions. The association’s final
point is to ask whether there is any right of appeal if a lower
court—although perhaps “lower court” is not the
right expression—decides not to grant an extension. Is there any
right of appeal to a higher

Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, for her intervention in support of these
proposals—I am also grateful for my momentary promotion. It
gives me an opportunity to pay tribute to the work of Lord Justice
Ryder when he was with the Family Division. He did a lot of
ground-clearing in this area, not least bringing 
<?notus-xml column=317?>in some very useful comparative statistics which allowed us to see the
variety in performance of courts, which was affecting children at a
vulnerable time of their lives. When this exercise
started, it took more than 60 weeks in some cases to come to
a decision. The tri-borough project also demonstrated in advance of
this legislation that this could be done more quickly. Certainly, the
robust leadership that Sir James Munby has given in implementing the
Norgrove proposals has meant that, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler,
said, a culture of delay has been replaced by a culture of urgency.
That is much to the credit of what we are
proposing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000092">We
all agree that delays in decision-making, whether by local authorities
or in courts, can be very damaging. They can add to emotional
insecurity and affect children’s prospects for returning to or
finding a permanent loving home. Introducing a 26-week time limit for
care and supervision cases will send a clear and unambiguous statement
to all parts of the family justice system about the need to reduce
delay. Removing certain cases from the ambit of the 26-week time limit
at the outset, as proposed by Amendment 62, would undermine this
effort.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000093">I
recognise that these cases deal with important and complex issues and
not all will be able to be completed within this timeframe. The court
will therefore have the discretion to extend the time limit in a
particular case beyond 26 weeks if that is necessary to
resolve  the proceedings justly. The clause carefully strikes
the necessary balance between putting in place a maximum 26-week time
limit to tackle delay in all cases and allowing sufficient judicial
discretion to extend time where necessary to resolve the case justly,
having explicit regard to the child’s welfare.</hs_para>

last for a maximum of eight weeks at a time will help ensure that the
court is focused on resolving cases as quickly as possible. To allow
the court to grant an extension without imposing any limit as to the
length of the extension, as proposed by Amendment 63, would potentially
allow cases to drift. This could undermine the aim that we all share,
of reducing unnecessary delay. There will always be some very complex
cases which it may not be possible to complete within 26 weeks. Where
that is the case, the court will be able to extend time, where
necessary, to resolve proceedings justly. It is important, however,
that we keep a clear focus on resolving cases as quickly as possible,
and specifying a maximum eight-week limit on the length of extensions
will ensure that this happens. There is, however, no limit on the
number of extensions that can be
sought.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000095">I

answered the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby. The noble
Baroness, Lady Jones, asked about the Family Procedure Rule Committee.
On the basis of its specific expertise, the committee has been invited
to consider whether to further elaborate on the matter to which the
court is to have regard in order to support Clause 14, and we await its
response. The court rules may set out the matters to which the court
must, may or may not have regard when making the decision whether to
grant an extension to the time limit. It is, rightly, the remit of the
FPRC to consider whether to make court rules under the clause; it is a
statutory independent non-departmental public body responsible for
making these rules of the court. Before making the rules, the FPRC must
consult such persons as it considers appropriate, and we will update
the Committee on the FPRC’s work before Report.</hs_para>

there were any other matters that were specific to this; the questions
come thick and fast. Yes, there was one: the noble Baronesses, Lady
Jones and Lady Benjamin, raised the question of whether the 26-week
time limit would impact on kinship care and whether it would be
shoehorned into a one-size-fits-all solution. We are aware that, in
spite of everyone’s best efforts, occasionally relatives are not
identified until late in the proceedings. However, the 26-week time
limit should not impact on kinship care. It is not for the courts to
decide whether it is Granny that the child goes to; rather, it relates
to the choice of the permanence plan being a relative if possible,
followed by adoption or long-term foster care. After all, the court
does not decide which adopters the child goes to when it agrees to a
plan for adoption. We are continuing to use programmes such as family
group conferences before proceedings start in order to identify family
members from the onset of cases. In addition, we are working in
partnership with the Children’s Improvement Board and the
College of Social Work to support the continuing improvement of social
work practice. Of course, the court retains the power to extend the
case for longer consideration if necessary.</hs_para>

in the Bill will tackle the damaging delays that exist throughout the
system. These delays can deny children the chance of a permanent home
and have a harmful long-term effect on a child’s development.
The measures will also refocus the system so that the child’s
best interests are part of the process. Our measures strike the
necessary balance between tackling delay and allowing sufficient
judicial discretion to resolve proceedings justly, and I hope that
noble Lords will agree to withdraw these
amendments.</hs_para>

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I briefly pay tribute to the
Government. In the past week I met District Judge Crichton and his team
from the NHS Portman trust. District Judge Crichton set up the Family
Drug and Alcohol Court five or six years ago and has had great success,
with about one-third of families coming through the court keeping their
children, and the best evidence so far is that those children continue
to do well and thrive with those families, so the family stays off
drugs and alcohol. I pay tribute to the Government for their support of
FDAC from the beginning and for their continuing support. I express the
hope that perhaps in future FDAC might be made even more widely 
<?notus-xml column=319?>available across the country, always bearing in mind the heavy burden
that local authorities are continually faced with as more and more
children each year come into care and the challenges that that poses to
all of us. Once again, I pay tribute to the Government for their

the noble Baroness, Lady Benjamin. I do not want anyone to be under any
illusions: of course it is imperative that we tackle the court delays
that have occurred in the system. We absolutely start from that point
of view. We welcome all the steps that have been taken to modernise the
family court system, including those to cut the time that is taken to
deal with cases in the court. I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady
Tyler, that it is a cultural issue as much as anything and we need to
tackle that
culture.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102123000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102123000102">Our
amendments were never intended to be an open door for judges just to
sit on their hands and delay decisions. The intention was that in very
particular cases, which people could see from the outset were going to
take longer than 26 weeks, they would be able to make a decision and
spell out and justify that decision at the time. It was not just an
opportunity for a delay for the sake of it.</hs_para>

about how these eight-week extensions are going to work. For example,
if a family is going through an intensive period of therapy, knowing
that the case is going back to be reviewed every eight weeks is
fantastically stressful and disruptive to them when they feel that they
are making progress. The evidence shows that a lot of court decisions
were delayed because the processes were not in place, reports were not
received in time or the evidence was not there at the time. If you are
then going to deal with a rolling eight-week review, there are all
sorts of opportunities for things to go wrong and for the evidence
simply not to be before the court at the right time. I would be
interested to know how these eight-week extensions work in practice. We
may well need to have a review of them in the short

say as a one-off, “We’ll allow a further eight

Lloyd of Berwick:</Member></B> My Lords, I said that the two questions
posed by Section 31 should be capable of being answered without too
much help from lawyers, but that has not proved to be the case. In the
27 years since 1986, the section has been considered on no fewer than
eight occasions in our highest court, and on two occasions already this
year. On one of those occasions it was
said:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102127000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000072">“This

think noble Lords would say amen to that. Happily, there is one word in
the section on the meaning of which everyone is agreed, and that is the
word “likely” in subsection (1). It does not mean more
likely than not. It means only that there is a real possibility of harm
to a child or, as one judge put it, a possibility that cannot sensibly
be
ignored<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:35:14"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

paraphrase Section 32(1) again. It states that a child may be taken
into care only if, first, it is suffering significant harm or,
secondly, there is the real possibility that it will suffer significant
harm. I shall not repeat all the wording. In other words, there are two
separate conditions which may trigger the threshold, one relating to
the present and the other relating to the future. When the case is put
on the basis of present harm—for example, that the child is
being physically or sexually abused by its father—it will be
necessary to prove that fact on a balance of probability. Anything less
than that would be unfair on the father and, indeed, on both parents.
This is so also where the case is that the child has suffered serious
injury and it is uncertain whether the injury was inflicted by the
mother. It will be necessary to prove on a balance of probability that
the child has indeed been injured and that the injury was inflicted by
either the father or  the mother, or both, but it will not be
necessary at the threshold stage to decide which parent it was. That
will be decided, if it can be decided at all, at the 

<?notus-xml column=322?>welfare stage on all the evidence which will then be
available. The same principle of the threshold test also applies in
relation to any unharmed child of the
family<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:37:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sailing. The difficulty arises when the parents separate. Let us
suppose that the father goes off to live with another woman who already
has a child of her own of the same age as the injured child. Is the
threshold satisfied in relation to that child? Common sense would
suggest that it is. There is a 50% chance on the proved facts that it
was the father who injured the first child, who we will call child A.
There must be at least a serious possibility that he will also injure
child B—a possibility which, I repeat, cannot sensibly be
ignored. If so, the threshold would be satisfied in relation to child B
as well as to child A. However, the Supreme Court has held in a very
recent case, Re J (Children), that that is not so. The Court has held
that a serious possibility that it was the father who inflicted the
injury is not enough. In order to satisfy the threshold in relation to
child B, it will be for the local authority to prove on a balance of
probability that it was the father and not the mother who injured child
A. Since on the assumed facts that could not be done, child B would
remain at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:39:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

cannot have been what Parliament intended when enacting Section 32(1),
otherwise why did Parliament include the word “likely” as
the alternative ground on which the threshold may be satisfied? The
matter can be tested in this way by assuming that the mother is also
now living with another man and has had a child which we shall call
child C. Does child C also have to remain at risk because it cannot be
proved on a balance of probability that it was the mother rather than
the father who inflicted the harm on child A? The noble and
learned Lord, Lord Nicholls, who gave the leading judgments in the
three initial cases on Section 31 in the House of Lords, described such
a result

has the Supreme Court in Re J arrived at a different conclusion that,
as the noble and learned Lord has said, on the face of it is
“grotesque”. How can two of the judges in the Supreme
Court have held that the injury to child A in such a case is logically
irrelevant in deciding whether child B and child C are at risk and must
therefore be disregarded altogether?</hs_para>

answer to how the Supreme Court can have reached that conclusion is to
be found in the judgment of Lord Justice McFarlane in the same case but
in the court below. Lord Justice McFarlane is one of our most
experienced Family Division judges, and is the author of one of the
leading textbooks in this field. It was he who gave the leading
judgment in the Court of Appeal in Re J. He went through all
the House of Lords and Supreme Court decisions going back to 1996, and
he showed that a clear distinction is drawn in the cases between those
where the question is whether any harm has been proved at all and those
cases where harm has been proved but the perpetrator of the harm is
uncertain. That is the very distinction drawn by the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Nicholls, in the House of Lords case that I have already
quoted.</hs_para>

though, that distinction was overlooked in later cases. Lord Justice
McFarlane makes no secret of the fact that he favours the approach of
the noble and learned Lord, Lord Nicholls, and would therefore have
allowed the appeal in Re J if he could. However, subsequent decisions
in the Supreme Court meant of course that his hands were tied. So the
Court of Appeal took the unusual course of dismissing the appeal but
itself giving leave to appeal to the Supreme Court, thereby, one might
think, inviting the Supreme Court to have another look at this problem.
Unfortunately, as I see it, the Supreme Court simply came up with the
same answer again.</hs_para>

Justice McFarlane’s judgment is long and detailed but his
conclusion is clear, concise and very relevant in this context. It is
contained in a single page of the Law Reports, which I have had copied,

considering this amendment. Copies are available on the table by the

come to the decision of the Supreme Court itself in Re J. Is it open to
us to take a different view? If so, is it wise for us to do so? To both
those questions I would answer yes, for three reasons. First, three of
the judges in the Supreme Court were themselves attracted by the
argument that the approach in these cases has become much too
complicated and that this is having unfortunate consequences. Secondly,
the decision in the Supreme Court has been subjected to a hail of
criticism in lengthy articles by Professor Mary Hayes and Stephen
Gilmore, appearing in <I>Family Law</I>. There is not the slightest
reason to doubt that, as they point out, the decision is causing real
concern, if not consternation, among social workers and local
authorities who have to apply Section 32 in practice. Thirdly, the
decision in the Supreme Court hardly does justice to Lord Justice
McFarlane’s decision in the Court of Appeal; indeed, it is
scarcely even
mentioned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:45:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102127000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000010">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T18:45:16"></hs_TimeCode>
is another reason for accepting this amendment. I am not seeking to
amend the wording of Section 32(1) itself; the wording is
fine and has stood the test of time. It is only the interpretation of
that section that needs correcting, and that is what the amendment
seeks to do. Its intended purpose is to clarify, and above all to
simplify, the approach in cases of the kind that I have described where
the harm has been proved on the balance of probabilities but the court
cannot make a finding on the evidence whether it was the father or the
mother who inflicted that harm. A judge of great experience in the
Family Division said that that is the sort of case that occurs very
often—“commonplace”, I think he said—in
practice. In such cases, if the amendment were accepted, both parents
would be placed in what is called a pool of possible perpetrators, thus
enabling the case to proceed to the next stage, the welfare stage,
where a decision could be made.</hs_para>

refer to a “pool” because that is the term used by those
who read these cases, or a “list”, as it is called in the
amendment. Why does one have to have a pool or a list? The reason is
quite simple: in one case, which has actually occurred in practice,
there was a third possible perpetrator. In addition to the parents
of  
<?notus-xml column=324?>the child in question, there was a childminder who also had a child of
her own of about the same age. In such a case, it obviously makes sense
that the childminder should be included in the pool of possible
perpetrators, thus enabling that child to be protected should it become
necessary. I hope that this has done something to clarify the purpose
of the amendment and I beg to

Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood (Non-Afl):</Member></B> My Lords, I
support the amendment as strongly as I may. The critical consideration
to keep in mind here, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has
explained, is that what we are concerned about today is a threshold
provision. The amendment would mean simply that in a small but very
important additional category of cases, the court would have the
jurisdiction and the power to investigate the case in depth and to
consider whether in all the circumstances it should then make a care
order or supervision order for the child’s protection. The small
category of additional cases—again, the noble and learned Lord
has explained this—is where it is established that some other
child has already suffered significant harm, perhaps has even been
killed, but the local authority concerned about some other child can
demonstrate only the possibility, rather than the actual probability,
that the perpetrator of that harm was someone who is now caring for the
child in question—the child, that is, whose safety is presently
under
consideration.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_21_PT_1/9C8F8B9669A3330BA2538E30C03E97EC20A51E62" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 October 2013">Monday,

is clear, as again the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, has
explained, is that several judges who have had to grapple with this
point, even if they felt bound by the original majority’s
decision, have expressed serious misgivings about the consequences of
that interpretation. In the case last year, Re J, to which again my
noble and learned friend has referred, both the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Judge, then the Lord Chief Justice and now a Member of this House,
and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Neuberger, then Master of the
Rolls and now President of the Supreme Court, agreed with Lord Justice
McFarlane. His judgment expressed his trouble with the interpretation
given to this section and described it,</hs_para>

that the clause as originally enacted was not clear enough as to what

Lord Lloyd, or some comparable draft, would make it plain. It would

part of the law has got itself into, and it would produce a result that

repeat, this is only a threshold provision which would apply whenever a
child is found to be at risk of being harmed, as must surely be the
case when one  of the caring parents is shown to have been a
possible perpetrator of serious harm in the past. To anybody who is
concerned that the court, following this amendment, would too readily
take children away from a parent who only might have harmed some other
child, I would say this is absolutely not the case.

In my own previous academic experience I did a considerable amount of
government-funded research into child abuse, and child sexual abuse in
particular. Apart from any other kinds of cases, we found a very
significant although small number of men who quite deliberately target
families and go round seeking one woman after another. In each case,
there is harm to the child but it cannot necessarily be definitively
proved which individual committed the harm. For a small number of

first view is that of seven Supreme Court judges. Normally in the

McFarlane, but two of the judges of the Supreme Court were family
judges of even greater experience and expertise than him. Both those

One concerns a situation where there has been no significant harm to
the child, or in Re J, the case with which we are concerned, three
children. However, there was very significant harm to one child who
died. In that case, the mother and the father were the only possible
perpetrators. Under the current law, it did not matter which of them
had killed or injured the child. The child may have died of asphyxia
from being rolled on to in the bed—the child was lying in the
bed with the parents, which is a terrible habit. This child had been
seriously injured before it died. Those are the facts. The mother,
during the time she lived with the father, was in that pool of
perpetrators and it was clearly not safe for the older child, born
while the parents were engaged in the process of care, to live with
them. They then parted and went to live with different people. The
mother eventually went to live with a man who was the divorced father
of two children who lived with him, and with him she had two further
children. The pool was then a different pool, not the pool of two
perpetrators, one of whom was bound to have done it, but a different
pool in which nothing had happened so far. The judges in the Re J case
said that there had to be some evidence from which to infer the
likelihood of significant harm in the new group, and it could not be
said that the mother had injured or helped to kill the child when she
lived in the other group, where she and the father were the obvious
suspects. In Re J, the seven Supreme Court judges, who were unanimous,
said that you had to have some evidence to cross the threshold.
Unfortunately in that case the only issue that the local authority
presented to the Court of Appeal and to the Supreme Court was the fact
that the mother was in the area pool of perpetrators; no other facts
were presented at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:03:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102127000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000028">The
alternative view put forward by the noble and learned Lord was one he
put forward in the earlier case of Re H, where he was in the minority;
the majority found against him. In that case, there was a girl of 16
who the elder sister of younger children. The girl said that she had
been raped by the stepfather. In the criminal proceedings, he was
acquitted. In the family proceedings, the judge said he was not
satisfied as to the appropriate standard that the stepfather had raped
this girl, but there was a strong suspicion. In that case the Court of
Appeal and the Supreme Court held that they could not infer sufficient
facts to say that the other children were at risk.</hs_para>

childminder. In that case, the noble and learned Lord said that in
relation to those three in that pool where the child was
injured—I think that the child died—clearly it was

noble and learned Lord, Lord Phillips of Worth Matravers, raised an
interesting point. He asked whether there were any recorded cases where
the only evidence was that the mother or father had moved from the pool
of perpetrators into a subsequent pool where  the current law
meant that nothing could be done and the child had suffered. I have to
say that I have not heard of such a case. I do not think that there is
such a case because it would undoubtedly have been referred to in the
later cases, particularly in Re J. I thought that the noble and learned
Lord, Lord Phillips, made an extremely pertinent point that there was
nothing to show that the current law has been to the detriment of
children potentially at
risk<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:06:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102127000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000031">The
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, pointed to the crucial fact that the
mother in Re J was in a new pool. No one has suggested that the father
of the other children had ever committed any offence. He was a totally
respected man. In his note, the noble and learned Lord said that the
fact that the mother was in the earlier pool of perpetrators was
relevant, but by itself that was not sufficient. He went on to say that
it could be relied on, together with any other facts or circumstances
that might be relevant, to support the conclusion that the three other
children in Re J were likely to suffer
harm<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:07:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

there are other important factors that neither the Court of Appeal nor
the Supreme Court were allowed to deal with. The first factor was that
the mother was very young when she was living with the man and the
child died. Secondly, it was a new relationship with a totally
respectable person. Thirdly, there were two further children and she
was much more mature. There were factors against her which they did not
take into account; namely, that she had colluded with the man in the
first case. If they had taken that into account, they might well have
crossed the threshold. Unfortunately, those facts were not taken into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:08:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102127000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000033">Therefore,
as I understand it, this is a sole issue that is unlikely and, as the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, said, it is extremely rare. The
noble and learned Baroness, Lady Hale, who is one of the great family
experts, and Lord Wilson, were both satisfied in this case that the
threshold was properly not crossed. Lord Reed said in paragraph 98 of
<I>Family Law </I><I>Week</I><I> </I>that if the current law as stated
in this case was causing consternation, it would appear to be an
overreaction because the one clear-cut point was not one that was
likely to come up very often, if at all. I am extremely concerned that
we maintain a balance between the right of children to their own
family, the right of parents to family life and their own child, and
the crucial importance of the protection of the child where there is
danger to that child.</hs_para>

not quote a single passage of

family judge, speaking perhaps as  the only family judge
present, although of course the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, is a family

concluded in favour of  the local authority’s view at

lowering the tone of this extraordinarily learned exchange, in the
church we face a similar issue when trying to discern when someone
poses a potential risk but nothing can be proved. It is a difficult
line to establish. In the drafting of this amendment, my eye has been
caught by the juxtaposition of the words “likely” and
“possible”. I wonder whether there is a better way of
phrasing it. The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, used
the word “might” at one point, but interestingly then
corrected herself and said “was likely to”. There is a
real difference between someone being assessed as “might”
be a threat and “is likely to” be a threat. I think that
I come down on the side of the noble and learned Baroness. However, it
is good to know that the lawyers have only two views in these
situations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:12:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Mackay of Clashfern (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I had the
responsibility of producing Clause 31 as it was, now Section 31, of the
1989 Act. It is extremely important and, as the noble and learned Lord,
Lord Lloyd, has said, it has stood the test of time. It is important
because it marks a threshold. That does not 
<?notus-xml column=330?>mean that it is an introduction or a preliminary, it means that it
determines whether or not the court has the power to remove a child
from the natural situation in which he or she is living. It is vital,
on the one hand, where there is harm to the child, that the public
authority, in this case the local authority, should be able to step in.
However, it is equally important that the local authority should not be
able to step in where the facts required for the threshold have not
been demonstrated. It is that sort of position that the threshold
occupies. It is not a question of having to do this in order to go on
to welfare. It is that if the threshold is not satisfied, the court
cannot remove the child from its natural parents.</hs_para>

with the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, that this was a
very considered decision of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom,
containing at least two very experienced family lawyers. It is not the
first case to determine this matter but is possibly the first in which
it has been distilled to the only point in the case. The case was
brought in order to settle the law on whether the mere
fact—nothing more—that a parent was in a situation where
a child was damaged or injured is of itself sufficient to create a risk
that will satisfy the threshold test.</hs_para>

into all the detail because Members of the Committee may read the
Supreme Court judgments for themselves if they wish to do so; they are
clear, precise and compelling. The point that I want to make is as
follows. Let us assume that there are parents who have produced harm to
their child. That could be one or both of them. If actual harm is shown
to have been done to the child, it does not matter which of the parents
was responsible; the child can be removed.</hs_para>

these two people—married, we will assume—with their child
harmed, split up. The mother goes away for some time, and eventually
sets up a relationship with another person who has no history whatever
of harming any child. He has two children of his own and there is no
suggestion whatever that he has harmed them. What is the source of risk
to the children who are cared for by that new union? The only possible
source of risk is that the mother was a party to the injury to the
first child. That is exactly what the court has not been able to take
as the fact. The fact is that the only thing that was known is that
this mother was a member of a group in which a child was injured. It
does not follow that she had any part in it whatever.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102127000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000045">That was the only fact
that the Supreme Court was allowed to take into account.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:17:48"></hs_TimeCode> case was
deliberately put together so that this point of law could be dealt with
by the Supreme Court. I think that it was in the judgment of the noble
and learned Baroness, Lady Hale—noble Lords can read that for
themselves if they wish—that the case was unique in the sense of
being packaged in this way. In nearly every other case, it would be
possible to adduce further evidence from which the court might be able
to assume that it was one or the other, either the mother or the
father, who had been the perpetrator. However, the unfairness of 
<?notus-xml column=331?>this idea is that if the mother had nothing whatever to do with harming
the child, she should be marked as someone who creates a serious risk
and that any child for which she had responsibility thereafter is to be
at serious risk and liable to be taken away from whatever union she has
joined<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:18:47"></hs_TimeCode>. When we
look at it that way, as I assume we should, it is quite unfair to make
that kind of inference from this sole fact. There may be many other
facts in ordinary cases, and there usually are. At the stage at which
this case was put, though, there was just the one fact, and that was
the legal decision that seven judges
reached.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-21?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_21_PT_1/04F6EAB91B1469B5B003E08609947EFEBCE31376" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 21 October 2013">Monday,

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:20:29"></hs_TimeCode> am always
concerned about the protection and well-being of the child. In recent
years we have seen children who have been physically and mentally
abused at home, and no one has been able to help them. They have seen
the abuse but they have not been able to go and do anything about it.
Recently, there was a little boy who was emaciated; he was scrabbling
around for food in the gutter and was allowed to be ill treated by his
parents. If this discussion means that a social worker can knock on the
door, get into the house and provide welfare and, presumably, safety
for the child—not necessarily taking the child away—then
that must be the right thing to do. It must not always be about a legal
interpretation or a legal battle between two sides. We must always
focus on what is the best for an individual child. Recently society has
let those children down. We have to remember the case of Baby P to see
where that
happened<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-21T19:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102127000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000050"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord McNally" PimsId="1843" UID="13102127000097" xid="1331" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000097">Lord
McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may follow my noble friend
Lord Storey because he encapsulates a lot of why this is a very
difficult debate. Earlier today we heard strong appeals to ensure that
local authorities did not rush to judgment and deprive a child of
staying at home and being brought up by their natural 
<?notus-xml column=332?>family. I have colleagues in the other place who are extremely critical
of what they think is a tendency by authorities in Britain to too
readily take children from their natural parents and from their kinship
carers and family. Yet, as my noble friend says, every so often we get
these horrific cases, and not just the media but everyone asks,
“How could it happen? Where were the teachers, the social
workers and the neighbours? How was it allowed to happen?”. The
question of that balance has kept on coming up throughout the
debate—the importance of the threshold that has to be cleared
before we can intervene.</hs_para>

pretending to the Committee that these things are coming from the top
of my head, but I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, that I am
told Section 47 would allow statutory intervention in a child’s

local authority has a duty to investigate and can gain access to the
child’s home if it deems the child to be at risk of significant
harm, and then move for an emergency protection order. It may not be

noble Lords will appreciate, Section 31(2) of the Children Act, which
the noble and learned Lord proposes to amend, has to balance the need
to protect children from harm with the need to protect the child and

noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, the author of that Act, has
explained to us. Any amendment to this carefully worded section, which

amendment would allow a court to infer that the threshold for making a
full care or supervision order has been met solely on the basis that
someone living with a child might—but was not proven
to—have significantly harmed a child previously. This is a
departure from the current balance in the Act. Currently there must be
a factual foundation for the state’s removal of a child.
Reasonable suspicion is a sufficient basis for authorities to
investigate and even take interim protective measures in order to
gather evidence, but case law has outlined that it cannot be a
sufficient basis for long-term
intervention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102127000055" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021-gc0001.htm#13102127000055">The
threshold for being able to intervene under Section 31 is there not
only to protect the family but to protect the child, as unjustified
removal can in itself result in significant harm to the child. This is
the very reason why Section 31 was included in the Children Act 1989.
It is possible that such protection would be eroded if it could
be inferred on the basis of unsubstantiated suspicion that there was a
basis for making a final order such as a care or supervision

the local authority to safeguard the child’s welfare. A Section

considered this matter in some detail. The noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Hale, explained, certainly to my satisfaction, why the case that
the noble and learned Lord believes needs clarification is so special,

facts—injuries suffered, how they occurred, whether there was
delay in getting medical help or concealment of injuries—that

the mother is not enough; it is clearly a serious possibility, at the

other, and that serious possibility is enough to trigger the threshold

The exemptions to the aggregates levy are designed to encourage the use
of recycled and secondary by-product aggregates. However, the European
Commission recently opened a formal investigation into whether
particular exemptions and reliefs amount to state aid. The UK is
therefore obliged, under Article 108(3) of the Treaty of the
Function of the European Union, to suspend the application of those
exemptions and reliefs about which the Commission has raised
doubts.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102118000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131021w0001.htm#13102118000004">Revenue

The National Planning Policy Framework makes clear
that minerals planning authorities should plan for the steady and
adequate supply of minerals to support sustainable economic growth.
Through Local Aggregate Assessments, they are expected to prepare
annual assessments of the demand for, and supply of, aggregates in
their area. In doing so they need to take account of all supply
options, including the level of known resource, the extent of permitted
reserves and the contribution of secondary and recycled aggregates.
These assessments provide the basis for determining when the mineral
planning authority should review its plan to allocate more sand and
gravel sites where extraction may take
place.</hs_para><NewDebate BusinessType="Question">

The UK Government work closely with Airbus and the
three Governments that hold shares in its parent company—France,
Germany and Spain. The UK’s main sources of support for the
company are delivered through Research and Development (R&amp;D)
funding and repayable launch investment. None of this funding is

in the Airbus Inter-governmental Committee alongside France, Germany
and Spain. This is not an EU body, but an arrangement recognising that
the four Governments invest large sums in Airbus and have an interest

are two areas where changes in the UK’s engagement with the EU

input into the WTO case on subsidies to aircraft manufacturers brought
against the EU by the US, and the counter-claim brought by Europe. A UK
withdrawal from the EU could have some impact on this case, but the
most likely outcome would be that it would continue as now, with the UK
co-ordinating its input alongside the EU’s. The second area
which may have an impact is in the UK’s ability to participate
in cross-European Aerospace research projects. We cannot say now what
impact this will have on the UK but it is unlikely to impact
significantly on the UK’s relationship with Airbus as the
