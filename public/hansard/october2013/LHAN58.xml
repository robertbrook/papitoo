Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, the first thing I will say
is that the noble Lord is indeed a patient Lord. However, our purpose
is to seek a voluntary process, and we very much hope that the press
will, 
<?notus-xml column=1174?>through its independent, self-regulatory body, apply to the recognition
panel so that what has happened before does not happen again and we
have the right mechanism in place. I emphasise that it is voluntary for
the press to apply to the recognition panel. However, as your Lordships
know, Parliament has—following through from the Leveson
report—made very clear, through the Crime and Courts Act, what
the position would be for those who
transgressed.</hs_para>

noble friend. In the end, we have a duty to the public and to the
victims in particular. We have a responsibility to try to set in place
a position where this does not happen again and which gives confidence
to the public. I am aware of the polls—polls can do a range of
things. I hope the press will see that the cross-party charter is

have always tried to view things through the eyes of the average man or
the average consumer. With that in mind, the Leveson inquiry seems to

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not think the noble
Lord will be surprised if I say that Lord Justice Leveson did a very
thorough job for the nation. There was great merit in what he was
wrestling with because he was trying to balance the freedom of a
responsible press—which we all cherish—with putting in
place something that enshrines that but ensures that there is redress
and gives confidence to the public. I am therefore afraid that I
disagree with the spirit of what the noble Lord is

important request that this House be given the

friend’s position, particularly given that he chairs the
Communications Committee. However, we have debated the cross-party
charter and the Leveson report on many occasions, and I have been
delighted to answer—or seek to answer—questions on them.
I sense that the public are seeking some conclusion to this and that is
why the cross-party charter is going before the Privy Council on 30
October. It is about trying to get some resolution so that we can move

Grocott (Lab):</Member></B> Does the Minister detect something that I
have not yet detected? The Leveson inquiry came about in the first
place as a result of the most appalling treatment by the print media of
individual innocent members of the public. It was that outrage that led
to the inquiry. In the kind of almost academic exchanges that are going
on, I get no sense at all that the leaders of the print industry share
or understand that outrage. Can the Minister simply report to the House
and reassure me that the Government feel the same sense of outrage that
the overwhelming majority of the British people

Gardiner of Kimble:</Member></B> I sense from our exchanges in your
Lordships’ House that there is a very strong feeling here which
reflects what the nation feels. This is why the Prime Minister was
absolutely right to start on the path of asking Lord Justice Leveson to
look into these matters, because they should not have happened and
responsible people could not possibly justify them. I say to those who
are very senior in the press: I see no demons in what is proposed by
the cross-party charter. This is about trying to have two very
important things in our nation’s life: a responsible free press
that can scrutinise and look at all that we and our institutions do,
but will also safeguard the rights of the
citizen.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_24_PT_1/6BD268CF2590EA9354B5EAFB83845050DF0348E7" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 October 2013">Thursday,

people often get involved in all sorts of campaigns. One of the things
which comes through in citizenship education is how the links can be
made between those sorts of issues and how you effect change through
voting. For example, if young people are encouraged by Comic Relief to
be concerned 
<?notus-xml column=1177?>about the plight of children of their own age in another country,
actually voting and trying to ensure that there is a commitment to

I return to the issue of the syllabus and the role of citizenship in
it. Following concerns from all parts of the House, not least from my
noble friend Lord Phillips and the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, on
Thursday last week, is it not incredibly important to demonstrate to
young people that this is not just theoretical, but that it leads on
specifically to active citizenship? Is my noble friend aware that in
Northern Ireland, where there was real concern about the transfer to
individual electoral registration, it has become the habit in secondary
schools to go right through the citizenship course with an end result
of registration on the electoral register and for eventual
voting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T11:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T11:33:21"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13102470000585" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000585">Baroness
Northover:</Member></B> Indeed, it has had a very positive effect in
that regard. As I answered an earlier question, the link between what
students will learn in their citizenship classes and their ability then
to take that forward to register to vote and to vote is very important.
I also note that within citizenship education students will be debating
all sorts of political and social issues, and they will be encouraged
to debate and make reasoned arguments and so on. I imagine that they
are going to be very lively

understand the concerns about the quality of decision-making? Some 30%
of appeals against initial asylum decisions were allowed, meaning that
nearly one-third were wrong. In more than one in 10 cases reviewed by
inspectors, selective information from the country of origin reports
had been used to deny claims. We have to get this right because asylum
should be granted only when it is genuinely needed, but there is now a
serious fear that those at great risk of violence are being denied a

concludes that there is no evidence that failed asylum seekers

ill treatment merely because of an unsuccessful asylum claim in the UK.
This was a conclusion upheld by the Court of Appeal in 2008. In 2012

the Scottish Parliament’s report is an interesting and reasoned
discussion of the early months of this policy. It suggests that it is
difficult to assess impact at this stage, a view that we share. That is
why we are undertaking a two-year evaluation on the effects of the

Scotland are affected by the bedroom tax, with an average cost to those
households of £50 a month. Some 80% of those households include
a disabled adult. Does the Minister still stand by his advice, as

discretionary housing payments—we topped them

Freud:</Member></B> My Lords, I must make the point that while the
party opposite likes to use the expression “bedroom tax”,
it is deeply misleading. A tax is when you take away money that people
earn. We are limiting the amount of money that the taxpayer pays to
people. There are 1.4 million one-bedroom properties, which become
available at the rate of roughly 100,000 a year. Quite a lot of people
are likely to want to keep an extra bedroom because they have the
resources and the desire to keep it. Therefore, there will be a period
of adjustment, and we are going through it. We are spending the
discretionary housing payment to allow that transition to happen in an
orderly

rented sector basis is the local housing allowance, which is paid on
the shape of the family who occupies. It is paid on the basis of how
many rooms are required. Until now, there has been an imbalance between

am conscious that we have had a number of debates on aspects of the EU
in recent months but there are two reasons why I feel that a debate on
the economic benefits is very important now. First, over the summer and
early autumn a number of companies and professional bodies have been
making their voices heard in support of our continued membership of the
EU. Secondly, I have been very concerned that discussion in the media
about the EU has tended to concentrate on issues other than economic
benefit. Immigration, our net budget contribution, state benefits and
health tourism, for example, all feature strongly. Each of 
<?notus-xml column=1184?>these is clearly important but some, such as health tourism, are not
just an EU matter. All these areas rightly reflect public concern and
so they need to be constantly reviewed and debated but, I submit, we
should do this as members of the EU, just as they do in the other
countries of the EU, so that we understand better, for example, state
benefit rules and how they should apply between countries, given the
enormous differences that
exist.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000068">However,
the issue of state benefits is not just a UK matter. I was interested
to note reports earlier this week that in Germany more than 10,000
British people are receiving unemployment benefit—some 10% of
the British population resident in Germany. That reflects the fact that
we live in a world in which national borders have less meaning.
Transport is easier and cheaper than it used to be and both employers
and employees want mobility of labour across borders. This is a
changing world and we cannot opt out of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T11:55:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000069">I
congratulate the Mayor of London on his leadership on this matter
earlier this week and on several previous occasions in explaining
London’s role as an international capital. However, perhaps the
Government should think further about how they can invest more quickly
in public services in areas where private sector employers recruit
workers in significant numbers from elsewhere in the EU, because that
can strain public services. I believe that that would build support for
the
EU<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T11:56:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

ago our net budget contribution, but that is less than 1% of annual
government expenditure. A number of other EU states are also net
contributors, but the economic benefits of our membership matter a
great deal more than how much we pay each year to belong. Of course we
should examine closely what we pay and fight our corner, but it is not
the central issue. We should never downgrade the overriding reason for
our being members of the EU. That reason is economic, because the size
of our economy, our growth prospects and the creation of new jobs in a
fast-changing world depend fundamentally on our continued membership of
the European
Union.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000071">I cut
my political teeth in the referendum in 1975, in the all-party yes
campaign in the north-east of England. The EU has since then proved to
be hugely important to the exporting success of the north-east of
England, which is the only part of the UK with a positive balance of
trade, a high proportion of which is with the EU. For that reason, I
want to draw attention to two firms which have committed themselves to
the north-east of England as result of foreign direct investment, both

Nissan has made it repeatedly clear—again, only a few days
ago—that the UK continuing as a member of the EU is very
important for the company. More than £125 million has been
committed to the Sunderland factory. It is a wonderful success story,
with more than 6,000 employees making vehicles which are exported into
the EU and across the world. The second firm is Hitachi. The president
of Hitachi recently confirmed that he met the Prime Minister last
spring and said that if the UK pulled out of the EU, it could 
<?notus-xml column=1185?>jeopardise £1 billion of funding for Britain’s railways
and nuclear energy. In August, Hitachi Rail Europe
said that its investment in an £82 million factory in Newton
Aycliffe resulted from its strategic decision that the UK should be its
gateway to the EU single market. I also understand that the Japanese

Engineering Employers’ Federation, which is a trade body for UK
manufacturing, recently reported that 85% of manufacturers say that
Britain must stay in the EU, leading from within and not putting
investment and jobs at risk. They want the single market to work
better, but they do not want to exit from it. They say that the UK must
remain part of the EU with “no ifs or buts”. They know
that the UK’s relationship with Europe and the EU is vital to
our economic success because the single market is our largest export
market. The British Chambers of Commerce has reported that although
businesses want more decisions made in the UK, most members think that
withdrawal from the EU would be bad for Britain. A CBI survey published
last month of more than 400 businesses showed that almost four out of
five firms favoured staying in the EU, including 77% of small and
medium-sized enterprises. Just 10% think it is in their interest for
the UK to leave the EU; that is 11% of SMEs. The CBI says that despite
frustrations over the current relationship and the burden of some
regulations, particularly employment law, the survey shows that most
businesses feel that the positives more than outweigh the negatives.
Those negatives are primarily seen to be unnecessary regulations. The
CBI wants to see rules implemented evenly across all member states,
with an end to the gold-plating of EU legislation in the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:00:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000074">What
then of financial services, which contribute £1 in £8 of
our tax revenues? The City of London Corporation made it clear in a
note this week that the financial sector based in the UK cannot be
treated as distinct from Europe. The reason is that London’s
role as a financial centre is international. The corporation points out
that financial markets in the EU and the UK are intermeshed in a common
regulatory structure. Non-European firms come to London because it is
both international and within the single market at the same time.
Crucially, and I quote directly from the

UK’s priority must be to oppose policies that could lead to the
fragmentation of that Market. Fragmentation of the Single Market in
financial services could drastically reduce the efficiency of the
Single Market and European businesses’ access to capital.
London’s position as the most prominent international financial
centre in the world would be put at risk by an imperfect Single Market
in financial services in which rules and access differed by level of

that we should withdraw from the EU is this: what problem are you

are several reasons why firms want to move into the UK, including the
gateway to the single market, the English language, the quality of our
legal system and our excellent workforce. For many, the single market
is the most important. A single market of 500 million people means that
they and we benefit from a common set of rules which enables businesses
to generate wealth without having to comply with many different sets of
regulations. We need to defend the single market and deepen it to drive
up UK jobs and growth. We need a continuous process of reform, but
completing the single market would further reduce internal barriers to
trade, particularly in services, which 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>our Government think could generate a 7% increase in GDP—a great
deal higher than the 0.4% of GDP that goes to our net budget
contribution. There are many discussions going on around regulation.
Some of them may be justified and there are discussions that will be
pursued in Brussels and elsewhere about this matter. However, we should
note the success of the Government in tackling regulatory issues and
their continuing work in that area. Some 1.4 million UK small
businesses are now exempt from certain EU accounting rules, which
demonstrates that the EU is willing to reduce red tape for small
businesses and it is in the interests of all member states that this
process should
continue.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000083">If
we left the EU, we would probably operate within a “most

view. There are no net economic benefits of the UK’s membership

the very first day that we joined the EU. Successive
Governments—including, I regret to say, the current
Government—have refused to commission a proper economic
cost-benefit analysis of our relationship with the EU. The dominant
pro-European bias in Whitehall, which takes its lead from the Foreign

second largest element of the 11% is the cost of resource
misallocation, which accounts for around 30% of the total. The common
agricultural policy, with its protectionism and overt subsidy of
uneconomic agriculture, has often been seen as the main villain when it
comes to resource misallocation, but that is now only a small part of
the overall picture. Much more important are the impacts on both basic
and high-technology manufacturing from tariff and non-tariff barriers.
In 2005, these were estimated by Patrick Minford and others to be of
the order of 3% of GDP. Nothing has significantly changed in the
intervening years to moderate that

Congdon is clear that a withdrawal from the EU would not lead to an

than the other way round. If the 3 million figure is correct, we are
probably talking 
<?notus-xml column=1189?>about well over 4 million European jobs resting on trade with us.
Therefore it is fanciful to think that the UK would not continue to
trade with the EU—it is just that we would probably do so via
free trade agreements. We would certainly not need to be tied into the
unsatisfactory Norwegian and Swiss arrangements which have already been
referred to. Just as now, a minority of our trade would be with the EU.
The proportion of our exports going to the EU has been declining for
several years and, once we eliminate the Rotterdam-Antwerp effect from

Watson of Invergowrie (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too,
congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, on initiating this important
debate. I am absolutely clear that membership of the EU is very much in
the best interests of the UK—in economic and social terms, and
in terms of the influence that the country can bring to bear both
within the EU and globally. I would be very concerned about our
isolation in relation to all of those aspects should we walk out on the

within it really are too important to be used as a means of dealing
with a little local difficulty within the Conservative Party, which is
what is happening with regard to the increasingly shrill voices that
the PM eventually answered with his plan for a referendum by 2017. The
Prime Minister claims that it will be to decide on changes that he
hopes—somewhat fancifully, I suggest—to negotiate.
However, if that fails to materialise then pressure from within his
party would surely mean that we would be stuck with a “Should we
stay or should we go?” vote. I would characterise that as the
Clash option, for those of a certain age and musical tastes. It is also
an uncertain road down which to travel. Fortunately, the Prime Minister
first has to clear a certain hurdle in 2015, which gives us some hope
of this vital matter being taken out of his hands.</hs_para>

Washington and three years as permanent representative in Brussels. He
has said that a Britain on the sidelines is not in anyone’s

even more, out of Europe—would not be in the US interest or in
the interests of our other major European partners. The noble Lord,
Lord Browne, a former boss of BP, one of the most senior non-executive

that the UK must stay in the EU. Surely that level of support cannot
seriously be questioned. Furthermore, significant numbers of those
surveyed believed that the current relationship had a positive impact
on their own businesses on issues such as the ability to buy and sell
products without taxes and tariffs on trade flows in the EU markets

with zeal and hyperbole for us to withdraw, it obviously makes good
sense for this House to debate the economic impact of our membership
even if the economic arguments can never be the whole story—as,
indeed, they were not when the British people voted in an “in or
out” referendum in 1975. In that context, I warmly welcome the
initiative by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley—and, indeed, his

worse than study the Regent’s University report on the costs,

Lord Shipley, also referred and which was launched earlier this week by
Mr Peter Sutherland. Even that sort of detailed study of the subject
matter of our debate today suffers from one major weakness: it is not
actually possible to calculate with precision where Britain’s
economy would stand today if we had not joined the European Community
in 1973, and where it would be likely to stand were we to withdraw at
some point in the future. That is why, personally, I treat with some
scepticism the precisely quantified predictions of both supporters and
opponents of membership as to its impact. These have to be qualitative

start with trade. We saw the removal of myriad barriers that used to
impede trade between this country and the rest of Europe before we
joined the customs union, and then we took the lead in shaping the
single market. Imperfect though that market may be, what we now have
has led to a huge expansion in mutual trade to the benefit of our
economic actors, in both the goods and services sectors, and of our
consumers. Outside the European Union, many of those benefits would not
have occurred or would be at risk if we were to leave, as we ceased to

unit on trade policy matters, we have benefited both from the
protection that that provides against discriminatory treatment by third
countries and the leverage that it gives in prising open the markets of
others. If noble Lords doubt that, they should talk to the Scotch
Whisky Association. Those who say that we would be better placed if we
promoted our exports outside the European Union need to explain why the
Germans, who have been in the Union for longer than us, have fared so
much better in their trade with China than we have. The Mayor of
London, trailing his Eurosceptic robe through Beijing, should provide

will talk in particular about the topic of economic impact, not about a

noble Lord, Lord Hannay, said, one thing is certain—that there
is no certainty about the economic impact of the United
Kingdom’s membership of the European Union. The excellent
document that the Library has produced shows the cost to range from
between minus 6% to plus 8%; and as the noble Baroness said, the new
UKIP document—written by Tim Congdon, for whom I have great
respect—says that the figure will be minus 11%. So the figure
ranges from between minus 11% to plus 8%. It is probably
anybody’s choice. The problem is that each person answering the
question grasps a different part of this

want to say two things about the figure of 11% arrived at by Tim
Congdon. There are two large items in his calculations. The cost of
regulation is 5.5% of GDP, and the other major cost is resource

subtracted from 11%, leaves about 2%. So those two numbers are worth
examining in more detail.</hs_para>

list the social directives that are supposed to be costly. They include
the safety and heath at work directive, the works council directive,
the parental leave directive, the race directive, the equal treatment

directive. Let us suppose that we were not in the EU. Would we
necessarily not have some of those directives? Would we not have the
race directive? Would we actually say, “No, we want a racist
society”? Would we not have a gender directive of some kind? Do
we not already have health and safety legislation? Are we going to
jettison that? A proper comparison would be:

when Tim Congdon costs resource allocation, the one definite number he

computed from a study of tariff and non-tariff barriers in the EU by
Patrick Minford which is about eight years old. I have not had time to
look at it in detail, nor do I have time to talk about it in detail,
but I believe that some of those tariff barriers have disappeared. We
ought again to calculate properly whether there are still such tariff
barriers within EU trade, and if so, determine whether they are likely
to be removed, or whether we will have to live with them. Also, if we

Wrigglesworth (LD):</Member></B><B> </B>My Lords, it is a great honour
and a great pleasure to address your Lordships’ House for the
first time. I do so with some trepidation as it has quickly become
apparent that I have a great deal to learn about the workings of your
Lordships’ House, not to mention its myriad nooks and crannies.
However, that learning process has been made easier and more pleasant
by the warmth of welcome from the staff and from all sides of your
Lordships’ House, particularly from so many old friends and
colleagues, and also by the excellent induction programme provided by
officers of the House and by my noble
friends.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000119">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:34:38"></hs_TimeCode>
am also grateful to my two sponsors for their support and
encouragement. In one sense it was my noble friend Lord Rodgers who
first got me into all of this. It was in his victorious by-election
campaign in my home town of Stockton-on-Tees way back in 1962 that I
cut my political teeth. That process was aided and abetted later in
that decade by my noble friend and former student flatmate Lord
McNally, with whom I was actively engaged in student politics, among
other things. It was a great honour and pleasure later in my life to
represent Stockton-on-Tees in the other place. I thought it might be
wise, before speaking today, to look up the maiden speech that I made
nearly 40 years ago. I have to tell noble Lords that the only thing it
reminded me of was my
age.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000120">The
north-east and its history have been responsible for moulding my
politics and my attitudes from my earliest days. From up there, Leeds
and Manchester are down south. The scourge of unemployment has left an
indelible scar on me and many others over the generations, not least on
the first noble Earl, Lord Stockton, who, as Harold Macmillan, served
as the town’s MP between 1924 and 1945. The region has been
transformed in the past few decades and has many vibrant new
industries, but it is profoundly 
<?notus-xml column=1195?>depressing that, after all these years, the unemployment rate still
remains the highest in the United Kingdom. I have spent most of my life
trying to do something about that, serving on bodies such as the
Northern Development Company, the Northern Way, the NewcastleGateshead
Initiative, as chairman of the Northern CBI and latterly as deputy
chairman of  the advisory panel for the Government’s
regional growth fund. I am sure that if it had not been for these, and
the work of many other bodies such as One North East and the new LEPs,
things would have been worse than they are today.</hs_para>

passed a vote no confidence in me in 1987, I started a new business
career in London and the north-east. After a few years of working in
industrial property, a partner and I launched UK Land Estates. It has
become one of the biggest investors and developers of industrial and
commercial property in the north-east with more than 2,000 businesses
now as tenants. I declare an interest in that company and in my own
business, the Durham Group. Until last year I also had the pleasure of
chairing the Port of Tyne. It supports some 10,500 jobs in the region
and contributes £0.5 billion to the region’s gross value
added. During my time it has grown to become the largest trust port in
the United Kingdom by turnover and profit, overtaking the likes of
Dover some time ago. It is one of the major trading gateways of the
United Kingdom, connecting United Kingdom businesses to five continents
via the major European
ports.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000122">That
brings me to the subject of today’s debate, introduced so ably
by my noble friend and fellow Northumbrian Lord Shipley. The north-east
region is the only United Kingdom region showing a balance of trade
surplus. A large proportion of that surplus is in the £7 billion
of exports handled by the Port of Tyne. Most significantly, it is the
fourth largest import/export terminal in Europe. The main reason for
that is that virtually all the vehicles exported by Nissan from the
United Kingdom are shipped through the Tyne. As my noble friend said,
the Nissan plant at Sunderland is the largest and most productive
vehicle-manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom. It is now
producing more than half a million cars a year, 80% of which are
exported. It directly employs 6,400 people plus many more in the supply
chain. Since it came to the United Kingdom in 1986 it has invested
£3.5 billion in the plant and is investing more today. Its
contribution to the north-east and to the national economy is massive.
It is not surprising, therefore, that Nissan has said that
Britain’s membership of the European Union is very important to
it and that it wants to see the United Kingdom remain part of the
single market, with its uniform standards and tariffs. I believe that
its views very much reflect business sentiment across the United
Kingdom. The most recent Chambers of Commerce survey showed that most
businesses think that withdrawal from the EU would be bad for Britain,
and CBI surveys reflect the same
views.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000123">All my
business experience tells me that confidence is the most important
ingredient in any investment or spending decision. I have worked in two
banks, served on the boards of many companies—large, small,
public, private and co-op—and I sometimes think that the 
<?notus-xml column=1196?>political community does not understand the vital importance of
confidence in business decisions. Nothing undermines confidence more
than uncertainty, and there is uncertainty at the moment over our
country’s future in the EU. If that uncertainty increases,
confidence will be damaged, but the consequences will not be immediate
plant closures; instead, decisions will be taken to build the next
model in Spain and not in Swindon, Solihull, Halewood, or Sunderland.
That will lead to the plants gradually declining and the jobs
decreasing. And who will suffer? The national economy, of course. But
most directly it will be those 6,400 people at Nissan, and
others like them. Even more tragically, it will be those without jobs,
whose hopes will be dashed and whose families will continue to suffer.
Talk of referenda and other issues in Westminster is all very well and
may be unavoidable, but I hope that we will never forget the potential
consequences for many vulnerable
people.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102470000514" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000514"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:41:01"></hs_TimeCode></I>12.41

It<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:42:10"></hs_TimeCode> is strange
that those who come from the northern parts of the country always speak
slightly more seriously, but there is something behind the words they

probable by my calculations that the noble Lord, Lord Wrigglesworth,

noble friend Lady Noakes and I agree on so many things, but not
necessarily on the things she says. Trade has been my lifeblood and
fate. The European Union is our biggest trading partner by far, and it
also represents our biggest deficit; with the exception of Ireland,
with which we have a big surplus, we have a deficit with practically
all the EU countries. Our biggest trading partner is still, just, the
United States, followed by Germany. But it is not so much the EU that
counts; it is the international development and activity that follows
on a global

have managed to attract, in recent years, a sizeable volume of foreign
investment in the United Kingdom, not just in manufacturing or in

growth areas, surprisingly enough, are those that used to be those of
our Commonwealth partners, where the added value is created, in
agriculture, minerals or semi-manufactures. At the same time, we have
encouraged successful entrepreneurs from those countries to come and
invest in the United Kingdom. It will not surprise your Lordships to

putting a case for the benefits of UK membership of the European Union
will not convince many people. It is important to recognise the levers
that we have and those that we face, and not to argue this in a vacuum.
For instance, we will never have a mass-circulation press that loves
Europe. It is a fact—and, in the words of the noble Lord, Lord
Adebowale, on Tuesday—we should “get over it”. The
media are more balanced about Europe, but even that leads to hysterical
reactions from some newspapers about pro-European bias in the media. We
have also to accept that the UK will never love Europe. Except for
Guernsey and Jersey, with huge consequences for those islands, we have
not had foreign enemy troops tramping across our borders; we are an
island, and proud of it. We can never appreciate the strong emotional
element that applies to most of continental Europe about the need to
bond on economic and social
alliances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:49:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:49:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:49:06"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T12:47:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000133" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000133">That
emotional commitment was palpable when I was a member of the European
TUC for nearly 10 years. You have only to visit Jersey or
Guernsey on Liberation Day—in Liberation Square, for
example—to witness the effect that invasion has on people. We
have to accept that our hearts will never be in the EU, and that we can
live with that. However, if our hearts are not there, our heads are in
Europe and I am sure that they will continue to
be.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000134" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000134">What are
the levers which will effect this? One is the number of countries
desperate for entry to the club, which will convince people that there
must be perks. Another is the support for social Europe from those
seeking to protect workers’ rights, which will win arguments.
However, it is the support of significant sections of business which
will win the day. Others have already mentioned last month’s CBI
survey, in connection with YouGov, which indicated that 78% of
companies—both small and large—favour staying in the EU.
I will not elaborate on that except to say that the majority of
companies believe the EU has a positive impact on their businesses
without prohibitive taxes or tariffs, recruiting staff from across the
EU and participating in EU supply chains. CBI companies were against
attempts to create similar employment laws across the EU, working hours
being the least popular. This is hardly surprising, since the UK has a 
<?notus-xml column=1199?>higher proportion of overtime worked than most other countries, with
employees working longer hours and all the social consequences we know
about.</hs_para>

the UK has influence on EU policies that affect them: 72% felt there
was significant or some influence and 27% felt there was not very much
or no influence. So support is not enthusiastic but it is absolutely
solid. As I have been involved in negotiations most of my life, I
realise that you cannot walk away from difficult problems and you
cannot opt out when the going gets tough. As I have said before, the
TUC and CBI meet as social partners at European level. They know about
tackling difficult issues and, for a while, when some of the
employment-related directives were being introduced belatedly into the
UK, it might have looked as if the unions were making progress and the
employers were not. Since then, the boot has been on the other foot.
They will have differences on regulation of the market and
workers’ rights but no one can afford to throw their teddy bear
down just because a problem is
difficult.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000136">We
can do some things now, without waiting for a referendum or fresh
negotiations; I thank Richard Corbett for some of this information.
First, there is already a requirement for EU proposals to go to
national parliaments first, with eight weeks’ notice before they
are dealt with in Brussels. We should implement this, so that Ministers
appear before Parliament, or the specialist parliamentary committee, to
explain the issues. Secondly, there is already a procedure to check on
subsidiarity: to prevent the EU straying beyond its remit. National
parliaments can object to European Commission proposals. Thirdly, the
Government have a duty to maximise their impact in the European
Parliament and are not doing so. Tory MEPs were trafficked onto the
goonish fringes and this was an unworthy
move.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000137">We are
all calling for more transparency in the EU, yet our own Government
have failed to strengthen Commons scrutiny of Ministers and failed to
publicise their proposals to safeguard the City of London. I could have
mentioned the European arrest warrant or cross-border tax evasion, but
there is insufficient time. We should not forget that tax fraud, tax
evasion and tax avoidance are of such magnitude as to have an effect on
government deficits. Acknowledging that employment protections are
unpopular with employers, we cannot have a single market where
workers’ rights are diminished in a race to the bottom.
Unfairness leads to distrust in institutions and, as I have said

country where he has striven so hard to make that region more
prosperous. I would also like to thank my noble friend Lord Shipley for

made in opposition to our membership, particularly by the noble
Baroness, Lady Noakes, overlooked some facts that others have raised.
In particular, the noble Baroness spoke a great deal about the burden
of regulation. I recognise that it is difficult to measure the impact
of this, but the OECD has produced tables—a little out of
date—which show that the burden of regulation in the product
market of selected countries puts the United Kingdom at the top of the
list of those which are least restrictive. It was even ahead of the
United States of America and way ahead of Australia, New Zealand,
Poland and Greece.</hs_para>

not belittled by our membership of the European Union, as I think the
noble Baroness implied. The focus of our trade is, rightly, with the
500 million consumers—rich consumers, by and
large —in the European Union. This is a highly
competitive market which also improves the quality of our production.
Access to other countries is greatly assisted by the work of the
European Union in opening trade to no fewer than 37 economies around
the world, including South Korea, Singapore, South Africa and Mexico.
The recent green trade deal with Canada is likely to see British
exports increase by an estimated
29%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000142">Our
country could not expect to have such a high rating in attracting

have seen in a report from TheCityUK that 60% of decision-makers
specifically cited access to EU markets as a core reason for choosing
the United Kingdom over other financial centres. Japan in
particular—already mentioned by a number of contributors to this

created 130,000 jobs. The Japanese Government have been very outspoken

alternatives that have been alluded to, particularly in relation to
Norway and Switzerland, would certainly not be attractive in that we

remaining  in the European Union for economic reasons are
overwhelming and I hope that this message gets across to the wider
electorate. The figures mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Donaghy,
about the CBI’s views are telling. At the Glasgow conference the
Institute of Directors produced figures showing that 80% of its members

Wrigglesworth, on his maiden speech, which was witty, meaty and suave.
By “suave” I do not mean to criticise; I mean that his

shown, all debates in this country about the European Union now take
place in the shadow of a future referendum on Britain’s
membership. To me it is of the utmost importance that there should be a
full and thorough public debate on this issue and I am worried that
this might not happen—that is the burden of most of what I have
to say. There is a real danger that Britain could sleepwalk towards
exit, with many of the public simply being unaware of the seriousness
and complexity of the issues involved.</hs_para>

pro-European—indeed, something of a passionate one. My noble
friend seemed to indicate that we do not exist. We do exist. Many
people like me feel an emotional, not just pragmatic, commitment to the
European Union and what it has accomplished for the continent over the
past several decades. However, I am not one of those who hold that it
would be economic suicide for Britain to quit the Union. There are
scenarios in which the country could survive quite well, perhaps even
prosper, although its influence in the wider world would be sharply and
irretrievably reduced.</hs_para>

not be the marginal issue that many citizens appear to think. It would
be the most consequential decision that the country had taken for 60
years and involve a protracted and wrenching adjustment. To me, leaving
the EU would mean the reinvention of the country. The idea that the UK
could simply leave the EU and become the same as it was in 1950, going
back to having some kind of autonomy in the wider world, is simply
ridiculous. An enormous process of reinvention of identity would have
to occur. If it did, the country could in principle be successful, but
such a course of action should not be contemplated without intensive
and, above all, informed public discussion. I hope that this discussion
in your Lordships’ House will be the first of many that will
involve the wider citizenry, not just a proportion of people in this
establishment.</hs_para>

problems to which Britain would have to respond if it left are easy to
state but, as my noble friend Lord Desai said, not as easy to quantify
as many on either side of the debate seem to think. I hesitate to
disagree with a colleague from the LSE, especially an economist who
admits to the fallibility of economics—that is something to
behold—but I spent the past six months of my life studying the
economic statistics of the EU and I know that some of the assertions
that are made are robust and some are 
<?notus-xml column=1202?>not. For example, we know that the single market has made a fundamental
contribution to the overall wealth—the GDP—of the EU,
including this country. The calculation of a 2.2% net addition as a
result of the single market before the 2008 crisis is robust. What are
not so robust are the employment statistics. We do not really know.
Between 2 million and 3 million jobs here depend on the EU, but the
counterfactuals are so difficult to state that no one can simply assert
that bluntly. It has been demonstrated, however, that the financial
services industry would inevitably suffer if the UK left the EU. One
can forget the idea that Britain could become a sort of offshore
banking centre like Singapore. London could perhaps do that if it
seceded from the rest of the UK, but there is no chance of that
happening. There is no doubt that leaving the EU would have a serious
impact on the financial services industry.</hs_para>

subtle argument that most of the important economic losses would stem
from factors that are not wholly economic. Here I would reverse the
conventional wisdom about Britain losing sovereignty as a result of its
membership of the EU. It can be demonstrated that every member of the
EU gains sovereignty from being a member and does so when acting
alone—not just as a member. This can be done easily by reference
to the proposal mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, for the
EU-US free trade agreement. That will be the single most important
source of wealth and job generation for both sides that has ever been
established. Could anyone think that Britain outside the EU, feebly
knocking on the door and timidly asking to be let in, represents more
sovereignty than if we were an active participant in the European Union
when it negotiates such an agreement? That would be
ridiculous.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102470000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000151">I

some noble Lords will know, I never wanted to join the Common Market
and I believe now that it would benefit this country if we left the
European Union. Noble Lords will recall that when Harold Macmillan
recommended that we join the then Common Market, or the EEC, he said
that one of the major reasons was that Britain deserved to have the
chill wind of competition. We have certainly had that. Our

Shipley, referred to a number of firms, the CBI and other organisations

referendum, Lord Stokes—he was then Sir Donald Stokes, the
chairman of BLMC—wrote to all my constituents and said that if
we left the Common Market they would all lose their jobs and the car
industry in this country would be destroyed. We decided to remain in
and, of course, the car industry was destroyed by our remaining in
rather than the reverse. I might add that many of the people who have
been quoted were the very people who recommended that we should join
the euro. It is fortunate that we did not take their advice then.
Perhaps we should not take their advice

quote some figures. We have heard a lot about the benefits of being a
member of the EU, so let us now hear about some of the disbenefits. For
a start, we pay a contribution of between £10 billion and
£12 billion for the purpose of being a member of the
EU. That represents £55 million per day and translates into
£150 per person every year. In the case of a family, it is
£500 per year per family. We are arguing about
£100 on energy bills, yet every year each family pays
£500 to belong to the European Union.</hs_para>

about the trade figures, so let us look at some of them. In 2007, our
exports to the European Union were £318 billion. In 2012, they
were £278 billion. That means that, instead of becoming a better
market for us, Europe is becoming a worse one. In 2007, exports to the
rest of the world were £370 billion and in 2012 they
were £394 billion, so our trade with Europe is declining but our
trade with the rest of the world is going up. I think that we should
take note of that. Furthermore, the current adverse balance of trade is
going up—shooting up, in fact. In 2007, the deficit was
£40.9 billion; in 2012 it was an enormous £83.2 million.
So there are figures on the other side, of which we should take notice.
The EU is a declining
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000157" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000157">Unfortunately,
I do not have time to deal with more aspects, but I want to refer to
the democratic deficit. Of course, I would like to see this reduced to
nil and for us to get our own democracy and central government back.
Unfortunately, that is not easy. As the President of the Commission,
José Manuel Barroso, said, David Cameron’s attempt to
renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the EU was doomed before
it began. That really says everything about the centralised

never agree on what that number might be, but it would be a number,
certainly. As the noble Lord, Lord Shipley, said, an even greater
threat is the future loss of investment, which we would have if we
stayed in the single market, which we would not have if we left the
European Union. I think that would be quite dramatic. It would be
dramatic in manufacturing. It is difficult to see how we would get any
manufacturing at all, where manufacturing is generally producing for
more than 50 million to 60 million people. People will want to put in a

a Eurosceptic friend of mine—a former Conservative Minister with
whom I have been discussing Europe for 20 years—said to me the
other day, “We could do better than Switzerland and
Norway”. I asked how and he said something very similar to what
the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, has said. He replied,
“We’ve got great power because we have a balance of
payments deficit with the European continent—with the other
members of the EU—so we could really put the pressure on them
and cut off their exports to the UK”. I said, “So what
you are actually planning is to declare war not merely on the EU but on
the WTO—on the international trading system”. He did not
really have an answer to that. I do not think that it is a practical
possibility. It is extraordinary to think that we would leave the EU
with all the risks involved to go into some uncertain
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:21:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

error in what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said about the rest of
the world. She seemed to think that there is a trade-off in our trade
with the rest of the world and the single market in the sense that, if
you have more of the one, you have less of the other. In fact, there is
a negative trade-off: if you have more of the one, you have more of the
other. The whole point of the single market is that with a greater
specialisation within that market, the greater competitiveness that
emerges as a result of that specialisation, the economies of scale and
the longer production runs, you are more competitive outside the EU.
Therefore, far from the EU being an incubus for us in developing non-EU
markets, our presence in it is actually a major gain. That is a very

Wrigglesworth—an old friend. Whether he will actually achieve
the holding of the balance of power in this House is open for later

undoubtedly going to make. He will bring a sharpness in the sense of
realism. He has, I believe, been described as “suave”. I

interests which are relevant to the subject. We have already heard
about the impact of EU membership on the funding of university research
in the United Kingdom. As High Steward of Cambridge University, I
should like to say that the real dependence that Cambridge University,
which in many ways is the leading science university in the United
Kingdom, has on EU funding is immensely significant and would of course
be threatened by an EU withdrawal. Secondly, I chair a number of
companies, all of which are deeply dependent on trade within the

individuals, companies and, increasingly, countries whose good will and
decisions are going to be vital to Britain’s future and which
have warned us of the consequences of withdrawal. That list is perhaps
in some danger of becoming a kind of litany, recited by pro-Europeans
such as myself; nevertheless, the list stands and it grows: the US
State Department, the German Chancellor, Nissan cars and Hitachi.
Earlier this month, a survey showed that one-third of British
manufacturers said that they would be less likely to invest if we quit,
and a further third said that they would have to make significant
changes to their business model were we to

on the economic impact of membership, I should like to focus not on
that lengthening list and the current benefits which we might
jeopardise but on the vast and new opportunities that we would forgo in
world trade; namely—and it has been raised already—the
momentum of the EU’s bilateral trade and investment agreements,
signed, about to be signed and now being negotiated. Taken together,
they represent an extraordinary new landscape of trade, and if we
excluded ourselves, we would mar and impoverish our prospects as a
trading nation for decades and maybe centuries to

deals was with South Korea in July 2011. As tariffs have fallen with
Korea, exports have soared, giving the EU, for the first time in
15 years, a trade surplus with Korea. On the 18th of this
month came the comprehensive economic and trade agreement with Canada.
It is actually the EU’s first free-trade

the agreement with Japan—the second biggest Asian trading
partner of the EU—which could boost EU exports by a third,
creating, it is calculated, up to 400,000 new jobs in Europe. The
current round of talks this week in Brussels involves powerful EU
pressure on Japanese non-tariff barriers, which is probably the key
with Japan. Talks with India are under way, although at a much earlier
stage, and then of course there is the really big one: the
Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, which was born of the
EU-US high-level working group on jobs and growth, involving a great

£119 billion to the GDP of the EU. It is not going to be an easy
thing to negotiate but it is an imperative for both sides. Let us

that we should be looking at is not just an arithmetic calculation of
present benefits and penalties. Underpinning all this is a recognition
of change. I should like to end by saying that six years ago when I
stepped down as the chairman of the British-German bilateral
Königswinter conference, a member of the German Parliament got
up and attacked Britain’s attitude towards the EU, saying that
we lacked vision and commitment. I said in reply, “Look, we
started this European journey from very different places. We started it
as the bankrupt victor; you started it as a country which had been
disgraced, divided and occupied. We began at a different place”.
What matters is where we are now, and the place where we are now is a

Obviously it is now dawning on the Government that that is exactly what
they are doing. You change by building on what has gone before. You
complete the single market by reviewing the rules, bringing them up to

investors in car-making, technology and nuclear industries, it is also
the view of 85% of the EEF members, who said that they would vote to
remain in the European Union if there were a referendum now. This is
because people in business know that it takes months and years of hard
work to build up the trust, confidence, connections and knowledge to
sell and trade successfully in overseas markets. EEF members do not
want to see their years of effort in Europe wasted by the incompetent

could doubt that the impact has been of major importance. The European
treaties are the UK’s supreme constitution, over and above our
laws, as per the European Communities Act 1972. The UK’s cash
contribution to the EU is second only to that of Germany. Since 1973,
the UK has paid to the EU some £370 billion and received in
return £180 billion—this to an organisation whose own
auditors say that 90% of the EU’s entire budget has been
materially affected in some way by fraud or unaccounted spending. If
sending to the EU some £12 billion net in 2013 is perhaps not of
major impact in relation to the total UK budget, the economic cost of
regulation is. The European Commission itself puts the EU costs of
regulation at £600 billion a year for all the members. Business
for Britain, supported by more than 500 business leaders,
has told us that since the 2010 general election, Brussels has handed

research and development will drive growth. We will not achieve growth
with a low-income economy. We cannot go down that road. If you are to
maintain that level of research and development expenditure, and come
out of the European Union, you have to answer the question that I think
was asked by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, and the noble Baroness,
Lady Noakes: where does that money come from? It will not be replaced
by the private sector or the public sector in Britain. Inevitably, that
would impact on us. My noble friend Lord Haskel gave the classic
example of the space industry. Although I have said it on a number of
occasions in the House, it is not well known that Britain still has the
second-largest and second most-advanced aerospace industry in the
world. There is hardly a satellite going around this planet that does
not have British instruments on it. Often, they are of major
importance. A lot of that expenditure on research and development has
come from the money that we have received from the European Union.

also want to put this in a political context. I am very conscious that
when people making economic decisions do not take into account the
political circumstances, they often make mistakes. Politicians who make
decisions without taking into account the economic world in which they
operate can make very big mistakes. If you look back on
Britain’s relationship with the evolving European Union, many
people would say that we made very big mistakes in our political
calculations. You can go back to the famous headline in the <I>Daily
Mail</I> around 1908—I cannot remember exactly when—which
said, “Fog in the Channel: Europe 
<?notus-xml column=1211?>isolated”, or perhaps it was “Fog in the Channel:

often ask the question: Why are the British so diffident about Europe?
One of the reasons is that we are an island nation. Another reason,
which was alluded to a few moments ago, is that we have never been
defeated and occupied. We are almost alone among the European states
and certainly alone among the major states. We have always been the
victor. If you ask continental Europeans about the importance of the
European Union, often they will put first that it has maintained the
peace. The majority of British people do not see it in that way; it
does not have the same weight here. That is a very important factor in
people’s attitudes to
Europe<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:43:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

balance between politics and economics, having had a view of ourselves
as being separate and having won the two world wars, in the period
after the Second World War we looked at where our market was going to
be while the European Union was developing as the European Economic
Community. Initially, we had the Commonwealth Party, which argued for
the Commonwealth as the market, for which I had great support at the
time. As an internationalist in that sense, I rather liked the idea.
Having failed on that front, we turned to the European Free Trade Area,
which we set up. Again, it did not
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:44:06"></hs_TimeCode>. People who

change is again taking place in the world now. The United States will
no longer be the dominant world power as it was after the Second World

economically or whatever. I do not think that that is happening but the
US will not have the same dominance that it had previously. In many
respects, it is rather like Britain in the early 20th
century when we had lost our total dominance of the world. People used
to say that 95% of goods travelling around the world were in British
ships. Now we say that about 88% of the advanced technology of the
internet is driven by the United

it is time for Britain to stop the half-in, half-out dance. We are
doing ourselves enormous damage. My fear about the referendum—I
do not support it and I am not a great fan of referendums at the best
of times—is not that it will not be won. I am sure that it will
be won, but my fear is that there will be a relatively low turnout.
Those people who want to take Britain out will continue to fight on
that front. There will be the same problem as there will be if we do
not win the referendum convincingly in Scotland, although I hope that
we will. People take heart, although often it is because people are not
voting in the way that one hopes. I hope that the British people have
the wit to see that the politics has changed dramatically and, 
<?notus-xml column=1212?>along with it, the economics of the world. We had better face up to that

important debate and it is an important time for our country to have
these discussions. Before I move to the substance of my speech, I could
not possibly not congratulate my noble friend Lord Wrigglesworth on his
fabulous speech, which, as the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, said, was
delivered with such verve and
conviction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:46:45"></hs_TimeCode>. My
acquaintanceship with my noble friend goes back to SDP days when he was
one of the grandees and I was one of the workers. It is very nice to

debate is hugely significant in the sense that, while most speakers
have spoken from more or less the same hymn sheet, some speakers have
not. Of course, it is important to mention the contribution made by the
noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, as well as that of the noble Lords, Lord
Stevens of Ludgate and Lord Stoddart of Swindon. These debates on the
other side of the fence to most of us will be hugely significant as we
move forward to cross swords over the referendum campaign. I was not
surprised to hear what the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, said. She
quoted Professor Congdon and Professor Minford who, distinguished as
they are, are also known to be very long-standing critics of EU
membership<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:48:01"></hs_TimeCode>. In a
sense, it might have been more fruitful if we had heard from more
authoritative and more impartial sources on the other side of the camp.
I regret that we did not get that. However, the noble Lord, Lord Desai,
illustrated ably why their analysis needs further scrutiny and I am
sure, particularly since the paper by Professor Congdon is relatively
recent, that research institutes will analyse his findings very
seriously<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:48:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lady Noakes, also made a point about EU jobs that are engaged in trade
from the EU to the United Kingdom. I think she used the figure of 4
million jobs, rather than the widely accepted figure in terms of UK
jobs relating to trade with the United Kingdom. There was a difference
of 1 million on her side. I would argue that while we are talking about
3 million jobs that may be lost if we disengage from the European
Union, the noble Baroness says that there would be 4 million jobs and
that therefore the European Union would be loath to disengage from us,
which would give us the benefits of non-tariff barriers, free trade and
so on. Of course, 4 million jobs spread across 27 states with a
population of 420 million 
<?notus-xml column=1213?>is a very much smaller impact than the impact that it would have on a
single country—that of the United
Kingdom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000202">I
turn now to recent debates on the cost of welfare through inward
immigration, because that has become the flavour of the time and it
needs rebutting. There is clear evidence to show that EU migrants pay
more in taxes than they receive in benefits and services here in the
United Kingdom. The Department for Work and Pensions recently published
figures for 2011. Of those receiving working-age benefits, it is true
that 25% were from within the EU, but Poland, which had the highest
figure of those receiving benefits, was in the seventh slot, behind
Asia, Africa, the Middle East and several other countries. Of EU
accession countries, only one figured in the top 20 of countries from
which people claim benefits in the United Kingdom. That compares to the
10% of Britons who claim benefits in Germany alone, so it goes both
ways and we must not allow this debate to run away. The idea that
migrants from the accession countries and from the wider EU are coming
here for some sort of benefit or health tourism needs to be looked at
more
carefully<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:51:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000203">The
free movement of peoples is also enormously significant in terms of its
impact for us in the United Kingdom. The Centre for Economics and
Business Research estimates that if we curbed EU
migration—mostly young people, in terms of demographics, who are
coming into an ageing society and who will ameliorate the impact of the
demographic changes of ageing here in significant proportions—it
would cost our economy something like £60 billion, or 2% of GDP,
per year by 2050 and increase public borrowing by something like 0.5%.
Moreover, we also benefit from inward tourism from the EU. Some 19
million visits were conducted by EU citizens in 2012 and some £7
billion was spent
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:52:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000204">To
conclude, I come to the very important point made by the noble Lord,
Lord Giddens, that this is not just a dry cost-benefit analysis, not
just about how many pounds in and euros out. What matters to our trade
and our economic position is not just money. What matters is the future
of our young people, the status of our country internationally and the
debt we owe succeeding generations if we do not take the right

behalf of the Opposition Front Bench to the noble Lord, Lord
Wrigglesworth, and welcome him to the House. I have known him for the
best part of four decades, I am afraid to say. For me, he has always
been a man of solid principle, unfailing good humour and boundless
resilience and it is good to see that those qualities are still much in
evidence. When he first got into the House of Commons he was at one
stage known as Roy Jenkins’s seat warmer, so that the great man
could continue to linger a little longer over lunch before he took his
seat in the Commons. I would say, on the basis of his performance in

Lord, Lord Shipley, for putting down this debate. He made a very
comprehensive, well argued case for Europe, and I do not disagree with
a word. We have heard many excellent speeches. It is a timely debate.
No one has mentioned that today the Prime Minister is in Brussels at a
European Council meeting which has, as one of its main purposes, the
discussion of the digital economy, innovation and trade in services, so
it is a very appropriate day to be debating the single market. I should
like some assurance from the Government that they are taking this
opportunity very seriously, because when one looks at the digital
economy, economic estimates are that if we had a proper single market
in digital this would add 4% to 5% to European GDP. Looking, for
instance, at telephones, whereas the US and China have three or four
major operators with a single set of rules for their whole economies,
we still have hundreds of operators and 28 different
rulebooks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000207" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0001.htm#13102470000207">Similarly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:56:28"></hs_TimeCode>,
when one looks at internet commerce, there is enormous scope for
expansion but we have to have common rules on online content and online

on privacy and data protection, we have to deal with customer
worries—a lot of people will not use the internet for shopping
because they worry about making payments and their details being
disclosed—and we have to have a copyright system for the digital

Prime Minister has gone to Brussels today on another campaign to cut EU
regulation. There is nothing wrong with trying to improve EU
regulation, but surely what he should have been doing is emphasising
the potential, for Britain and the rest of Europe, that real progress
towards deepening the integration of the single market could make.
Although it is always very nice to see the noble Lord, Lord Newby, on
the Bench opposite, it would be so much better if we had a Conservative
Minister there who could tell us where the Conservatives stand on the
necessary sacrifices of sovereignty and the compromises that have to be
made in the European Union if we are going to bring about that
deepening of the single market. There is no point just saying,
“Wouldn’t it be lovely if we had a digital single
market?” Yes, it would be lovely if we had a digital single
market, but we have to be prepared to compromise on sovereignty and
negotiate. Are this Government really prepared to do
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:57:55"></hs_TimeCode>? In fact,

on this side of the House fully support improved regulation, but let us
remember that it is much better to have one European rulebook if you
are a business operating inside the European Union, rather than 28

why the Germans and the Swedes can so successfully compete in world

export more to us than we to them. That is almost certainly rubbish.
For instance, take the car industry, which is one of our most
successful export areas. We would face a tariff of 9.8% if we were not
part of the single market. Still, more than 50% of the car production
in the UK goes to Europe. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes,

trade agreements through the EU lower trade barriers and increase
access to markets. If the EU completed all trade deals currently under

particular, independent analysis commissioned by the Government has
found that the net benefits to the UK of the EU-US free trade agreement
currently under negotiation could add up to 0.35% to the UK’s

ability to conclude such free trade agreements in a world where the WTO

two things about trading elsewhere to the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes.
First, as several noble Lords have said, there is no trade-off between
trading to the EU and to the rest of the world. The more a company
trades in one part of the world, the more likely it is to be good at
trading somewhere else. Secondly, we want many more companies to start
trading, and the logical place for them to start, particularly if they
are small, is with the EU. For a small company thinking about foreign
trade, the prospect of doing it in Brazil, China and India is almost a
bankrupting prospect. You do not have the time. You do not have the
money. You do not have the knowledge to do it. The only logical place
to start is the EU. That will continue to be the

being part of the single market helps UK businesses to attract inward

must become more

centrepiece of our engagement with the EU. When my colleague in another
place, Ed Davey, was at BIS he set up a group of like-minded
countries, which eventually involved a majority of EU member states, to
promote the single market in an effective way. It shows, incidentally,

it needed? There has been a lot of talk about how fast people want to
go, and it has been suggested that HS2 is really all to do with people
wanting to go quicker. That is not the case. It is now becoming very
clear that the reasons for the line are what are now being referred to,
slightly opaquely, as “capacity” and
“connectivity”. As far as capacity is concerned, everyone
knows that the west coast main line in its present form is already
virtually full. For example, it is proving very difficult, in fact
almost impossible, to find paths for the proposed new services that
Virgin wants to run between Blackpool and London. The east coast main
line is perhaps in not quite so congested a state—although it
seems pretty full to those of us who use it—but the combination
of intercity traffic, commuter traffic, particularly at the southern
end, local services and freight services means that the line is pretty
full.</hs_para>

a bit more capacity out of it; we can improve the situation at
Peterborough and provide a freight diversionary line at
Lincoln”, and so on, but there is a limit to how far that kind
of tweaking can solve the problem. In particular, there is a huge
freight potential on both the east and west coast main lines to move a
lot more freight on to these main railway lines from the motorways of
this country which is simply not possible to achieve at the moment. No

bravery in putting it through the Chilterns, but I suppose that that
was originally the decision of the previous Government. However, I want
to take an overall view. The network that we have been bequeathed by
the Victorian railway builders, particularly the east and west coast
main lines, does not actually connect or even go through the main
conurbations or the great regional centres. Birmingham is served by a
very unsatisfactory loop, and anyone who goes on those services to
Birmingham knows how they trundle when they go through the Black
Country. Manchester is on a branch line. Derby, Leicester and
Nottingham are served by neither the east or west coast main lines, and
neither is Sheffield. Leeds is on a branch line. North of London, you
have to go as far as Newcastle before you get to a major regional
centre that is actually on either of the two main lines. They then of

than that of the Victorian age, and that means high speeds and shorter
journey times. No, this debate is about something much more important:
it is about what sort of transport infrastructure we are to bequeath to
our children and grandchildren. We could go back to the thinking of the
1960s, 1970s and 1980s, when it was assumed that private motoring and
heavy lorries would reign supreme. The transport imperative then was to
build motorways on a predict-and-provide basis to serve them. The
railways at that time were expected to decline gracefully, with many
more lines being closed and services replaced by buses, passengers
being discouraged by ever higher fares, and the rail freight business
being largely abolished except for heavy-haul bulk loads and some
container traffic.</hs_para>

years, cost almost £10 billion, and we still have 125 miles per

Mandelson (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly welcome this debate
and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Greaves. Like my noble friend who
has just spoken, I have been an ardent pro-railway supporter all my
adult life but it is precisely for that reason that I do not support
HS2, because its sheer cost will suck the very lifeblood out of the
rest of the country’s rail
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000278" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000278">Originally
in government, I, along with my colleagues, took the default position
in favour of anything with an engine at its beginning, a guard’s
van at the back and a lot of sleek carriages planned in between.
However, I think that the Labour Front Bench is now right to have
become more sceptical of the project. I am not going to dwell on how we
reached that decision as a government but, frankly, there was too much
of the argument that if everyone else has a high-speed train we should
have one too—regardless of need, costs or alternatives. As a
party, to be frank, we did not feel like being trumped by the zeal of
the then Opposition’s support for the high-speed train. If
anything, we wanted to upstage

then, I have had a lot of time to think about this decision and to face
the fact that no empirical case has been established for HS2, despite
repeated attempts. The so- called business case, when the original
justification for HS2 was all about speed, duly collapsed under
scrutiny when it was discovered that in real life people actually work
on trains, and sometimes even better than when they are in the office.
Now the whole justification has shifted to assumptions about increased
overall capacity, reduced crowding and the economic benefits to a
handful of the nation’s cities—none of which assumptions,
I might say, have been authoritatively quantified or verified,
academically or otherwise. They all depend on forward projections of
passenger loads which are uncertain, famously unreliable and greatly
affected by the future price of tickets and elasticity of
demand.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000280" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000280">What
has been forgotten in all this debate is that in 2006 the then Labour
Government asked Rod Eddington to undertake one of the most
comprehensive studies ever of transport in the UK. That study, after a
great deal of very thorough examination, firmly rejected HS2. Eddington
concluded that Britain’s transport infrastructure needs would be
much better met by a wide range of incremental improvements rather than
a few high-profile extravagances. He ended with one very important

conclusive evidence that any such things will happen. It might give
some short-term boost to

is not surprising that KPMG, on a closer examination of its

£50 billion spent on HS2 is £50
billion—or anything like it, for that matter—that will
not be spent on upgrading the east coast main line, which serves
Humberside, Teesside and the north-east, and on lines to Bristol and
the south-west or to East Anglia. Importantly, it will not be spent on
the links between cities outside London. This is something on which we

point is that the Government’s own economic case, if HS2 goes
ahead, has made clear that this will involve nearly £8 billion
worth of cuts to existing intercity services. That means, for example,
that Coventry’s services to London will be cut from three to two
per hour, Stoke’s from two to one per hour and
Stockport’s from three to one per hour. All Wilmslow’s
intercity services to London will be axed, and journey times from
Oxenholme, Penrith and Carlisle to London will be lengthened. So much
for the capacity case for HS2. If it goes ahead, we will see a
shrinking of the rail network in this country, and that should be the
very last thing that pro-rail supporters in this House should want to

Rodgers of Quarry Bank (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, welcome
this debate, carefully chosen by my noble friend Lord Greaves. There
has been too little serious and sustained discussion, pro and anti, in
this House of the project launched in the House of Commons by the then
Secretary of State for Transport, Geoff Hoon, nearly five
years ago. At that time, on 15 January 2009, there was only one modest
paragraph about High Speed 2 out of 25 in a Statement on transport
policy. Within little more than a year, the noble Lord, Lord Adonis,

believe. I hope that my noble friend will be persuasive this

the initial momentum of the project, it was said—or so it
seemed—that the chief merit was to reach Birmingham from London
half an hour faster. Not everyone was sure that this was a
recommendation, but, by definition, a high-speed train meant going
faster and getting somewhere sooner. The relevant paragraph of the
January 2009 Statement referred only to faster journeys, but by the
publication of the March 2010 White Paper by Gordon Brown and Andrew
Adonis, there had been a major shift of emphasis from glamorous speed
to workaday capacity within the railway system; this has since become
the dominant

is now approaching 40 years since I became Secretary of State for
Transport. The 1970s was the most depressing era for the railways. It
was often said that my civil servants were anti-railway, but that was
not the case generally. Passenger miles had dropped steadily since 1945
and flattened out for a decade, which was bad for the morale of those
who cared about the railways. November 1976 was also the time of the
visitation of the IMF, from which followed deep cuts in public
spending, including transport. There was no prospect of taking any new
initiative. As far as I could, I continued to introduce the HST
Intercity 125, which was then a high-speed train, to improve the
existing urban network and to encourage light railways. I also saved
the Tyneside Metro when the Treasury was about to axe it. Then, rather
to my surprise, in the mid-1990s, the passenger miles began to grow,
and this growth has continued. I recognise the trend, and it is right
to provide additional capacity. I also recognise and welcome faster
trains on the existing network—or, as we are now required to

the first trains took five and a half hours. I am sure that whether you

that would have taken five and a half hours. Thank heaven—I hope
we can all agree on this—that the objections that were

mentioned that it was a Victorian railway. Essentially, we rely, in the

wonderful engineers built it, and phenomenal engineers kept it patched

running, by and large, while they did all that. However, a Victorian
railway serves us today. There is one big exception—that it is
not even as good as the Victorian railways because large chunks of the
system have been closed down. Routes, railways and stations all over
the place were closed. One railway in particular that was closed down
was a fine north-south route between London, Leicester and
Nottingham—the Great Central Railway—that was closed down
in 1969. Therefore in proposing a new railway we are not
revolutionary in adding to what has historically been

this new line. I am sorry that there is no easy way. They say,
“Let’s improve the existing railway. Let’s make
some modifications to it so that trains can run through at greater
capacity levels, with bigger trains”. We have been doing this
for more than 80 years. We have kept on patching up, making do and
mending, and amazingly, we have kept the trains running while we have
done that. However, that is saturated. That argument has
gone—there is no easy solution to that proposal. Interestingly,
people do not ever say that about the motorways. I do not remember
people saying, “We should not have built the M1 or the M5. We
should have built loads of 
<?notus-xml column=1232?>bypasses, strengthened the bridges and got more traffic running through
on the old roads”. There comes a point when that proposal
becomes ridiculous, and as far as the railway that we need for the 21st

the noble Lord, Lord Faulkner, and others, I am a supporter of the case
for investing in improving transport services in the UK and in
particular of upgrading our rail capacity using the most appropriate
technologies. However, as my noble friend Lord Mandelson says, the
supporters of HS2 have to do better than rely on dodgy forecasts and
puffed-up consultancy reports. This is not an icon; it is a major
investment decision for the UK, so it is right that, at a capital cost
of £50 billion with ongoing subsidies, everybody should be
convinced by the case before it is approved. To achieve that,
we must debate and agree a proper economic argument which
explains convincingly not only what problem we are trying to 
<?notus-xml column=1233?>solve and why HS2 is the answer but also why other cheaper solutions do
not do the trick. The Government have caused a lot of confusion on this
point. First it was green and then it was speed, or was it the other
way round? Then it was the need to fuel economic growth in the regions,
recently clarified as “some regions but not others”. Now
it is capacity on the west coast main line and connectivity with HS1,
albeit that that constitutes an embarrassingly large gap in the current
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000309">This
debate is on the economic case for HS2. On the facts so far available
to us, there is no doubt that the economic case for HS2 is very weak. A
project that costs £50 billion in capital needs a better case

it has so many critics, ranging from the press to the Institute of
Economic Affairs and the TaxPayers’ Alliance, from Alistair
Darling to David Davis and many others, including the National Audit
Office whose value-for-money report suggests a number of problems with
the existing cost-benefit study and the Treasury Select Committee whose
report published on the 2013 spending round concludes that only when HM
Treasury has decided its own comprehensive economic case for supporting
the decision should the Government formally reassess the
project before deciding whether to proceed. In other words, there are
very substantial blocks to moving forward on this
proposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000310" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000310">So
far all we have seen from the Government is the KPMG report, which, as
has been said, far from proving the Government’s case, suggests
that there will be as many losers as winners in the regions. The
problem is that HS2 has been designated solely as a point-to-point
railway line, lacking any proper integration with the classic rail
network, the UK’s only hub airport or HS1. As such, the project
exemplifies the silo approach of UK transport planning where decisions
on aviation, classic rail and high-speed rail are taken in isolation,
let alone thinking about the implications for things such as high-speed
broadband. Current HS2 proposals need to be improved to ensure that the
route connects into more of the UK, integrating with other transport
networks and co-ordinating with the work of the Airports
Commission.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000311" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000311">Surely
we should not be considering in the early 21st century a transport
solution which inflicts serious damage on our natural heritage. These
may be old arguments but they are still real. The Woodland Trust has
demonstrated that the Government’s preferred routes for both
phases of the scheme will cause loss or damage to at least 67
irreplaceable ancient woods. The Chilterns AONB, which is where I live,
is now the only AONB along the entire HS2 phase 1 and phase 2 route
that would be adversely impacted by the proposed project. Actually, it
would be destroyed. The draft environmental statement consultation
published on 16 May accepts that a tunnel through the
Chilterns AONB would perform better on environmental grounds compared
with the current tunnel option. It would also reduce the operational
noise impact and, for certain locations, would result in a reduced
construction impact. It is feasible in engineering terms and I

Alton of Liverpool (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, as one of the sceptics,
I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, on giving the House the
opportunity to have this important debate and for the way in which he
introduced it. Since first arriving in Parliament in another place in
1979, I have been a regular user of the west coast main line from both
Liverpool and Preston. Virgin provides a superb service and most
journeys to London take just over two hours. It is specious to suggest
that we need a faster rail link, which is no doubt why Patrick
McLoughlin shrewdly sought over the summer to alter the terms of the
debate away from the question of journey times to that of
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000313" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000313">If
the raison d’être for HS2 is a moving target, so are the
estimated costs. In 2008, it was estimated that the project would cost
£17 billion. By 2010 the figure was £30 billion. By this
year it had reached a staggering £42 billion, according to some
estimates, and nearer £50 billion once the cost of the rolling
stock has been added in. The <I>Financial Times</I>—hardly part
of a disreputable conspiracy—reported a private Treasury
calculation of £73 billion, and all of this before a single
sleeper has been laid. Having said that he has been changing his mind
about HS2, the former Chancellor Alistair Darling is right to warn that
this is a project that could easily run out of control. He says the
business case has been exaggerated and that there are better ways of
encouraging growth outside London. That is the main reason why I share
his view.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000314" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000314">For
the avoidance of doubt, I believe in public transport and have always
supported the enhancement of our railway network, like the noble Lord,
Lord Mandelson. I have supported capital projects that improve
infrastructure, provide demonstrable economic benefits and create jobs.
It is claimed that the region I live in will be a principal beneficiary
of HS2. However, for reasons I will explain, and not simply because of
the runaway costs, I have been opposed to this project in its present
form from the
outset.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000315" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000315">For a
fraction of the cost of HS2 we could enhance the capacity of our
railway system, by upgrading stations and platforms, lengthening
carriages, improving railway stock, using new technologies and through
timetabling and the reintroduction of services such as overnight
sleepers to northern cities and towns. We could make significant
improvements to our railways. Think of the opportunity costs at stake.
A far higher priority for railway improvements should be commuter
services and town-to-town links. Travel times between northern cities
and towns are diabolical. To travel from Preston to London takes just
over two hours; from Liverpool to Preston takes one hour, and from
Leeds to Liverpool takes one hour and 47 minutes. Liverpool to
Sheffield takes one hour and 41 minutes, and Liverpool to Hull takes
three hours and 13 minutes. Those cross-Pennine, east-west services,
not north-south services, are
impeding economic development in the
north.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000316">If we

Because, unlike Manchester, which will have a direct line to the city

am also certain that, if these proposals go ahead, the magnetic appeal

Bradshaw (LD):</Member></B> I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Rooker,
on his firm speech. I am speaking because I was responsible, at some
time in my career, for the management of all the four main lines which
go out of London to the north. They are now at least 85% full. When a
system—a railway, water pipes, gas or anything—is at 85%
capacity it is full, because just a small incident can spill over and
cause havoc with punctuality or supply of
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:26:05"></hs_TimeCode>. So the
capacity enhancement is urgently needed, but I am sorry that this thing
ever got called High Speed 2 because it is not a high speed railway in
international terms: they are not talking about going at about 250
mph.</hs_para>

upgrading of existing routes is a hopeless proposition. I have just
read that next year the west coast main line will be shut for 36 days
for urgent engineering work at the London end, running through Watford.
That will bring back the horrors but this time it will affect more
people because more people are now using the railway. The London end of
this project needs rethinking because the way it has been drawn up is
wrong. I do not believe there is any need, at least in phase one, to
demolish houses in the Camden area. I must cast doubt on the quality of
leadership of the project because it has not gone for the most sensible
option. We do not need to demolish lots of houses for phase one: we can
do that quite easily by other
means<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:27:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for the first stage of the HS1 extension. At the time people
talked—in this House, I am sure, although I was not

the same again. However, a week or two ago I met a Labour MP from one
of the constituencies affected. I asked him if he was getting a lot of
trouble from HS1. He said, “No, none at all, but if you ask me
about gay marriage I will bring you a few bags of letters”. That
is the way 
<?notus-xml column=1238?>in which the ill effects of this project have been grossly exaggerated
by various opponents. There will be disruption while it is built but,
as someone remarked, the wildlife and the birds come back. The railway
does not have lots of service stations, garages and posters. It fits
into the countryside and I am sure that noble Lords who travel around

new line will free up a lot of existing capacity and the talk about
Coventry, Rugby and Milton Keynes not having as good a service is just
not true. This month the Desiro company, which has built many of the
excellent suburban trains used between London and Birmingham, has been
given permission to increase the line speed of these trains to 150 mph.
They are more comfortable and will be nearly as fast as the Pendolinos,
and I am sure that customers will like them better. I am certain that
all the places affected will have a far better service than they have

for the Minister. Will she please facilitate the ongoing discussions
about the London end? The Secretary of State knows about them and the
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, and I have been to see him. We believe that
we can save a lot of money, not the odd million but the odd billion, by
these proposals. Look again at the appraisal methodology that these
people used. They used the old-fashioned cost-benefit analysis that was
invented by the Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment in
the 1960s and 1970s that compared the value of road schemes to see
which was best. The process was never intended to value a project such
as this. A recent publication by High Speed 1 has shown that the value
of HS1 over 60 years is £17.6 billion. Will the Minister look
again at the external benefits? This has been done by HS1, which looked
at the effect on the value of property. Recently at Ealing Broadway it
found that property prices are increasing sharply in anticipation of
Crossrail. None of that value gets into the public purse but there is
no doubt that it is of value, and it is time that the department looked
at this issue to find a way to ensure that some of that value gets into

Mallalieu (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, like the noble Lord, Lord
Stevenson, I must declare that I live in the Chilterns but not in an
area affected by the proposed route. However, for most of my life I
have known that stretch of countryside from where the line drops off
the escarpment and cuts a swathe through Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
Northamptonshire and Warwickshire. It is not picture-book pretty.
Unlike the Chilterns, it is not an area in which walkers such as the
noble Lord, Lord Greaves, to whom we are indebted, come out in numbers
at weekends or visit for its views. It is old England, big blackthorn
hedges, pasture, beef cattle,

have been born and lived all their
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:33:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Through
that countryside the route goes past Grendon Wood, in which Shakespeare
is said to have been inspired to write “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream”, and—this is for my noble friend
Lord Grocott—Doddershall, a remote moated house built in 1520.
The route also goes through 24 sites of special scientific interest and
67 irreplaceable ancient woodlands. It is proposed to drive HS2 through

clear. I am aware that the lack of any proper consultation and the
weakness of the economic case concerned a number of those at the heart

it is a passion which I believe led to a very expensive mistake. Nor do
I underestimate the pressure that was put on politicians of both sides
to go ahead from others who stand to profit: mainly the rail and
engineering firms and also from a number of local authorities on the
direct route who stand to benefit. They make up a rich and powerful
lobby, but they are not succeeding with the public and nor must they.

trains, without which the railway cannot operate, nor, as I understand
it, does it include the essential infrastructure to create links to the
city centres where the station is on the outside. Estimates that I have

rather more places that believe they will lose out, and badly. The
biggest losers of all are the poor souls who have to pay for it, who
are the British public. What is more, HS2 is unlikely ever to generate
enough income to cover its running costs. Construction has to be
taxpayer funded, because it is unlikely ever to make a profit and no

Lea of Crondall:</Member></B> My Lords, this debate produces a most
unfortunate degree of polarisation among people who are normally much
more sober in their analysis. I am on the same track as my noble friend
Lord Rooker. When we talk about £8 billion being a lot of money,
we are not talking about a project that will last for only 10 or 20
years; HS2 is going to be there for 100 years. Does anyone think that
the Channel Tunnel will not be around then? The Victorian railways are
still in place and HS2 will still be
there<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>. It would

some sort of context. First, what is our national income and how does
it grow? At the moment, our national income is £1.5 trillion per
annum, or £1,500 billion—so in 10 years’ time it
will be £15 trillion and in 100 years it will obviously be
£150 trillion; that is without any underlying rate of economic
growth. Secondly, can the rate of return capture all the benefits? Of
course it cannot. I hope that the noble Baroness, Lady Kramer—I,
too, very 
<?notus-xml column=1241?>much welcome her appointment—will take on board the
comparison with Crossrail on this. We do not expect
Transport for London to capture all the benefits that accrue at
Farringdon or Tottenham Court Road. It would be nice if it could, but
it cannot. The benefits for everybody in London are huge.</hs_para>

describing what is done—but there are private benefits and
externality benefits. As Alastair Morton, the first co-chairman of
Eurotunnel said, economies are created through transport
infrastructure. Therefore, you cannot capture all this with just one
figure, and I am not surprised if people come up with very different

cannot be increased by building more motorways any more easily than it
can by building more railways—it is far more
difficult—but I ask the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, to think
about the alternatives. She may be a zero-growth person but I do not
think that the rest of us are. We are 2% growth people around here, as

this is a densely populated island. However, it is no more so than
Belgium, and Belgium has four high-speed train services. It is
precisely because we are a densely populated island that we need HS2,

of the arguments that other enthusiasts of this House have already

has been sold to the public very poorly. To begin with, much too much
emphasis has been put on the high-speed element of the project. The
faster speeds are one, but one of the less important, of the advantages
of HS2. Why, ask our opponents, are we spending so much money merely to
take 20 minutes off a journey time from Birmingham to
London? Besides, they say, we need that extra time to work on the
train. We then get into this argument about what people actually do on
trains: work, read, look out of the window or go to sleep. Personally,
whatever my original intention, I usually end up going to
sleep.</hs_para>

element only really becomes significant when the line gets as far north
as Carlisle and Scotland. Regrettably, that will still be some
considerable time in the future. What is significant is that we are
planning to build a brand new railway line, the first major new line
since Victorian times. The main reason it is needed is to relieve
pressure on the existing network and to increase capacity. Our
opponents ask how we can justify spending so much money on a brand new
railway line. As many noble Lords have asked today, would it not be
better spent on upgrading the existing network? However, this is not an
either/or situation. The Government promise to spend money on upgrading
the existing network at the same time. It is all part of the same
process, the same overall
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000353" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000353">The
Government need to get across to the doubters and waverers that rail is
the only practical, and potentially civilised, mode of transport in
Britain for distances of more than 100 miles. More and more people are
travelling by train now, and with the anticipated rise in population,
there could be 20% more passengers by 2025. The fact is that there has
been precious little capital investment in the railways for more than
100 years. With the regrettable exception of
Beeching’s ruthless scrapping of so many of our branch lines in
the 1950s, as the noble Lord, Lord Grocott, mentioned, Britain’s
railway network is much the same as it was in 1910. At certain times of
day, in many parts of Britain, it is already inadequate to accommodate
the existing number of passengers. One can only imagine what it will be
like in 15 years’ time if nothing is
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000354" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000354">Now, at
last, something is happening; something is being done. The Government,
with Labour Party support, have recognised the future importance of
rail and that in order to free up capacity on our existing railway
lines we need to build a brand new one, linking London with major
cities in the Midlands and the north. As we need a new line, it surely
makes sense to build the most advanced and up-to-date model available,
which has been tried and tested on the continent. That model is
high-speed rail.</hs_para>

one-off, speculative gamble out on its own, as some
of our opponents seem to suggest. It is an integral part of a long-term
plan  to modernise our whole railway network. That is the
message that the Government have to get across to the public and to
some of their Tory
sceptics<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:49:39"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, there will be people, like some of the citizens of Camden Town,
whose lives and outlooks will be considerably disturbed and disrupted
by the construction of high-speed rail. It is right and essential that
they should be generously compensated. However, I believe that fears of
long-term damage to our countryside and wildlife are greatly
exaggerated. Within 10 years, the scars will have healed, and the
disturbed woods and farmland will have been reshaped and
relandscaped<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:50:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000356" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000356">The
advantages of high-speed rail greatly outnumber the disadvantages of
temporary disruption. Although HS2 is not exactly squeaky clean
environmentally, it is considerably less polluting than the hundreds of
aircraft from Heathrow, Gatwick or Stansted which fly overhead and
whose internal flights, I hope, will eventually be made redundant by
high-speed rail. Britain’s major cities will feel much closer
together and Britain in general will feel less dependent on London. Of
course, the construction of the line will provide much-needed
employment in times of
austerity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:50:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000357" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000357">I
need assurance from the Government and the Minister that they will not
get cold feet over high-speed rail and will not be tempted to
compromise through fear of rising costs. The cost seems almost
irrelevant when compared with the value and importance of the whole
enterprise. We need a modern and efficient railway network. It is no
longer an option; it is an essential. This is the most important and
far-sighted transport project for more than a century. By the time it
is completed most of us here will be dead but it will provide a greatly
enhanced quality of life for our grandchildren. That is what we should
be considering. Surely, the Government can better get that message

Watson of Invergowrie (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am a long-time
supporter of rail travel and hold to the belief that trains are so
important that they should be seen as a public service. They are an
essential part of any country’s infrastructure and, as such,
should be run as a service and not for profit. If that requires
nationalisation and/or government subsidy, so be it. Surely it ought to
be seen as a wise investment in economic
terms<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:51:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000359" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000359">Is
it not ironic that although none of the main political parties favours
renationalisation of our railway infrastructure, none is opposed to our
trains being owned and run by the state, just as long as it is not this
state? The state-owned railway companies of France, Germany and the
Netherlands regularly bid for our rail franchises, sometimes with
success. I did not know this until I did some research, but the royal
train is now operated by EWS, which is owned by Deutsche

support for railways is often sorely tested. There are 28 different
train operators and too often, it seems, they do not speak to each
other, at least not in 
<?notus-xml column=1244?>the same language. Perhaps that harks back to the point that I have just
made. For years I used commuter services between Edinburgh and Glasgow,
and it was rarely a pleasant experience. I do not do that now and I
rarely use the commuter trains that serve London. However, I feel that
it is a failure of the service when I am forced to stand and cannot get
a seat that I have paid for. Just last weekend that happened in
Scotland on a journey that I made between Aberdeen and
Edinburgh<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:53:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000361" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000361">High-speed
rail exists in all major EU countries—France, Germany, Italy,
Spain and, of course, here—as has been referred to by many noble
Lords today, so I am naturally inclined to support the concept of HS2.
Yet there are two basic reasons why I have doubt in my mind. One is the
spiralling cost. The figures I have seen suggest that when the project
was first announced in 2008, the projected cost was £17 billion.
By 2010, that had gone up to £30 billion. This year, it is at
£42 billion plus £7.5 billion for rolling
stock. The <I>Financial Times</I> has estimated that the final cost
could be as much as £70 billion. I do not know the veracity of
those figures but it seems that the projected costs are spiralling out

my noble friends Lord Faulkner and Lord Grocott that transferring some
of the cash—certainly not all of the cash—to upgrade
existing infrastructure is not the answer. But surely some form of

the noble Lord, Lord Greaves, talked of the need to close the regional
divide. I certainly support him in that. Anyone who looked at
today’s <I>Guardian</I> will have seen figures on the front page
showing that during the boom from 1997 to 2006, London and the
south-east were responsible for 37% of the UK’s growth in
output, and since the economic crash of 2007-08, London and the
south-east were responsible for 48% of that growth. Every other region
except Scotland has suffered relative decline over that period, which
highlights the need to ensure that economic benefits are not
concentrated, as they have all too often been, in London and the
south-east. Regional benefits are the second reason I have doubts about
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:55:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000364" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000364">I
thoroughly agree with my noble friend Lord Rooker on the need for HS2
to be extended eventually to Glasgow and Edinburgh, but I think it
highly unlikely that that will happen, certainly in the lifetime of
most noble Lords, because the numbers that would use it would be held
not to justify the cost. It is for the same reason that the motorway
network stopped at Carlisle for 20 years before it was extended to
Glasgow. I wonder how many noble Lords are aware that not only is there
no motorway between Newcastle and Edinburgh, two major cities in the
UK, but that there is not even a dual carriageway for a considerable
part of that journey, which is a
disgrace<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:55:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000365" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000365">The
recent figures prised from the Government—and I use the term
advisedly—through an FoI request on the question of the benefit
of HS2 show that the coalition had attempted to withhold the bad news:
the information in the KPMG report that, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton,
rightly said, demonstrated that 
<?notus-xml column=1245?>Aberdeen and Dundee would lose heavily when HS2 is in place, as, indeed,
would other places such as Norfolk, Cambridge, Bristol and Essex, among
others. That seems to stand to reason because there cannot be winners
all the way. Not everybody can win from HS2. It is quite clear that
there will be displacement of business and of travel, so to say that
everything will be better with HS2 just does not stack up. I am
prepared to accept that there will be considerable benefits, but
certain parts of the country will undoubtedly lose as a result and that
has to be faced by those who are particularly enthusiastic about

was one thing he did not say that he might have done. He talked about
the west coast main line being full, as have other noble Lords on both
sides. We ought to recognise that the west coast main line,
particularly the southern section, is not just full, it is in a pretty
poor condition too, despite all the money that has been spent on it.
The recent £9 billion overhaul has held off some of the decay on
that route, but the last stretch in particular, from Watford to Euston
is in a pretty poor state, as was revealed earlier this year. A report
was published in the railway industry’s in-house magazine,
<I>Rail News</I>, about an inquiry led by Virgin Trains’ chief
operating officer, Chris Gibb, who had been seconded to Network Rail,
about the state of the track, particularly that stretch from Watford to
London. Chris Gibb reported to a joint board chaired by Sir
David Higgins, then chairman of Network Rail, about whom many
complimentary comments have been made during the course of the debate.
Mr Gibb’s report says
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13102470000488" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000488">“trying

extremely difficult. Yet opponents of HS2 appear to believe that by
declassifying a couple of coaches on Pendolino trains and adding a few
more trains, a junction here and a flyover there, we can somehow cope
with the projected increase in traffic which will take place on the
west coast main line if HS2 is not

fear that life is not like that. Chris Gibb’s final
recommendation is that the line from Bushey, just south of Watford,
into Euston should be closed every Saturday and Sunday night for
between five and 10 years in order that all the
infrastructure can be renewed. That is a pretty unlikely prospect, but
I have to say to 
<?notus-xml column=1246?>those who oppose the building of HS2 that we cannot go on, in David
Higgins’s words, pounding the west coast main line. He said that
by the time the first stage of HS2 is due to open in 2026 the route
will be—his exact
word—“trashed”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000371" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000371">We

people whom he prayed in aid in support of his opposition. I do not
regard the Institute of Economic Affairs as a particularly credible
organisation, nor, although I will be careful out of deference to some
of my near neighbours, could I bring myself to be too complimentary
about the Countryside Alliance. Both my noble friends might like to
read a document produced by Centro, the passenger transport authority
in the West Midlands, explaining why the West Midlands needs HS2. I
will leave it on the board for both of them if they like; whether they
find that any more credible than the two organisations they cited
remains to be seen. The fact remains that Centro believes that 50,000

that we are hearing today about HS2 were used then about HS1. The
garden of England was going to be destroyed. The phrase “cutting
a swathe” was one I heard from many a high-paid lawyer as I sat
on the committee when they were talking about what was likely to happen
in Kent. As the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, said, Kent has not been

years ago, I was a signalman on the west coast main line, so I have
some experience of what happened when trying to run trains when the
line is being modernised. At least we had many alternatives in the
1960s. For example, Manchester trains ran from St Pancras to
Manchester Central. The line from Matlock to Manchester Central was
closed in their wisdom—by, I suspect, by a Labour Government, I
must say—in the 1960s. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, talked about
trains to Liverpool. They went up the great western line from
Paddington to Birkenhead. That is not available 
<?notus-xml column=1247?>to us any more. As my noble friend Lord Grocott said, there was always
the great central line, which ran to Leicester, Nottingham and on to
Manchester, which could also be used as a diversion. None of those
lines are available to us today. There are neither locomotives nor
rolling stock. It must come as a surprise to my noble friend Lord
Mandelson to find that loco hauled trains are very rare in most parts
of the country and guards vans do not exist at all. He must have missed
that during his sojourn in Brussels, but the railway has changed
somewhat. Pendolino trains will not run anywhere else. If there is no
25 kilovolt overhead wire, they will not get out of the depot, so they
are no alternative. It is not often that I pray in aid the late
Baroness Thatcher, but there really is no

the rolling stock which has been mentioned. The Treasury predicts that
this will rise to £73 billion. The noble Lord, Lord Snape, has
told us that some of the people criticising HS2 are not credible. He
mentioned the Institute of Economic Affairs giving a figure of
£80 billion or above. I hope that the noble Lord thinks that the

are they living? Many noble Lords have spoken about the problems on
that line, and I will not repeat what they have said. One of the
problems is that if you improve a line, you either dig it up and close
it or you extend it sideways into people’s properties. That will
have just as much opposition as building a new line—in fact,
probably more—because people will want compensation, as they do.
Yes, the line is going past their property and has been there a long
time, but their property is very valuable. That idea just does not
work.</hs_parafo>

real problem that I want to mention with regard to capacity, though, is
freight. Freight is different from passengers because it runs only if
the customers and the train operators want it to and therefore,
hopefully, it will make a bit of money. There is no subsidy. The
industry has forecast a doubling of demand for rail freight on the west
coast main line in 20 years. That is because the type of traffic that
goes up that line is mainly containers from retailers. That is what
retailers like—noble Lords will have seen some of the
supermarkets giving green credentials on a packet of cheese, or
whatever they are selling—so they have asked for this. Freight
is growing by leaps and bounds; it might treble, for all I know.
However, if you want a doubling of traffic in 20 years, that is the
equivalent of an extra two trains an hour on the west coast main line.
It is full already, as other noble Lords have said, and we are having
discussions with Network Rail about how this can be accommodated,
particularly when phase one is built and it stops near Tamworth. Still,
it is a wonderful challenge to have.</hs_para>

alternative? There are two options. One is that it could go by road.
Let us have a motorway through Little Missenden; I am sure that my
noble friend Lord Stevenson would not like that. I was brought up in
Great Missenden, and I would not like to see a motorway go through
there; there is a railway there already, and a horrible road. If
freight is not going to go by rail, therefore, it will go by
road—or, the other option, it does not go at all. Do we want it
not to go at all? What would be the consequences for the economy if it
did not?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102470000390" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000390">I
reflect that the latest route through the Chilterns is going to affect
about 100 properties, whereas in Camden it will affect 2,700. That is
why the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, and I have come up with our
alternative route through Camden that will, we hope, significantly
reduce the demand for demolition, perhaps down to nothing at all. I
look at HS2 as adding two more tracks to the west coast main line, for
reasons of capacity. It is pity that it did not start off being sold
that way, but it is indeed for capacity. We need HS2, otherwise the
traffic will not go, or we go by
road.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000391" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000391">I
conclude by commenting a little more on my noble friend Lord
Snape’s comments about HS1, which I was also involved in. There
is a study by Volterra 
<?notus-xml column=1250?>consultants about the economic benefits of HS1, which could therefore
apply to HS2. Apart from generating extra rail and car park revenues of
£3.4 billion, which we may or may not want, the transport
benefits include more than £100 million of congestion relief, an
increase in rail revenue of £3.4 billion,
while earnings per annum across the study area—Kent—have
increased by between £62 million and £360 million due to
the commuting facilities. You may not want to commute but perhaps you
do. Overall this is estimated at a very significant benefit to the UK
of HS1 over 60 years—it is a long-term project—of
£17.6 billion. I think this is worth having.</hs_para>

why on earth are you thinking of doing it on the basis of 50-year-old

to the East, to the way in which they are building their high-speed

Opposition support HS2. We believe that a new north-south line is
needed. The issue of speed or whether it is a trophy has nothing to do
with it. We need the speed because it increases the capacity. It is not
a trophy because we did not ask and are not asking the nation to embark
on this major construction because we wanted some kind of trophy like
the French or Germans had with their high-speed lines. That is not so:
it is because there is a real need. The need, which is quite clear, is
one of a dramatic requirement for additional rail capacity in this

been cited in this debate. I am grateful to my noble friend Lord
Faulkner who, in his usual hard-headed manner, indicated some crucial
figures. The growth of rail has been double that of gross domestic
product in the past 30 years. As the country has expanded over that
time, rail has expanded much faster. Even in this past decade, when we
all recognise the difficulties there have been in the economy, there
has been a growth of 4% per year in the demand for rail services in
terms of passenger numbers. This is not a passing fancy; it is a real
need, to which we need to address the resources of the

noble friend Lord Faulkner, expressing it in his usual cool manner, and
my noble friend Lord Grocott, in his rather more expansive way,

Victorians faced great challenges to their infrastructure projects as
well but we have to face up to that challenge, too. People might say
that the Victorians had a head start and all sorts of obvious
advantages. Even the Great Exhibition, which was one of their
triumphs—although the Crystal Palace did not survive too long
afterwards—has been surpassed by the success of the structure

Games were an infrastructure project that was delivered on time and on
budget. It had a contingency element in it, of course, as indeed this
project has. What people often talk about as the enormous expansion of
costs is a contingency of £14 billion, which may not be called
upon. Of course, the pessimists will say, “Oh, but it will
be”. They said that about the Olympic Games but the Games were
delivered on budget. They were a much smaller project than this but we

underestimate the need, which is often expressed in terms of the
enormous pressure of commuting. For the London conurbation, it is
always expressed in these terms because we know about the vast numbers

<?notus-xml column=1252?>the map, yet the West Midlands have a commuting problem as acute for the
people involved in it as at London Euston and the other great terminals
of London. The West Midlands have had massive growth in commuter
traffic. The demands of rail passenger numbers have increased by 105%
in the past five years. Let us not pretend that this is an issue solely
for London and the south of England; the pressure is exerted elsewhere,
too. That is why we need to address those issues, and this is the most

also agree in every way with what my noble friend Lord Rooker
indicated. On major infrastructure projects, which are bound to extend
way beyond the lifetime of any one Parliament, there is no hope for
this country unless we have a commitment across the parties and across
Parliaments to deliver. Otherwise, we are trapped within a four or
five-year perspective for the great needs of this nation. We will be

Crossrail has been an infrastructure project for more than a decade. It
is still some way off completion, but it has survived elections and
changes of Government because the commitment is there to meet an
obvious and clearly expressed need. Some doubting Thomases in the House
may say that is because that expressed need is among the London and
south-east community with their greater leverage. The important thing
about High Speed 2 is that it recognises the leverage that is being
exerted from the regions and the cities of the north. That is why, when
my right honourable friend Ed Balls, with his usual judiciousness,
examined the figures of this enormous and significant increase in the
projected costs, settled down and said that he wanted to look at the
figures very closely and intended to scrutinise them in the future, he
was doing what we would expect any responsible shadow Chancellor to do,

of warning for the Government because, my goodness, they are skilled in
the arts of delay. We saw this exercised with regard to the problems of

knows how difficult hybrid Bills are. On HS1, it took more than two
years to get the Bill through. On Crossrail, it took more than three
years—in fact, nearly three and a half years—to get the
hybrid Bill through; and we have not seen the hybrid Bill yet because
we have not even got the paving Bill through Parliament. Therefore, as
this construction was meant to start in 2017, the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:30:25"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I join
noble Lords in thanking my noble friend Lord Greaves for obtaining this
important and timely debate. However, before I begin, I pay particular
tribute to the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, who is suddenly in his
place—he did not know that I would say this. He managed
transport business in this House with great knowledge and skill and I
know that your Lordships will wish me to express our respect and our

Kramer:</Member></B> I feel rather redundant. The case for HS2 has been
made so powerfully by the noble Lords, Lord Greaves, Lord
Faulkner—whose book, <I>Holding the Line</I>, which he modestly
did not advertise, sits on my desk as a bible—Lord Bradshaw,
Lord Grocott, Lord Rooker, Lord Lea of Crondall, Lord Snape, Lord
Berkeley, the noble Earl, Lord Glasgow—what a list. Every one of
them is an expert, respected by this House, and I know that this House
will listen to them. I welcome the words of the noble Lord, Lord Davies
of Oldham, who reaffirmed from the opposition Front Bench his
party’s commitment to this project. He is right that this issue
must stretch across the politics of these Houses—it concerns the
long-term infrastructure of this country—and I thank him for his
words. I will touch on three key issues and will then respond to some
of the remaining challenges raised in this debate.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102470000411" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000411">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:29:49"></hs_TimeCode>
I joined the board of Transport for London in 2000, London was running
out of transport capacity. “Make do and mend” was no
longer sufficient, and we had to commit to Crossrail. As I came to the
department, therefore, it was with a sense of déjà vu
that I saw that we face the same problem but on a national scale.
Without HS2, key rail routes connecting London, the Midlands and the
north will soon be overwhelmed. Demand for long-distance rail travel
has doubled in the past 15 years to 125 million journeys a year. By the
mid-2020s the west coast main line will be full. As any user of the
line knows, the pressures are obvious now, as they are on the east
coast main
line.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000412" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000412">We
cannot simply run more trains. Each new service has to be planned
around what runs already. It is nearly impossible to find new train
paths, and there simply is not scope for future demand, even if we use
the very modest forecast of 2.2% growth in demand every year. Already,
in my first two weeks in the department I have had to take note of two
turn-downs by the Office of the Rail Regulator, for routes from
Shrewsbury to London and Blackpool to London, 
<?notus-xml column=1254?>because it is simply not possible to find an adequate train path for
those services. However, HS2 gives us the capacity we need. It doubles
the number of seats between London and Birmingham; it is capable of
carrying a number of passengers equivalent to the population of
Nottingham every day; and it will run 18 trains an hour when we finish
phase 2, each of which carries 1,100
passengers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000413" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000413">I
will leave your Lordships with one set of numbers to remember. If we
look at all the proposals for enhancing the existing rail network as an
alternative to HS2, the most we can squeeze out of those enhancements
is 53% new capacity from London to Birmingham—and as the noble
Lord, Lord Snape, and other noble Lords have said, that is despite
years of disruption to the routes on which that work will have to be
done. We would gain 53% that way, but if we build HS2 we will add 143%
more capacity, and that is the transformation we have to
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000414" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000414">Transferring
long-distance passengers to HS2 frees up the west coast and east coast
main lines to develop significant additional regional and commuter rail
services. We very much need those for the future, but we could even use
many of them now. Very importantly, as the noble Lords, Lord Berkeley
and Lord Rooker, have underscored, it leaves room to move far more
freight onto rail. The west coast main line is especially crucial as we
anticipate growing freight demand as the economy expands. Frankly, the
road network simply cannot cope so rail has to take its share and only
with that transfer of long-distance passengers and the ability to use
those main lines can we achieve
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000415" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000415">HS2 will
be an engine for economic growth and jobs. The current estimates are
that HS2 will contribute £60 billion to the economy. That is
actually quite a narrow calculation and the wider effect could be much
greater as we link key northern cities to each other and to the south.
Incidentally, those who referred to the KPMG report must have misread
some of the lines. It shows benefits to far more areas than those which
suffer a relative disadvantage. It will help to rebuild our economy.
The noble Lord, Lord Greaves, used that key phrase, “closing the
regional divide”, because although London gains, the big winners
are the northern cities like Sheffield, Wigan, York and Wakefield. I
understand the demands to look at the case of Scotland. Scotland will
benefit from phase 1 of HS2 and even more from phase 2, but there are
ongoing discussions and we have all undertaken to examine this
area.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000416" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000416">HS2 will
also be a catalyst for city-centre regeneration. We have seen that with
Crossrail and Kings Cross. The HS2 growth taskforce led by the noble
Lord, Lord<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:36:05"></hs_TimeCode>
Deighton, who<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:36:05"></hs_TimeCode> I
know is so widely respected in this House, is now working to make sure
that we maximise all of those opportunities. Frankly, if the noble
Lord, Lord Mandelson, doubts that the north is going to benefit, I
recommend that he have a conversation with the leaders of Manchester,
Birmingham and Leeds. They want this line sooner because they recognise
the benefits that are coming. Of course the line does not serve every
city and region and the boost is naturally greatest in the places it
serves directly. That is the 
<?notus-xml column=1255?>character of infrastructure. We were right to build Crossrail
even though the main winner was London and not
elsewhere.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000417" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000417">HS2
is only one part of a much bigger investment programme which includes
the electrification of the East Midlands, the west of England and
Wales. There will be a £1 billion electrification of the Great
Western main line to Cardiff and Swansea with intercity express trains
from 2017. There will be a dualling of major road links in Cornwall and
East Anglia. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, asked about the north. I have
such a long list, I will read only some of it. We are electrifying the
line between Liverpool, Manchester, Preston and Blackpool. We are also
electrifying the trans-Pennine route from Manchester to York via Leeds.
We are introducing electric trains between Manchester airport and
Scotland. It is crucial that this House understands that the overall
investment in transport infrastructure in the next Parliament is
£73 billion and that of that, HS2 is only £17 billion. I
can confirm that in response to a question from the noble Lord, Lord
Bradshaw.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000418" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000418">Lastly,
let me make a couple of comments on actual delivery. The upper limit of
the cost is £42.6 billion. As others have said, that includes a
very considerable contingency of £14.4 billion, so we have
genuine scope to bear down on that number. The cost of £7.5
billion for rolling stock also includes a contingency. Let me assure
the noble Lords, Lord Watson and Lord Truscott, that we are much better
today at understanding how to work out cost and how to manage and
build, which is essential to the HS2
project.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000419" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000419">The
noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, raised the question of using property uplift
values as part of the way to pay for that. That is very interesting and
we will look at that going forward. There is going to be a significant
private-sector contribution because the stations, other than the
operating part of the stations, undoubtedly can be provided by the
private sector. We have seen the capacity to do that in places like
Kings Cross. And after HS1 was completed, although it is a 100-year
railway, a 30-year concession for that line was sold which paid for at
least a third of the actual cost of construction. We have mechanisms in
place to make sure that the cost is controlled and that we can turn to
the private sector for significant parts of the financing. I intend to
become very much more involved and look intensively at that
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:39:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000420" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000420">The
Government are also committed to fair compensation for those along the
route who are impacted. I say to the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu,
and the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson of Balmacara, that the consultation
is under way now and that they should contribute to it, as it is
crucially important that they do. The package—and the Government
are committed to this—will go above and beyond what is required
by law. This will be a fair and generous package. We are looking at
issues, and part of that consultation includes things such as property
bonds, voluntary purchase and rural support zones. I recommend that the
noble Lord encourage his neighbours and others interested to
participate, because we need that
dialogue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:40:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000421" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000421">HS2
will also be built to the highest environmental standards, with, for
example, some 70% of the surface lines between London and the West
Midlands insulated 
<?notus-xml column=1256?>by cuttings, landscaping and fencing. I say that again partly in
response to questions raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Mallalieu, and
the noble Lord, Lord Stevenson. I accept that when one builds a piece
of infrastructure, there is an impact. It is impossible to do it
without an impact, and it is difficult if it impacts on an area that
you either live in or know and love. This project has made a real
effort to minimise the impacts, but it must pay attention to costs, and
the balance that we have struck is, frankly, the right
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:41:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000422" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000422">The
noble Lord, Lord Low, brought up the issue of Maglev technology. In
China, Maglev goes between Shanghai airport and the city of Shanghai.
For the kind of long-distance services that we are looking at with HS2,
the Chinese are using very similar technology to that which we are
proposing. We are choosing it because it is safe and proven. I think
that we would all think that that was an appropriate approach to
take<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:41:43"></hs_TimeCode> for that
size of infrastructure
project.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000423" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000423">There
are opportunities to build British capacity for business and to build
jobs around this project. It is by far the largest infrastructure
project in Europe. One focus that I and others in this Government will
have is to look at how we can build the British supply chain to make
sure that we reap benefits in gathering expertise and experience in
business and then put those businesses in a position where we can
export that kind of expertise to other projects across the globe. With
all that come jobs for young people and highly skilled jobs; this is a
fantastic job opportunity. To look back over the kinds of numbers that
we have seen, the Core Cities Group alone predicts that HS2 will
underpin the delivery of 400,000 jobs. Construction jobs, at their
peak, will be in their thousands—50,000 at peak and probably
19,000 over the average of the
project<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:42:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000424" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000424">HS2
is simply the most significant transformation of our infrastructure in
a generation. It will link eight of the 10 largest British cities,
serving one in five of the UK population; two-thirds of the population
of northern England will be within two hours of London. As others have
said, there will be interconnectedness between those communities as an
additional base for stimulus within the north
itself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:43:19"></hs_TimeCode>. This is
a time for ambition; make do and mend will not serve this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102470000425" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-0002.htm#13102470000425">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:43:34"></hs_TimeCode>
noble Lord, Lord Mandelson,
may<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T16:43:23"></hs_TimeCode> have viewed
the decision on HS2 as a vanity project, but he does not do justice to
his colleagues when he says that. We have heard discussed again and
again the requirement for capacity, and it is simply incontrovertible.
We have to be able to move people in the modern era, and to move
freight. To have a project that focuses on bringing prosperity to the
north of England, so often forgotten in previous schemes, is critical
and important. So although it is all right that the debate should
continue, this Government remain—and I assure those who have
asked—committed to this transformational project. I thank the

cannot respond to the whole debate in the one or two minutes I have

little—not for the first time in my life—with one or two
of his comments. He said that, “Its sheer cost will suck the
lifeblood out of the rest of the country”. In my opening speech
I mentioned a few of the infrastructure projects in London and the
south-east where people do not come along to your Lordships’
House, or anywhere else, and complain they are sucking the lifeblood

eye-watering amounts that HS2 is costing. However, the proponents of
it, the corporate interests and the right-wing pressure groups who are

matter because Parliament needs to put much greater focus on the issues
facing deaf people and I hope that the debate will be the start of a
much more considered engagement in thinking about what kind of services
are most appropriate to support deaf people. I do not speak from any
particular expertise but my father was a welfare officer for deaf
people in Oxford. In fact, he worked for the late Baroness Faithfull
when she was director of the first social services department created
out of the merger of children’s and welfare services. We have

the life outcomes for many deaf people are not as good as they ought to
be. Public services are not sufficiently focused on deaf people and
there is probably a lack of drive within government and an
over-reliance on local government without it being given the means to
deliver the kind of support that is required. Perhaps I may provide
some statistics. It is reckoned that one in six people in the UK are
affected by deafness and hearing difficulties; more than 45,000 deaf
children live in the UK; and 25,000 deaf people in the UK
use British Sign Language as their preferred language Deafness is of
course not a learning disability but half of all deaf people have
special needs compared to one quarter of non-deaf people; over 50% of
deaf people have experienced some form of abuse as children; and one in
four deaf people will experience a mental health problem at some point
in their lives.</hs_para>

all the statistics that I could draw attention to, it is those on
educational achievement that are the most important and worrying. In
their GCSEs in 2012 just 37% of deaf children achieved five GCSEs at
grades A* to C, including English and maths, compared to 69% of
children with no identified special educational needs. The attainment
of deaf children actually fell in 2012 from nearly 40% in 2011. That is
not surprising because there is a direct connection between lack of
educational achievement and lack of employment opportunities. Whereas
80% of the non-disabled population are in employment—it may be a
bit less than that now—just over 50% of deaf people of working
age are in work. An awful lot needs to be done to improve the support
given to deaf

Children’s Society report <I>Stolen Futures</I> demonstrated the
disproportionate effect of public spending cuts on the lives of deaf
children. It identified reductions in services across education, health
and social care, and said that inconsistent decisions by the Government
are setting children up for failure. The society says that to achieve
their potential deaf children are dependent on multiple smaller
specialist public services such as teachers of the deaf. The children
need consistent co-ordinated support from an early age through to
adulthood across the public services. Yet in 2012-13 25% of councils
said that they planned to reduce one or more of the education, social
care and speech and language therapy services for deaf people. What do
the Government intend to do about that and the squeeze on resources and
support services for deaf

are similar issues when it comes to access to health services. This is

communicating with their GP or practice nurse and 24% said they missed
appointments because of poor communication, such as not being able to

brings me to the question of the British Sign Language and alternative
communication methods. I am sure all noble Lords were delighted when,
after many years, British Sign Language was officially recognised as a
language in its own right. That was a very significant movement which
received a lot of all-party support. However, there are only 800
registered sign interpreters in the UK and my understanding, coming
back to the health service, is that 70% of British Sign Language users
went without an interpreter during visits to A&amp;E in

solutions to the problems. We need to have more registered sign
interpreters and support for family sign language
classes. Clearly, if a child who is deaf is to communicate effectively
with their parents and families, the whole family needs to have an
understanding of sign language. Access to family sign language
facilities becomes very much more important. I know that some
organisations for the deaf think that having a named Minister
responsible for driving a cross-government approach towards supporting
British Sign Language would be a major advance. Will the Government
consider how they could drive forward a number of initiatives to ensure
that, following the decision to recognise British Sign Language, it
will be put into practice in a very practical way? Will they make sure
that it is used as much as possible, that public services recognise it
and that there are enough people, both in family sign language
facilities and among qualified interpreters, to provide the kind of
support that people need when they come to embrace public

and partial hearing are issues that affect people throughout their
lifespan. We need to recognise that many older people have hearing
loss. We know that, if their hearing loss is managed effectively, there
is a real chance of improving the quality of their lives. However, we
know that diagnosis is currently opportunistic and ad hoc. If an adult
hearing screening programme could be introduced for everyone over the
age of 65, it would deliver long-term savings to the health and social
care system. That would enable people to adjust to wearing and looking
after hearing aids at a much earlier stage. Early identification and
remediation would be much more effective than dealing with some of the
issues that now arise from people who lack a diagnosis at the
appropriate

noble Lords who will be speaking in this debate have far more expertise
than I have in some of the issues that face deaf people. However, what
unites us is an effort to raise in Parliament the question of services
for deaf people and I hope that we will continue to do so in the
future. I urge the Government to recognise that there is a need for a
drive from the centre—from government—due to the diffuse
nature of the services and the fact that people are spread around the
country, which means that there may not be many people needing a
particular service in a particular local authority area. I very much
look forward to noble Lords’ contributions and to the noble

in 2011, a telephone survey by the National Deaf Children’s

local authorities varied considerably and it is clear that not all
families can rely on ready access to family-friendly sign language
classes. What further steps will the Government take to ensure that
families get the support that they need to promote early years
communication for deaf children? Given how important that is, is there
some scope for considering following the example of Scandinavia and
placing a duty on local authorities to provide that

education, many deaf children rely on support from their local

teacher for the deaf who might support families in the home with early
language and communication, visit deaf children in mainstream schools,
support deaf children directly and/or advise mainstream teachers on how
to adapt the curriculum and use technology effectively, or contribute
to specialist assessments of deaf children and intervene to promote
good outcomes. There is real concern that these services are being
severely undermined by public spending cuts. The department repeatedly
tells us that it has protected funding for the most vulnerable
learners, but, as has already been mentioned, the NDCS’s Stolen
Futures campaign has established, through a freedom of information
request to all local authorities, that 29% of authorities plan to cut
specialist education for deaf children this year. A further 28% are at
risk of cutting services, or undertaking a review of them. These cuts

many local authorities do not disclose information nor involve parents

not directly improve accountability in this area, not least because it
does not require local authorities to disclose expenditure on SEN
support services as part of the local offer. How will the department

welcome the local offer outlined in the Children and Families Bill, I
am concerned that it does not go far enough in recognising the

requirement to publish information about the local offer and neither is
that offer published by type of need: they only have to provide generic
information about special educational needs. It is also not clear that
the local offer will follow a set format. That can be difficult for
parents trying to compare provision in different areas. The local also
offer needs to be underpinned by a minimum provision. Too many children
with a sensory impairment are being denied the support they need, at a
considerable cost to families. The department argues that minimum
standards would lead to a race to the bottom and stifle the development
of local offers. Surely the opposite is true: in the absence of any
expectation on minimum
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:17:55"></hs_TimeCode>, local
authorities with better provision will reduce it in line with poorer
neighbouring provision. Can the Minister provide explicit reassurance

on an important note that I have not yet heard covered, outside the
range of education, what are the Government are doing to develop a
vaccine against cytomegalovirus, one of the main causes of congenital
deafness and blindness? Some 50% of the population are estimated to be
carriers, but it is only dangerous if contracted in pregnancy and
transferred to the foetus. The medical advice that a mother carrying
the virus should not touch anything—including her other
children—that might mean she contracts the virus is, frankly,
ridiculous. If there were a vaccine for this virus, it would be
targeted at a very specific group: mothers and women planning to be

my case, my hardness of hearing began when I had children. I think that
that was inherited, too. Over the years, it has got to the point where
there is no further help other than good amplifiers, such as we have in

start by highlighting the importance of the newborn hearing screening
programme. Many regard that programme as one of the major health
successes of the past decade. Prior to that programme, many children
born deaf were not diagnosed until as late as three and four years-old.
Such late diagnosis does significant damage to the deaf child’s
language and communication skills and, obviously, to their future
prospects. Early diagnosis provides the opportunity to put in place a
central support as soon as possible, so that deaf children can achieve
their full potential. The National Deaf Children’s Society is
clear that that has led to improved outcomes for deaf children

is therefore important that we continue to maintain that programme at
the highest possible level and standard. What steps has the Department
of Health taken to monitor and protect that service in the context of
the Health and Social Care Act and significant changes to health
services? Is the department monitoring whether the programme continues
to be adequately funded and whether, when their children have been
diagnosed as deaf, parents continue to experience a joined-up service
between public health and the NHS? Will the existing quality assurance
programme continue to include both diagnosis and follow-up
interventions in audiology services, the latter being as critical as
the former<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:22:39"></hs_TimeCode>? It
is vital that we do not take our eyes off the ball and let the service
wither away, so I would welcome the Minister’s assurance on that

also highlight the need for health services to be more accessible to
deaf young people. The National Deaf Children’s Society’s
youth advisory board spent the past year working on a new campaign to
improve deaf awareness in health professionals. I understand that it
hopes to launch that campaign, called “My life, my

with numerous examples of poor practice. We have heard of some already.
One deaf girl had missed several appointments at her GP because she is
unable to hear her name being called. She has now, ironically, been

I would like to highlight the importance of communications support to

children, provided that they get the right specialist support. But too
many deaf children are not getting the specialist support they
need.</hs_para>

still, according to evidence collated by the National Deaf
Children’s Society, that support is now being cut in many areas.
As we have already heard, freedom of information requests to all the
local authorities in England have established that 29% of them plan to 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>cut specialist education services for deaf children this year. A further
25% are either at risk of cutting or undertaking a review of their
service and these cuts are happening despite the commitment from the
Department for Education that it has protected funding for vulnerable
learners.</hs_para>

there is more that the department can do to ensure that local
authorities do deliver high-quality services and are held to account
when they fail to do so. One such action would be to require Ofsted to
begin inspecting these vital services for deaf children. When we
consider how much scrutiny mainstream teachers and schools are subject
to by Ofsted, it is shocking that teachers of the deaf in specialist
support services are subject to virtually none. That can only send a
signal that deaf education is less

we consider all the competing pressures that local authorities face, it
is hardly surprising that the lack of external scrutiny makes it even
easier for local authorities to cut services. A sharper eye of scrutiny
would also incentivise local authorities to improve services that are

Brinton, has tabled an amendment to the Children and Families Bill

that the Government will give it their strongest possible

I am concerned that we need to do more about the recruitment of
teachers of the deaf. Teachers of the deaf undergo two years of
additional training to gain a mandatory qualification in teaching deaf
children. Their important role has been recognised in the new draft SEN
code of practice. However, we are recruiting far too few teachers of
the deaf if deaf children in the future are to get the support they
need. Evidence suggests that around 80% of these teachers are over the
age of 50 and, in addition, the number of training departments appears
to be reducing. There is also anecdotal evidence that in some areas
services are already having to rely on teaching assistants to do the
job that would otherwise be done by teachers of the deaf. What steps
have the Government taken to assess how many teachers need to be
trained as teachers of the deaf to meet future demand and what action
is being taken to ensure that they are in place? Does the Minister
agree that there needs to be a national recruitment
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

debate, the Children’s Minister referred to the national
scholarship fund for teachers’ postgraduate training, which is
available to people wishing to train as teachers of the deaf. That is a
welcome first step. How many people are currently using this fund to
train as teachers of the deaf? Can the Minister reassure me that this
fund will be expanded to meet future needs? It is vital that we take
action now to ensure that there is an adequate number of teachers of

Government recognise the scale of the issue. One in every 700 babies in
England is born with some form of deafness and there are just under 10
million adults living with hearing loss. All these people will, at some
point, be in contact with public services. In fact, we know that there
are 35,000 children and 1.6 million adults with hearing loss being
managed and supported across health and other public sector services.
It is therefore absolutely vital that these public services are geared

to the need to eliminate discrimination and to advance equality of

standard usually offered to everyone. I would like to take your

social care, we know that there is a need to improve in the
commissioning and integration of health and social care services for
people with hearing loss, as well as in the provision of new and
innovative models of care. This is why we are looking to develop a new
action plan on hearing loss. The action plan will identify the key
actions that will make a difference in improving health and social care
outcomes for children, young people and adults with hearing loss. The
Department of Health is currently engaging with a range of

new health and social care structures provide the framework to improve
access to services and outcomes at a local level. The national adult
social care, public health and NHS outcomes frameworks enable us to
hold services to account for how they are tackling health inequalities

information standard around the provision of accessible information and
communication support to disabled patients, carers and service users.
It is intended to be finalised in late 2014, with organisations being
required to comply in 2015. Once implemented, the standard will ensure
that disabled patients, service users and carers receive information
from NHS bodies and providers of NHS care in formats that they can
understand, and that they receive appropriate support to enable them to
communicate. All this should help people when they visit their GP.
Certainly, at my GP practice, a name comes up: for example,
“Jolly to go to room 4”. This is not rocket science.

already delivered considerable improvements in services, including

“any qualified provider” 
<?notus-xml column=1272?>model, which offers even greater choice and convenience. We have rolled
out a system of voluntary accreditation of hearing service providers to

NHS England will publish guidance on making reasonable adjustments to
meet the communication needs of service users. That is expected next
year. All NHS staff should have disability awareness training, and
within that must come British Sign Language. The noble Lord also asked
about annual screenings for over-65s on hearing loss. There are no

opportunity to address such problems as hearing and vision, as well as
other key health issues.</hs_para>

opportunity to raise this matter. Unlike many of our debates, which are
concerned with specific issues, it is more fundamental; it relates to
the way in which this House, in carrying out its duties with
regard to legislation and holding the Government to account,
actually does its work. Therefore, it is a different sort of issue from
those that are more often
debated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000004">I
will start by putting the memorandum in context. It was produced after
the Government had dropped their House of Lords Reform Bill. It was
evolved in consultation with a number of groups in the House, including
the Campaign for an Effective Second Chamber, and puts forward a number
of very important suggestions and analyses them. We do not know what
will happen as far as the wider issue is concerned. My own feeling is
that it would be very unwise for parties to put the issue of an elected
Chamber in their manifesto because I think the House of Commons has
realised the dangers that would present to its position at Westminster
and the position of individual Members in their constituencies. In any
event, it is essential now that we do everything we can to improve the
way in which the House
works.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000005">I was
worried in the immediate aftermath of the other business that there
would be resistance by the Government to any progress on this at all.
It appears that is not now so. I am glad to see that a Bill embodying
what I think we are still calling Steel Mark 2 has been taken up by Mr
Dan Byles in the Commons and is apparently being given a favourable
wind. I hope that is also true of the proposal made by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hayman, who I am very glad to see in her place

we will not make sufficient progress. Yet it is absolutely clear that
the main danger we are facing is the ever increasing size of the House,
which the Hunt committee pointed out very clearly as having the effect
of, first, risking the reputation of the House; secondly, the
difficulty of conducting business effectively; and thirdly, the effect
of the additional Members on the resources of the House and their
ability to do their job. Therefore, we need to take urgent action and
the proposals in the report by the Clerk give us an opportunity to make
real progress.</hs_para>

want to concentrate on two particular points: first, the suggestion by
the Clerk that the voluntary retirement scheme should be strengthened,
which he does in paragraphs 19 to 21. He suggests that the scheme that
exists at the moment could be strengthened, particularly with regard to
taking action if people are not really acting as a full Member of the
House. This, too, he says, could be done without
legislation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000010">My
particular concern is the proposal that he makes in paragraphs 36 to 38
of his report, and in appendix A, for a scheme for voluntary
retirement. As has been pointed out time and time again—I think
in all the reports that I have mentioned—the trouble with
voluntary retirement is that there is no incentive for Members to
retire voluntarily. The Hunt report suggested that the Government
should look at the possibility of some form of retirement package,
which it is hoped would result in a number of people agreeing to retire
voluntarily.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000011">I
will make one quick point in parenthesis about a view that I believe is
held by the Leader of the House. What is proposed would not affect the

preserve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000012">My
concern is that of a former Treasury Minister—and once a
Treasury Minister, always a Treasury Minister. The Clerk’s
memorandum makes it absolutely clear that this proposal will be likely
to reduce public expenditure. The key policy of the Government is to
reduce public expenditure. Therefore, I am sorry that it is not a
Treasury Minister who will reply to the debate this afternoon. I do not
suggest that the proposal will result in a massive reduction in the
deficit. None the less, it is a move in the right direction, and if we
do nothing at all with more and more Members being appointed, there
will be an increase in public expenditure, which is clearly
incompatible with the fundamental economic policy of the present
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000013">The

insignificant, and this points the way forward. I hope very much that

particular point needs to be borne in mind. It is the question of party
balance. Clearly, if all the volunteers were from one part of the
House, that would give a certain amount of concern to the Whips. We
will need to take that into account. Therefore, in organising this, the
Whips will need to be involved. None the less, we can make significant
progress. I do not believe that it is something which is impossible to

central issue on which I will focus—although by no means

perhaps some more than others. I will just run through the charge sheet
because it has a bearing on what we can do about it. The first mea
culpa is for the Labour Party, but as my noble friend Lord Hunt of
Kings Heath will confirm, in response to an invitation from Tony Blair
some six or seven years ago, the Labour Party wrote a memorandum, which
I helped to draft, on the future of the House of Lords. It included all
the elements that were subsequently picked up by the noble Lord, Lord
Norton of Louth, and sold to the noble Lords, Lord Cormack and Lord
Steel. It largely became the Steel Bill. There were people in all three
political parties with an answer; they were not just whingeing about

the one written as a holy writ in the coalition agreement. It says that
the pattern of this House should reflect the voting in the last general
election. What an absurdity; what a shameful absurdity in
constitutional terms. Yet Mr Clegg and his followers, with a straight
face, express the belief that it is fair. We do not need much of a
crystal ball to speculate about what might happen after the next
election. If, as I hope, Labour gets in with an overall majority and we
were to apply that formula, what would the Liberal Democrats be

the Parliaments is someone who can look at this position
dispassionately and for the long term. When he wrote the first draft of
this memorandum, which a lot of people saw, it had in it a suggestion
that the three party leaders ought to get together and agree a formula
on this very question, but then he was nobbled. I do not think that the
Clerk of the Parliaments should be nobbled by the party leaders, but
the first draft had that suggestion in it, and now it is not there. It
was the final paragraph, and it has now gone. I think that this is a
case of the politicians getting above their station in this matter. We

it would cost £3.9 million in year 1 and save £4.4

has provided for today in allowing us to debate this subject. As the
noble Lord, Lord Steel, has already reminded noble Lords, the size of
the House was already a problem when the Hunt committee reported. Far
from seeing a reduction in numbers, as was proposed, we have seen a
substantial increase, with all the difficulties that have been referred

want to take up the theme of party-political balance in the House. We
have no agreement about what the relative strengths of parties in the
House should be. However, we do have agreement, I think, that much
legislation that comes to this House is badly drafted, inadequately
scrutinised or not scrutinised at all, because of timetabling in the
other place. Given those circumstances, I ask the Government to think
very carefully about increasing by large numbers the proportion of
party-political Peers in the House. Second Chambers exist to ask first
Chambers to have second thoughts. We need to do our job of
pressure-testing legislation, both for policy and for drafting, and to
ask the Commons to think again when appropriate. The joy of our present
system, and the reason why many of us oppose an elected House of Lords,
is because democratic power, accountability and legitimacy lie with the
Commons, which always in the end gets its
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000026">I have

Cormack (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow
the noble Baroness, Lady Hayman, and I agree with everything that she
said. I, too, thank my noble friend Lord Higgins for initiating this
very useful and helpful debate. However, I gently take him to task on
one thing: that is, these are not proposals from the Clerk. The Clerk
cannot make proposals; he merely set out some alternatives which
Members of the House can consider. We ought to put that on the record
to defend the total impartiality of the Clerk. In fact, this paper came
about as a result of an approach from the Campaign for an Effective
Second Chamber, which was formed by my noble friend Lord Norton and I
more than 11 years ago. I went to see the Clerk in the wake of the
timely defeat of the very ridiculous Clegg Bill and asked him whether
he could produce a paper which we could consider. He agreed but on the
condition that it must be made available to all Members of the House.
Naturally, we readily agreed to that, and that is why it is before
us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T13:22:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000030">This
is a debate in which we are rightly limited to a very short speaking
time and I want to make just one or two very brief points. The Byles
Bill is the filleted version of the large Steel Bill on which my noble
friends Lord Steel of Aikwood and Lord Norton of Louth and I worked
something like eight years ago. It is a modest proposal but it will
help, above all by providing a statutory framework for retirement.
However, that is not the end of the matter. Of course, many of these
things would have been dealt with had that large section of the
Constitutional Reform and Governance Bill, attached as an appendix to
this paper, not been dropped in the wash-up prior to the 2010 election.
Therefore, we should gently remind the leaders of both parties that
they were, indeed, more or less signed up to that three years ago. What
they must now do is to exercise restraint. This is crucial
for the reputation of the House, which stands high in the
public esteem. There was a very good leader in the <I>Times</I> the day
after our latest colleagues’ appointments 
<?notus-xml column=431?>were announced way back in late July or August, which said that this was
a great institution but was in danger of being overinflated, or words
to that effect. It is crucial that we heed that warning. The noble

not matter

congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Higgins, on raising this issue.
With respect to the Clerk, who was here earlier, his note is just
tinkering with the issue when the reality of what is happening is
making a mockery of it. This House is being packed. We now hear that
there is going to be a second list. As my noble friend Lord Lea asked,
what is the purpose of this? Is it to reflect the vote at the general
election or the balance of the House of Commons? Why? This is a

that the structure of this House and the way it is constituted needs
reform—I do not think there is anyone who disagrees with

In the long term, it needs to be looked at in the context of what else
is happening in this country in constitutional terms, particularly with
devolution. I favour a federal structure, which the Liberal Democrats
have been arguing for. We could be a federal House representing the
regions of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. That would be
a great step forward. That kind of indirect election should be looked

need to look at something more radical than the tinkering that the

age or participation in the House, so that we can encourage people who
are not taking part or who are of a certain age to move towards
retirement. We need to get a House that is smaller than the House of

Lady McIntosh here—but the Labour group is looking at this in
the short and long terms, and we will be coming forward with some quite
sensible, radical proposals. I hope they will be given serious

I hope we can use what I hope the Labour group will propose as the

two questions for the Minister based on this statement. First, if it is
wrong for taxpayers’ money to encourage Members of this House to
retire, why is it not considered wrong to use taxpayers’ money
to encourage Members of the other House to retire? It used to be the
case that some MPs sat well beyond retirement age because they could
not afford to retire. The Government introduced financial packages
that, for all intents and purposes, were designed to enable MPs to
retire gracefully. Not only is there now a pension, but for the past 22
years there has also been a resettlement grant. Why is this use of
public money deemed right, but something similar for this House is
wrong?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000051">Secondly,
why do the Government find it wrong to use taxpayers’ money to
facilitate Members leaving the House, but have no difficulty using
taxpayers’ money to enable new Peers to be created? I have seen
estimates of how much it will cost the public purse if the latest
tranche of new Peers prove reasonably assiduous in attendance. The
scheme embodied in the memorandum of the Clerk of the Parliaments is
designed to save money in the long term, and help to reduce the
size of the House, whereas the current practice of the
Government in creating new Peers achieves precisely the opposite. I
look forward to the Minister justifying this state of
affairs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000052">The
Government appear to have no qualms about creating more Peers, adding
to the burden on the public purse, while making no real effort to
address the problem of the size of the House. I see no principled
reason for the stance taken by the Leader of the House. The
Clerk’s suggested scheme is a valuable contribution to the
debate, and if it is not to be pursued, we need a much more considered
response from
Ministers.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_24_PT_1/9FD562ACFE01F2A7AD281584B081BBE3542D6F5F" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 October 2013">Thursday,

more, and I want to ask the Government whether they expect to win every

see the point of your Lordships’ House. If the Government are
not defeated on a fairly regular basis, we cannot send matters back to
the House of Commons and there is no point to us. I am increasingly of

interesting report, with a number of suggestions as to how we might
deal with these issues. We may not agree with all of them, but I
particularly draw your Lordships’ attention to recommendation
10, on determining the relative numerical strengths of party groups in

Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, this debate
raises a large number of questions. Let me try to answer as many as I
can. I start by saying that the 
<?notus-xml column=436?>Government remain committed to thorough reform and the creation of an
elected House. This is part of the reason why we resist proposals to
end by-elections of hereditary Peers. I was here when that particular
concession was made by the then leader of the Conservative Peers, now
the Marquess of Salisbury, on the basis that it would remain until
thorough reform took
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000061">The
Government are committed to thorough reform. However, we now have a
number of proposals which I have heard described as housekeeping
proposals, which are on an interim basis. We recognise that there will
not be another attempt at House of Lords reform until well after the
next election, when I look forward to seeing a commitment to an elected
second Chamber appearing once again in all of the party manifestos.
Having said that, we have to recognise that there are some real
problems in the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000062">The
noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, disappointed me enormously in his speech. I
looked forward to him saying that we must tackle the question of
retirement age, a topic on which I thought he was intervening the other
day. I recognise that at the core of much of this are the difficulty of
a retirement age or of encouraging retirement, and the balance of the
groups within the
House.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000063">When
I joined the House, now some 17 years ago, I was told that by
entering the House of Lords I was raising my life expectancy by a
further two years. It is such an interesting place and it keeps us
lively and fit. As I sat listening today I reflected that, if I decide
that I really ought to take permanent leave of absence when I am 95, I
have only 23 more years of service to go. I will then have served in
the House for 40 years. We recognise the problem of keeping the House
lively and renewing
membership.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000064">Incidentally,
there is also the problem of different age balances among the different
party groups. The Conservatives are the oldest group in terms of
appointments, because many of them were appointed in the Thatcher
years. Particularly when I talk to some of the older Labour Peers, I am
conscious that the reluctance to retire of those on both the Labour and
the Conservative Benches is sometimes expressed in terms of,
“I would be letting my side down if I retire but some of
them do not. We would alter the age balance against us”.
Anything we talk about in relation to retirements feeds back into the
question of party balance. I remind the noble Lord,
Lord Hunt, that it is not just the party groups who vote in
this House. We have a very active group of Cross- Benchers. I
will check on the incidence of votes lost in this Parliament compared
to votes lost in the last Parliament. I was not aware that there was a
substantial difference in the number of votes lost. In the Bills that I
have dealt with, the concessions which one must make in order to avoid
votes being lost, and the number of votes lost, are certainly important
matters. I give way.</hs_para>

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, this is for the first time
a coalition Government and part of the issue is whether you count the
entire coalition of both parties as one or as two. The Government do
not have an overall majority in this House because we have a large
number of Cross-Benchers. If I may say so, one of the first
things I learnt when I entered this House was that if you want to
defeat the Government, what you need is a speaker from each of the
four main groups, because at that point the Government will
recognise that they are about to lose. The noble Lord, Lord Cormack, is
occasionally very good at being part of those groups which challenge
his own Government. That is the way the House of Lords

general election with a majority? It would be faced with a majority of
100 Conservative and Lib Dem Peers over the Labour group in your
Lordships’ House. There would then be a dissolution list to
which I assume both Mr Cameron and Mr Clegg would contribute. What

this because unless we are going to have a House that grows older
gracefully and has very little renewal, we have to have a scheme that
encourages retirement. The House has been getting older.
After 17 years I have just passed the average age of the House.
We need good new Members because we do not entirely want to be a House
that represents the wisdom of 25 years ago, and therefore we need to
address the question of retirement. I have had one or two conversations
with older Peers who have suggested that a more dignified retirement
arrangement, in which the House recognises the service of those Members
who are retiring, would be of very considerable assistance to them. I
am willing to take that back and, indeed, I have already discussed it
with the Leader of the House. I think that it is something which we
should all attempt to progress as best we can.</hs_para>

who have also welcomed this rapprochement. The UK in general, and the
education sector in particular, would benefit from the easing of
sanctions. This could be a win-win for all concerned, provided that
there is understanding and appreciation of the difficulties on the
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000095">Education
is one of the most effective means of building long-term trust among
nations and individuals. It is hardly surprising that it is Ayatollah
Rohani, a graduate of Glasgow Caledonian University, who started the
negotiations and secured a level of agreement from the spiritual leader
of Iran. Students make a significant contribution economically,
academically and intellectually, in terms of building understanding
across divides that sometimes prove difficult to cross
otherwise.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000096">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:04:17"></hs_TimeCode>,
there is a real problem in the banking system as it stands and as it
has operated in the decades since the imposition of sanctions. It has
been a serious impediment. Students who have been offered
places—who are more than willing to pay the fees and health
taxes that might be imposed in the future and have the money
ready—cannot find a bank in the UK willing to open an account
for them. I know of students who have lived in Canada for more than 10
years but who, because they are Iranian, cannot even transmit money
from Canada to the UK to start discussions. That seems to result in
universities saying that their hands are tied because they cannot
proceed with the processes. The University of Sheffield, for example,
has been working in Iran and has offices there offering scholarships to
Iranian students with exceptional academic potential. Many Iranians,
particularly women, have such potential aplenty.</hs_para>

only that the students cannot open accounts; a further problem is when
those students who are already in this country and have accounts here
go on fieldwork trips and come back, they find that they have to reopen
the same accounts and provide the same information all over again. In
the case of one of my students, who made two field trips, this had to
be done
twice.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000098">These
kinds of obstacles make students less willing to apply to British
universities. The measures are highly counterproductive and the
Government should come to the rescue of these students because, as we
all know, most if not all British universities are heavily dependent on
foreign student fees in order to bridge the gap created by the cuts.
Last year, banking restrictions also resulted in Iran abandoning its
conversion rate 
<?notus-xml column=441?>for foreign students, which gave favourable rates to students studying
abroad, particularly in the UK. Now, it is much more expensive for
Iranian students to raise the same fees in Iran.</hs_para>

have also resulted in very serious medical problems in Iran because
pharmaceutical companies cannot import the necessary ingredients for
producing medication at affordable prices. This has resulted in the
deaths of hundreds of people. Political prisoners have even written an
open letter asking for the lifting of sanctions. They point out what I
have pointed out in the House before: namely, that sanctions only make
the rich richer and the poor poorer. It is not the rich who suffer from
the sanctions—they get their medication, they come abroad for
treatment—but those who are living in Iran. The situation is
dire, which is another reason that Iranians are extremely keen to enter
negotiations and for them to be
successful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000100">The
prospect of detente has already resulted in the freeing of a number of
political prisoners: 11 were freed a month ago. They included Nasrin
Sotoudeh, the campaigning human rights lawyer and winner of the
European Parliament’s 2012 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of
Thought, and the reformist politician Mohsen Aminzadeh. A week later,
on the eve of President Rouhani’s visit to the USA, 80 more
political prisoners were freed, some of whom had been jailed after the
mass protests triggered by the fraud- tainted re-election of
former President Ahmadinejad in 2009. Last week, more political
prisoners were pardoned. The hope is that this process will continue
and
accelerate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000101">A
rapprochement would be extremely beneficial to the UK. The
Iranian economy has not died during this period. In fact, many projects
have been set up, including mining, construction, chemical production,
car manufacturing and packaging, and are thriving. But the sanctions
have resulted in trade relations moving towards Russia and the East,
rather than the West. In 2010 China became Iran’s largest
trading partner. In 2011 trade between Dubai and Iran was valued at
$13.6 billion. Last year Iran’s largest car maker agreed to send
10,000 cars per annum to Russia.</hs_para>

banking restriction, trading partners use hawala, a system of
exchanging money without the money ever leaving the country. It is a
system completely dependent on trust, in which the bank uses a country
that trades favourably with both trading partners. The current
favourite is Japan. The Iranian bank leaves money in a bank in Iran and
Japan uses its debts to Iran to provide money in any currency to a
trading partner on the other side. So trade has continued; it has not
diminished. This could be a profit that the UK is missing.</hs_para>

mentioning nuclear power and chemical weapons. I am no expert in these
matters, but the facts that the Iranians are offering to keep only two
nuclear programmes in Natanz and argue that they have no chemical
weapons are worth considering. Iran was attacked with chemical weapons.
The havoc that caused means that no Iranian would allow them to be used
against anyone, not even their enemy.</hs_para>

human rights in Iran and recognise the concern over them. Only this

highlighted and condemned the continued detention of human rights

as the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar said, 500 Iranian intellectuals
wrote an open letter. Eighty of them were or had been in prison. They
said that the election of President Rouhani had produced a significant
change in the climate, that things were changing and that they felt the
offer Rouhani had made ought to be responded to by the West. That was

noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, on initiating this debate. I entirely
agree with what she said about cultural exchanges. I am also involved
in the Iran Heritage Foundation, which exists to do precisely what she
described. For example, it was involved in helping set up two major
exhibitions in the British Museum and in taking the scroll of Cyrus
back to Iran. The Foreign Office advised that it would be stolen by the
Iranians, but we went ahead and did it, and it was returned on time and
generated a lot of good
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000107">I
believe that the election of President Rouhani was a significant event

Netanyahu saying that it is the same old thing with a smile, I do not
believe for one minute that President Rouhani could have said the sort
of things he said with eloquence in the television debates without
meaning them and without intending to try to bring change to Iran. His
spoke about the use of social media and greater freedom for
individuals, and just 48 hours ago made a speech about freedom in

are some people who say that sanctions have brought this about, and
therefore that we should continue with them, not relax them. That would
be a huge error. People wanted change, but polls show that there is

500,000 people either lost their lives or were seriously wounded.
People do not recognise that Iran is, militarily, a very weak country.

a deal possible? There are a number of points that need to be
considered. First, obviously, we need the maximum transparency and
rigorous inspection. The additional protocol has to be signed by Iran,
meaning that inspectors can request to go anywhere in the country. Then
there is the big issue of the timescale. The Iranians want a quick
deal. They talk of six months. Of course, they want quick relief from
sanctions. However, quick relief from sanctions does not mean that
there could not be an extended period, perhaps lasting five years or
so, in which the suspension of sanctions was conditional or dependent
on Iran continuing to honour the undertakings that it made with regard
to its nuclear
programme<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:17:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000113">Then
you have the issue of the size of Iran’s enrichment programme.
The Israelis say that it should be dismantled completely. I think it is
clear that that is unacceptable to the Iranians. I do not pretend to
have any nuclear expertise but I have spent quite a bit of time talking
to people who have. I believe that by taking measures to deal
with capacity, output and the type of centrifuges involved, it would be
possible to define the breakout period. The breakout period is what
concerns Israel: that is, the time it would take to break out from a
civilian programme to manufacture a weapon. That period has to be long
enough so that the West can identify and respond to it. I believe that
that could be
identified<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:18:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000114">I
do not believe that Iran will accept that there should be an end to all
enrichment in that country. That would be very difficult for it to
accept politically, and very difficult for it to justify after all the
suffering from sanctions and all the billions that have been spent on
it. However, its programme should be related to what its need for
nuclear electricity is likely to be. We threw away opportunities in the
past: in 2003 and 2005. Even the Israeli Defence Minister said
yesterday that he believed Iran was genuine in wanting a deal. Israel
may be opposed to it, but he said that Iran was genuine in that belief
and aspiration. I hope that we will not repeat the mistakes we made

Williams of Crosby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I very much agree with
what has already been said by the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, and I
congratulate her on calling this timely debate. I also strongly support
what was said by my noble friend Lord Lamont, who was absolutely right
in suggesting that it is perfectly possible to now open negotiations
with Iran on a serious basis. I add only one thing to what he said
about that, which is that Iran has already suggested that it could move
away from the 20% refinement figure across the front, where it started
moving in that direction, and back to the 5% which is compatible with
civilian uses of nuclear power. That should be carefully tested,
investigated and discussed so that we can find out how much credence
there is in what has already been
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000117">The only
other point that I will make is that it is difficult to look at a
country like Iran and not recognise that it has profound reasons to be
frightened of being attacked. We tend to forget in this country
that the Iran-Iraq war brought, as my noble friend said,
500,000 casualties. That is a rather modest figure; my understanding is
that it was probably more like 800,000, of which the larger proportion
was Iranian casualties. Why? Because only Iraq used chemical weapons;
Iran never resorted to them. Iraq used both sarin and mustard gas,
which are long-standing and extremely agonising forms of chemical
weaponry. It can fairly be said that there is not a single country in
the world, not even Syria, which has suffered as much from the use of
chemical weapons as Iran. Despite that, Iran has never attempted to
build up chemical weapons. Compared to the huge reserves of 10,000
tonnes that we know Syria has, the core of the matter is that Iran has
never moved in that direction. It has repeatedly said that it regards
chemical weapons as totally
unacceptable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000118">On
a more general note, I understand that up until now, the United Nations
has not sent an invitation to Iran to take part in the Geneva II
negotiations which are likely to happen later this year or, at the very
latest, early next spring. I find that puzzling given that Iran is the
second-greatest regional power in the whole area, and also given that
it is seen as an ally by Syria. Assad has not said himself that he will
go to any Geneva II negotiations, but there is surely reason to believe
that if his closest ally, Iran, is there, he is much more likely to go
than if it is not there. Perhaps my noble friend Lady Warsi will tell
us something about the prospects for Geneva II including Iran as one of
the countries sitting round the table. It is vital because, like it or
not, Iran is seen by the whole of the Shia group of Muslims throughout
the world as being the lead country. Therefore, its non-presence would
almost certainly undermine the value of those
negotiations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000119" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000119">I
will say two other things before turning to one or two practical ideas
that could be used to create a much closer and mutually constructive
relationship with Iran. 
<?notus-xml column=445?>I fully share what has already been said by the noble Baroness, Lady
Afshar, and the noble Lord, Lord Lamont, on the subject of issues that
can be taken up and used in this respect. The first thing I will say is
that there is a colossal misunderstanding about Iran in the West. I
will take just one example, as a woman Member of the House of Lords. It
is widely believed in large parts of the United States that Iran is
rather like Saudi Arabia: that women walk around fully veiled, are not
allowed to drive cars, have no education and are deeply and profoundly
suppressed. Not so. Some 55% of undergraduates in Iran at the
present time are women, and there are large numbers of women at the
very top of both the legal and medical
professions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000120" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000120">I
completely share what was said by both previous speakers about human
rights. We absolutely need to insist that Iran lives up to the highest
standards of human rights and that it releases more—indeed,
ultimately all—its prisoners who have not been tried. It is
vital that we better understand that this great civilisation is not the
same as some of the excesses that one sees in other countries.
Incidentally, the widely held belief that Iran is Arab is also
completely misleading. The fact that it is multifaceted in religious
terms is an important point to make. There are still active members of
the Zoroastrian community in Iran, which is an ancient
civilisation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000121" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000121">Practically,
what can we do? I suggest that there are three areas where we could
create much better relations with Iran without damaging in any way the
serious considerations that have to be brought to bear on such things
as nuclear weapons and so
forth.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:24:23"></hs_TimeCode> First,
the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, mentioned the possibility of much
closer relations with universities. My noble friend Lord Phillips of
Sudbury recently went to the University of Isfahan, which is a very
famous and ancient university, and also to the University of Tehran. In
both cases he was told very strongly that they would welcome a much
closer relationship with a matching United Kingdom university. They did
not specify which ones, but they made it clear that they would be wide
open to such
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:24:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000122">There
is another serious issue which involves the universities. That is, as
some noble Lords in the Room already know, that there is a very serious
incidence of drug-related tuberculosis in Zahedan, in the south-eastern
part of Iran. I will spell it for <I>Hansard</I>. I am not sure I have
pronounced it right. The important point is that drug-related TB is not
a respecter of borders. It crosses them very happily. We know from our
own experience of drug-related tuberculosis among some migrants to
Britain how crucial it is to try to deal with this at the source. Iran
comes second only to India in the incidence of drug-related TB. We have
in Britain university departments that are highly instructed about and
knowledgeable about drug-related TB. This is, again, an obvious win-win
example of what can be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:25:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000123">Secondly—and
I now look firmly at the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon and
Leeds, who will be surprised that I address him—I strongly
believe that a group of religious leaders from Britain would be very
welcome in Iran and would do a great deal to bridge the gap between us
and this strange country, which is rather like the Holy Roman Empire,
in that it is at 
<?notus-xml column=446?>once both a religious and a political entity. I have always been puzzled
why the great advantage that the Church of England has in this respect,
as a state-based religion, could not be used to create much closer
relations with

final point is very important. We have in this Room—I invited
him as a guest—Professor Lightfoot, who is the leader of the
co-ordinating organisation of international research into disease
surveillance. He has set up, all over the world, networks of people
looking at surveillance of a disease and how it moves across the world.
He has just been approached by Iran, Armenia, Georgia, and other
countries with a view to setting up a regional network. I can think of
nothing better—less objectionable, politically
speaking—than to set up such

others, I have been heartened by the change of political rhetoric
following the elections in Iran, and share the high expectations that a
more pragmatic stance from Tehran will see progress made on a range of
issues, not least the nuclear issues. In view of the speed of recent
diplomatic developments and the ambitious timetable set at this
month’s talks in Geneva—the six to nine months to which a
number of noble Lords have already referred—it would be helpful
to have some idea from the Minister as to what she understands to be
the end game. What would a normalisation of relations look like? What
might be the trade-offs that each party might be required to make? That
seems to be at the heart of the question that the noble Baroness has
put before us

will take up the references that have been made to issues of human
rights in Iran. I want to see progress on the nuclear issue, but I am
conscious that in any trade-off we could see a weakening of the
Government’s commitment to secure progress on other fronts,
particularly that of human rights. Iran appears to be preparing a
receptive response to inquiries from international oil and gas
companies, in the expectation of the lifting of EU sanctions. That may
well be right, and it may well be the direction in which we ought to
go. However, it seems premature until we have more in the way of
assurances and evidence that human rights will be more respected in
Iran than they have been.</hs_para>

not yet convinced that a change in Iran’s human rights agenda
will come with the Rouhani presidency, because critical decisions
continue to be made by the Supreme National Security Council. This
remains populated by a cohort of people who spent much of their careers
in the military and security services. I listened hard to the
arguments, both in this debate and earlier, that Iran has no regional
ambitions, and about its place in the funding of rejectionist
Palestinian entities. I am not yet convinced by these arguments. For
me, there needs to be much clearer evidence of a new Iranian policy in
the whole area, as well as new developments at

Hylton (CB):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I join in the thanks
already expressed to the noble Baroness, Lady Afshar, for this debate.
I start from the fact that the United States has had no diplomatic
relations with Iran since 1979. This has moved me to argue for
political détente. I will continue to do so, and I welcome of
course the first small steps that Her Majesty’s Government have
taken in this direction; for example, by exchanging non-resident
chargés d’affaires and by the conversation between our
Foreign Secretary and his Iranian counterpart in New York.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102455000136" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000136">I<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
hope that relations will continue to be improved step by step. There
are two rather obvious reasons for doing so, the first being external
and the other internal. 
<?notus-xml column=448?>Iran is in a position to be extremely helpful in other countries,
particularly Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Afghanistan. That is why, and as
other speakers have mentioned, I would like to see Iran taking part at
whatever level can be agreed in the second Geneva conference on Syria.
I agree strongly with the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000137">The
internal reason is that Iran is a diverse country, by no means
monolithic. It contains Azeris, Kurds, Arabs and Balochis—to
name only a few of the subgroups. Politically, there are hardline and
more moderate clerics, just as there are Revolutionary Guards and
pretty extreme politicians. The new president and his Government are
somewhat different from the previous Administration. It is therefore
important to give as much encouragement as possible to those who hold
reasonable views and who care for the common good of the whole
population. This has, we know, been much damaged by sanctions, a
depreciating currency and rising prices. It is in our interest that the
present Government should not be marginalised by their
opponents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:36:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000138">Iran
has some 75 million people and is therefore of a similar size to Egypt,
recognised as the largest Arab country. The noble Baroness, Lady
Afshar, is therefore quite right to ask for closer education links. My
late mother’s cousin, Nancy Lambton, was for many years
professor of Persian at London University. She and others created links
which should be
developed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:37:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000139">On
commerce and trade, Iran could become an important market for our
goods, services and expertise. Iranians whom I met just a few years ago
in Isfahan were keen supporters of our football teams. We therefore
have some goodwill on which to build. I acknowledge of course that
major trade links may have to wait until progress has been made on the
nuclear issue. I look forward to the Government’s thoughts on
the possible means for achieving improved relations and greater
détente—some of which, again, were outlined by the noble
Baroness, Lady

important moment. I share President Obama’s assessment, echoed
by my noble friend Lady Ashton on behalf of the EU, that President
Hassan Rouhani is indeed reaching out. The recent exchanges on the
nuclear programme, the exchanges of letters and the interface with our
own Foreign Secretary are hopeful signs, but so far they are only
signs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:38:51"></hs_TimeCode>. I

who knows the Iranian people or who has visited the country will be
impressed by the energy and intellectual curiosity, particularly of
young Iranians. Anyone who has ever taught Iranian students, as I have
had the good fortune to do, will know exactly what I mean, and the
noble Baroness, Lady Williams, made key points about the role of women
in higher education which I wholly endorse. Iranians are inquiring,
modern and hungry to engage with others; they are protective of their
country, although that does not mean that they embrace theocratic rule
or want to live 
<?notus-xml column=449?>in a social order resembling a caliphate—that is not true about
them. Some are very brave. They faced repression, even if there are now
limited changes.</hs_para>

look at the two outward-facing windows that this debate suggests we
look at which offer perhaps the best opportunities to build, for
ordinary people, on the process of reaching out. Commercial links have
understandably been impacted by economic sanctions. Sanctions were and,
in my view, are essential until there is compliance with all United
Nations decisions. They have had an impact and have had a much better
effect than the alternative forms of intervention which some have
advocated. It is easy to understand that the Iranians want them eased.
The country is struggling under the current sanctions, not least
because of the two-thirds decline in its oil exports, which account for
some 50% of government
expenditure.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000143">The
noble Lord, Lord Lamont, put the case about the economy very strongly,
and I can only echo him. In exchange for diplomatic concessions, there
is already promising talk about easing sanctions imposed by the UN and
the West. Starting from such a low point, almost any commercial link is
bound to be an improvement. On 19 October, the United States released
$12 billion-worth of sanctions and the EU released $35 billion-worth of
sanctions. These are good steps. I know of business opportunities,
including some for Iranian state pension providers, many of whose
beneficiaries are British. Opportunity is there, so there will be
progress, but only if there is progress in the other areas that concern
us, not least uranium enrichment and security for the missions of
countries, including ours, that have suffered in the recent past. We do
not yet know with certainty that this progress is sustainable, and I
will return to the strategic judgment we have to make. It should be the
core issue of this debate that we look at this issue, and ask the same
fundamental questions as the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Ripon
and Leeds. I share his call for clarity.</hs_para>

invaluable for the future. They reach a new generation of Iranians whom
we need to reach. UNESCO tells us that almost 99% of Iranians aged
between 15 and 24 are literate and, as a percentage, as many people go
to tertiary education as in this country. Support for educational and
cultural exchanges between our two countries will form stronger bonds
and more mutual comprehension. We have promoted this through the
British Council and Chevening
scholarships.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000145" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000145">Other
countries have also recognised the problems in this arena. UNESCO
reported interventions—I will not go though all the kinds of
courses because of the time—from Germany, France, the Czech
Republic, Malaysia, Korea and the United States, and I am sure there
are a great many others. Aside from the Chevening scholarships, I am
aware of initiatives taken by a number of British universities. There
are scholarships at Cambridge, East Anglia, Westminster and Nottingham,
and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, kindly reminded us of a longer and
deeper historic link with the universities as
well.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000146">All this
is positive, but it does not address the key strategic issue. I know
how hard negotiating with Iran can be as I conducted the negotiations
for the release 
<?notus-xml column=450?>of our sailors and marines who were seized in the
Persian Gulf by the Revolutionary Guard. Everyone is entitled to look
for signs of hope—we would feel hopeless if we did not do
that—but we will all weigh the changes in top personnel, even if
we do not yet know much about them, and the positive words, which are
to be welcomed and given weight, while we recognise that the intention
of diplomats who utter them is that they should be given weight. The
art is to be optimistic, but not to put unsustainable weight on
pronouncements or on preliminary stages of a dialogue. These are
processes where cautious advance is critical, working out with
consummate care what is to be given in exchange for real changes, and
for nothing
less.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000147" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000147">I ask
noble Lords not to misunderstand my point. I want hope and positive
advance no less than anybody else. I do not want to miss any window of
opportunity, but I know that no sophisticated nation or alliance builds
a credible foreign policy on the basis of hope alone. It is built in
calibrated steps by all parties. It is circumspect and usually involves
turning around a huge tanker that is loaded with history, poor
experiences and disappointments. To do so as fast as the evidence

should have carefully designed milestones by which to measure
proposals. That is the approach I would advocate, and I do not believe

the UK is concerned, we have tried to issue
e<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:47:36"></hs_TimeCode>xport licenses
for these products as a priority, but I understand the challenges that
are presented by the banking sanctions. I shall certainly take back the
comments that have been made in the debate today, including those
referring to CORDS, the organisation that is in attendance here. It is
the ambition of the UK Government to resolve the impasse in the nuclear
issue peacefully. We therefore hope that President Rouhani’s
Government will engage constructively and reach a negotiated settlement
with the international
community<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T14:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Lords, and specifically in response to the comments made by my noble
friend Lord Lamont, that we have been open with Iran. We have said
clearly that reaching a comprehensive agreement on the nuclear issue
would mean the normalisation of political and economic relations with
the international community and the end of all nuclear sanctions.
Iran’s nuclear programme would be treated in the same manner as
that of any other non-nuclear weapon state party to the
non-proliferation treaty. A solution to the nuclear problem would mean
that normal commercial ties with Iran could resume. It is therefore in
all our interests for this matter to be resolved and for us to proceed
to the next stage. The E3+3 accepts and respects Iran’s right to
use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. But this remains impossible
if Iran continues to expand its nuclear programme in violation of UN
Security Council resolutions and multiple resolutions of the IAEA Board
of Governors.</hs_para>

activities go far beyond what is required for a civil nuclear
programme. Iran needs to take concrete steps to address international
concerns and comply with international resolutions. We therefore
welcome the more positive approach taken by the Iranian Government in
nuclear talks between Iran and the E3+3 in Geneva last week. Foreign
Minister Zarif presented a basis for negotiations and for the first
time diplomats have begun more substantive 
<?notus-xml column=452?>discussions with Iran on issues of concern. We hope
that negotiations will lead soon to some tangible results. There is a
great deal of hard work ahead and further talks will take place on 7
and 8 November in Geneva. It is important that we maintain the positive
momentum of the negotiations while at all times keeping a clear focus
on Iran’s continuing efforts to develop its nuclear
programme.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000155" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000155">The
noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and other noble Lords raised the issue of
educational ties. We deeply regret that one implication of the lack of
progress on the nuclear issue and a consequence of the closure of our
embassy in Tehran has been to make it harder for Iranians to apply for
visas to travel here as students, and for other visas. While there has
been a noticeable drop in the number of students applying for visas,
the UK remains committed to fostering educational links and has issued
nearly 1,500 student visas via our diplomatic missions in Istanbul and
Abu Dhabi. We also continue to run the Chevening Scholarships programme
for Iranian students. This scheme is part-funded by the Foreign Office
and will enable six outstanding scholars from Iran to study a one-year
postgraduate course at a university in the UK.</hs_para>

Williams is right: one issue where Iran can, and must, play a
constructive role is Syria. The new Iranian Government have said that
they want to see a peaceful solution to the Syrian conflict. No
decision has been made on Iran’s participation in Geneva II. We
call on President Rouhani’s Government to match their words with
actions and publicly endorse the G8-backed Geneva communiqué,
which calls for a negotiation between the Assad regime and the
Opposition on a new transitional authority for Syria. Iran has so far
failed to endorse that communiqué. Iran’s actions must
not prolong the conflict and must not contravene UN Security Council
Resolution 1747. However, by supporting the Syrian regime with weapons

to do that at this

as this Committee is well aware, the human rights situation in Iran
continues to be a matter of serious concern. We regularly receive
reports of serious violations by the Iranian regime against its own

the issue of human rights, women’s rights in particular, but
there are still challenges. Women continue to suffer discrimination
under Iranian law with a draft Islamic penal code continuing to
legitimise disparity between the sexes. We saw a further erosion of

release of Nasrin Sotoudeh. This is, of course, a welcome step, but
more needs to be done to ensure all Iranians enjoy the rights and
freedoms to which they are entitled. I can assure the right reverend
Prelate that the issue of human rights concerns is as important to us
as nuclear concerns. We have designated more than 80 Iranians
responsible for human 
<?notus-xml column=454?>rights violations under EU sanctions and have helped to establish a UN
special rapporteur on Iran human rights. We supported Iran-focused
human rights resolutions at this year’s UN General Assembly. In

conclusion, we sincerely hope that the marked change in Iran’s
public statements is accompanied by concrete actions on issues of
concern, not least the adoption of a viable approach to nuclear
negotiations. If it is, the UK stands ready to work with Iran. We do
not underestimate the difficulties ahead, but must take full advantage
of any opportunities. If Iran matches its words with genuine steps to
address the concerns that have been outlined in today’s debate,
the Government believe that there is a rare and significant opportunity
for progress to be made, and for our commercial and educational links
to be strengthened as a result. This can only be to the benefit of
Iran, Britain and the rest of the international

since that housing strategy document was published, and it has to be
said that the first year, in terms of the number of houses built, was
disappointing. In 2012-13, only 108,000 houses were completed. We have
to face the fact that, after the 2008 economic meltdown, which had an
overheated speculative housing boom and bust at its epicentre,
restoring confidence and getting finance flowing again was never going
to be a quick fix. There was also the adjustment of a new social
housing programme, which has taken time to bed in and get under
way.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000172">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:02:51"></hs_TimeCode>,
there are signs of life now in the housing market. The number of new
homes completed in the last quarter was up 25%, housing starts were up
by a third and stamp duty revenues were up. That is clearly a change
from a year ago. Housing was then very much seen, certainly by those
who thought we should give greater priority to it, as the best
possible kick-start to the economy. Now, with signs of recovery, our
main concern must be that demand does not outstrip supply. We have to
refocus on the shortfall between the number of houses built and the
formation of new households, which requires houses to be built
at double the rate we are building them at the moment.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:03:25"></hs_TimeCode> hope the
Minister will be able to tell us what the Government’s latest
forecast is for new homes this year and whether they are
confident that they can build the projected 170,000
affordable homes by 2015 that they set out in their housing
strategy. That will represent significant progress on the number built
in the last five years of the previous
Government.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000173">With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:03:49"></hs_TimeCode>
signs of recovery, and some initial concerns about house prices rising
in the south-east and London, housing strategy requires a long-term
focus. We must avoid the quick fix that ends in another burst housing
bubble and which will only compromise the chances of more people owning
their own home or renting one at an affordable
rent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:04:07"></hs_TimeCode>. We must
not forget the many lessons of past housing cycles, which have occurred
under Governments of all persuasions, but particularly under the
previous one in the so-called good times between 1999 and 2007. The
number of new houses built annually during that period rose by
something like 30%, from 120,000 a year to 160,000 at the peak. But
prices rose by 173% and mortgage loans increased by 182%. The central
problem is that housing is a cyclical industry where price inflation
has been the driver of profitability in the short term and land asset
appreciation has been endemic to a business model that eventually hits
the
buffers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000174">Each
boom and bust has not only shaken financial confidence but has sapped
capacity in the sector. Each cycle has made the inelasticities of the
supply chain even less subtle. Housebuilders are rightly going to be
cautious following the experience of the bust times. They are initially
going to be motivated to make marginal additions on their most
profitable sites. They will even have some interest in allowing prices
to rise rather than in providing volume to counter the higher prices.
There has been a huge reduction in capacity in the sector, and skilled
workers and developers have left the scene. Already there are signs
that building costs are moving up with the initial recovery.</hs_para>

guidelines for the Government. First, given the very dysfunctional
housing market, they will need to intervene more than they want to.
Particularly as recovery takes hold, they will have to work on opening
up land supply and making sure that our technical colleges provide the
new skills that are going to be needed to fill the capacity shortages.
They will have to monitor competition in the market with the smaller
number of developers in
play.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000176" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000176">Secondly,
they will have to watch like a hawk their demand-led initiatives, such
as Help to Buy, to make sure that they do not simply lead to price
inflation. Thirdly, although 75% of new build is in the private sector
by developers, they need to balance their attention with initiatives
for social and council houses and for self-build to develop the full
potential of new capacity and affordable housing. Doubling building
capacity must be our objective, and it will probably take another full
Parliament to get
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000177">What is
needed with these guidelines? It is all there in the housing strategy
document, but the strategy now has to concentrate on easing the supply
constraints in the sector. Let us look first at the private sector.
Planning flexibilities have to show through to release more land to be
used. We have to make sure that the new homes bonus for local
authorities provides an incentive to release development land. New
players have got to be encouraged into the market. The Government were
right to give more support to encourage self-build, which has been a
weak component of the private sector after the destructive impact of
stop-go cycles. Price stability has to be an important objective for
living standards. Energy bills pall into insignificance compared with
the cost of housing.</hs_para>

to have low interest rates, but we do not want people fooled into
thinking that they can continue. The greatest concern is that Help to
Buy will stoke up prices in the south-east, although it will probably
still have a role to play in other parts of the country. Will the
Government consider reverting to a regionally focused Help to Buy
scheme if house prices get out of hand in London and the south-east?
Will the Minister update us on the progress the Government have been
making with build now, pay later, the Growing Places fund and
initiatives to stimulate self-build? Is the announcement on the much
needed larger developments for the new generation of garden cities now
imminent?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102455000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000179">In
the social housing sector, there is still uncertainty about future
funding. If it delivers the Government’s target of 170,000
affordable homes, it would demonstrate its capacity potential. The
Government’s proposal to develop a guaranteed bond scheme linked
to potential institutional investment has the potential to fund a
further 60,000 homes. What impact on extra housing supply can now be
expected from the guaranteed loans for social and private rented
landlords provided in the Government’s
strategy?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000180">In
the council housing sector, now that councils have control of their
housing revenue accounts, is the improving economic situation not a
good time to review whether council investment in housing should be
included in the public borrowing limit? We need to put councils on an
equal footing with housing associations. 
<?notus-xml column=457?>No other European country has as strict accountancy
arrangements as we do. Frankly, if we want to tackle some of the
problems of our own council estates, they need development,
regeneration and investment. Is this not a good time for the Government
to review the anomaly that exists between councils and housing

seven years from preparation of the first application to the grant of

cost us about £4 million. If the scheme was unusual, even
revolutionary, it would probably have taken longer. It certainly

the analysis. At present, our site in Bicester has permission for 1,585

slow down something is to tax it. Can we please try the reverse? A
route to be studied would be to ensure that stamp duty on residential
houses was paid to the local planning authority rather than to the

should declare my interests in the register, as did the noble Lord,
particularly the fact that I am chairman of OLIM Property Ltd, which is
a commercial property investment management company. I have bought
about £100 million-worth of property during the past year all
over the country, from Belfast to Ipswich, Preston to Leeds and
Peterhead to Exeter. Although I am not operating in the housing market,

is a simple and very serious problem that house prices are horribly and
unaffordably high in this country. I go beyond the people who argue for
stability, and say that prices are too high and need to come down.
There are two simple reasons for this. We have built far too few houses
for many years and we have also, in terms of affordability, sold off so
much of the social housing stock. Two million houses were sold since
Mrs Thatcher introduced the policy in 1979, of which three-quarters of
a million—no less—were sold under Blair and
Brown.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102455000195" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000195">Under
both Governments we had a failure to build, and a failure even to use
what houses we have to best advantage. We are therefore left today with
£23 billion of housing benefit being poured down the drain. Much
of it is actually spent on the same council houses which were sold off,
but the rent now goes to private
landlords.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000196" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000196">The
result of this long-term lack of supply can be seen today in the ratios
of earnings to house prices, which is the key measure of affordability.
You do not, if you are wise, take a mortgage on the basis of this
week’s special mortgage offer. Mortgage rates go up and down,
but obviously what matters long-term is how your earnings compare to
what you pay for the house. If I were to advise someone to rush out and
buy a house on very low mortgage rates today, to be honest I would be
guilty of mortgage
mis-selling.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000197" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000197">Going
back to 1997, when Labour came to power, English house prices were
three and a half times median annual earnings. Ten years later mortgage
lending had trebled but there had been no net increase at all in house
building, with the same number being built. The cost of housing index
had doubled to a ratio of 7.2 at the peak of the 2007 boom. On the
latest official figures, which are for April 2012, 18 months ago, it
had only slipped back to 6.7 times annual
earnings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000198">It
is very likely that, with house prices rising five times faster than
average earnings, that ratio is right back up past the 2007 peak. As a
very good map in the <I>Guardian</I> showed last Saturday, the ratio is
already above that peak in very many local authorities. These are
mainly, although not entirely, in the southern half of the country, all
the way from Somerset to Suffolk, 
<?notus-xml column=460?>in Devon and even one or two in Lancashire. It is not just in the centre
of London. For example, housing in Welwyn Hatfield, the constituency of
former housing Minister Grant Shapps, is now unaffordable. There houses
cost eight times local earnings, even higher than at the peak of the
boom.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000199">I have
also done some work on auction results and the housing auction market.
This is a real market where real volumes change hands. The numbers are
quite large, about 5,000 houses a quarter. In the last quarter, July to
September 2013, the average price of a house sold at auction across the
country rose by 10%. It rose by 14% in London, but still actually by
10% in other parts of the country. That statistic is more up to date
than the Government’s Land Registry figures, which are on
completions, and it goes further back. House prices are rising fast,
and I am afraid that that is
accelerating.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000200">My
noble friend Lord Stoneham asked for a long-term focus on housing. I do
not know if 40 years back is long enough, but I remember buying my
first home in 1972. That was in rather similar conditions to today,
during the Barber boom. There had been a great relaxation of credit,
and house prices had already gone up 40% or so over the previous year.
I had quite a struggle to buy a house priced at £8,500 with a
£7,500 mortgage. Two years later I had to come to London to be a
special adviser in the 1974 government, and mortgage rates had then
gone up to 14%. Having saved up on my own to be a first-time buyer, I
then had to be a second stepper with the bank of mum and dad behind me
to have any chance at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000201">We have
had many, many experiences in this country of wild fluctuations in
interest rates. Rates may be a little more stable today, but there is
clearly a great deal of concern about the way they are going. That is
being expressed by commentators from all sorts of backgrounds. I have
here the HSBC chief UK economist’s research from last week,
which argues that house price inflation will not help the UK rebalance

supply.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000202">To
return to what the noble Lord, Lord Borwick, was talking about
regarding resistance to development, I am not personally against a bit
of nimbyism, “not in my back yard”. After all, that is
local democracy and people are able to argue that. What we must fight
against is the attitude there often seems to be of BANANAism. I do not
know if your Lordships’ know about BANANAism, but it means
“build absolutely nothing anywhere near anyone”. I am
afraid that that is the attitude of some
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000203">For a
variety of reasons, we have had a serious shortage of housebuilding for
many, many years. Lately, as my noble friend Lord Stoneham has said, it
has been creeping up to 110,000 or 120,000 a year. It was down a couple
of years ago to the lowest level in peacetime, since 1923, so, though
it is picking up, supply is still far, far below what is needed even to
keep house prices stable, given the growth in population, given the
growth in household formation. The best estimates are that we need
something like 250,000 completions every year just to keep up with
increasing demand. To make any impact on the problem and 
<?notus-xml column=461?>keep house prices down or even make them a bit more affordable, we would
clearly need to be up at 300,000 a

very much hope and believe that the Liberal Democrat manifesto at the
next election will have a commitment to that. However, a commitment is
one thing—getting on with progress towards it now is quite
another. There has been quite a bit of talk about Help to Buy and
whether that—as I believe it is—is quite dangerous, given
the way it has come in, with a limit of 25 times national average
earnings, £600,000 a year. Like my noble friend Lord Stoneham, I
think it should be limited to areas where the housing market is not so
overheated as the south-east of England. It certainly does not need to
be at anything like that high a level when you consider that across a
lot of the country house prices, certainly for first-time buyers, are
much more like £100,000 or

problem. There are two reasons house prices did not fall as much as one
would have expected during the crash, and why they have gone up faster
than they otherwise would have done. One is, of course, quantitative
easing—£370 billion of credit pumped into the
economy—which was necessary to avoid the economic
patient’s dying of a heart attack at the time but has a lot of
serious after-effects. The other is the Funding for Lending scheme.
Just in passing, again, if you think this is wild left-wingery from me,
the chief executive of Legal &amp; General, no less, was describing
quantitative easing as a policy devised by the rich for the rich. There
is no doubt that it has helped push up prices of all sorts of assets,

Funding for Lending scheme of the Bank of England has significantly
failed to do what it is meant to do, which is to get cash to small
businesses. Instead, it has led to a flood of cheap credit in the
mortgage market, which is not its point. The Bank of England and the
Treasury, I believe, must refocus Funding for Lending on its proper
task, which is to rebuild desperately needed business job growth, not

afraid—Conservative Ministers, anyway—seem to be washing
their hands of the high-house-price crisis, because that is what it is,
in a way reminiscent of Pontius Pilate. We cannot pump up house prices

and rough-sleeping are increasing, and the number of families in
temporary accommodation is rising. People are struggling to get
mortgages to get on the housing ladder and there is a rapidly growing
private rented sector where too many lack security, have to pay ever
increasing rates and suffer poor quality accommodation. There are
nearly 5 million people on local authority waiting lists and this
housing shortage is central to the cost of living crisis. It now takes
the average family more than 20 years to save for a deposit,
and house prices are, I think, eight times the average wage. It is no
wonder that home ownership has fallen for the first time in a century,

ownership is to be a realistic aspiration for working people and rents

overnight, and on present policy certainly not by 2015. We have seen a
plethora of initiatives by this Government, but they have not delivered
anywhere near what is required. On home ownership we have seen First

there are real concerns about the latest Help to Buy scheme. If the

policy should be helping—first-time buyers—will find it
even harder to get on the housing ladder. How in touch are this
Government who introduce a scheme allowing taxpayer-backed mortgages
for homes worth up to £600,000 when the average house price in
the UK is £245,000 and the average price paid by a first-time
buyer if less than

coming to office, the Government cut the budget for new affordable
housing by 60% and put the strain on increased rent levels to fund such
provision. Even then its claim to deliver 170,000 new homes by 2015

will doubtless hear from the Minister about the reduction in the number
of affordable homes under the Labour Government; in fact, the figure
usually quoted is a reduction in the number of homes rented from local
authorities and housing associations over the period, and does not take
account of the wider stock of affordable housing. The reduction is a
direct consequence of the Right to Buy programme, touched upon by the
noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, which is a policy that this Government are
seeking to make more generous. In fact, under the previous Labour
Government, nearly 2 million more homes were built in England,
including half a million affordable homes, with 256,000 in the last
five years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000216">It
is not difficult to conclude in all of this that the patchwork of
current initiatives will simply not produce the step change in housing
provision which is required. We have a job as the Opposition to
criticise, challenge and support where necessary the Government of the

Miliband and Hilary Benn have asked Sir Michael Lyons, supported by a
panel of experts, to lead a new housing commission whose task will be
to set out a road map for how an incoming Government can help secure a
big change in the number of homes being built. Some of the policy
solutions to a step change must include tackling land banking and
speculation by looking at giving local authorities proper compulsory
purchase powers so that they can buy, assemble and grant planning
permission on land that is being hoarded and is holding back
development and giving councils the power to charge people escalating
fees for sitting on land with planning

must be planning to establish new towns and garden cities. The UK has
never delivered a large uplift in housebuilding without large-scale
development such as the post-war new towns. This will entail the
creation of new town development corporations as public/private bodies
with the power to raise finance, undertake building and provide
infrastructure. It would also necessitate financial incentives and
freedoms for local authorities within the scheme and a fast-track
planning process under the nationally significant infrastructure

know that at present some areas want to grow to meet local housing
demand but do not have land within their local authority boundary to do
so. Neighbouring authorities block the building of badly

prove effective. We want to establish a “right to grow”
status with bids from local authorities assessed by the planning
inspectorate. We also consider that there is scope to reform the
housing revenue account system and we are not unsympathetic to the
proposition to remove the cap. We want to give local authorities
greater flexibility so that they can build more social homes. A number
of local authorities are already beginning to build again within the
constraints they have but we want the commission to look at the
obstacles to overcome and the incentives needed to get councils and
housing associations back into the business of building again. Despite
various attempts to do that through Section 106, the community
infrastructure levy and the new homes bonus, we consider that there
remains a significant mismatch between the national and regional need
for further housebuilding and the incentives which local communities
have to accept new developments, especially developments such

My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord
Stoneham, for introducing this debate. As the noble Lord, Lord
McKenzie, has just said, far from putting me on the spot, this is my
third housing debate in the past two weeks. However, I am far from
expert in this area and I recognise and acknowledge the great expertise
of noble Lords who have spoken today. I also welcome my noble friend
Lord Borwick. I have not had the pleasure of participating in a debate
with him until
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000222">Before
getting to the substance and specifics of the points raised by noble
Lords, of which there are quite a lot, I shall start by speaking in
general terms and move on in due course. The most important point to
make at the outset is that the Government are committed to delivering
long-term economic stability and economic growth. Our purpose and
objective in that area have not changed. Whereas the previous
Administration oversaw a housing boom and bust, we have done extensive
work since coming into office to pick up the pieces. We have introduced
a series of initiatives to boost housing supply, increase the provision
of affordable housing and support a healthy private rented sector, and
by tackling the deficit we are helping to keep down both interest rates
and the number of repossessions. However, we are only at the start of a
return to recovery. The housing market has turned a corner, but
mortgage lending and loan-to-value ratios on new mortgage lending
remain below their historic averages, while, relative to earnings,
median house prices across England are at around the same level as they
were in
2005<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:40:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=465?><hs_para UID="13102455000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000223">I
was pleased to hear the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, acknowledge in his
contribution that his Government did not build enough homes when they
were in power. The housing supply today is at its highest since the end
of the housing boom in 2008, with 334,000 new homes built in the past
three years. It is worth noting that the Chartered Institute of
Purchasing and Supply has said that activity in housing construction
has been increasing at its fastest pace for almost a decade, and as my
noble friend Lord Stoneham has already acknowledged, starts are up by a
third on last year. Indeed, the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors
reported this week that housebuilding was picking up across the
country, which is an important point since it indicates that recovery
is not confined to one particular
area<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:41:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

making progress because of the policies that we have introduced and the
investment that we have been able to make, and that that investment has
been able to attract private sector investment as well. In the current
spending round, we have invested £11 billion in housing, which
has leveraged a further £15 billion from the private sector in
affordable housing. In the next spending round, government and private
sector investment will be in excess of £23 billion in new
affordable homes, which will be supported by government guarantees of
£12 billion to support
homebuyers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000225">In
response to many of the points that have been raised in the debate, if
housebuilders are to build, they need to know that people will buy.
Since the launch of the Help to Buy equity loan scheme in April this
year, more than 15,000 reservations have been made for new-build homes.
In total, we have helped nearly 30,000 people to buy or reserve a
new-build property through a range of government-backed home ownership
schemes, including the most recent initiative that was launched earlier
this month—the Help to Buy mortgage scheme. This is aimed at
people who, unlike the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, do not have a bank
of mum and dad to rely on but still have every right to aspire to get
on to the housing
ladder<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T15:42:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Oakeshott, and others asked whether some of these initiatives were
having the effect of creating a housing bubble. In the course of his
contribution, the noble Lord referred to different economists and other
experts. He will not be surprised to learn that I am about to quote
from others who offer a different view. There are plenty of people who
very much endorse what the Government are doing in this area. For
instance, Huw van Steenis and Charles Goodhart from Morgan Stanley said
recently that Help to Buy could help to stimulate far more
housebuilding than many believe, while Ernst &amp; Young stated earlier
this
month:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13102455000317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000317">“The
Government’s well-timed initiatives to revive mortgage lending
have borne fruit, with prices and transactions recovering from their
recent very low levels, in turn supporting the wider economy. The
housing revival has given rise to concerns that the government’s
interventions—including bringing forward the Mortgage Guarantee
Scheme—risk stoking up a housing bubble, especially in London.
In our view these worries are overdone”.</hs_quote>

some of the national figures that have already been covered in noble
Lords’ contributions, but many areas outside London are seeing
much lower average prices today than before the housing boom in 2008.
For instance, in my home town of Nottingham, 
<?notus-xml column=466?>in August 2007 average house prices were £103,000; they are now
£86,000, which is 17% lower. In the Isle of Wight, which I know
the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, is familiar with, the average price is
16% lower than previously. Certainly, transactions around the UK as a
whole are way below what they were before the
crash.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13102455000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000227">While
I am on Help to Buy, I will respond to the point made by the noble
Lord, Lord Stoneham, about reverting to a regionally focused Help to
Buy scheme if house prices get out of hand in London and the
south-east. It is far too early for me to give any response to that but
I emphasise that, as the noble Lord knows, we have a proper regime with
the Bank of England to monitor these schemes and ensure that they do
not have a perverse
outcome.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000228" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000228">I
think we all agree that owning your own house is an important part of
our culture. It is a symbol of security and success, which people
understandably aspire to. But increasingly, some people are opting for
different choices. There is evidence that renting as a long-term option
is something that people want, so we have also been improving the
private rented sector so that it offers a real, positive alternative.
As has already been mentioned, we are kick-starting the building of
more private rented homes through our £10 billion housing
guarantee programme and the £1 billion Build to Rent Fund, which
means that blocks of flats or new estates will be built with the sole
purpose of being for rent. Under the Build to Rent Fund, 44 projects
have been shortlisted and the first scheme has been agreed at
Southampton Quay. The noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, asked about targets
for this scheme. It is important to emphasise that this is a demand-led
scheme, not one that we would start off with a target for. We want to
see how demand for it develops.</hs_para>

rented sector back to affordable housing, the noble Lord, Lord
Stoneham, was right to emphasise the importance of supplying social
housing alongside new private sector homes. We are building more
affordable housing. As the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, predicted, I will
remind your Lordships that the previous Administration saw a reduction
in the stock of social rented homes of 420,000. I am glad not to have
disappointed him. He questioned whether our Right to Buy scheme, which
supports those in social housing who want to go on to purchase housing,
is the right measure. I think that it is, because of the reasons I have
just given about the importance to people of owning a home.</hs_para>

continue to build new houses. In this spending review period alone,
with £19.5 billion of public and private funding, our affordable
homes programme is on track to deliver 170,000 new affordable homes
between 2011 and 2015. The noble Lord, Lord Stoneham, asked for an
update: half way through, 84,000 households have already moved into new
affordable homes. In the next spending period, we are looking to build
a further 165,000 such homes. So there is real effort and impetus in
that area. We are also making a great effort to release public sector
land so that it is available for new build.</hs_para>

questions about garden cities. Our approach is about supporting local
areas to develop large-scale schemes while making sure that they are

the Natural Capital Committee is clearly a bit like a bus. There has
been no mention of it in either House for ages, and then suddenly this
week two debates come along at once. I am delighted about that. We are
privileged in this House to have the Defra Minister responsible for it,
my noble friend Lord De Mauley, to respond to us.</hs_para>

Capital Committee deals with many Defra matters, it was commissioned by
the Treasury and reports to the Economic Affairs Committee of the
Cabinet, which is chaired by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The
NCC’s job is to advise the Government on the state of English
natural capital. The establishment of the NCC is one of the rather
quiet but very significant things that the coalition has done. It is
part of a package. In 2011, the Government also introduced the natural
environment White Paper <I>The Natural Choice</I> and the UK national
ecosystem assessment which shockingly found that one-third of the
UK’s ecosystem services was declining severely. If the
UK’s ecosystems were protected and enhanced, they could add at
least an extra £30 billion annually to the UK economy. By
contrast, neglect and loss of ecosystem services can cost us as much as
£20 billion a
year.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000236">The
Government made these moves as part of a plan. Previously, successive
Governments and the public have really thought about natural capital
only in response 
<?notus-xml column=468?>to a crisis, some sort of wake-up call, whether floods, droughts or food
prices. The coalition Government were certainly reminded early on of
just how much the public value natural capital when they announced
their plan to sell off UK forests. The coalition Government learnt that
the public value natural capital, even if they do not consider all
parts of it.</hs_para>

this debate as a result of a conference on soils. Soils are perhaps the
most vivid illustration of our natural capital. The development of soil
takes between 500 years and perhaps 10,000 years. Even a centimetre of
topsoil takes at least 200 years to develop. Soil is the basis of our
food production, but it is much more than that. It is important for
carbon storage, water absorption and water filtering, and is crucial as
the first layer in the food chain. How have we treated this virtually
irreplaceable resource? We have allowed it to be eroded, polluted,
washed away and built over. People may own the land, but the timescale
that soil takes to form puts it into the category of a real commons for
the nation—or natural capital.</hs_para>

part of our natural capital that has been the subject of debate in our
Chamber recently: bees. Pollinators are—to mix my
metaphor—perhaps the canary in the coal mine. We do not know why
bee colonies have collapsed; there seem to be several possible
contributory factors. Only recently have people begun to appreciate
that, beyond the luxury of honey, the pollinator services of bees and
their many pollinating relatives are critical to food production. The
collapse of bee populations is mirrored by those of frogs and other
amphibians Could it be that the use of substances such as
neonicotinoids is having a much wider effect, or is it the cocktail of
pesticides that needs further examination? It has always seemed bizarre
to me that a product is tested alone when in reality a cocktail is
being used out there.</hs_para>

brings me to the first question for my noble friend. The NCC rightly
sees developing a research agenda on natural capital as a priority. The
research agenda on the constituents of natural capital is badly in need
of some major help and overhaul. I have seen plenty of evidence which
suggests that attempts to ensure the future health of our natural
capital might be undermined unless research priorities are better
aligned to overall needs and move away from the quick buck producing
areas. The determinants of innovation and factors that influence
research choices, such as science policies, public-private partnerships
and the career paths available, all combine to favour technological
regimes that tend to suit very focused, reductionist approaches rather
than the holistic ecological approach that is needed to address
ecosystems and the sort of complex interactions that we get between,
for example, soil and water. Can my noble friend confirm that the
Government will ensure a move to a more appropriate balance of
research?</hs_para>

minerals, stone, gravel and energy sources, whether oil or gas. They
are all part of the natural capital that is fundamental to our manmade
economy and society. We could not have a manmade economy if it was not
underpinned by all those elements. 
<?notus-xml column=469?>Our failure to adequately protect our natural

severely over

the problems is that efforts to protect our natural capital have too
often been made on the basis of the intrinsic or aesthetic value of,
say, woodlands, uplands, clean streams or bird populations. I accept
that we may succeed in better protection if we explicitly demonstrate
the value that society places on our natural assets, thereby protecting
and maybe even enhancing them for future generations. The Natural
Capital Committee is part of that effort. The first annual report of
the NCC earlier this year contained a number of important
recommendations, and I wonder if my noble friend would be able to
comment on one of them. The NCC stated that,</hs_para>

my noble friend could tell us how that work is going, I would be
grateful. Will he also encourage the NCC to consider who should be the
innovators of these approaches? Clearly, there will need to be some
pilot areas; the national parks are one obvious example, but what about
the Crown Estate? It is also responsible to the Treasury, and there it
is with swathes of our natural capital under its management. Surely it

have a few comments to make on the NCC itself. It held a useful open
event at the Royal Society and its first annual report is quite
readable. However, the minutes of the NCC are dry to the point of
desiccation. This is important because it needs to be outward facing if
it is to succeed in integrating the thinking that is being developed
into the mainstream and make it the discussion of the day in
boardrooms. It will also need to develop some work with institutions
such as Cranfield because it is disappointing to read that the

conclusion, I must say that there are plenty of cynics out there who
think that the NCC is just a way to suggest that the Government are
after some green credentials. Whether that is the case or not will be
proven in whether policies start to shift in decision-making across all
departments, and by the Treasury itself in the way it allocates
resources. We need some startling, if welcome, decisions and some much
more radical
policies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000246">The
next debate, which my noble friend is also going to answer, is on the
Thames Tideway Tunnel. That is a good example of what I am talking
about. Faced with the same sort of problem as London, the city of
Philadelphia chose a radically different solution, avoided many costs,
enhanced its environment amazingly 
<?notus-xml column=470?>and brought solutions down to a neighbourhood scale. The NCC is perhaps
looking at such worldwide examples of practice that could help its
deliberations, and I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, may go
into the Philadelphia example. The NCC is subject to review in 2014,
and I certainly hope there will be no question but that it should
continue. We really need its

the help of scientists as a measure of natural capital, which is not an

There was an extensive development programme there, involving some of

planting of native trees, shrubs and hedges, using the old hedge lines
and retaining the old hedges and ancient oaks. There are green
corridors throughout this development which are so important for the

Grantchester (Lab):</Member></B> I thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Miller of Chilthorne Domer, for tabling this debate this afternoon. It
gives the Committee the opportunity to debate the first report of the
Natural Capital Committee, issued in April this year, following its
establishment in May 2012. There has always been a debate around the
relative merits of the environment when set against economic
development and around how to translate this into public policy
priorities. The debate initially focused on sustainability, with the
thought that competing claims had to be balanced between two
polarities. When English Nature was set up some 10 years ago,
sustainability was likened to a stool with three legs: the first leg
being the economy, the second the environment and the third, in equal
balance, being communities or society. At that time, debates contested
whether it was possible to balance these competing aims and whether
economic benefit would take precedence or the environment should be
given an overriding
veto.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000257">The
difficulties in settling this debate can be readily appreciated when
there is no clear and independent assessment of value. When the
environment, or elements in it, can be described, in the classical
sense, as a free good, how can it be assigned a value? Meanwhile, the
degradation of our environment here in the UK and internationally could
not be denied. The effects of waste and pollution in one country are
often visited on its neighbours. Nature and the environment cannot
simply be seen as isolated elements or units in a biodiversity action
plan, such as one to increase songbirds. Instead, the natural
environment needs to be assessed and valued as an ecosystem. No longer
can this be seen as an either/or debate; instead it must now be
recognised that nature and the environment represent a complicated,
interrelated system. A properly functioning natural environment is the
foundation of sustained economic growth and prospering communities. It
bears repeating that we need to create a green economy, where economic
growth and the integrity of natural resources sustain each other and
the consequences of actions and decisions better reflect the importance
of the environment.</hs_para>

some may find it reprehensible to try to assign value to natural
capital, nevertheless the widening recognition of other assets, such as
intellectual property and brand values, perhaps points to natural
capital accounting as the best way forward, especially across
continents, cultures and national governance divergences. In advising
the Government on the state of natural capital in England, the Natural
Capital Committee set out to do three main things: first, provide
advice on when, where and how natural assets may be being used
unsustainably; secondly, advise the Government on how they should
prioritise action to protect and improve natural capital and the
environment through its methodology; and, thirdly, advise on research
priorities to improve future advice and decisions on enhancing natural
resources and natural
capital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000259" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000259">In
reporting directly to the Cabinet’s Economic Affairs Committee,
it must work across government and have an interdepartmental profile.
It will not be lost on many that this is where it is most
needed—under the nose of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The
committee could be seen to have already had an effect on resource
allocation and decision-making through its advice on accounting for
forest assets in response to the recommendations of the Independent
Panel on Forestry, which was set up following the disastrous disregard
for woodland assets in the early days of the

Woodland Trust urged the Government to adopt the committee’s
recommendations, stating that the extent to which the NCC informs
policy will be a key test of the natural environment White Paper and
its ability to achieve a paradigm shift in how nature is valued. With
the disastrous lack of border controls and risk analysis of tree
diseases in the UK, better protection of our natural assets means, to
the Woodland Trust, stronger and better enforced planning protection
and robust action on tree diseases. The UK’s woodlands are
vulnerable to the effect of historical fragmentation and a continual

reference to trends in UK fisheries but made no reference in its
recommendations to the marine environment. This is perhaps a glaring
omission that the committee should correct as soon as possible. In the
four years since the Marine and Coastal Access Act 2009 was passed, the
designation of the first tranche of up to 31 marine conservation zones
is still awaited. These sites represent less than a quarter of the
sites proposed to achieve an ecologically coherent network, known as an
ECN in the jargon. The designation of a network of marine conservation
zones is vital to stemming the degradation of the marine environment.
Does the noble Lord agree that this is perhaps one of the most pressing
issues that his department should be tackling? Will he put the marine
environment at the heart of the debate on the EU fisheries policy? Will
he ask the Natural Capital Committee to undertake some work on this for

this as a useful tool to inform practical applications in policy and

agriculture exists in a food chain, and that the actions of all in that

simply, offsetting means that if a developer is going to build
something that will damage or destroy a habitat of conservation value,
it must buy a biocredit to compensate for that loss elsewhere. I find
this incredibly dangerous because it sends the mixed message that it is
somehow all right to denigrate our natural assets in exchange for
making a payment to a good cause. It is the equivalent of having an

said, the committee’s first report is very provocative. The
state of natural capital in the UK is at a critical point. Recognition
of the committee’s work from the Government who set it up must
amount to more than lip service. With the debates over decarbonisation

De Mauley:</Member></B> My Lords, natural capital therefore underpins
two of the Government’s key priorities: encouraging economic
growth and enhancing the natural

sensible use of our natural assets is an essential precondition of our
prosperity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000274" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000274">In
its first report, <I>The S</I><I>tate of Natural Capital</I>, published
in April this year, the Natural Capital Committee made just this
compelling argument: that long-term economic growth will be undermined

long-term prosperity is possible only if we preserve the foundations on
which our economy and well-being are based.</hs_para>

that we measure, value and protect our stocks of natural capital.
Indeed, this is why the Government set up the independent Natural
Capital Committee in 2012, the first of its kind in the world. The
committee has been asked to provide expert, independent advice to
government on the state of England’s natural capital assets. In
the past, the benefits that flow from our natural capital have too
often been taken for granted, and as a result our assets have become
eroded.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102455000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0001.htm#13102455000276">The

referred to work that the NCC is undertaking. For example, one of the
key recommendations was to develop metrics to value and measure changes

about the common agricultural policy and the extent to which we are
moving in what one might describe as away from subsiding production

move away from subsidies in the long run. We support a greener cap with
the emphasis on Pillar 2, recognising that there is scope for using
taxpayers’ money to pay farmers for public goods that the market
otherwise would not reward, such as protecting the natural environment
and supporting biodiversity. We negotiated hard to secure a final
outcome that was a significant improvement on the Commission’s
original proposals, but it is very disappointing that we did not get as
far as we would have liked. Securing the flexibility to transfer up to
15% from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2 was a good outcome of this set of
negotiations. The Government have always made the case that
transferring funding from Pillar 1, which is subsidy, to Pillar 2,
which is in favour of the environment and the rural economy, represents
the best use of taxpayers’ money while supporting farmers to
deliver the valuable goods and services that the market left alone
would not provide.</hs_para>

Berkeley (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am pleased to have the
opportunity to debate this important project. It is not the most
popular time in the House of Lords weekly calendar, but it is still
good to have the opportunity. We have had a number of Questions in
short debates over the months and years, but I think it is timely to
put some markers down because the Tideway tunnel is at the IPPC for
determination. There is a new report from the Environment Agency on
SUDS—it is interesting, the delay in publishing; I know it has
been around for several months. Perhaps this debate has
hastened its publication. There is a call by Thamesbank, the
Environmental Law Foundation, supported by Sir Ian Byatt, the former
director general of Ofwat, and many others for a review of the national
policy statement for waste water. It seems a good time to have a
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:00:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102455000299" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102455000299">I
think the project of the Thames tunnel has become a kind of
rollercoaster with its own momentum, but it is based on some seriously
flawed and out-of-date data and the failure to properly consult or to
consider alternatives which could put £70 to £80 a year
on Thames Water’s customers’ bills for perhaps 100 years.
It could also possibly incur a large amount of taxpayers’ money
because Thames Water’s finances are in a pretty unhealthy state.
Before the Government commit to such an expensive project, I believe it
is essential that an independent and wide-ranging assessment be made of
the alternatives using the latest data—and I mean the latest
data. It should take into account the contribution that can be made by
better sewer maintenance, the combinations of engineering solutions
that can achieve the desired environmental objectives without involving
excessive costs, the financial options available to pay for these
solutions, the interaction between the choice 
<?notus-xml column=479?>of scheme and the method of financing, and of course
the insertion of conditions that would prevent the recurrence of the
payment of excessive dividends by Thames

are the issues? The first issue is that the data on which all these
studies have been based are out of date, and I would suggest they are
inaccurate. The baseline goes back to the Thames Tideway Strategic
Study group, which worked between 2000 and 2005, when the chair was
Professor Chris Binnie. On the basis of this information the Government
in 2007 announced that they were going to promote this project and the
national policy statement was based on the Thames Water 2010 needs

serious errors in these reports. It is extraordinary that the Thames
Tideway Tunnel website says there are going to be 39 million tonnes of
untreated sewage flushed into the Thames in a typical year. Professor
Binnie, in his latest report—which I think the Minister now
has—points out that, after the various upgrades already in hand,
and when the lead tunnel is complete, this will fall to 17 million

sewage works has been upgraded. It originally had about 110 CSO spills
a year. It now has about nine. That is quite surprising because the
European Commission has suggested a maximum of 20 spills a year as
acceptable, so Mogden passes the test. Binnie also states that Thames
Water assumes that sewer flows will increase by about 13% up to 2021.
This of course depends on the water delivered to customers which then
go to sewage flows, and there is the issue of leakage in the sewer
systems. The <I>Thames Water Resources Management Plan</I> says that,
despite the population rising in 2021, the water
delivered—hence, the discharge to the sewers—will go
down, as will the leakage and, presumably, the sewer infiltration. This
is another 23%
reduction.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_24_PT_1/46B6D0966571DB001A9EB6E64190DB540DA15DF9" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 24 October 2013">Thursday,

my view … the sewer system model should be looked at again to
see what would be needed to meet the EC criterion, particularly with

problem is that Thames Water seems to be in denial about the volume of
leakage and the effect of meter installation. It is also failing to
maintain the sewers properly to maintain the necessary storage
capacity. I recently met Dr Jean Venables, former president of the
Institute of Civil Engineers, who commented about the Kingston
“fatberg”—noble Lords might like to know was made
of wrongly flushed festering food fat mixed with wet wipes—which
reduced the capacity of the sewer to 5%. Is Kingston special or is this
a common occurrence? We do not know but perhaps we
should.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102464000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000003">I am
convinced that Thames Water and the Government have failed to look at
alternatives. The only study of alternatives relied upon was the
<I>S</I><I>u</I><I>DS Evaluation for Example Areas</I> by Professor
Richard Ashley, which is included in the planning application but is
not for comment. Professor Ashley recently 
<?notus-xml column=480?>stated very clearly that the terms of reference were
too narrow and the time and resources dedicated to it were inadequate.
I could go through the terms of reference but I think that in the time
available I should not. He said they were really too narrow and the
results could not be relied
upon.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102464000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000004">Now we
have this Environment Agency report, published just yesterday. It needs
careful study, but it appears to repeat many of the errors that have
made since 2005. Most importantly, it presents SuDS as the only
solution. I do not think anybody has really said that SuDS is the only
solution; it is a contribution to the solution but there are other
things, some of which I have mentioned and some of which Professor
Binnie has mentioned, which could also be used. The report does not
really help in either way. Before embarking on a £4 billion-plus
project, there should be an obligation on government to provide
up-to-date and independently verified data, along with an objective
comparison with alternatives. We do not have that at the
moment.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102464000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000005">So
what is to be done? I have outlined the strongly expressed views of a
number of experts who believe that the problem is much smaller than was
originally believed. It is possible to start SuDS in a way that would
work in this country. It is a pity that the Environment Agency did not
talk to the people in the US—maybe it did but it is not in the
report—about the successes in Philadelphia: technical,
engineering, and of course the legal and property issues as well. I
have talked to the Americans and I think it could be done in this
country. Thames Water could lead, fund and organise it, overseen by
Ofwat, using separate arrangements for domestic properties, commercial
properties and local authorities, with incentives built in through
their sewerage charges. I suspect that Thames Water would be highly
unenthusiastic about this but it is a regulated industry.</hs_para>

Thames Water the company, and what Ofwat is doing to ensure that the
company is fit for purpose. We have discussed its financial situation
in this House several times before, but it is odd that there is a
problem over who will actually do the work, who will fund it and what
the risks are. Martin Blaiklock, an independent consultant who has
worked on this, believes that the Government and Ofwat will face an
uphill task in financing such an expensive and long drawn-out project
with a very high construction/completion risk. Of course, there is also
the revenue risk and one has to ask: who is the customer? How much will
the tunnel be used? Where is the revenue stream? Should there be a
separate tunnel company? If so, what should be its relationship with
Thames Water? What happens if the customers do not
pay?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102464000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000007">I think
there is a question of whether such claimants, if they did or did not
happen, would be seen as a contingent liability for Thames Water? That
could have an indirect negative impact on its financial strength and
threaten its investment grade status. Mr Blaiklock even suggests that
because the tunnel option is a Thames Water concept derived out of its
licence, many will say that the liabilities for this, as an independent
company, should reside with Thames anyway. Any proposed structure as
set out above may have echoes of Enron economics, which I am sure we do
not want to see.</hs_para>

it is not surprising that the Government, Thames Water, Ofwat and the
others are taking so long to decide how this should be done. Martin
Blaiklock concludes that given the alternatives to the tunnel option,
which are gaining reality daily, for example SuDS variants, a prudent
Government should forget the tunnel and choose the course of lowest
financial risk and cost to Thames' customers and the
taxpayer. I cannot but agree with him. It really is time for a
wide-ranging study of the alternatives.</hs_para>

know a little about the water industry because I was elected to Reading
Borough Council and served there for 18 years. One of the first
committees I served on was the water committee. In those days the water

reasonable success of it. I was later the chairman of the land and
works committee of the Thames Valley water board. We produced a very
efficient and cheap water service for the people of the Thames Valley
area in south Oxfordshire. My boast was always that we provided water
at sixpence a tonne. It is of course a lot more now but prices have
gone up. Therefore I have a little knowledge of the water

about London, we had a quarrel with the Metropolitan Water Board.
London is an important place and we understand that, but what they
wanted to do, and what they did do through a parliamentary Bill, was to
extract water from the Thames Valley area—our water, as we put
it. It came along and stole it and put it into the Thames for the
benefit of the people of London. It was not to the benefit of rivers in
the Thames Valley area because a lot of them dried up. We have to

there are many aspects to this proposal. It involves people who live
outside London having to pay for a project from which they will receive
no benefit. All the benefits will go to London. They will be forced to
pay the same increase in bills as Londoners, who will be the sole
beneficiaries. The population of London is set to increase to more than
9 million over the next few years, so Thames Water will be receiving
extra profitable revenue from all those people, part of which I believe
should be used to finance this scheme. Also, when the shareholders
bought the company, they knew that there was a 
<?notus-xml column=482?>problem of disposal in London. They knew exactly
what the commitment might be and that it would be very expensive, yet
they still bought the shares. Having acquired those shares, they should
take responsibility for the proposals which, by buying the shares, they
actually agreed to. I have said this before and I will repeat it now:
this project should be largely paid for by the suspension of dividends
for the shareholders. After all, a precedent has been set for this.
Lloyds Bank shareholders, for example, have not received a dividend for
three or four years because of the intervention by the Government in
the bank’s management. I believe that the shareholders should

Berkeley, has outlined some of the much cheaper and more effective
alternatives. I believe that they should be examined more thoroughly
than has been the case so far. He has also referred to the
Government’s intervention into this privatised industry. It may
be proposed that there is to be a government subsidy, but that would be
intolerable. This is a privatised industry, and the Government have no
business paying a subsidy. I have to tell the Committee that I
disagreed profoundly with the privatisation of water, and I blame both
parties for it. When the Labour Party had the opportunity to
renationalise it and give it back to the local authorities where it
properly belongs, it did not do so. It would therefore be outrageous
if, having sold the water industry off in order to get rid of any debt
and responsibility, they should now expect the public to subsidise a
project which the shareholders knew about when they bought the
shareholdings. I am completely at one with the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, and I hope sincerely that the Government will not subsidise
this project. It is not their business to do so. They should ensure
that the cheaper alternatives are put in place and that if they are not
put in place, the shareholders of Thames Water should pay the
whole bill.</hs_para>

are in familiar waters. To reiterate: London’s sewers carry both
raw sewage and rain run-off. They were designed for a capacity of 4
million inhabitants, but London now has in excess of 8 million
inhabitants. As much of London’s infrastructure dates back to
horse-and-carriage days and therefore rainwater is included, there are
50 or 60 overflows each year straight into the Thames. In a typical
year, 18 million tonnes of untreated sewage enter the river through the

Evidence </I><I>o</I><I>n Sustainable Drainage Systems and the Thames
Tideway Standards</I>, published this month, which concludes that
sustainable urban drainage systems—or SUDS—alone would
not be enough to combat the sewage issues facing the Thames and meet
the environmental standards for the Thames established by the <I>Thames
Tideway Strategic Study</I> in 2006. In 2012, Sheffield University
published a further independent study examining the potential to
retrofit SUDS on the tideway catchment areas. It concluded that
retrofitting SUDS, while technically possible, is not feasible due to
the very high costs and disruption that would be likely to be involved.
Retrofitting could well complement conventional sewage infrastructure
and be instrumental over time in separating rainwater from sewage as
development projects slowly rebuild and modernise buildings and areas
throughout the capital. SUDS will also play a key role in ensuring that

tideway environmental objectives for the river within a reasonable
timescale. Accordingly, the then Government asked Thames Water to
proceed with developing detailed proposals for a tunnel. Since then,
Thames Water has refined its proposals and consulted extensively on
them.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102464000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000028">Defra

dwell for a moment on what some major US cities are doing, because the

similar dimensions to

storage and transplant tunnels are also a key feature of solutions put
in place to tackle combined sewer overflows in Milwaukee and Wisconsin.
Pittsburgh is attempting to achieve a similar standard through the
25-year implementation of sustainable drainage systems. In Portland,
Oregon, SUDS have been used to remove approximately 8 million cubic
metres of storm water a year. This is 35% of its total sewer overflow
volume, but tunnels still prove necessary to meet the required levels
of control. Philadelphia aims to tackle 85% of its sewer overflow
discharges using SUDS over a 25-year period. The work has been going

seen compelling recent evidence of the scale of the problem with
wastewater discharges into the Thames, and I am advised that the
serious rainfall event last weekend resulted in more than 1 million
tonnes of wastewater being discharged into the river over a very short
period of time. A tunnel would have captured these discharges, and
transferred them for treatment in time to handle any subsequent heavy

further important factor is the 2012 European Court of Justice ruling
that the UK was in breach of the urban waste water treatment directive
in London, which means that there is an increased likelihood of very
significant infraction fines if we do not comply within a reasonable
period of time. The risk of fines has been reinforced by the very

noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, asked what the tunnel solution will deliver.
The Thames tideway tunnel would reduce the frequency of spills from the
34 combined sewer overflows in London intended to be caught
by the proposed tunnel from around 50 to 60 to just three or four times
a year during extreme rainfall events, with the estimated overflow
volume falling from around 
<?notus-xml column=487?>18 million to 2.5 million tonnes. That would improve water quality, with
benefits for wildlife and river users. It will also ensure that we
continue to meet the UK’s obligations under the urban waste
water treatment directive and the water framework
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:35:49"></hs_TimeCode>. We
are clear that the overflow volume to be addressed by the tunnel is 18
million tonnes, not the 39 million stated by the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, as quoted by
Thames<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:36:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102464000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000038">The
noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, also asked about the financing of the
project. The Government believe that the private sector can and should
finance this project. Although the Government can provide financial
assistance in any form in relation to the tunnel, we have stated that
this will be contingent financial support for exceptional project
risks, to help ensure the cost of financing the project is kept to a
minimum and offers best value for money for customers and taxpayers.
However, we will want to be assured, when offering this contingent
support, that the taxpayer is appropriately protected by measures that
minimise the likelihood of these exceptional risks

noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, asked about customers outside London paying
for the tunnel. It is worth saying that London customers have helped to
finance major sewerage investments outside the capital that serve a
much smaller population. When improvements are needed, for example, in
rural Oxfordshire, the cost is spread among all customers of sewerage
services, including those living in London. This approach, which is
supported by Ofwat, is standard across England and Wales and is the
fairest way of apportioning the costs of investment in water and
sewerage
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-24T17:37:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102464000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131024-gc0002.htm#13102464000040">The
noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, suggested that Thames Water should pay for
the tunnel from existing funds. Paying for the project from any
accumulated reserves would neither reduce the cost to customers nor
remove the requirement for some type of government support. This is a
major tunnelling project and has a risk profile significantly beyond
that typically expected of a water and sewerage company. That is why
the tunnel is expected to be financed and delivered by an independent
infrastructure provider with its own licence from Ofwat and backed by
some form of government support related to exceptional project

July 2013, following consultation, the Secretary of State for Transport
issued Safeguarding Directions to local planning authorities (LPAs)
along most of the route of Phase One of HS2, between London
and the West Midlands. Safeguarding Directions protect the
route of HS2 from conflicting development. At that time we were
consulting separately on fourteen design refinements on the Phase One
route. In particular, the Secretary of State proposed that there should
be bored tunnels rather than a surface route at both Northolt and
Bromford. As the nature of safeguarding in these areas would be very
different depending on the option chosen it was decided to delay
safeguarding these areas until the Secretary of State had reached the
final decisions on the tunnel proposals following

Department has an ongoing dialogue with industry to discuss proposals
to replace or modify the tankers according to a schedule that ensures
security of fuel supply while maintaining safety. Around 230 of the
tankers are in operation in Great Britain and account for around 12% of
the fleet of vehicles delivering road fuel. Some of these tankers have
been on the road for over seven years and collectively they have
travelled millions of miles without a serious incident. We are not
complacent about the risks and it is important that this remedial work
is carried out as soon as is practical. This would involve tankers over
six years old being taken out of service first, with modifications on
newer models to allow a staged withdrawal of these vehicles over
subsequent months. Some haulage firms have already placed, in total,
orders for about 100 new
tankers.</hs_para></Body></Fragment></System><System type="Writtens" ColStart="181"><?date 2013-10-24?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_24_PT_1/B207C2649F6EF091D9124DAA5AD8951DDAFB2518" __version__="1.2"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="24 October 2013">Thursday

commitment made by EU Foreign Ministers in December 2012 to make a
distinction in relevant EU programmes and agreements between the State
of Israel and Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories, to
ensure that no EU funding goes to Israeli settlements. They
were not intended to prevent the continuation and development of
economic and scientific 
<?notus-xml column=189?>co-operation between the EU and Israel. Discussions are currently taking
place between EU and Israeli officials to find a way forward which
implements the guidelines whilst enabling Israeli participation in

Gardiner of Kimble (Con):</Member> The Government directed Ofcom in
December 2010 to revise the fees paid for licences to use spectrum in
the 900MHz and 1800MHz bands following the auction of licences to use
the 800MHz and 2.6GHz bands so as to reflect full market value. The
Statutory Instrument making this direction was accompanied by an impact
assessment which is available at
http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/3024/impacts . That auction was
held earlier this year with the licences granted on 1 March. On 10
October 2013 Ofcom published its proposals for revising these spectrum
licence fees and invited responses by 19 December. In coming to its
final decision on the revised fees to be paid, Ofcom will take full
account of all the responses it receives to this consultation. In this,
as in all its activities in relation to communications, it is the
principal duty of Ofcom to further the interests of citizens and of
