number of people. They are not right for everybody, but for those for
whom they work, such schemes are important when put in place. Latest
statistics show that last year, 2012-13, 7,100 households had
homelessness prevented or relieved thanks to the installation of a
sanctuary scheme—a 17% rise on the previous year. On the spare
room subsidy, the Government are providing baseline funding of
£20 million annually to the discretionary housing payment
scheme, which is available to local authorities to help people in such
circumstances. The Government have also provided an additional
£25 million per annum on top of the baseline funding until the
end of the spending review

respond to such incidents. I am pleased that the Government have
introduced a number of pilot schemes and are considering various ways
that victims of domestic violence can be further protected. Domestic

had informal discussions about the use of body-worn cameras at the
college of policing last week. I am pleased to say that a number of
forces have piloted the use of such cameras. The college will look at
best practice so it can ensure they are used as effectively as
possible. They will not only reduce the bureaucracy that the police are
involved with, but provide greater and enhanced ability to deal with
crimes and provide the evidence in criminal circumstances. They will
also benefit officers when accusations are made about their
behaviour—often, the body-worn camera will show when such
accusations are not
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T14:43:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310285000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000047"><Member ContinuationText="Jack Dromey" PimsId="5693" UID="1310285000341" xid="1005" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000341"><B>Jack
Dromey</B> (Birmingham, Erdington) (Lab):</Member> Crime has fallen
overall thanks to the development of neighbourhood policing under a
Labour Government. With the thin blue line stretched ever thinner,
there are disturbing signs of a generation of progress in some areas
being reversed. Since the general election, shoplifting is up in 23
police areas and mugging is up in 15 police areas. There has been a
staggering 44% increase in mugging in London. Does the Home Secretary
therefore share the concerns of Her Majesty’s inspectorate of
constabulary that that which has proved to be so successful and is so
valued by communities throughout our country—neighbourhood
policing—“risks being

the best approach for him to take. I am very sorry that he has failed
to recognise the work being done by police officers and staff around
the country to ensure that overall levels of crime have fallen since
2010. I would hope he welcomes the work they are doing. HMIC has made
it clear that forces, in taking the budget cuts, have focused on
ensuring front-line resilience. That is a very good example of how it

to ban analogous drugs—the family of drugs—as a
consequence. Some of the banned drugs have often not yet been created,
but if and when they are created, they are already covered. We are

Helplines indeed play an important role in supporting the victims of
domestic and sexual violence. That is why the Home Office provides
£900,000 to five national helplines each year. We take every
opportunity to publicise these helplines, and we have done so through
the two campaigns to which I referred in my previous answer—the

that we beef up the IPCC—that we give it a greater ability to
deal with serious and sensitive cases and complaints that have been
made against the police, rather than seeing so many of those complaints
referred back to the police for their investigation. I think the public
are 
<?notus-xml column=652?>concerned at the number of cases where they see the

Cooper:</Member></B> The Home Secretary’s response is welcome,
but it does not go far enough. Let us consider some of the problems we
have seen for the IPCC. So far, the IPCC has proved that it is
powerless to direct action in the case of West Mercia police; it is
powerless to get seven former police officers to come to interview over
Hillsborough; and it is unable to keep the confidence of families over
the Mark Duggan case, over undercover policing and Stephen Lawrence, or
over the death of Ian Tomlinson. Surely the Home Secretary agrees that
the public need to have confidence not only in the police, but in the
watchdog, in order for an effective job to be done? The resources are
not sufficient, and the watchdog needs the powers to be able to launch
its own investigations and ensure that lessons are learnt. That is the
best way to ensure that a shadow is not cast over the excellent work
the police do. We have been urging her to do this for more than a year
now, so why will she not introduce these reforms to give the watchdog
the much stronger powers that it
needs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:22:51"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_Para>

issue of the investigation of complaints against the police, but the
whole question of the integrity of the police goes further than simply
the IPCC. We have taken a number of steps: for example, the register of
struck-off police officers, which will be introduced as a
result of action taken by this Government. It is exactly the sort of
thing that would have helped in respect of the police officer involved
in the issue relating to the Ian Tomlinson death, to which she
referred. This Government are taking action on the IPCC. We are going
to increase the resources, we are increasing the powers for the IPCC
and we will ensure that it will be investigating the serious and
sensitive cases which currently are passed back to the police. I think
it is right that these investigations are done by a body that is not
the police themselves.</hs_Para>

me turn to last week’s European Council. The key subjects under
discussion were business regulation, competitiveness and monetary
union. We also discussed migration policy following the Lampedusa
tragedy and the importance of the EU’s eastern partnership,
specifically with respect to Ukraine, so the background to this Council
was the state of the European economy. There is no doubt that the
outlook is better than it has been, particularly here in Britain, where
Friday’s figures showed the fastest growth for three years. My
aim at this Council was to do everything possible to enhance the
prospects of a sustained and balanced recovery here in the UK. We made
good progress in three areas in particular: cutting red tape; promoting
trade and the completion of the single market in digital and services;
and protecting British interests as the eurozone integrates further.
Let me briefly say a word about
each.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310285000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000182">First<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:34:21"></hs_TimeCode>,
on cutting red tape, Britain’s business taskforce produced an
excellent report, which was endorsed by 100 European businesses. I
chaired a meeting bringing members of the business taskforce together
with President Barroso and the leaders of Germany, Sweden, Italy,
Poland, Finland, Estonia and the Netherlands. Those countries, which
represent all parts of Europe and all political traditions, agreed on
the need to make more progress in cutting regulation and helping
businesses across Europe to create jobs. The strong language adopted in
the communiqué by all EU member states reflects that ambition.
It calls for rapid implementation of REFIT, the Commission’s own
bureaucracy-cutting initiative, and a proper scoreboard to measure
exactly how much regulation is being cut. Deregulation is now part of
the EU agenda in a way that it simply has not been
before.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310285000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000183">Second<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:35:37"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
on trade, we welcomed the conclusion of the new EU-Canada trade deal,
which could be worth £1.3 billion to the British economy, with
estimates suggesting that British exports to Canada could go up by as
much as a fifth. Last week’s agreement also means that we can
now move on to focus on the EU-US talks that we began at the G8 at
Lough Erne. There were some attempts to link that potential US trade
deal with the concerns about US intelligence, but the Council rejected
the
idea.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310285000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000184">On

single market, once again a commitment was made to complete that by
2015, potentially boosting growth by as much as 4% of the EU’s
total GDP. As Britain is a world leader in e-commerce, that is very
much in our interests. We made good progress at the Council on
issues such as portability of data, e-identification, e-invoicing and
payment services, and an EU-wide copyright regime for the digital age.
But we also agreed not to rush ahead with the data protection 
<?notus-xml column=658?>directive on an artificial timetable, because the
current draft has disproportionate burdens on small business that need
to be removed.
With<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:39:36"></hs_TimeCode> regard to
the services directive, we also agreed that it was time to look at a
new sector-by-sector approach, rather than just trying to remove all
the outstanding barriers to free trade in services in one go, a process
that has stalled in recent
years.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310285000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000185">Third<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:36:56"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
on defending Britain’s interests, as I have argued repeatedly in
this House, the European Union is changing and the eurozone needs more
integration and co-ordination, but Britain is not in the single
currency and is not going to be, so we should not have to take part in
those additional pieces of co-ordination, whether they cover economic
or social policy. Therefore, while eurozone members agreed to even more
intrusive policy co-ordination, including on social policy, I was clear
that Britain will not take part. That is reflected in the
communiqué, which states that all changes are voluntary for
those countries not in the single
currency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310285000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0001.htm#1310285000186">On<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:37:32"></hs_TimeCode>
the tragedy at Lampedusa, we agreed the next stages of the work of
Frontex, which is responsible for trying to stop people coming into the
EU in the first place, but we rejected the idea that there should be
additional burden sharing for so-called “front-line
states”, not least because the figures show that Britain,
France, Germany, Belgium and Sweden received almost 70% of asylum
applications recorded in the EU in the last 12 months. What is
most important of all is to help stop the problems at their source. The
UK will continue to play a leading role in that, for example through
support for border security in Libya and the focus of our development

because of the recent controversies there was much discussion of the
role of intelligence agencies. We agreed a statement, which we
signed as Heads of Government—because there is no EU competence
in this area, and nor should there be—saying that European
countries and America should have a relationship based on trust and
referring to the damage that had been done by recent revelations. The

regard to our own intelligence services, it has been a long-standing
stance that we do not comment on their activities, but it is worth
saying this: we have parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence
agencies through the Intelligence and Security Committee, and we have
strengthened that oversight. Our agencies operate under the law and
their work is overseen by intelligence commissioners. Of course, as
technology develops and the threats we face evolve, we need to ensure

Since 9/11—this is a significant figure— 330

completion of the digital single market could have a significant impact
on our prosperity. On numerous occasions, the Prime Minister has come
to this House stating his commitment to expand the single market in

we will look at the proposals of the Prime Minister’s taskforce.
We agree with the need to restrain unnecessary regulation and welcome
any progress on this, but we do need to distinguish between good and
bad regulation. That takes me to a couple of questions about his
taskforce’s report. In the light of the horsemeat scandal
earlier this year, does it really make sense, as the taskforce seems to
be suggesting, to scrap new rules providing transparency about where
slaughtered meat has come from? What about rules on agency work? Those
rules play an important role in deterring employers from using low-wage
migrant labour to undercut local workers, but his taskforce says they

tight, the European Parliament is trying to spend as much money as

There are two points here. What the eurozone countries want is a sort
of social score card to go with deeper integration. I said that we did
not want to be involved in that and insisted on a voluntary system. We
not only need to see that welfare issues remain for national
Governments; we need to look at the habitual residence test and some of
the problems with the welfare system. This is not now a uniquely
British complaint about European systems. We hear it from German and

but this is an issue predominantly for members of the eurozone. A
single currency necessitates some form of single bank regulation and
resolution system, and that is what its members are putting in place.
They are doing so quite tentatively, however, because they are
beginning to realise what an enormous transfer of sovereignty it could
amount to—theoretically, of course, it would see German citizens
standing behind Greek banks and vice versa. Some progress was made.
Britain is not taking part in this banking union, of course, but we
have achieved some excellent safeguards to ensure that we have a real
say over those parts of financial services regulation to which we are
still subject. I suspect that progress towards full banking

second provision in this Bill will protect the local press from unfair
local competition. Where local newspapers thrive, local democracy
thrives. Local newspapers not only inform residents of what is going
on, but play a vital role in exposing local waste, mistakes and
corruption, and, thus, in holding councils to account. When councils
put out their own glossy free sheets to compete with local newspapers,
local democracy is the loser. Tackling that abuse was a key pledge in
not just the coalition agreement, but the general election manifestos
of both parties.</hs_Para>

2011, Parliament previously strengthened the local government publicity
code, but a small number of councils have intentionally ignored it,
with Tower Hamlets being a case in point. Ofcom has found it guilty of
breaching broadcast rules for political advertising, but no power
exists to tackle its political propaganda sheet, and local auditors
have recently refused to intervene. Such actions are not just a misuse
of public funds; they are, ultimately, harmful to local democracy and
the independence of the free press. They are also further evidence of a
worrying pattern of divisive community politics and mismanagement of
council staff and resources by the mayoral administration. So
provisions in the Bill will ensure that we will act when Parliament is
ignored. Yes, this is central intervention, but it is being done to
protect the free press and deal with the serious abuse of power. Even
in a localist system, there is a role for central Government to set an
ethical framework and maintain checks and balances on local government
to prevent corruption. Without such backstops, there would be a siren

councils. Individual taxpayers and the new wave of citizen journalists
must be let in to conduct their own scrutiny. We are localising audit
and scrapping protection, while ensuring that there is protection
against the bad old days of municipal corruption. In short, the Bill

when it came to producing lower fees. There is limited market in public
audit. In the last financial year 800 councils, health

the Bill as drafted requires the appointment of new auditor panels. The
health bodies, as we know, will have panels based on their existing
audit committees. On the one hand, the ad hoc Committee that
scrutinised the draft Bill described that as an added layer of
governance and made a case for strengthened audit committees in order
to meet the independence requirements of best practice. On the other
hand, the contrary argument has been made that there would be
difficulties in asking audit committees to do the work of the panels,
not least because in many local authorities the audit committees have a
much wider range of responsibilities. Perhaps when he replies, the

on freedom of information, the Bill will weaken the public’s
right to know. The Audit Commission is covered by the Freedom of

transparency, which the Secretary of State repeatedly tells us he
supports, will be diminished. That is really important, especially as
more councils are outsourcing work to private companies. We all
remember the Government’s recent unhappy experience with the
tagging contract scandal. Given that the Government’s view on
applying the Act and the arguments they advanced in the other place

Hollingbery:</Member></B> I am grateful to the right hon. Gentleman for
being so generous in giving way. Is it not the case that clauses 21 and

information requests are completely superfluous? Clauses 21 and 22
allow the auditor to request any and all documents not only from the

is what is in the Bill, but there is a great big hole in it. It is
principally a backward-looking piece of legislation giving effect to
the Secretary of State’s decision of three years ago. He has
completely failed to make provision for auditing in the new world being
built before our very eyes, which I think is an astonishing omission.
The proposed audit arrangements simply do not provide for that changing
world in which public services are managed and provided. We have shared
services, community budgets, city deals and combined authorities, which
are all part of a shift towards much stronger working between central
and local government, yet the current and proposed audit arrangements
still focus much too narrowly on institutions—the arrangements
in the Bill for local government and the National Audit Office for
Whitehall—rather than the work they do. Therefore, as community
budgets develop, does it really make sense for different auditors to
examine the use of the local government pound while the NAO examines
the use of the Whitehall pound when they are being spent together? If
the service is shared and common, so should the audit be. I hope that
Ministers will reflect on that

prompts the question why the Secretary of State has put this measure
forward. He advanced two arguments, the first of which is about
competition with local newspapers. I agree that local newspapers are a
very important part of our democracy. Their independent reporting holds
us to account, and they give us important news and information about
what is happening in our area. However, many local newspapers are in
real difficulties as readership declines and people get more of their
news from the electronic media. Sir Merrick Cockell, the highly
respected Conservative leader of the Local Government Association,
says:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102819000225" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000225">“We’ve

evidence as we do have suggests that the amount of advertising revenue

statutory notices.</hs_Para>

is therefore very curious that, despite great play being made in the
Secretary of State’s speech and in all the consultation
documents of unfair competition and the loss of advertising revenue, it
was reported a little while ago that he had indicated to a private
meeting of Conservative councillors at the LGA conference that the
requirement to place statutory notices in local newspapers is going to
be phased out within a couple of years. I would be happy to give way to
the right hon. Gentleman if he would like to clarify the
Government’s position on the future of statutory notices. The
House will have noticed that he has nothing to say. That is 
<?notus-xml column=686?>because on the one hand he is arguing that council magazines and the
advertising revenue they take are a terrible threat, while on the other
hand it seems, as reported by Conservative councillors who were at the

money that papers get from local councils in the form of statutory
notices. The truth is that his position is utterly

in transport infrastructure and local growth in the city region? This
is an important point of principle, because I fear that the actions of

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:19:59"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Leeds Central (Hilary Benn), the shadow Secretary of State.
It was a curate’s egg performance. I grant that there were some
near rib-tickling moments—some of which were probably not
intended—but it was a classic case of an Opposition searching
for something to oppose. My right hon. Friend has introduced and
delivered a Bill that the Government said at the very beginning of the
coalition we would introduce. I am delighted that it has come to
fruition.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102819000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000102">Let
me deal with the various parts of the Bill. I was fascinated to see
some of the Audit Commission’s expenditure when I was part of
the Opposition Front-Bench team. In the climate of the 1980s, there was
an argument for considering a body such as the Audit Commission.
However, two things happened: the Labour Government caused massive
mission creep in the Audit Commission, and the climate changed. What
caused the massive mission creep? Effectively, the Audit Commission was
used as the machine for imposing a centralised performance regime on
local government. That was a distinctly and fundamentally un-localist
thing to
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102819000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000103">The
situation is well described by Professor George Jones of the London
School of Economics, whom many hon. Members will know—he is the
biographer of Herbert Morrison. Professor Jones would not regard
himself as a natural admirer and advocate of the coalition
Government’s policies, but he believes in local independence. I
disagree with many of the things he says, but he has described the
Labour Government as taking “a fateful decision”
that</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13102819000234" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000234">“turned
the Audit Commission in effect into an agent of central
government…[It] marked the end of its independence, which was
confirmed as further tasks required by central government were placed

Jones is one of the leading independent academics. Most people would
say he has a left-of-centre viewpoint—he happens not to be a
member of any political party—but that significant academic is
condemning the actions of a Government of whom the right hon. Member
for Leeds Central was a member. It is therefore a bit rich of him to
accuse the Secretary of State of back-door localism. Anyone who knows
my right hon. Friend and the history will know that that is
nonsense.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102819000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000105">The
Audit Commission grew beyond its remit to such an extent that it became
the elephant in the room in a great deal of local government budgeting.
Increasingly, time and again, local authorities—officers and
members—felt themselves to be more constrained. They felt they
had to play the system and adopt policies and priorities that ticked
the box of Audit Commission approval. The system of reward and funding
was such that they were incentivised to tick the box to meet central
Government objectives rather than those of their council tax
payers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102819000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000106">That
was initially swept away when the coalition Government got rid of the
iniquitous comprehensive area assessments regime, which, at that time,
was a huge amount of the Audit Commission’s work. Essentially,
the core audit function was left. As I recall, by that stage, the Audit
Commission was about the fourth 
<?notus-xml column=692?>largest audit practice in the country. There was no logical reason why
such a large audit practice should not operate in a commercial
environment, providing that a proper statutory regime was in place to
overarch it and that there was a proper regulation and performance
regime, which the Bill
introduces.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102819000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000107">We
saw that when the in-house audit practice was successfully floated in
the private sector. It is worth noting that, as a consequence, there
has been a 40% reduction in audit fees paid by local authorities. By
the time the Bill is implemented and the Audit Commission is finally
abolished, there will be a 50% reduction in those bills. That has got
to be a good and thoroughly localist thing. Those of us experienced in
local government will remember regular complaints about the level of
charging by the Audit Commission. There was also the iniquitous
situation of its top-slicing, whether it did the job in-house or it was
done through private sector contractors, which was clearly
unjustifiable. I hope people accept that the Bill recognises a sensible
reality.</hs_Para>

have to say with a smile that I note the cost of trying to persuade the
Opposition Front Bench team to change our minds was put at
£56,000. They were getting my right hon. Friend the Secretary of

much effect, so perhaps they were had in any event. I assume that
£50,000 was for my right hon. Friend and £6,000 was for
me—I am fully aware of the status of these things—but it
says something of the level of unreality in the Audit Commission. In
the end, that is why it had so few friends in local government and why
its departure will be unlamented. Instead, we have a sensible set of
checks and balances which need to be put in place, and which I think
the local government sector now understands.</hs_Para>

authorities of a levying body on to the levying body in the knowledge
that the expenditure moved on to the joint body would not be captured
by the council tax threshold referendum. With respect, that would be
pulling the wool over the eyes of the council tax payers of the local
authority’s area. The council tax referendum proposals are
therefore sensible in protecting council tax payers by removing a
loophole that could have been open to that sort of abuse. As the

Neill:</Member></B> In the case of the majority of the larger levying
authorities—it does not apply to some smaller ones—my
experience has often been that they take the form of joint boards or
joint authorities, which have elected members of the constituent
authorities sitting on them, but who are also in a sense members of a
separate legal personality. That is why they are not part of the
council for the purposes of the council tax itself. If a council is
concerned that its council tax bill should not rise unduly, which might
put it in jeopardy of breaching the referendum threshold, it would be
perfectly logical and sensible for it to talk to its representatives on
the board. If I were the leader of that council, I would talk in clear
terms to my colleagues who were the leaders of the other constituent
authorities. There is thus a perfectly good and practical means for
council leaders and their representatives to avoid that happening.
Equally, when they sign up to particular elements of expenditure
through a joint board, it is not unreasonable for them to take into
account the budgetary consequences of that expenditure for their
council tax payers. As I say, these are sensible proposals, which close
a
loophole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102819000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102819000140"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:44:19"></hs_TimeCode>I

Members, including the Secretary of State himself, have suggested that
the exposure of the gerrymandering of Westminster city council, which

Audit Commission. I wonder, however, whether the regime that the

appalling scandal, as the district auditor did then. It really was an

role of the Audit Commission has been both extended and reduced over
the years, but I often found its interventions very helpful when I was
leader of Derby city council. It was able to assess the effectiveness
of local public services, thus providing us with a benchmark in
relation to local authorities in other parts of the country and the
services that they provided. It did so by means of the comprehensive
area assessment which has been so ridiculed by the Secretary of State,
and which was one of the first things to be ditched when the Government

unprecedented cuts, which have continued year after year. The
comprehensive area assessment would doubtless have highlighted the
significant diminution in the quality and breadth of the services
provided by local authorities that resulted directly from the
Government’s cuts agenda—and a very unfair agenda it was.
As we know, the cuts fell most heavily on the local authority areas in
greatest need, although, perversely, some authorities in other parts of
the country received an increase in Government grant. I think that, had
it been allowed to continue, the comprehensive area assessment would
have put the Government parties in a highly embarrassing

One of my favourite statistics that it made me report was the number of
buildings that were open to the public and the number of those
buildings that were accessible to disabled people. I managed to improve
the ratio in my first year in post, simply because we closed a building

evidence to support his statement that there will be a saving. Indeed,
many experts say that fees are likely to increase as a consequence of
scrapping the commission. The draft Local Audit Bill ad hoc committee

that figure may be slightly wrong. Nevertheless, there was a 40%

do not understand why that double standard is being applied by the
Government when it comes to local government. Cynics might say that the
Government are creating yet another money-making cartel. We know that
the Conservative party has form in using taxpayers’ money to
enrich vested interests in the private sector. We need look no further
than the privatisation of the utilities, with millions of consumers
being ripped off on a quarterly basis by the big six utility companies.
We could also look at railways privatisation, which has seen the
railway companies fleecing the travelling public, or the deregulation
of the private rented sector, where we have seen a massive hike in
rents. As a consequence, the housing benefit bill has gone through the
roof—some £10 billion a year is going into private
landlords’ pockets. This is yet another example of the
Conservative party flagrantly using taxpayers’ money to enrich
vested interests in the private sector. It is a shameful
abuse.</hs_Para>

greater responsibility to local bodies and encourage local people to
hold those bodies to account, and the Bill is a step in the right

placed to decide what arrangements suit them locally. It should not be
for central Government or anyone else to dictate to local bodies the
people they should appoint. Under these reforms, they should know
exactly what they are paying for and have control over their
procurements. I am sure that we will discuss whether we are ending up
with a cartel or with competition in greater detail in

tax referendums, closing a loophole to prevent unaccountable levying
authorities from exerting pressure on council tax seems a laudable
aim—however, I have two buts to add. As a localist, I am not
keen on council tax referendums—an alternative to
capping—because they interfere with local decision making.
However, I accept that, in these times of austerity, council tax
freezes and controlling council tax are very important controls of the
cost of living for many hard-working families. Secondly, I am concerned
about the unintended consequences if the council and the levying board
do not work perfectly together, despite the fact that the council might
have representatives on the levying board. A financial risk is also
placed on the local authority, which it could well do without in these
difficult times. As Labour Members have said, there could also be a 
<?notus-xml column=704?>perverse incentive in terms of growth, whereby much-needed investment in
infrastructure could be curbed, which does not seem right. I also share
the concerns about the retrospective nature of the provision. So

I really want to see is transparency for the general public. Both on
precepts and levies, members of the public are confused by the
newspaper headline, “Your council tax is frozen”. They
might not go through all the details in the Bill—I accept that
the details are in place—but the bottom line for them is that
their council tax is not frozen. That makes people very angry, because
they do not see the accountability in the system. So I have
just a few questions about that proposal.</hs_Para>

code has been much mentioned this afternoon. My experience of local
government, public relations departments, and council newspapers and
publications has led me to conclude that the administration —the
party in power—has a greater enthusiasm for having a big PR
department and good, big, flashy newspapers than the opposition.
Normally, the opposition will say, “We can find savings in the
budget by slashing the PR budget.” That is usually the proposal
on budget-setting night. However, if the opposition party then moves
into control, it suddenly finds that the PR department is rather
useful, after all. There are rightly questions about this money and the
way it is spent, but a council publication has an important role to
play; it certainly means that the public become more engaged, even if
that is just a case of knowing where grit bins will be in icy weather
and what provision is going to be made. Such publications are important
disseminators of information for the many people who still do not
access the internet. We cannot have all the information in that format
at the moment, so the newspaper is of importance.</hs_Para>

that not many examples of abuse are being provided and that most local
authorities are probably not going to be affected by this measure, I
have a concern that we may be using a sledgehammer to crack a
nut—that question needs to be asked. Again, the measure slightly
offends my localist principles, because the local council should be
making the decisions and standing up to be counted when it is seen by
its electorate as wasting money on these “lavish”
publications. I am not at all convinced by the argument that such
publications are in widespread competition with local newspapers, and
the evidence would seem to be against that view; so, again, questions
remain. I can see what the Government are aiming to do, but we have to
recall that the provision of information and a council being outward
looking is a good thing, even if most of the photos in the newspaper
are of members of the ruling party.</hs_Para>

wish to end by talking about statutory notices. The LGA has called for
the introduction of a new clause that would remove the duty on local
authorities to publish statutory notices in their local newspapers. It
would not remove the duty on councils to inform their residents about
the statutory notices or any other area of council policy; it would
just allow councils to decide whether or not the local newspaper was
the best place to do that. It has been estimated that adopting the new
clause could save local government at least £26 million per
year, which is a considerable sum, and more cost-effective methods of
conveying this information are available. I believe an Opposition
Member intervened to suggest that estate agents and other professionals

<?notus-xml column=705?>look at all the public notices, but they should be
there for ordinary members of the public, who are the ones who do not
spot the notices that affect them. So I do not feel that the most
effective method of conveying information to the bulk of council tax
payers is being used. The professionals who need to know this
information could access it online; perhaps it is paper notices that
are needed for residents. Will the Government repeal this outdated and
expensive statutory requirement? Such an approach would be strongly
welcomed by all parties in local
government.</hs_Para>

believer in direct provision by the local authority itself, but if

second point is about examples in my own area. The Bill does not seem
to address any of the structural or procedural concerns arising from

transparency in local decision making. To a certain extent I blame the
previous Government for the structural 
<?notus-xml column=709?>problems that we now have in local government. I use my own local

making.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000010">In
my local authority, Hillingdon, we have a leader and cabinet system
which has centralised powers in the hands of one person—the
leader. The leader is able to use exclusive patronage to appoint all
the other members of the cabinet, and that patronage then determines
the lucrative business of the payments of himself—£65,000
a year for a part-time job, plus expenses—and of every other
member of the cabinet, who receive £50,000 to £55,000
each. If any members step out of line, they are demoted. In recent
weeks in my local authority, I have seen long-standing experienced
senior councillors prevented even from standing again for the local
authority.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000011">Transparency
International’s report expresses concern about cronyism in local
government. In my local area I am witnessing the worst forms of
cronyism where the leader appoints everybody, everybody is responsible
to the leader, and there are financial consequences if people step out
of line. In addition to that, there is nothing in the Bill about the
decision-making process in relation to policy, which has also been
centralised. In my local authority all decisions, no matter how minor,
go through the leader’s office. If any officer loses the favour
of the leader, they are out. If an officer provides unpalatable advice
to the leader, that is enough for them to be shown the door. That is
described among officers in Hillingdon as a reign of
terror.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000012" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000012">Whistleblowing
is not an option for most. In Hillingdon, when people are asked to
leave, they go under a compromise agreement, which includes a gagging
order. I would like to see in the Bill an end to all compromise
agreements in local government and an end to all gagging orders that
are implied as part of those compromise agreements, because they
prevent officers from providing independent advice or making public
their concerns to all members of the council and to the general
public.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000013">I
want to see the Bill also address the issue of secrecy. The cabinet
system means that all major decisions in my area are made in part 2 of
the cabinet agenda—that means in confidence and in secrecy. As
an officer in the past, I have advised on what should be in part 2 and
what should be in part 1 and in public. Decisions which I considered in
the past should be made in open committee and information upon which
those decisions are made are almost inevitably put in part 2 in
Hillingdon—the confidential part of a cabinet meeting. I want to
see a provision in the Bill which restricts the ability of members to
avoid accountability by putting decision making into the secret part of
cabinet
agendas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000014">I
shall give a couple of examples to show how ludicrous the practice has
become. For the building of a new school in my area, a matter which I
have raised in the House before, a consultant was employed to examine
which site the school should be built on. It was controversial because
the council wanted eventually to build on a country park—a
green-belt field about which even the Mayor of London expressed his
concerns. The consultant’s report on which sites were examined,
all in council ownership, was put in part 2 of the cabinet
agenda—the secret part. Even freedom of information requests
were refused on the grounds of commercial confidentiality.</hs_Para>

must address in the Bill how councils are allowed to interpret
commercial confidentiality in a way that avoids accountability and
avoids their providing even the basic information to local members of
the public and also to opposition members. Let me give another example.
On the same site there was a recent archaeological find of flints. The
report from the archaeologist who discovered the flints was put into
part 2 of the cabinet agenda on the basis of commercial
confidentiality. It might have been commercially confidential 6,000
years ago, but not now. Eventually both reports were released, but not
in a timely
fashion.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000016" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000016">The
problem—I say this from a non-partisan point of view—is
that an opposition councillor who seeks to reveal anything that is in
part 2 of a cabinet meeting is threatened with criminal sanction, so
people are fearful of releasing information from part 2. We should
address that matter in the Bill. We need to define more clearly what is
commercial confidentiality, and what criteria can be used for putting
items into the secret part 2 of the agenda for a committee or cabinet
meeting. I believe that is being abused, not necessarily for corrupt
reasons, but perhaps for party political advantage or because
individual councillors do not want to be held to account by local
communities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000017">The
Bill refers to audit and some elements of transparency as best it can,
but it does not really address accountability and scrutiny. In my
borough, scrutiny is virtually non-existent. Scrutiny committees are
packed with a majority of party members loyal to the leader and can
therefore be controlled by patronage. Scrutiny committees might have
been an excellent idea some years ago, but in many local authorities,
including mine, they have proved

are real concerns about corruption. Advice needs to be
provided to local authorities on how independent investigations should
take place when allegations of corruption are made, but again that is
not covered in the Bill. I will cite an example I raised in the House
some years ago relating to the planning incentive grant introduced
under the previous Government by the then Department of the
Environment. If a local authority considered its planning applications
within 13 weeks, it was given an additional grant from central
Government, so it was in incentive to improve efficiency. In my local
authority—this was proved, and the details published, as a
result of what I said in the House—dates and signatures on
documents were found to have been forged in order to bring planning
application decisions within the 13-week period, even though many were
taken
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000019" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000019">Those
forgeries were exposed because fortunately one of the planning
applications was submitted by a police inspector. He looked at the
documentation and discovered that the dates had been changed. In fact,
decisions on his application had been recorded as taking place even
before council officers had met him to discuss it. After an
investigation, a couple of officers retired from the local authority
unsanctioned. Bizarrely, the leader of the section responsible for the
planning process was then promoted. There is nothing in the Bill that
provides real direction for local authorities on how to deal with such
matters. It is extraordinary that these things still go on, yet we turn
a blind eye to it by not relating the legislation to the real world of
local
government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:42:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000020" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000020">I
could cite many other examples, including Southern Cross and the
neglect of the elderly in my constituency, and non-monitoring as a
result of the staff cuts that

no one was held responsible. There was a refurbishment programme of an
old people’s home—I raised this 12 months
ago—which resulted in a year-long delay for elderly people being
relocated to their homes. There was laundering of money via contracts
to a builder. Again, there was an internal investigation that reported
to part 2 of a cabinet meeting and there were no sanctions
whatsoever against any officer. I wrote to the Secretaries of States of
successive Governments on all those matters to call for an inquiry, but
there was no response and no action was ever
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000021" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000021"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:43:11"></hs_TimeCode>I

as local government officers, are not allowed to put forward party

many of us would like to see thriving local newspapers reporting what

how many jobs have gone in the industry and the impact that has had on

synergy between the local press and the local authority in its

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:47:17"></hs_TimeCode> am concerned
that the proposed measure is unnecessary, because sanctions already
exist. It will also undermine the dissemination of information by local

the local community is properly informed on two key issues of local
concern. One of them, as
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:47:56"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Leeds Central mentioned, is the expansion of
Heathrow airport, in which it is up against a large corporation that is
sending out large amounts of information to the local community, most
of which is inaccurate. It is only the local authority that is
providing a balanced analysis of what is happening. The other issue is
high-speed rail.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:49:36"></hs_TimeCode> am anxious
that Hillingdon council, or any other local authority, should not be
debarred from ensuring that local people are kept informed about such
pertinent issues, because it is absolutely essential that they are
fully aware of the consequences if they are to exercise their
democratic right and decide on the actions taken by local and national
Government.</hs_Para>

would like assurances from the Minister that the activities of local
authorities to inform local residents of matters such as high-speed

if the local press has declined so badly, with a limited circulation

inadequate. I understand the point

welcome the abolition of central auditing and inspection, which was
highly bureaucratic and rarely had any real effect. It led to very
little action, at least in my council, and was highly burdensome and
expensive. Indeed, just putting in the systems to cope with it cost my
council £50,000. That seemed completely over the top given that
the council raises only £4 million in council tax.</hs_Para>

have already given an example of one of the ludicrous statistics that I
had to collect, but I would like to share a couple more. We had to
report the percentage of the council work force who were of black and
ethnic minority origin compared with the percentage in the local area
that we served. In one year, we had a 25% fall in that indicator
because one person retired.</hs_Para>

were also asked to report on the time taken to re-let local council
housing. Sitting here in Westminster that seems like a sensible thing
to measure, but in Winchester we had a serious problem with hard-to-let
apartments, many of which had been un-let for a year, perhaps two or
even three years, because they were 30 or 40 years old and no
longer suited to modern conditions. The better we did on that, the
worse our indicator got, because the length of time we had taken to
re-let council flats went up and up as we added a year or perhaps two
years every time we re-let a council flat. That is not what was
intended, and it demonstrates the problem with large central
organisations. I very much welcome the

have talked about the amount of money that has been saved by the
abolition of the Audit Commission. There is some debate about this, but
it is undeniable that the 70% of local government audit business that

reason I have fairly lengthy notes is that the Communities and Local
Government Committee, on which
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:54:38"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Derby North (Chris Williamson) also served, reported on this issue
in July 2011. I should like to go through some of the
recommendations that we made, compare them with the Bill, and see
whether what we recommended has been delivered. In evidence, we
detected some nervousness about violating the principle that public
bodies should not appoint their own auditors. I have never understood
the problem with that. I cannot see the philosophical difference
between the private and public sectors in terms of audit. In both
cases, roughly the same requirements hold. Yes, we have to be
absolutely confident that public money derived from taxation is
properly spent, but why is that, in principle, any different from
individuals giving money to private companies that has to be properly
handled and is subject to the rules of the land?
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:52:23"></hs_TimeCode> both cases,
the public must have full confidence that the law is being upheld and
that their money is being spent as intended.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:55:45"></hs_TimeCode>I recognise that
a lack of confidence in how public money is being spent threatens the
whole principle of a Government being able to raise taxation in the
first place, which lies at the very heart of our democracy. That said,
I cannot see that there is any greater need than a general confidence
in the true and fair view of the private sector on which so much of our
economy rests. I cannot see why this is any more important in the
public sector than in the private sector.</hs_Para>

Committee felt that the change was no great threat as long as
sufficient safeguards were put in place, and I firmly believe that the
Bill provides them. A reasonable summary of our principal
recommendations is that any replacement audit regime should be
independent, transparent and effective. Let us then look at the Bill to
see whether it contains remedies to those three issues. We asked that
any scheme be “proportionate and risk based”. Paragraph 1
of schedule 6 deals with that in that it specifically allows the code
of audit practice to be different for different authorities. That is
exactly as it should be. It is somewhat at odds with our request for
“ensuring consistency”, but as long as all audit is
driven by the same overarching principles, the need for a proportionate
approach trumps
uniformity.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0002.htm#13102824000039">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:57:03"></hs_TimeCode>

passing I note that where authorities choose not to join such a body,
there may be scope for having one committee in a council that deals
with all issues that require independent control. I suspect
that that does not need addressing in the Bill but is something that
councils could do for themselves. To my mind, there is at
least one other such committee—that setting
councillors’ rates of pay and expenses. There could be one
committee that has a majority of independent councillors and/or members

issues that required an independent

regulations may be issued on that subject. We will need to see the
detail of the secondary legislation to be completely certain about how
the issue of removal will be dealt with, but I am confident that the

Given that I have some experience of both public and private audit, I

call it a gulf—and I welcomed the Government’s commitment
in the Lords to add words to that effect. Those words now appear in
clause 17 and paragraphs 8 and 13 of schedule 5, which will establish a
register for qualified individuals. That is a sensible move. If we are
going to have independence of audit, we need to make absolutely certain
that those who are eligible to be auditors are properly qualified and

process, for which the Committee also asked tangentially. Baroness
Hanham responded in the Lords by saying that, given the NAO’s
role in the design and scope of local audit, she felt that it would
always be there to give advice. I think that that is a reasonable
assessment and it seems that Lord McKenzie
agreed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:02:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000052" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000052">Finally,
the Committee felt that the proposal for thematic studies previously
undertaken by the Audit Commission to be undertaken by the NAO was
entirely workable. Indeed, we said that it “may have some
advantages”. We also expressed the view that the Local
Government Association was well placed to do more work of this sort
outside the more formal NAO structure. My understanding is that the LGA

want to comment briefly on a couple of other aspects of the Bill that
deal with matters other than audit, and it will not surprise anyone to
know that one of them is “The Code of Recommended Practice on
Local Authority Publicity”. At the moment the code is only
advisory and continues to be abused by only a very small number of
authorities. It is right that public money should not be allowed to pay
for partisan political activity, save in very limited instances and
when specifically authorised by Parliament; Short money is a particular
case in point. The Government are absolutely right to try to stop such
abuse. It cannot be right to have political campaigning on the rates,
but I ask the Minister to be
careful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:03:47"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:03:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000055">At
present a number of authorities breach the code, but they do not do so
for political gain; usually, it is related to the frequency of
publication. There is an argument that quarterly publishing is more
than adequate and that to allow more would threaten the viability of
local newspapers, particularly if the content of the council
newsletters is not limited solely to council matters, takes advertising
and is laid out in such a way to compete directly with
newspapers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:04:13"></hs_TimeCode>. I
have some innate sympathy with that position, but I must admit that the
evidence that there is truly an adverse effect is
scant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000056" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000056">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:04:29"></hs_TimeCode>
real worry is that, while the enforceability of the code is clearly
important, so too is the proportionality of the code itself. I suspect
that Ministers are not, in fact, too worried about the frequency of
publication. Their real worry is the partial nature of a very few
publications—the “Pravdas,” to quote the Secretary
of State—but legal officers on councils will not see it that 
<?notus-xml column=717?>way. Understandably, once the code becomes enforceable their advice will
be that they cannot recommend anything other than that which the code
allows, which includes not publishing more frequently than quarterly,
as detailed in paragraph 28.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:05:06"></hs_TimeCode> believe that
as long as local authorities can adequately justify a more than
quarterly publication we should not seek to prevent them from doing
so.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000057">A
more than quarterly publication would

month<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:05:15"></hs_TimeCode>. At the
same time, a number of much larger authorities could easily fill a
publication monthly with objective, useful and relevant information for
residents. May I encourage the Minister to look at the code with a view
to dealing with that

the Minister also look again at the publication requirements for
statutory notices, which have already been mentioned? Although it is
right that we consider the effect on local newspapers of the

effect.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000059">One<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:05:57"></hs_TimeCode>
of my local editors made the argument to me that it is important for
readers to be able to see what is going on in a public authority and
that the publishing of statutory notices in newspapers is an important
part of that process. I pointed out to him that if he truly thought
that to be the case, there was nothing to prevent the paper from
reporting on them and publishing the list itself if it felt that
strongly about the matter. The simple fact is that the vast majority of
the public access data about planning, licensing and so on from public
notices and, thereafter, council websites, rather than from the local
paper<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:06:19"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000060">This
issue was a bugbear to me as a portfolio holder. It was expensive,
inflexible and of little advantage to the public, and it cost my
council—a small district council—£32,000 a year.
It may have been to the advantage of the profitability of newspapers,

turn to council tax referendums. It is clear that the Government are
right to give local voters the right to vote on council tax increases
that are above the limit set by the Government as reasonable
and proportionate. I believe that is much better than a cap, allowing
as it does for a council to take its case to the voters if it believes
it has a strong enough case to persuade
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:07:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102824000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102824000062">The
Bill corrects an anomaly in current regulations that omit levying
authority charges from the calculations that determine the proposed
percentage increase on council tax. We have already had the argument
about why they should be added, but there is a difficulty that the
Government need to address. If there needs to be a council tax
referendum because the amount charged by the levying authority
pushes council tax above the Government’s limit, there is no
legal way in which the council can force that levying authority to
change its charge. Neither is there any duty on the levying authority
to hold a referendum—that falls to the local council taxpayers.
I believe that that is wrong. We have to force some decision on levying
authorities if this particular provision is to work
correctly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:07:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

simple possibilities have occurred to me. It may be that none of them
is the right thing to do, but they are all possible. The first is to
impose a cap on levying authorities, which is not something that I
would favour. The second is to impose the cost of the referendum
required as a result of the charge from the levying authority on the
levying authority. The final one is to make a no vote binding on the
levying authority, such that it has to change the charge back in such a
way that the overall council tax will rise only by the amount specified
by the
Government<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:08:16"></hs_TimeCode>. I
would welcome a commitment from the Minister to consider the matter and

conclusion, I am confident in the general thrust of the Bill and in the
vast majority of its measures. I will certainly vote for it tonight

what others have said. I ask, however, that Ministers address some of

must explore critical issues in Committee that are currently unclear,

it 
<?notus-xml column=719?>would do Ministers much more credit if they stopped double-counting and

hon. Friend the Member for Meon Valley (George Hollingbery), who has a
background in local government, spoke of his wide experience of
comprehensive area assessments and gave a great outline of exactly why
we need a firm ending of the Audit Commission, so there is no chance of
it coming back in the format we have experienced. He touched on auditor
appointments, on enforcing the publicity code, which I will deal with
later, and on council tax referendums and levying bodies. He suggested
a range of interesting opportunities to ensure that referendums are
dealt with in a proper and fair manner for the authorities. I look
forward to taking his suggestions forward in
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000059" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000059">Let
me be clear why the Government have decided to proceed with the final
abolition of the Audit Commission. The House has heard how our reforms
to local audit will result in a more efficient audit system, with an
estimated £1.2 billion of savings—I would not want to
disappoint the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:31:30"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Corby by not mentioning the £1.2 billion of
savings. That is exactly why it is important to push forward and embed
that to stop any chance of future Audit Commission mission
creep.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000060">The
reforms are not just about saving money. They are about the
Government’s drive to decentralise power and responsibility to
local bodies, and giving local people better tools to hold bodies to
account. By cutting out the middleman, local bodies will no longer be
forced to foot the bill for Audit Commission costs. They will know
exactly what they are paying for in their audits. Local bodies will be
required to publish information about their auditor appointments and
any public interest reports they receive from the auditor. People will
therefore be able to find that information locally, rather than having
to go to a remote central
body.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000061">The
reforms improve local accountability. As many hon. Members, including
Opposition Members, have said, the Audit Commission had lost its way,
forcing councils to focus on Audit Commission priorities rather than
priorities that matter to local residents.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:32:33"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Meon Valley outlined some of those. As a councillor, I
remember sitting in meetings when officers told us what we should
do—it was often to do with waste collection. The suggestions
were not made because they were right for our residents, but because
they ticked a box to please the Audit Commission, and the Government
would punish us further down the line if we did not take that action.
The Government’s impact assessment estimates that the cost to
local authorities of complying with the CAA was around £25
million per year—that money could be better spent on other
things that residents want and need and deserve to have
delivered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000062">Let
me reassure hon. Members who are concerned that the quality of audit
will suffer. The Government are committed to ensuring that that does
not happen. Private audit firms have long had a role to play in
auditing public bodies. As I have said, the Audit
Commission has contracted out some 30% of its audit

<?notus-xml column=726?>contracts to private audit firms. Last year’s
outsourcing exercise demonstrated that public audit can be carried out
to the same high level but at a much lower cost to the
taxpayer.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000063">The
Bill contains robust mechanisms to safeguard auditor independence. The
work of the auditors remains largely unchanged and auditors will still
be required to use their professional judgment to decide whether to
make a report in the public interest if they believe something is
amiss. To enshrine that important principle, the Bill allows auditors
to recover costs for their time in making a public interest report or
advisory notice. By amending existing secondary legislation, we will
ensure that whistleblowers can make disclosures to local auditors
directly or to the National Audit
Office.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000064" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000064">Many
hon. Members have mentioned the publicity code. I want to make one
point clearly at the outset: there is no change to the code. The
measures contribute to the Government’s commitment to localism
rather than run counter it. Given that the code is not changing, I am
somewhat surprised that any hon. Member has a problem with it being put
into statutory form. Opposition Members have complained that the
Government have not enforced the voluntary code. By putting it in
statute, we can make sure that it is enforced to ensure that
taxpayers’ money is spent appropriately and properly, and not
for political
ends.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000065" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000065">There
have been exaggerated claims that provisions on the code will lead to
central Government clamping down on, for instance, HS2 campaigning,
which has been mentioned. That is nonsense. Councillors are free to
campaign on behalf of their constituents. Indeed, the Government
legislated in the Localism Act 2011 to give councillors the freedom to
campaign. If any challenge is balanced and factually accurate, it will
not contravene the code, unlike some publications. For example,
Nottingham city council’s website seems unusually to mirror the
Nottingham Labour party’s website. Residents might want to
question expenditure on that sort of thing. If anything, the publicity
code defends council communications from political interference and
propaganda-pushing, as was outlined by

been clear that, in the internet age, commercial newspapers should
expect, over time, less state advertising as more information is
syndicated online for free. Local papers need to develop new business

together and have done so, both under the old Government capping

parish polls is a long-standing issue that was raised during the
passage of the Bill in the other place by the Earl of Lytton. It was
agreed to consider amending the Bill in this House to include a power
for the Secretary of State to make provision in regulations to
modernise the rules on parish polls. We need to define more tightly
what constitutes a legitimate topic for a poll, and modernise the

in the parish have an opportunity to vote. This will allow all local

meetings where they are allowed to be present. Some councils are still
refusing to allow people to do this, preventing local people from using
modern technology to hold their elected representatives to account.
Councillors should not be shy about the public seeing the great work
they do for their local communities. We have already legislated on this

is an opportunity to put the case for small retailers, who are caught
between a rock and a hard place when it comes to the sale of tobacco. A
few weeks ago, I was visited by a delegation of small retailers, a
number of whom were my constituents who were supported by the
publication <I>Asian Trader</I>. Also at the meeting, and uninvited by
me, were representatives of Imperial Tobacco. I was surprised to see
them and wondered what role they had to play in the proceedings. They
were attending, I was told, in a spirit of helpfulness, and offered
their “help” to me until I explained in no uncertain
terms that I was not a friend of the tobacco lobby. However, their
presence did lead me to consider the amount of influence tobacco
companies have in the retail industry, and the kind of messages they
are giving to tobacco
retailers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000104">Tobacco
companies have a lot of money—it is a huge industry—but
as purveyors of substances that kill one in two long-term users, they
do not tend to be the most popular lobbyists around. I received an
e-mail from a Liberal Democrat councillor, John McClurey, who has been
a newsagent for more than 30 years. He suggested that the tobacco
companies were using the good names of the small retailers to lobby
Parliament with their own promotional messages. He also suggested they
were circulating misinformation to tobacco retailers, with the aim of
scaring them into becoming a voice for tobacco
manufacturers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:47:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000105">When
I met the retailers, there was no doubt in my mind that they believed
passionately in what they were telling me, but knowing the involvement
of the tobacco lobby led me to re-examine objectively what they were
saying in the light of wider evidence. For example, on the European
tobacco products directive, my retail friends told me that banning
smaller quantities of tobacco—packs of 10 cigarettes and 20
grams of loose tobacco—was wrong because it discriminated
against smokers on a tight budget and smokers aiming to give up. It
undoubtedly does. However, it also discriminates against minors, who
are extremely sensitive to price changes. These packs of 10 cigarettes
have been dubbed “kiddie packs” because they are so
popular with teenage smokers.</hs_Para>

retail friends also believe that smuggling is a growing scourge that

duty<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:48:41"></hs_TimeCode>. According
to Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs, tobacco smuggling has more
than halved in the past decade to 9% of total sales. I am not saying
that 9% is not far too high, or that general statistics will help my
friend Paul Cheema at his newly opened Kwik Save in Solihull if
smuggled tobacco is being sold from a van near his shop. Nevertheless,
despite tax hikes on cigarettes to the extent of 88% of the recommended
retail price, the amount of tobacco smuggling has continued to decline.
The tobacco multinationals’ concern about illicit trade needs to
be evaluated in the light of their having paid billions in 
<?notus-xml column=732?>fines and payments to settle cigarette-smuggling litigation in the EU
and Canada. They are being prosecuted for smuggling their own products,
so their trying to unsettle small retailers, when some of their number
are perpetrators of the problem, sounds a little
hollow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000107">Is
“plain packaging” not a misnomer, given that recent EU
votes have confirmed that 65% of the packaging surface will have to

and reduced their availability. What is the thinking in the Department
of Health on e-cigarettes? Will we follow the EU in not medicalising

I want to discuss proxy purchasing. Interestingly, there is no age in
the UK at which the smoking of tobacco products is illegal, if children

cigarettes is 18, and retailers can be subject to serious penalties if
caught selling tobacco to under-18s. Proxy purchasing—when an
over-18 buys cigarettes for an under-age smoker—is illegal in
Scotland, but not in England and Wales, so in the latter, the retailer
can be prosecuted, but the proxy purchaser cannot.</hs_Para>

have a better sales margin. That would be a good deal and a fair deal

for Solihull (Lorely Burt) on securing a very timely debate. I enjoyed
her thoughtful speech. I suspect that there will be things on which I

posed all the important and current questions, and I will try to cover
as many of them as I

all agree that smoking has an enormously harmful impact on health.
Nearly 80,000 people die in England every year from smoking-related
illnesses, and the Government are obviously committed to reducing the
number of those premature deaths—it is a priority for
us—so this is a welcome opportunity to debate tobacco control.
I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:56:38"></hs_TimeCode> will first
take a moment, however, to highlight the UK’s international
reputation on tobacco control. Successive Governments have demonstrated
a commitment to improving public health through effective
tobacco-control policies, and a wide range of measures have contributed
to our long-term success. Over the past decade, complementary domestic
and EU legislation has contributed to a decline in smoking prevalence
among both adults and young people, and in England today the rate of
adult smoking prevalence is under 20% for the first time. But clearly
we want to keep making
progress<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:57:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000118">Since
the 2001 tobacco products directive, there have been several scientific
and international policy developments on tobacco control, an obvious
one being the World Health Organisation’s framework convention
on tobacco control, to which every EU member state and the European
Commission are parties. It has become necessary to update the current
directive, however, and that work is ongoing. The revised directive, to
which the hon. Lady devoted much of her speech, proposes new
requirements across a range of areas, including: the ingredients and
emissions of tobacco products; labelling and packaging; product
traceability and security features; cross-border distance sales; and
novel and nicotine-containing
products<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:57:58"></hs_TimeCode>. The UK
Government welcome the revised tobacco products directive and believe
that the 
<?notus-xml column=734?>proposals will be good for public health across Europe, particularly in
helping to prevent children from taking up smoking—it is of
concern to us all that the vast majority of smokers started before they
turned 18.</hs_Para>

key objectives for the directive include: bigger pictorial health
warnings; ending tobacco with characterising flavours, which the hon.

nicotine-containing products such as e-cigarettes to be regulated as
medicines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:58:28"></hs_TimeCode>.
During the negotiations, my predecessor and officials worked to secure
adequate freedom for member states to introduce domestic policies
within the scope of the directive that aim for a higher level of health
protection where justified. That is important because we want to retain
the freedom to do more if we want to. For example, we need the ability
to introduce standardised packaging if we wish to do
so.</hs_Para>

Ellison:</Member></B> Yes, I share that concern. I saw a presentation
only last week with some of those adverts and imagery. As I said, it is
a key priority of ours to prevent children and young people from taking
up smoking, so anything that might contribute to their taking it up is
extremely worrying.</hs_Para>

UK’s support for the general approach agreed at the June Health
Council was important in securing the qualified majority needed to
avoid losing hard-won negotiated improvements to the text of the
directive. Hon. Members will also be aware that the European Parliament
has been scrutinising the proposal, and this is obviously where we have
had some recent pushback in some areas. We were pleased to see that, on
8 October, the Parliament agreed with the Council and voted to ban
packs of cigarettes with fewer than 20 sticks, to increase health
warnings to 65% of the front and back of packs, to make pictorial
warnings mandatory throughout the EU—as they are already in the
UK—and to prohibit characterising
flavours.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:00:21"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

should be noted that the Council and the European Parliament rejected
the Commission’s proposal to ban slim cigarettes, so that will
not form part of the final revised
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:00:28"></hs_TimeCode>. As
the new Minister, I made inquiries into why that was the case, and I
understand that there was not enough support among EU member states or
parliamentarians for such a ban. We in the UK felt that we had to go
with the majority to ensure the progress of the directive, as it will
be good for public health overall. That was a pragmatic decision.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:00:51"></hs_TimeCode>Like the hon.
Lady, I believe that this package of measures will help to reduce the
number of young people who take up smoking in the UK.</hs_Para>

are currently considering the detailed amendments that the European
Parliament would like to make. We were disappointed that the Parliament
did not support the regulation of nicotine-containing products as
medicines. We believe that the medicines regulatory regime, applied
with a light touch, is the best fit for these products. Although I
cannot say too much more about that now, we recognise that there is a
lively ongoing debate on that subject, and it is one that we are
engaged in. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:01:26"></hs_TimeCode>It
is also 
<?notus-xml column=735?>vital that we maintain momentum on the overall negotiations over the

hon. Lady devoted some time to considering what the tobacco products
directive will mean for small retailers. As a Back Bencher, I was
co-chairman of the all-party parliamentary retail group, and I heard
many of the same representations that she mentioned. I recognise those
concerns. We recognise that some of the proposals will have impacts on
tobacco retailers in regard to the range and pack size of tobacco
products that they will be able to sell. During the negotiations, as
with all of our tobacco control measures, we continue to consider the
impacts on all areas of society, including businesses large and
small<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:02:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000126">I
share the hon. Lady’s doubt that introducing the proposed
revised directive, if and when agreed, will have any immediate or
drastic effect on small retailers. As she said, retailers face an
ongoing challenge to diversify the range of products that they sell so
that they are not over-dependent on tobacco sales. British retailers
are, and always have been, the most innovative in responding to
consumer needs and diversifying. The earliest any new requirements
would be likely to take effect in the UK would be 2016, meaning that
shopkeepers have time to start making changes
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:02:45"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000127">The
hon. Lady made some interesting points on illicit tobacco. Like her, I
have heard that some tobacco manufacturers and retailers believe that
certain measures in the proposed directive could drive more smokers to
purchase illicitly traded tobacco products. We are not aware of any
peer-reviewed and published studies that show that that would happen.
However, we are not complacent when it comes to counterfeit or
non-duty-paid tobacco products in the UK. The illicit tobacco market is
complex and decisions by individuals to get involved in purchasing
illicit tobacco depend on a range of factors. The proposed directive
envisages a Europe-wide tracking and tracing system for tobacco
products, the details of which we are still negotiating in
Brussels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:03:37"></hs_TimeCode>.
The European Commission says that that will reduce the
amount of illicit products in the EU. Security features against
counterfeiting will also allow consumers to verify the legal status of
the products. The hon. Lady suggested that we were perhaps paying
insufficient attention to the security features on the packaging,
because they are often not very plain at all.</hs_Para>

am glad that the hon. Lady has pointed out that the illicit market in
cigarettes and roll-your-own has diminished significantly since the
launch of the first Government tobacco strategy in 2000, with the
mid-point estimate of the tax gap for illicit cigarettes decreasing
from 21% in 2000-2001 to 9% in 2012-13, for example, according to Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs
data<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:04:26"></hs_TimeCode>. The
UK’s success in reducing illicit tobacco is in no small part due
to successive Governments’ commitment to, and investment in,
enforcement, and that remains a key part of our
policy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:04:41"></hs_TimeCode>. We
should also see further progress on illicit tobacco on a global scale
when the new framework convention on tobacco control protocol on
illicit trade is
implemented<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:04:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000129">The
hon. Lady made some interesting points about proxy purchasing.
Obviously that is something that, as a new Minister, I have just begun
to look at, and I was glad that she explored some of the arguments. I
want to emphasise the valuable contribution that the majority 
<?notus-xml column=736?>of retailers make to ensuring that legitimate tobacco products are sold
according to the law, including by not selling tobacco to people under
18 years old. Retailers get frustrated that we hear only about the
occasional instances of poor practice that hit the headlines, and that
decent, ordinary retailers do not get any credit for the way in which
they uphold the law. I want to place on record my thanks to all those
retailers who make strenuous efforts to uphold the law and who do not
sell tobacco products to children.</hs_Para>

sympathise with the difficulties retailers face in ensuring that they
do not make sales to under-age people. I also understand why some
retailers feel that buying tobacco on behalf of a child should be an
offence. However, we need to think carefully before introducing a proxy
purchasing offence. I understand that the supply of cigarettes to
children is a problem, but an offence of proxy purchasing would not
necessarily tackle the wider problem of
supply<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:06:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

children who smoke get their cigarettes from friends and family, and

part of a package of measures. Also, we cannot draw a comparison with
alcohol because the regulatory regimes for the sale of alcohol and
tobacco are
different.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102830000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/debtext/131028-0003.htm#13102830000134">Enforcement
of a good deal of tobacco control legislation, including age of sale,
is the responsibility of local authority trading standards officers. I
have asked questions about the capability of enforcing any such rules
introduced. Currently, the Trading Standards Institute, while
supportive in principle of any additional measures to tackle under-age
access to tobacco, has told us that experience with the alcohol offence
shows that there are likely to be difficulties enforcing a proxy
purchase offence for tobacco. In practice, it is sometimes difficult to
prove the offence and effective enforcement would entail surveillance
of shopper and retailer behaviours, which can be time consuming and
resource
intensive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:08:13"></hs_TimeCode>. As I

finally touch on a couple of further points that the hon. Lady raised.
As I have mentioned, the tobacco products directive does not seek to
introduce standardised packaging, but it would allow the UK to proceed
with that if we wanted to do so. The Government 
<?notus-xml column=737?>published a summary of the consultation responses, issued a written
statement earlier this year and responded to an urgent question. As the
hon. Lady knows and as I mentioned several times at Health
questions last week, the Government have decided to wait before
making a final decision on standardised packaging. The policy
remains under very active consideration and the Government have not
ruled out its introduction. We are assessing all the information
available to us from Australia and elsewhere. I cannot give the hon.
Lady a time frame, but I repeat the fact that the policy is under very
active consideration. Some interesting information is coming in from
around the world, not just from Australia.</hs_Para>

want member states to have the flexibility to make further progress on
domestic tobacco control measures in certain key areas, potentially
going beyond the new directive, and we have been helping to shape the
final text of article 24 to try to achieve that as an objective. I hope
the hon. Lady agrees that it is sensible to see what we can learn from
other countries’ experience, but it is hard for me to speculate
about what different impacts might be seen and
when<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:10:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

South Sudan practical livelihood skills through a Youth Education

removing barriers to trade, developing local markets and increasing

Government of South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands (GSGSSI).
Following an initial declaration of a large marine protected area (MPA)
in 2012, GSGSSI consulted scientists and stakeholders and in January
2013 announced an enhanced suite of measures, strengthening the
extensive environmental protection already implemented by the existing
MPA (over 1,000,000km<Sup>2</Sup>
area).</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102831000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/text/131028w0001.htm#13102831000135">These
additional protection measures, which were developed in accordance with
guidelines from the International Union for the Conservation of Nature
(IUCN), incorporate an innovative combination of spatial and temporal
closures. Within the MPA, 92% of the seafloor is protected from any
form of bottom fishing, including all of the seafloor within 12 miles
of the island of South Georgia. A seasonal closure of the krill fishery
prevents competition between the fishery and the abundant krill-eating
predators, for example penguins 
<?notus-xml column=334?>and seals. This novel approach to marine protection provides an
excellent model for the implementation of MPAs in other parts of the
world.</hs_Para>

Simmonds:</Member></B> Somalia has come a long way in a short time. In
May, the UK jointly hosted a second Somalia Conference with the Federal
Government of Somalia. This generated further international support for
the Somalian Federal Government's plans for the armed forces, police,
rebuilding the judiciary, and public financial management. The Somali
President set out his plan for political reconciliation and roadmap to
elections in 2016; and international partners pledged some $350 million
(around £216 million) in new financial support aligned to these
plans. In September, a further conference in Brussels brought together
Somalia and the international community to agree a 'New Deal Compact',
a plan for the international community to support the Government of
Somalia in rebuilding the country. This sustained international
support, in which the UK continues to play a leading role, has produced
real gains on the ground, including the agreement signed between the
Federal Government and the Interim Juba Administration in the South of
Somalia. However the situation remains fragile. Al Shabaab remains
active, and it is important that the Somali National Forces and African
Union Mission in Somalia take the fight to Al Shabaab to create the
space for political reconciliation. We are working closely with the
Federal Government of Somalia to maintain international support for
that and their wider
objectives.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13102831000024" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/text/131028w0001.htm#13102831000024">Syria</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13102831000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/text/131028w0001.htm#13102831000138"><B><Member PimsId="385" UID="13102831000595" xid="1217" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/text/131028w0001.htm#13102831000595">Ms

are required to demonstrate that they have sufficient funds available
to meet their living costs while they are in the UK. The precise
amounts that they must have available are set out in the Immigration
Rules. Where the funds are in one or more foreign currencies, the
applicant must have the specified level of funds when converted to
pound sterling using the spot exchange rate which appears on
www.oanda.com for the 28-day period up to the date of application.
Students may therefore check for themselves whether their funds are
sufficient to meet the visa requirements, taking into account daily

police initiative which will make the firearms licensing process far
more efficient and may have cost benefits. Once the system has been

Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy is recognised by the National

not every person acquitted of an offence is entitled to be compensated,

language used in declining an application to pay compensation does not
cast doubt on the innocence of the applicant, the presumption of
innocence is respected. We do not believe that there is any conflict
between this view and clause 143 of the Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime

for compensation does not require the applicant to demonstrate his or
her innocence. It focuses on the new fact which led the conviction to
be quashed, and whether this new fact shows conclusively that there was

The figures given in the table relate to persons for whom these
offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.
When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, it is
the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same
disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is
the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most
severe.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left"><Sup>3</Sup>
Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate
and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have
been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the

ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are
taken into account when those data are

The Court of Protection deals with some of the most vulnerable people
in society and it is responsible for making decisions about the
personal health, finance and welfare on behalf of people who do not
have the mental capacity to decide for themselves. It can also 
<?notus-xml column=358?>appoint deputies to act on behalf of people who are unable to make

under Part VII of the Mental Health Act 1983, if a sole property owner
lost mental capacity and had not made an Enduring Power of Attorney, an
application would have been made to the Court to appoint a 'receiver'
to lawfully administer the individual's property and affairs. The Court
would listen to all the necessary representations before making the
decision in the best interest of a person who lacks capacity. Receivers
could be members of the individual's family or legal
professionals.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13102832000164" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131028/text/131028w0002.htm#13102832000164">If,
however, the property was subject to a legal charge, most mortgage
deeds include the power for the lender to appoint a receiver under the
Law of Property Act 1925. The powers of a receiver appointed
under this Act extend only to the property over which the legal charge
was made and not to the individual who is the borrower. On 1 October
2007, the Mental Capacity Act 2005 was implemented, repealing Part VII
of the Mental Health Act 1983 and creating a new jurisdiction for the
Court of Protection, as well as introducing 'deputies'—the new
name for receivers. If a similar situation arose today, an application
would be made to the Court under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, to
appoint a

Legal Complaints (OLC) undertook a review of its scheme rules and

making their recommendation, the OLC considered their experience of
complaints. They found that existing time limits were very restrictive

a result, changes to the scheme rules, including extending time limits,
were recommended by the OLC and approved by the Legal Services Board
(LSB) and Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor in line with the Legal
Services Act 2007 requirements is required to approve changes made
under section 136 (charges payable by respondents) only. The LSB are

Subtracting the number of gas meters from the number of electricity
meters produces a broad estimate of the number of homes that do not
have access to the gas network. It should be noted that these estimates
will overestimate the number of homes due to some homes having more
than one electricity meter, and also that the statistics may include

July 2013, the reduction in resource and capital grants for the
national museums sponsored by the Department for Culture, Media and
Sport was limited to 5% in 2015-16. In addition, a package of
operational and financial freedoms has been granted to national museums
and galleries which will help them act more strategically, increase
revenues from their commercial operations and attract more
philanthropic donations. In the light of this settlement, the Science
Museum Group confirmed that all of its museums will remain

licences in force below the level of UK (except in Guernsey, Jersey and
the Isle of Man for which exact figures are held). However, the BBC
receives a monthly report which lists licences in force excluding
accommodation for residential care concessionary licences. The total
licences in force figure (excluding the Channel Islands and the Isle of

British isles by region, giving an approximation of licences in force

There are no plans to reopen the nine SDVCs closed as a result of the
court closures announced in 2010. The majority of domestic violence
cases from these closed courts were moved to other existing SDVC
schemes. Three new SDVCs were planned to deal with work from SDVCs that
closed after the 2010 consultation and where there was not an
accredited SDVC to which the work could move. One of these has already
been accredited.</hs_Para>
