HMRC, so that it will be collecting £10 billion a
year more from its compliance activities by 2015-16 than it was at the

fell under the previous Government; under this Government there will be

Phillips of Sudbury (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, at a time when decent
Brits are struggling to pay their full taxes, is it not wholly
counterproductive that many of our richest citizens and companies are
evading and avoiding tens of billions of pounds in taxation? According
to the HMRC calculation, every extra pound spent on enforcement
resources yields £10 to £30. Although the statistics are
encouraging, surely we should be doing yet more to avoid the citizen
disenchantment that is currently

I would remind him that this Government reinvested an additional
£917 million in compliance activities in the 2010 spending
round. They added another £77 million in last year’s
Autumn Statement. Therefore, we have a track record of providing HMRC
with additional funding, should it come forward with proposals that
result in additional tax yield. It is not inconceivable that HMRC might
come forward with such proposals in respect of this year’s

against the multinationals? We all recognise that that is a challenging
nut to crack and needs international
co-operation. Internal

Newby:</Member></B> I think the decision taken by Ministers to give an
additional £1 billion for compliance activities was pretty
clear. Many of the problems that we see with multinationals paying less
tax than would appear appropriate are international by nature. That is
why we have put a lot of resources into the OECD. We put another
£400,000 into the work that it is doing following the G20 summit
earlier this year. There is a determination across the international
community, to a degree that has not been apparent before, that
companies cannot get away with avoiding taxes. This must be dealt with
internationally, and that is what we are promoting

Amazon, then it was Philip Green and Irvine Laidlaw; one after the

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, leaving aside the fact that, sadly, I
have not been a Minister for three years, the question of closing tax
loopholes and dealing with companies that are international by their
nature is an international problem. The level of activity now being
undertaken via the OECD is on a scale that we have not seen for a
generation. Some 15 work streams are currently under way, looking at
different aspects of this problem, with a two-year deadline to resolve
them. If it were possible to legislate in one country and deal with all
these issues, not only we but the US, Germany, France and other
countries that find themselves in the same boat would have done it. You
cannot operate against multinationals on a domestic basis alone; it
must be done internationally. That is what we are doing, and we are
putting huge effort and impetus into that
work.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-30?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_30_PT_1/19155E1512B0C6EB051983B5CE40B350F0238E67" __version__="1.11"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 30 October 2013">Wednesday,

considered reply. Perhaps I may illustrate my point. Recently, the
Chancellor returned from China, pleased that he had raised £13
billion to build the new nuclear power station so desperately needed
for our 
<?notus-xml column=1578?>energy security. Is it not paradoxical that over the past six years our
net contribution to the EU, which is substantially used for
infrastructure, has been over £50 billion? That is enough to
build at least three nuclear power stations. How is it that we can find
the money to build other people’s infrastructure but not our

relationship with the Union. He is ignoring the very substantial
economic benefits that we enjoy through increased internal trade via
the single market, increased external trade via, for example, the
recently concluded EU-Canada trade agreement, and increased investment
in the UK by companies such as Nissan. He is also ignoring the

that we incurred some time ago was dealing with a war in the Balkans,
which cost this country more than £1 billion. Since
the Balkan wars finished, Croatia has joined the EU and other Balkan
states will join. We will not fight other Balkan wars. That does not

Secretary to the Treasury, he introduced cash limits. At the moment,

significant change in ownership, but one would hope that
even vultures will be able to see that the Co-op’s USP is its
particular ethical stance. Its strength appears to me, at least, to be
very much in that direction. So for the development of the Co-op, one
would hope that they would see continuation of those traits being in
their own interests, as well as those of anybody else. Of course, there
are other mutuals that the discerning customer can put their money
with; the Nationwide is very successful, as are other building
societies. We must be clear on the difference between “for
profit” and “ethical”. I would not want to brand

Davies of Oldham (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the

one of the few which did not go to the Government and to the taxpayer

proposing to do about increasing 
<?notus-xml column=1583?>bank competition? Some 55% of the British population have never switched
their accounts. The degree of switching and of competitive banking is
low. Large banks owe their pre-eminence to historical development and
being early in the field. Surely the Minister is going to take
advantage of the Financial Services (Banking Reform) Bill to enact some
of the proposals from the banking commission, chaired by Andrew Tyrie
MP, and also amendments being tabled by the Labour Opposition to
increase competition in the banking sector, which it sorely

Newby:</Member></B> My Lords, the banking Bill incorporates many of the
proposals of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards. On
switching, a new seven-day switching service was introduced last month.
In its first month, there has been an 11% increase compared with the
previous year in the number of people who switched their bank accounts.
One would expect that number to increase as the service becomes better
known. This year the big change in terms of new entrants to the market
is that the regulators have greatly reduced the time that it takes to
become a new bank and greatly reduced the amount of money it takes to
establish a new bank. Those are key drivers for getting new competitors
into the

complementary to the weekly meetings that the Secretary of State has

that mean the inevitable merger of smaller GP practices? Can the noble
Earl spell out the Government’s intentions? In the Statement, we
are told that there is to be seven-day access to GP surgeries
throughout north-west London. Can the noble Earl confirm that that

now turn to the noble Earl’s announcement about Charing Cross

report of the Independent Reconfiguration Panel says that the future of
the proposed local hospitals at Ealing and Charing Cross, and the final
decision about what might best be provided from each location must be
the subject of a specific programme of work which should address the
needs for in-patient services for the vulnerable and frail elderly, and
that its outcome would determine whether there is a need for further
consultation. In his Statement, the noble Earl has said that, whatever
the outcome of that further work, Ministers have decided that Ealing
and Charing Cross hospitals should continue to offer an A&amp;E
service, even if it is a “different shape or size” to
that currently offered. Can the noble Earl spell out what, exactly is

hospitals in London. I was surprised that the noble Earl made no
mention of Lewisham Hospital. The victory won by the people of Lewisham
in the Court of Appeal yesterday will give hope to patients everywhere.
Back in the summer, the Opposition explicitly warned the Secretary of
State to accept the first court ruling. Instead, he ploughed on with a
hopeless case, wasting taxpayers’ money in a cavalier fashion.
Will the noble Earl confirm that there will be no further appeal to the
Supreme Court? Will he give the people of Lewisham and the staff who
work in Lewisham Hospital a commitment that their accident and
emergency and maternity units will be protected in the long term? Given
that the Lewisham clinical commissioning group opposed those changes,
what does it say about the assurances that he gave during the passage
of the Health and Social Care Act 2012 that the whole

noble Earl tabled an amendment to the Care Bill only a few days ago,
which he described as making a small change, so he will of course know
that the Government have sought, very rapidly and very quietly, to
change the law so that what happened in Lewisham cannot happen again.
My interpretation of that amendment is that in the future there is a
risk of services being shut down without the agreement of local people,
without extensive consultation and without agreement from local
commissioners. We, on this side of the House, support reconfiguration
of health services when supported by the clinical evidence, but it must
be on the basis of a requirement to go through a properly defined and
structured reconfiguration process with extensive consultation with the
local
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000091" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000091">From<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:01:31"></hs_TimeCode>

which I do, of course, 
<?notus-xml column=1589?>readily acknowledge. The key to these
recommendations is twofold. First, the way investment will be deployed
will mean that we shall have centres of excellence in emergency care
which will copy, in some respects, the way that stroke and trauma care
has been centralised across London. This was controversial at the time
but is now acclaimed by clinicians and, I think, politicians alike as
proving to save hundreds of lives every year. There will be more
critical care consultants on duty 24/7; more obstetric consultants on
duty 24/7 on labour wards; consultants in other specialities, such as
paediatrics, on duty between 12 and 16 hours a day, seven days a week;
more trained and experienced emergency doctors on site 24/7 in A&amp;E
departments; and more investment in mental health, so that psychiatric
liaison services can better co-ordinate care for vulnerable mentally
ill people. In general, we will have all nine of the hospitals
concerned across north-west London with urgent care centres open

local commissioners and NHS England to work out which surgeries they
should be<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:04:37"></hs_TimeCode>. Eight
hundred additional posts will be created to improve out-of-hospital

with that entirely. However, it also says that while the changes to

Hanham (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, may I say how glad I am to hear
that the proposals have support from all the clinicians and the CCGs?
The noble Lord will know that I was chairman at St Mary’s
Hospital when the Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust was formed
—and it was formed on the basis of full support from clinicians
and the local community. The local community is not always at one with
change, so I shall ask the noble Lord a couple of questions. First,
this is not a short programme. These proposals will not take five
minutes to implement. Most of the changes in the health service over
recent years have taken an enormous amount of time, and it would be
fair to say that the Imperial Trust, which includes Charing Cross, has
probably only just completed its previous reorganisation, and now it is
being reorganised again. The first question is: what is the proposed
timescale?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000101" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000101">Secondly,
the noble Lord mentioned consultation, and may I say that it is
absolutely vital that the local community be brought along with this?
Otherwise, it will take even longer. Thirdly, there is an expectation
that there will be a lot of new consultant and other medical posts. I
am aware that A&amp;E is not flush with clinicians taking up the
specialty, so may I ask what encouragement is being given, by the
colleges in particular, 
<?notus-xml column=1591?>to ensure that there will be enough staff available
to deal with the new services? Finally, may I say how glad I
am that St Mary’s has figured again in trauma
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:12:27"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000102"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13103058000213" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000213">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My noble friend, with her experience, asks some very
pertinent questions. On the question of timescale, we believe that it
will take between three and five years for the proposals to be actioned
to their fullest extent. It will be necessary to take that kind of
time. Some elements can happen relatively quickly, but my noble friend
is absolutely right that there are important workforce issues to be
taken into account. Indeed, one of the IRP recommendations was that the
NHS should review its workforce programme and ensure that it has the
means in place to deliver what is required. I am sure that in working
through the proposals, local commissioners, as well as NHS England,
will need to satisfy themselves on that point—not least with
regard to the new posts to be created in the community, but also in
terms of accident and emergency consultants in the A&amp;E departments
of the relevant
trusts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:13:55"></hs_TimeCode>. On local
communities, again I agree with my noble friend. As the <I>Shaping a
Healthier Future</I> proposals are developed by the clinical
commissioners, it will be vital that any further proposals are
consulted on locally, and that there is real buy-in from patient groups
and the public
generally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:14:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000103"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:14:16"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Winston" PimsId="4649" UID="13103058000214" xid="1499" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000214">Lord
Winston (Lab):</Member></B> I declare an interest as a member of
Imperial College London and a practitioner who has been a consultant in
north London for a long time. It is right that the financial shortfall
means that there has to be considerable reconfiguration. In this case
that is a move in the right direction. However, it raises a number of
questions to which I would be very grateful if the Minister would
respond. One is that if you close casualty you affect the training of
surgical trainees. Do the Government have a view on that
issue?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103058000104" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000104">The
Minister also referred to obstetrics in west London. As he
will almost certainly know, the neonatal paediatrics department at one
of the best obstetric hospitals in the country—Queen
Charlotte’s, based at Hammersmith Hospital—has always
been somewhat threatened. Is that secure, given that one of the issues
in north-west London is undoubtedly that of duplication in many
hospitals, which is expensive? Does the Minister feel that this is the
only reconfiguration that will be required, given the amount of
duplication that there
is<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:15:48"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000105"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13103058000215" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000215">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> To answer the last point, it is clear from the IRP
report that its authors believe that this is a comprehensive set of
proposals which will stand the test of time in north-west London. It is
a very thorough set of proposals which takes into account every aspect
of healthcare provision. On maternity and paediatrics, I can tell the
noble Lord that under these proposals there will be more obstetric
consultants on duty 24/7 in labour wards. As he will know
better than anyone, that, of course, is designed to reduce the number
of complications during birth and to ensure one-to-one midwifery care
for women during labour. Consultants in other specialties such as
paediatrics will be on duty, as I mentioned, for 12 to 16 hours a day,
seven days a week, providing much better cover than at
present.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=1592?><hs_para UID="13103058000106" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000106">It
was very striking in the IRP report that the first point made by the
noble Lord, Lord Winston, did not elude the panel. The panel concluded
that the pragmatic and explicit approach used by the NHS reflected
the clarity of the aim to improve quality outcomes by
implementing life-saving standards through the establishment of major
hospitals. The report referred to the economic realities of the NHS and
the urgency of making progress in the light of known risks to the
sustainability of emergency services such as the abilities of staff,
A&amp;E and emergency surgery rotas, and the desire to minimise the
negative impact on access of concentrating services. That was
shorthand—as the noble Lord will see if he reads the rest of the
report—for saying that the desirability of concentrating
expertise in centres of excellence is a clear imperative for the
quality of care that patients receive. As regards surgical experience,
I think that if my noble friend Lord Ribeiro were here, he would
confirm<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:18:02"></hs_TimeCode> that
that is absolutely the direction of travel, but that we must ensure
that surgical expertise is built on a sufficient number of hours and
cases for the quality of care to be maintained. That is exactly what
underlies this whole set of
proposals<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000107"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Walton of Detchant" PimsId="4515" UID="13103058000216" xid="1485" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000216">Lord
Walton of Detchant (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, since the relevant
professional bodies, not least the British Medical Association, have
decided that they wish to support a move towards the provision of all
acute and relevant services in the NHS for a full seven-day period, it
is inevitable that there will be major reconfiguration of services not
just in north-west London but in many other parts of the country. This
will involve the concentration of specialist services in fewer
hospitals and could even result in the closure of some smaller
hospitals. However, that is not immediately relevant. The point I will
make is that it is good to know that the clinical commissioning groups
and the local hospital trusts have all supported this proposed
reconfiguration.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103058000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000108">However, I must ask the
Minister a couple of questions. First, is he satisfied that the five
A&amp;E departments into which all accident and emergency services are
to be concentrated, with four others closing, have the capacity to
provide facilities for all the relevant staff and to deal with the
increased number of patients who will go through those five hospitals?
That is point number one, which is
crucial.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000109">Secondly,
is the Minister satisfied that this concentration of services, with the
new 800 posts in the community to which he referred, can be carried out
within the existing financial constraints? Have these changes been
costed? As the Minister knows, under the so-called Nicholson challenge,
the NHS is required to make substantial savings across the country over
the next year or so, and it is crucial that he can reassure the House
that the necessary money will be available to provide this
reconfiguration, which is clearly in the best interests of patients and
their
communities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:20:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:20:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13103058000217" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000217">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord raises the important
question of capacity. The key point is that none of these changes will
be implemented until such time as commissioners and the relevant
providers are satisfied that the necessary capacity exists. That is a
key point. Secondly, on the costing and the financial
aspects of the proposals, the way in which we will
be 
<?notus-xml column=1593?>able to spend more money on front-line care and
better-quality facilities is by spending less on duplicated facilities,
underperforming services, and badly designed and out-of-date buildings,
which cost a lot to maintain. Therefore, as part of this package, there
will be new custom-built hospitals at Ealing and Charing Cross, costing
about £80 million each, designed to deliver the specific
services needed in those respective communities. That will be part of
the way in which the money released will be invested for the betterment
of patients in the area over future
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:21:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000111"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Barker" PimsId="3880" UID="13103058000218" xid="1067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000218">Baroness
Barker (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the most important part of this
Statement is the part stating that none of these changes will come into
effect until NHS England is convinced that the necessary primary and
community services are in place. How will that be determined by NHS
England? Secondly, who will be responsible for the integrated
commissioning of community and primary services to bring about the
necessary preventive services on which this reconfiguration is
based<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:22:37"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000112"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13103058000219" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000219">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> Largely, the judgment by NHS England will be made by
local area teams—but not in isolation. It has to be a
collaborative exercise, which is my overall answer to my noble
friend’s second question. The successful integration of services
must depend on close collaboration between the different constituent
parts of the NHS but also with adult social care and local authorities.
It is striking that already we are seeing this happening in north-west
London, as we are in many other parts of the country. For the system to
work as we want it to, all the constituent parts need to be effective
and efficient. The integration of services, which is one example of how
the NHS can become more productive in the future, as well as more
clinically effective for patients, is an essential way of ensuring that
we have a sustainable NHS in the
future<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:23:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000113"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kennedy of Southwark" PimsId="5762" UID="13103058000220" xid="2042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000220">Lord

What lessons have been learnt by the noble Earl and his ministerial
team that they can apply to what is going on in north-west London? We
are all aware that the Minister has never visited Lewisham hospital;

Howe:</Member></B> I can certainly find out the answer to that last
question. As regards the appeal, we have only just received the
judgment, as the noble Lord will know. But that is only the outline
judgment. We have not received the full text. It is important that we
read that and inwardly digest it before we finally decide on the way
forward. The lessons of Lewisham are very clear. I confirm that we
shall not be legislating around Lewisham and the recent provisions in
the Care Bill were not retrospective, as the noble Lord is aware. I
have not personally visited Lewisham, which is clearly an omission that
I should at some point rectify, but it 
<?notus-xml column=1594?>is important for me to put on the record that the
concerns expressed by the people of Lewisham are, and have always been,
entirely understandable. Ministers greatly respect the wish of local
residents to see their hospital thriving, as it always has in the past.
Nevertheless, as I said earlier, Lewisham and Greenwich now have a
challenge. There is a financial issue that needs to be addressed and I
hope that commissioners and providers, acting together, can do that
successfully over the months
ahead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:26:21"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000115"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Masham of Ilton" PimsId="1733" UID="13103058000222" xid="1341" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000222">Baroness

Howe:</Member></B> I do not think that it is appropriate to talk about
downgrading in this case. However, it is appropriate to talk about
changing the way in which services are delivered to the local
population. In the case of two hospitals, we are seeing fully fledged
A&amp;E departments becoming 24/7 urgent care centres. That means that
the most serious A&amp;E cases, such as trauma and cardiovascular
emergencies, will be taken to centres of excellence where patients will
have a much higher chance of survival. That is a pattern that we are
seeing throughout the NHS and one that has been proved to be successful
and in the interests of patients. On ambulances services, we are
already seeing in London, for example with stroke care, ambulances
taking patients to centres of excellence for stroke care. Eight of
these centres now exist compared to 32 some years ago. That means
longer journeys in an ambulance but also much higher survival rates for
the patients. I do not think that we should look on the kind of
reconfiguration that I have described in a negative way. On the
contrary, the whole thrust of these proposals is to improve the quality
of care for
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:28:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103058000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000117"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Rea" PimsId="321" UID="13103058000224" xid="1774" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103058000224">Lord

Future proposals were designed by local clinicians in consultation with
their patients. It was not a prescription dreamt up in Whitehall. We
are very clear that the local NHS should continue to feel local

Inglewood (Con):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, we speak at a moment
of high drama in the politico-media world. Lord Justice Richards,
sitting with Mr Justice Sales, earlier today dismissed
PressBoF’s application for a judicial review of the Privy
Council’s decision to reject its charter on press
self-regulation, and will dismiss its application for an injunction on
the Privy Council’s sealing of the alternative all-party charter
later
today.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000003">Barring
any attempts by PressBoF to challenge this decision at the Court of
Appeal, I believe that, as things stand, the Privy Council is still due
to meet to seal the royal charter on the self-regulation of the press
later this afternoon. I dare say that historians of the media will one
day find it ironic that at the same time this House met to debate media
convergence, a phenomenon which raises the question: for how much
longer will the press truly require its own discrete self-regulatory
arrangements at all as distinct from those which may yet come to be
established in the future, which will have a wider focus and include
forms of news media available online, in text, audio or indeed
audio-visual form, with which the activities of what we now know as
newspapers may have seamlessly merged? It is a coincidence of events
that must generate at least a little Schadenfreude.</hs_para>

recently, separate media industries were actually distinct. They were
easily distinguishable by the way in which they delivered their
content; for example, newspaper businesses were newspaper businesses to
a great extent because their content reached us on 
<?notus-xml column=1596?>large sheets of thin paper rather than over the spectrum or through the
flickering light of a projector at the cinema. Media convergence,
however, has changed all this. Alongside their individual traditional
delivery mechanisms, content providers increasingly digitise their
material and distribute it through the use of internet protocol, known
as IP. Conveyed by IP, content, which has been reduced down to packets
of data, can be assembled as text, image, video, sound or however else
technology permits. This occurs on a growing range of devices, both
fixed and mobile.</hs_para>

stimulated media providers of all kinds into a search for new ways of
delivering their content, many of which have been straightforwardly
borrowed from industries they each used to consider neighbours. This
has blurred the boundaries between them. These experiments, in turn,
have given audiences all kinds of ways to consume virtually any
content, at any time, anywhere and on any device. In some instances,
the impact of this revolution is far-reaching and often entirely
positive, not just for the regulation of content standards, but also
for content creation and competition. Barriers of all kinds are
dissolving<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:34:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000006">The
impact of all this may not be fully felt at once, or even for some
time, across the whole population. A recurring theme of our
deliberations in this inquiry was the need, therefore, for haste rather
than panic. As they say, we were looking for an evolutionary, rather
than a revolutionary response. However, equally clear was that some
thinking, some preparation and, to some extent, action, is required now
to ensure that the evolutionary path is smooth and that we do not allow
the regulatory architecture for the media as a whole to become entirely
mismatched with the technological and commercial landscape which it
oversees. I hope that our report and my remarks will make it clear
why<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:35:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

submitted recommendations under three main headings. First, content
standards; secondly, content creation and thirdly, competition. I
should like to take each briefly in
turn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:35:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103065000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000008">On content standards,
which occupied us the most, it is worth saying that this
country’s content standards framework has to date proven
remarkably resilient. However, we found that the confidence and trust
which the public have grown to enjoy in it will come under increasing
pressure in two areas in particular. First, there is news content.
Newspapers are not just printed, but are online and they carry video
packages with the look and feel of traditional television. Broadcasters
publish websites, including text-based articles, similar to online and
print. The scheduled news programmes are still broadcast, but are also
available on demand, both on digital channels and on a variety of
websites. It is tremendously exciting, but potentially rather confusing
because the regulatory framework has been left
behind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:36:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103065000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000009">Broadcast news is
required to adhere to the broadcasting code, with its full range of
protections relating to accuracy and fairness, as well as an obligation
to uphold due impartiality. While the emerging press regulator, with
oversight of participating newspapers and websites, may well include
some of these protections in its code, it will certainly not include an
obligation to uphold due impartiality. It bears saying that this is a 
<?notus-xml column=1597?>good thing. The abiding difference between the balanced, impartial news
provided by the broadcasters, and the vigorous, partisan news provided
by the press, has helped to create a beneficial tension and a valuable
mixed ecology. Nevertheless, the impact of convergence means that the
providers of the one will become increasingly difficult to distinguish
from the other. The binary distinction between impartial and partisan
news will no longer be mirrored in the difference between
the news which UK audiences happen to watch and the news
which they happen to
read<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:37:58"></hs_TimeCode>. In order
to ensure that UK citizens continue to be able to identify and have
confidence in the provision of impartial news coverage, and that they
can identify and bring accurate expectations to partisan content, these
blurred lines should be tidied
up<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:38:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000010">The
second area that will come under increasing pressure is what we might
call non-news, audio-visual content—sometimes known as TV and
TV-like content. Perhaps the sharpest example of this pressure point
can be seen in the content now available to the public through
internet-connected televisions. On these, regulated and unregulated
content, licensed and unlicensed services, sit side by side on one
device. Increasingly, the public will be able to switch seamlessly
between them. As the European Commission says in its Green Paper,
<I>Preparing for a Fully Converged Audiovisual World: Growth, Creation
and Values</I>, from the consumer’s point of view, the
difference between linear and non-linear services might blur. Providers
under no obligation to observe the watershed, for example, are
increasingly only one press of the button away from those that do. The
clues which the public might have used to sense that they are entering
a different environment, in which different standards are to be
expected and to be found, are disappearing. With that comes the risk
that regulators will no longer be able to be sure that the public can
confidently make sensible decisions about what is suitable for them and
their
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:39:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103065000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000011">I turn now to our
recommendations on content standards and want briefly to make one
preliminary point. During the inquiry, we received a number of
thoughtful proposals for a complete overhaul of the regulatory
framework. These aimed for a new, logically coherent system. While some
of the thinking that had gone into the proposals was impressive, we
felt that they did not account for one or two important points. For
example, the pace of media convergence is contested, and it was put to
us repeatedly during the course of the inquiry that traditional
services such as linear broadcast television remain hugely popular and
resilient. What is more, there are very marked generational differences
in the ways that younger groups are using media compared with their
older peers. This meant, we felt, that it would not be right, in
considering reforms of the content standards framework, to try to set a
course for the promised land. Rather, we should look more simply for a
framework that enables audiences to make good decisions in the
circumstances of the time about the content which suits them and their
families. The framework will almost certainly need updating from time
to time to the extent that it fails to achieve this, and fails by
extension to earn or deserve their trust. To that end, we made two
recommendations 
<?notus-xml column=1598?>which could and should be adopted in the short term, and we postulated
on a basis, one that is entirely up for debate, around which further
change might occur in the medium to longer
term<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:40:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103065000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000012">First, in the shorter
term, broadcast licences should be amended to ensure that standards
similar to those set out in the Ofcom broadcasting code, amended for
the relevant environment, would apply to any service using the same
channel name or brand as a licensed broadcast service. It is at present
an anomaly that the BBC, to give an example, is required to uphold the
broadcasting code when it broadcasts, but not when it makes content
available through the iPlayer, and especially in light of the
director-general’s recent announcements about online
commissions, we feel that this is an important
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>. Secondly,
there is a case for positively encouraging other non-broadcast
providers to join the framework in return for some form of public
recognition or kitemark. Were such an opportunity to be provided, I
suspect that some of them would seize it, not least for their own
commercial advantage but equally so that the UK public could build
accurate expectations of the standards and character of their
products<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:41:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103065000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000013">We also made a number
of recommendations as regards the content standards framework that
focus on the medium to long term, but I do not propose to rehearse the
detail of these. In a nutshell, we recommend a slight reconfiguration
of the regulatory framework involving the establishment of four
different approaches to content standards across four clearly defined
types of content. The first one is public service broadcasters, the
second one would be non-public-service broadcast news providers, the
third would be non-news television and television-like content, and the
fourth would be the open internet. Some of the impact of this
reconfiguration might seem to be a bit striking at first blush. For
example, no longer would broadcasters other than public service
broadcasters be required to uphold an obligation to due impartiality.
In place of the watershed, a standard system of age-based
classification would be adopted for TV and TV-like services, providing
the public with useful information to take into account in making their
own decisions about what they and their family should look at. Ofcom
would be given a new proactive role with regard to the content
available to UK citizens over the open internet, with a duty to consult
on and publish UK citizens’ expectations of the responsibilities
of digital intermediaries, and to monitor performance against those
expectations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:43:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103065000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000014">While we believe that
these recommendations point in the right direction, they are entirely
up for debate, one that we would welcome and thoroughly encourage. The
Government’s response to our report was, as I said at the time,
disappointingly thin—albeit that that is probably better than
being thick. They deferred the substance of any response to our report
to what was at the time a forthcoming policy paper called,
<I>Connectivity, Content and Consumers: Britain’s Digital
Platform for Growth</I>. However, the Government appear to have avoided
the major questions, saying that they will look to industry and
regulators to provide clarity on the right approach to content
standards and regulation in the digital world. But because we believe
that what is required is a reconfiguration of the framework around the
media as a whole, there is an important and 
<?notus-xml column=1599?>necessary role for the Government in setting out a view and leading
debates that can be orchestrated sensibly only from that particular
podium. For example, there are matters of principle: should we,
generally speaking, adopt a more libertarian approach in which the
public are expected to make their own choices about which
media and content to use, informed by appropriate information, or
should there be a more paternalistic approach in which regulators
impose certain standards and help make those choices on behalf of the
public? As our recommendations show, our report tends to lean towards
the former over the latter. However, where the line is drawn is an
important matter for genuine and legitimate
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000015">Secondly,
there are matters of process. How can we bring about evolutionary
change to a system of regulation which is cemented in statute, and
which in recent years has been subject to a slow cycle of
change—10-yearly or thereabouts—imposed by the
parliamentary timetable as much as anything else? In our report we
propose a new approach, including the use of the super-affirmative
procedure. We believe that this would avoid the “stop/go”
approach, and provide the legislative mechanism to ensure smoother
evolutionary change in an era when time for primary legislation is
allocated elsewhere. In summary, I urge the Government and the industry
to read carefully the thinking behind our recommendations on content
standards, and to engage properly with this important set of
debates.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000016">I now
turn briefly to the two remaining aspects of our report, which address
content creation and competition. On content creation, convergence has
made it possible for new investors to reach audiences outside the
traditional broadcast environment. Your Lordships will be aware that my
noble friend Lord Dobbs recently had a great hit on Netflix, entirely
funded by that enterprise. Our congratulations go to him. However,
investment in content from these new entrants remains dwarfed by the
investment from the five public service broadcasters and their spin-off
channels, which still represent something like 90% of UK spend on
first-run, originated output. This seems very likely to remain the case
for some time to come. In that light, it is important to recognise that
the ability of the public service broadcasters to continue investing in
content depends on their ability to reach large audiences in this
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000017">We
therefore recommend that the Government consider the implications of
changes in the way that public service content will be discovered and
accessed by viewers on new connected TVs and other converged devices
and, specifically, what interventions on prominence and “must
carry online” obligations may be appropriate and possible in
non-linear environments. In our view, as far as possible the on-demand
services offered by public service broadcasters should achieve due
prominence on any relevant home screen or guide which directs users to
content.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000018">Having
said that, the way that the public access content is almost inevitably
going to change, and the range of brands they choose to consume is
likely to widen. Against that background, convergence can be seen to
raise some very important general questions about public investment in
content creation. As audiences 
<?notus-xml column=1600?>continue to fragment and models for funding content
creation adapt, exactly how public service broadcasting is provided, by
whom, and the contestable process of allocating public money to pay for
it, are all matters which deserve debate. The issue again is that these
questions must be considered from a higher vantage point, and in a
manner which is more holistic—to use a word I
dislike—than is currently the
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000019">To date,
decisions about each type of public service broadcaster—the BBC,
Channel 3, Channel 4 and Channel 5—have largely been made
independently of each other. In future, given the paramount importance
of sustainable and sensible funding in order to safeguard public
service broadcasting, we think that it is crucial for its future to be
considered in the round by the Government. However the detail may be
configured, a stable and sustainable future is required for the system
as a whole, not just for each player within that
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000020">We
believe that the Government would be well advised to get ahead of the
curve, rather than waiting for difficulties to arise. Therefore we
recommend that as preparation for, and in advance of, the next BBC
charter review, the Government consider fundamental strategic questions
surrounding the public service broadcasting system as an interconnected
whole, and the potential impact on it of convergence. For example, what
is the right scale and scope of PSB? What purposes should it serve? How
can it best be sustained in a converged
world?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000021">On
matters relating to competition, it is equally clear that convergence
has sharpened long-standing debates over Ofcom’s ability to
promote competition across media markets. While we did not have the
time to carry out a comprehensive review of broadcasting competition
powers, it was clear from the evidence we received that clarification
is required of Ofcom’s existing ex ante competition powers for
the audio-visual sector. The aim of such clarification should be to
enable Ofcom to take effective action where necessary, but also to
ensure a high hurdle before any ex ante approach can be adopted. It is
important for there to be clarity for all those who might be
affected.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000022">In

am one of those who believe that the invention of the internet may well
turn out to be more important in human history than the invention of
printing. One known unknown is that we cannot predict the nature of the
change that is coming about, any more than people could have forecast
that one of the prime uses of mobile phones would be text messaging.
One known, however, is that it will all happen very fast. The noble
Lord, Lord Inglewood, was right to draw attention to the importance of
flexibility in the Government’s response. For that reason, the
super-affirmative procedure is probably the best way forward from a
legislative point of view. I add a further suggestion: it would be
useful if the next communications Act did not try to go into too much
detail. After all, we have got by in public service broadcasting for a
very long time with the simple words, “inform, educate and
entertain”. If we left legislation giving us general objectives
and then left it to regulatory authorities to use common sense in
applying those in the circumstances of the time, the legislation would
stand the test of time rather

Communications Act 2003, to which reference has already been made, did

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:52:49"></hs_TimeCode> internet was
felt then to be different from broadcasting, in that it was a pull down
rather than a push out medium. Therefore, both libertarians and others
united in thinking that we did not need to regulate the internet. My
sense is that that is not the public feeling today; we most certainly
do need to regulate it. At a minimum, we all agree that we should not
allow child pornography on the internet, or incitement and aid to
terrorism. However, if we are able to do it for those two subjects, we
could do it for a whole range of others, so the decision is about
whether we want to regulate, not whether we are inhibited by the
technology from doing so at

would like to concentrate mainly on the main theme of the report,
content standards. We would all concede that the main argument for
public service broadcasting has lost two of its main pillars of
support; scarcity of frequencies does not now apply. But as Professor
Tommaso Valletti told the committee during the inquiry, the economic
argument has gone, but the BBC is the envy of the
world—“Why break it?”. That is very much my
feeling. It could also be said that PVRs have reduced the power of
programme scheduling to create high-quality programmes and get a large
audience for them. Some 45 years ago, I presented a political programme
on television which secured a somewhat larger audience than would
normally be expected for political programmes. I would like to think
that it was the intrinsic quality of the programme; realistically, I
think that it had a lot more to do with the fact that it was sandwiched
between “News at  
<?notus-xml column=1602?>Ten” and “New York Police Department”, and remote

service broadcasting is worth preserving and, indeed, encouraging
outwith the traditional sector. How can we do that? One way is charging
for spectrum. The report is ambivalent on whether we should do this,
but draws attention to its difficulty. It would remove more funds from
public service broadcasters which could otherwise be concentrated on
programming. I firmly think that there should be no charge for spectrum
for public service broadcasters. That would provide an incentive for
more people to provide public service programming.</hs_para>

important. I suggest that getting some payment from the platform
provider could be addressed. If the trade-off is that there
should no longer be a “must carry” obligation on the part
of the platform provider, it would enable us to find out what the real
market rate for a programme was. After all, the bulk of viewing on Sky

face new forms of broadcasting, to use that omnibus word, and we will
need regulation to ensure prominence in non-linear broadcasting

traditional television set on which programmes came fairly well down
the line. First, you are exposed to various products of the television
manufacturer, gaming, online games and everything else and then,
finally, you get through to an EPG programme guide. I think that we
have all assumed that television sets are passive; they are
not now. We must ensure that broadcasting—public service
broadcasting in particular—gets due prominence. That was alluded
to by Mr Simon Pitts of ITV, whose remarks were reported in
paragraph 163 of the report. That will clearly be an

be regulated as public service broadcasters, but I think that there was
a general sense that it would be a good idea if they aspired to produce
good programming. Perhaps the kitemark idea is the best way forward.
After all, people have a vested interest in being respected. The
advertising industry supports the Advertising Standards Authority.
Ofcom ensures that it operates, but the industry does it itself because
it is in its self-interest. I do not want to go to a chemist who is
unregulated; I do not want to go on holiday with an unregulated travel

crowding out other providers by its expansion on to the web. If the BBC

well lead to the loss of the licence fee altogether. The alternative is
to find another way of funding the BBC. On that gloomy note,

teenagers, I rather pine for the days when my children were not
constantly on their iPads, iPhones and BlackBerrys. The digital
evolution with media convergence has presented huge opportunities but,
as this report aptly puts it, with a number of major challenges. While
the UK market for on-demand services is one of the most advanced in the
world, it is reassuring that linear broadcast TV still remains largely
popular and resilient with most of the population getting their news

this report is that new technologies and behaviours are evolving more
quickly than regulatory protections. The Government’s
forthcoming White Paper on communications will certainly need to
address some of the regulatory challenges on content, content creation
and competition. Statute is a blunt instrument and should be used only
when totally necessary, but a regulatory framework needs to keep pace
with this ever-changing world in an evolutionary
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000052" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000052">Clearly
the competition regime for media markets should seek to promote choice,
innovation and competitive pricing. The new platforms to distribute
content over the internet and via satellite have allowed UK viewers
increasingly to take advantage of international content and businesses
to globalise. While this provides opportunities for wider economic
growth, it raises the thorny issue of jurisdiction over the content of
some of these programmes. This should and could affect a number of
areas of regulation and enforcement, particularly as Ofcom has the
ability only to regulate services that originate in the United Kingdom.
The impact of globalisation on national regulation of media content
raises a major
challenge.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000053">The

findings and recommendations in this report. Without repeating his
points, I will touch briefly on the safer internet, which was briefly
raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones. It was summarised in
recommendations 220 to 222. It is essential that adequate protections
are put in place to ensure that children’s use of the internet
is controlled in a safe manner. I know that the Government are working
closely with the UK Council for Child Internet Safety to pursue a
self-regulatory approach to keeping children safe online. However, I do
not believe that simply installing filters on IP smart devices,
including mobile phones, iPads and computers, is sufficient.
Parents need to be better educated as to their responsibilities to
ensure parental controls on these devices. It is also essential that
ISPs, mobile phone operators, device manufacturers and retailers as
well as software developers all work together to ensure adequate
protections.</hs_para>

and revenues, which could impact adversely on investment in
high-production-value content. As ITV pointed out in a recent briefing
note, the sustainability of their investment in content depends on
their ability to make a viable financial return on their investment and
also, obviously, to reach large audiences. I entirely agree with ITV
that in a digital age, an effective intellectual property regime is
vital. It is essential that any exceptions from intellectual property
protection are as narrowly and well defined as possible. Advertising
revenues are no longer sufficient to ensure continued investment in
world-class drama programmes. I call on the Government to give
assurances that a strong intellectual property framework will be
incorporated into the forthcoming communications White
Paper.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000057">I noted

movement to reduce the amazing opportunities that are presented by
convergence and the internet more broadly. Regulation should not stand

“latest in a range of excellent reports” because in

around the areas to do with communications and the audio-visual sector
more generally and bringing forward a range of proposals and ideas

report starts in relatively easy mode. It takes as its typical reader
someone—not unlike myself, I suspect—who does not really
understand what exactly they are talking about, and tries to explain
what media convergence is. I was okay for the first three or four
lines. In fact, I think I could answer a certain number of questions on
the first three or four paragraphs. I liked the bit that said that it
was a technological phenomenon where the various platforms come
together, but that does not really help us get into the question of
how, when and on what basis regulatory and other measures might be
needed to deal with this brave new

lounging on a settee watching television, plugged in to an iPod,
listening to other music that is playing loudly and also texting and
doing other things. How do they do it? Indeed, it occurs to me that the
need for regulation is probably in inverse proportion to the number of
platforms a person consumes on average. Think about

value of this sector to the UK economy is some £53 billion. The
sector is growing, providing jobs and new business opportunities,
creating exports and boosting inward investment, generating benefit for
the UK. All the signs are that this will continue. As the report
recognises, intellectual property is a crucial element in this mix and
while the report acknowledges it, it is a pity that the committee has
not, so far, dealt with it. I hope that it will return to this topic.
That aside, it seems to be generally accepted that convergence has the
potential to increase the value that this sector generates even
further, allowing new business models to emerge and offer people
exciting and innovative new products and services which will bring
about great benefits for consumers and businesses
alike.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000064">However,
I have some sympathy with those who warn that, while technology and
consumer behaviours are changing, it is important to remember that the
process of convergence is taking place unevenly. Different media are
becoming more converged in different ways and at different speeds and
we find that audience expectations have not changed as fast as the
technology or the markets. It is interesting that audiences have
continued to distinguish between content on the basis of where they
find it and on what service it is provided. Indeed, in that respect
they may be ahead of both this report and the

about the report, it is that it implicitly gives the impression that,
other things being equal, more convergence will require more
regulation. I can see the arguments for that, but I am not sure that
the evidence is there yet. It may be that smarter, different regulation
is what is required, but, at least in the interim, I hope that we can
all agree that there should be no movement to reduce the amazing
opportunities that are presented by convergence and the internet more
broadly. I agree with the committee’s assessment that a
flexible, industry-led approach will be key to addressing the

the timetable for legislation? Are we to see more publications along

have had a good discussion about the detail and I shall pick up on two
points. The committee points out that the process of convergence poses
a challenge in ensuring that public expectations about content
standards are met. I note that the Government do not believe that the
time is yet right for convergence of linear and non-linear regulation.
I should be very grateful if the Minister could say more about that
because we do need clarity here—indeed it came up as a Question
in the House only yesterday. The committee makes good points about news
and its imaginative proposals for non-linear news provision have some
merit. I hope that its suggestion of legislating early on the
principles but holding back on the detail will catch the eye of the
Government. It may be that the age-rating system that was referred to

make sure that children experience the internet in as safe a way as
possible. However, their parents have major responsibilities in this
area, and it is also important that the internet is open and
transparent, in line with the aspirations of its founding parents. At
this stage a self-regulatory approach is surely the right one for
non-broadcast material. As has been said, securing the engagement of
industry and organisations across the whole value chain, from internet
service providers, mobile phone operators and device manufacturers, to
retailers, software developers and parents, should deliver results. It

quality and diversity of our content is something for which the UK is

of the industry as a whole and continued investment in UK content both
by public sector broadcasters and non-public sector broadcasters. That
suggests a need for stability and certainty in the sector to avoid any
potentially chilling effect on such investment in the longer

my noble friend Lord Gordon noted, the report rightly raises the
importance of ensuring that terrestrial television has sufficient

Ofcom’s administered incentive pricing scheme. Again, it would

online activity takes place in the home. Providing parents and

unsure about how to go about keeping their children safe. That is why
we have charged the internet service providers with making the parental
control tools they are developing as simple as possible. The noble

update existing regulation on PSB prominence. The quality and diversity
of our content is something for which the UK is
admired

success. I applaud all the channels that work so hard and are so much

year in UK content. Non-PSBs have also increased the amount they invest
in UK content. In addition, UK-originated content is a successful
export. Research commissioned by the Producers Alliance for Cinema and

decided to undertake this inquiry because of the rising public, media
and parliamentary concern that multinational companies are not paying
their fair share of UK tax. We also decided to make it a relatively
short one, over the spring and early summer, because, given the
topicality and urgency, we did not think that we should carry on the
hearings after the Summer Recess and into the winter. The Public

and as we launched our inquiry, there was a steady stream of stories in
the media about multinational companies that in practice pay little or
no UK corporation tax, even when they are doing very good business
here. Examples included Google, Amazon and Starbucks, as well as the
British-based Vodafone, Thames Water and Cadbury before its takeover by
Kraft. This practice undermines public trust in the fairness of the
system, calls into question corporate sector responsibility, raises
doubts over the effectiveness of HMRC in ensuring compliance with
corporation tax, reduces the tax revenue to HMG that should
legitimately be coming here, and can place UK-based firms at a
competitive disadvantage if they operate mainly or solely in this
country and pay their full taxes here. This can in particular affect
small to medium-sized businesses that are attempting to compete and
grow.</hs_para>

corporation tax seems to a considerable extent to be a voluntary tax
for multinationals. Starbucks’ volunteering of extra payments in
the UK after bad publicity suggests that it recognises that. As the PAC
noted, Google generated $16 billion revenue from the UK between 2006
and 2011 but paid just $16 million of UK corporation taxes
in the same period. Even after accounting for all its expenditure, it

a serious issue of avoidance of corporation tax to be tackled. Part of
the problem is the complexity of the UK’s tax system but the
main scope for corporate avoidance arises from the international tax

UK, even when they are doing good and substantial business

report, based on the evidence, fully recognised that the Government are
giving priority to tackling these issues but, recognising the
challenges and concerns, also made some further recommendations. I have
to say that I find the Government’s response somewhat
disappointing, defensive and perhaps slightly complacent. That may not
have been the intention but the impression is given that it can be
summarised as, “Of course there is a problem but we are doing
all that is required to tackle it”, and they are dismissive of
any other

key points underlie our analysis. First, international companies, like
all others, are entitled to frame their tax policies with a view to
minimising tax within the rules, although multinational companies are
diverting huge resources to exploiting to the maximum what the rules
enable them to do. I will have something to say later about whether
HMRC is sufficiently resourced to ensure that companies are paying
their proper share. Secondly, we recognise that fundamentally this
issue can be fully and properly tackled only at the international level
because it is so often the difference between the tax regimes that
makes the exploitation and ability to minimise the tax
possible.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000111">I
will turn briefly to the areas in which we are in agreement with the
Government’s response and where we actually said so very firmly
in our report. We acknowledge that changes are being carried out
throughout the corporate tax road map and steps are being taken to
simplify the tax system and make UK corporation tax one of the most
competitive in the world. We acknowledge all the efforts to tackle tax
avoidance, in GAAR, DOTAS and so on. We acknowledge and support the
increased resources and manpower for HMRC to tackle tax avoidance and
evasion, and the successes it has achieved. Above all, we acknowledge
the key importance of international action and the Government’s
leading role in the OECD multilateral project on base erosion and
profit-shifting. All this is agreed and supported by our
committee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000112" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000112">However,
three of our recommendations were not accepted. The first is our
proposal for an urgent review, to be undertaken by the Treasury, of the
UK corporation tax regime, which should report back with proposed
changes to be made at home and pursued internationally. Our report
lists six issues for this review,  
<?notus-xml column=1618?>of varying importance. The one I would single out is a review of
alternative tax structures, such as a destination-based cash-flow tax,
which we analyse in some
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000113">I will
explain the reasoning for that recommendation. There is general
agreement that the various individual countries’ tax regimes do
not reflect the changing business models, the domination of
multinational corporations and the challenges of the digital economy.
This is well recognised in the G20 Leaders’ Declaration of
September 2013. Their solution is the OECD’s action plan on base
erosion and profit-shifting, to be completed in two years.</hs_para>

doing the work into alternative tax structures that we are recommending
is that there is no certainty, to put it mildly, of a successful
outcome of the OECD’s BEPS—as it is known—action
plan within two years. One needs to look only at the OECD’s plan
of action, published in July, to see what a truly formidable range of
work has to be undertaken, let alone agreed among so many Governments.
There is a serious risk at international level that we are putting all
our eggs in one basket and that three or four years on we would be no
better off. The advantage of the destination-based cash-flow tax is
that it could be introduced
unilaterally.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000115">Secondly,
I note that the Government have by implication rejected our
recommendation that HMRC should be better resourced, by outlining all
that has already been done. I acknowledge that the evidence so far is
that extra resource has been more than self-financing in the revenue it
has produced. I have looked at this quite a few times in the past and
our recommendation for more resources was designed to help and support
HMRC in the good work that it has been doing. That is why I am
disappointed that the Government have dismissed our recommendation. As
a former Chief Secretary, I have to say that it is the kind of extra
resource I would encourage. It is difficult to judge how much extra
resource is needed but the evidence is that it would well justify
itself.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000116">Thirdly,
I regret that our recommendation of a joint parliamentary committee,
along the lines of the Intelligence and Security Committee, to oversee
HMRC has been rejected on grounds of taxpayer confidentiality. The same
argument about confidentiality could be used against the existing
intelligence committee on grounds of national security, but there has
never been a breach or leak. Meanwhile, Parliament has to take it on
trust—relying on the National Audit Office, another body of
officials—that all is well in HMRC with the resources that it
has. I hope that this recommendation will be looked at
again.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103065000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103065000117">Finally,
I have three specific questions for the Minister when he comes to wind
up. Can he update us on progress since publication in July of the OECD
<I>Action Plan on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting</I>? Is the way
ahead any clearer? Can the Minister also update the House on progress
on some of the Government’s other anti-avoidance initiatives,
such as giving HMRC the ability to name high-risk promoters of tax
avoidance schemes? I understand that consultation on this ended on 4
October. Can the Minister brief us on the current status of the
Government’s proposals to exclude companies whose tax affairs
are not in good standing 
<?notus-xml column=1619?>from bidding for public procurement contracts? How
would such measures be consistent with that respect for taxpayer

a new approach is needed. The answer is an unequivocal yes. At the
heart of the report is the statement that the UK has serious problems
with the avoidance of corporation tax. As the noble Lord mentioned,
that is partly due to the complexity of our domestic tax regime, but
principally it is because of an international tax system which gives
multinational companies the ability to shift profits between countries
in ways which minimise their tax liabilities in the UK. The effect of
that is to damage the economy and undermine trust in the taxation
system. It has both social and economic consequences. We are witnessing
democratic failure here and the electorate have caught on. They are
unconvinced that the political class will solve these big issues, and
there are no issues as big as this to solve. The electorate are of that
opinion because they see the social contract as broken—the
social contract which was founded on the premise that everyone got a
slice of the pie. Over the years, some got a bigger slice, but now we
find that, while some are still getting a big slice, others are getting
nothing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:03:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103069000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103069000003">The
noble Lord, Lord King, the former Governor of the Bank of England, made
the point recently that wages and standards of living in 2017 will be
the same as they were in 2007. Professor Joseph Stiglitz, who is a
professor at Columbia University and a former chief economist at the
World Bank, stated, in his book, <I>The Price of Inequality</I>, that
the global economy is sick, has been sick for a long time, and that
that is infecting our politics. He cited figures to show that, in the
US since 1979, output per hour has gone up by 40%, but pay has barely
increased. Meanwhile, the top 1% in the US takes home more than 20% of
national income. He asked whether the great recession has made things
worse. It has made things worse for 99% of people, but 95% of the gains
between 2009 and 2012 went to the top 1% of society.</hs_para>

can see the same trends in our own country. The electorate feel that
their views are less important than those of the banks and financial
institutions, the energy companies and the multinationals like Google
and Starbucks. Our report backs that up when it says that multinational
companies are unique in that their corporation tax payments are largely
a voluntary activity. That is endorsed by Sir Martin Sorrell of WPP,
among others. However, it is not a voluntary activity for the rest of
society. The message from HMRC at the end of the year will be that
people better get their self-assessment tax returns in by 31 January
otherwise they are liable to a £100 fine per day. Rightly so, we
should say. But, if we are to have a level playing field, and the
chance to restore both economics and politics to health, then we must
urgently look at this
situation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:05:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

HMRC estimated that there was a £35 billion tax gap which it was
failing to collect. The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, made the point that
our proposal for HMRC to have extra resources had been rejected. If it
had those resources, as it has done in the past with positive results,
then some of that £35 billion could be clawed back. If the
Chancellor had that £35 billion in his hands, he could reduce
the basic rate of tax from 20p in the pound to 12p. There is a big pot
to get hold of, but we need the resources to do so, and it is
disappointing that the Government have rejected that proposal. Tax
evasion is relevant to the everyday lives and struggles of us all,
particularly at this present time of austerity.</hs_para>

the UK a soft touch here? It does seem so. The recent examples of
Starbucks and others who shifted their profits elsewhere illustrate
that point. Since their naming and shaming, the voluntary payment of
£20 million by Starbucks is welcome, but it is not
the answer. We need to change the structure. The use of outlandish
gimmicks to shelter profits in other countries must cease. Google is
claiming, absurd though it is, that its intellectual capital resides in
Bermuda. That would be okay if it was not for the fact that it was
approved by the US Internal Revenue Service. That illustrates just how
difficult the situation is and how we need to tackle it globally. In my
capacity as a member of the Parliamentary Commission on Banking
Standards, we saw how our own domestic banks—HSBC, UBS, Standard
Chartered, Barclays and others—were fined almost $4 billion by
the American authorities for engaging in money laundering activities.
The HSBC evidence to the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards
was very clear. It admitted that, on day one of assuming control of a
Mexican bank in 2002, there was an e-mail from the head of compliance
which made it clear that there was no recognised compliance or money
laundering function in the company. Yet it allowed that to fester for
years.</hs_para>

do I mention that in the context of a global financial situation? It is
not a victimless crime. During the period of HSBC’s ownership of
that Mexican bank, 35,000 individuals in Mexico died at the hands of
local drug gangs. So there is a moral as well as an economic case to be
looked at. We need international co-operation. We cannot do this
alone<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:08:55"></hs_TimeCode>. The G8
took place in Lough Erne, where warm words and a forced solidarity of
leaders gave some reassurance. However, the mild language in our report
where we say that we 
<?notus-xml column=1621?>are not yet clear how effective the proposed solutions can be or whether
they are achievable within the timescale puts a question mark against
the purpose of the G8 in ensuring that this issue is
tackled.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103069000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0001.htm#13103069000008">I
want to put forward a few proposals for what we need to do. First, we
need to tackle the opacity of the international structures. They are
giving companies an easy advantage in using differences in tax rates
between jurisdictions to avoid paying tax legally. The International
Financial Reporting Standards, which are overseen by the International
Accounting Standards Board, need to be urgently reviewed. Presently the
International Accounting Standards Board is an independent,
non-governmental body comprised of representatives from the accountancy
and tax professions, but it is not overseen or regulated by
government. Given the state we are in, there has to be a role for
government oversight of this issue. We have to look at how tax
structuring is based in the IFRS and elsewhere. The Government need
oversight of these accounting
standards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:10:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

to ensure that we remove the lack of transparency of, lack of control
over and lack of accountability in the basic tax system that we are now
witnessing. Thirdly, in promoting transparency and more democratic
accountability, we need a stronger culture. A public beneficial
ownership registry is an important aspect of that. Both the Government
and the EU have carried out cost-benefit analyses on it. The
Government’s cost-benefit analysis produced a figure showing a
saving of £30 million in police time alone, while the European
Commission has said that the United Kingdom could save €420
million if this register was created. It would be the correct thing to
do to have such a register so that we know who owns the companies and
what benefits they bring. Apart from revealing savings and costs and
being able to tackle money laundering and fraud, one of the key aspects
of such a register would be
transparency<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:11:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

recent horsemeat scandal, the key companies were set up by the same
Cypriot professionals who helped the infamous arms dealer, Viktor Bout,
to create his web of secretive companies. If such a register was
established, it would provide business with important information about
partners, suppliers, investors and customers, and it would ensure that
the law enforcement and tax authorities, including those outwith the
UK, would have quick and guaranteed access to information. That would
be helpful to us
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:12:29"></hs_TimeCode>. At the G8

pricing and the many ways companies find to shift profits between
countries. As the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, said, the

the fight, as they say, misses the point. Our report shows that
currently there are legal ways to avoid paying UK taxes that are owed
because of the very many existing loopholes. We need to identify and
close those loopholes.  
<?notus-xml column=1622?>If I was asked to choose between name and shame or ensure transparency,

did us a favour because the public finally became aware of an
international financial structure that has substantially reduced
government tax receipts in a way that directly affects the daily lives
of many lower and middle income families in the UK and around the

in tax and is that fair?” but “What are all UK
companies paying in tax?”. Paragraph 86 of our report makes this
point clearly by stating that,</hs_para>

addition, it is essential to make country by country financial

receive in aid. This haemorrhaging of the much-needed resources that
are required to combat poverty and hunger and to fund vital public

MacGregor, said, the OECD has been charged with some responsibilities,
but it has stated that the information from country to country

advance this issue by one whit. The Government urgently need to take
this on as part of an international agenda and ensure that country by
country financial reporting is secured. Professor Paul Collier of
Oxford University has done much to highlight the social and economic
injustices of global tax structures. He has noted that the G8 countries

sector remains untouched. All of these scandals derive from the nature
of modern business which is based on greed and the quest for
quick bucks while ignoring long-term considerations, and has
contributed to a mindset that induces corruption, bribery, fraud,
insider dealing and other criminal actions. These have been all too
little investigated in the past, although the prosecution rate is now

such illegalities has encouraged a lowering of standards across the

stretching the rules and following only the letter but not the spirit

the Care Quality Commission, the Serious Fraud Office in particular,

understandable in a period of austerity. Why should large corporations,

escape paying corporation tax and behaving like good citizens? The

opinion. Its PR advisers polish up the tried and trusted—at
least by them—technique of owning up to shortcomings in a very
generalised way, and initiating new dialogues about the need for
greater ethical concern. Unsurprisingly, as I speak, this is already
being diluted to “integrity”, which is a lesser word in
this context. Hence the meeting on 24 October 
<?notus-xml column=1625?>of some 200 senior business executives with religious leaders, headed by
Archbishop Vincent Nichols with the support of Archbishop Justin Welby,

Lawson of Blaby (Con):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I start by
thanking my noble friend Lord MacGregor for his outstanding
chairmanship of the committee, and for introducing this debate today.
He has been outstanding. He has been a friend of mine for a very long
time, since before either of us entered the House of Commons, let alone
this very illustrious House. Indeed, for part of my time as Chancellor
he was my Chief Secretary to the Treasury, and I could not have had a
better one. He has proved that he is a man of many talents, because he
is as good a chairman of a Select Committee of your Lordships’
House as he was a Chief Secretary to the
Treasury.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103069000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103069000030">This

answer was yes and the Government’s answer was no. That is a
slight difference between us. My noble friend Lord MacGregor, who is a
man of great understatement, said that in his judgment the
Government’s response to our report was complacent and
inadequate, as indeed it was, and in many ways it was also appallingly
petty. I will refer to one or two things in a moment, but first let me
reflect on why it was quite so
bad.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103069000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103069000031">One
change that has occurred since my time has concerned me more and more.
During my time there were two revenue departments—the Inland
Revenue and Customs and Excise. The Inland Revenue was an absolutely
first-class department, and it was a privilege to be the Minister
responsible for it. Customs and Excise was very different; it was
excellent on the drugs side. Its intelligence network, which is of the
greatest importance in combating drug imports, and so on, was
considerably superior to that of the police. It was also pretty good in
its anti-smuggling responsibilities. Where it fell lamentably short of
the standards set by the Inland Revenue was on the tax side. What
happened 
<?notus-xml column=1626?>is that subsequently, after my time, the two departments were merged
and, instead of the standards of the better department being the
standards of the whole, it has gone more the other way round. That
happens very often with mergers of one kind or another, which look
extremely rational but have that
result<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:30:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103069000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103069000032">Another
thing that has greatly weakened tax policy in this country is that,
again in my time, there was a very small tax policy division in the
Treasury, but there was also a powerful tax policy division in the
Inland Revenue. Since then, tax policy has been put entirely in the
Treasury. There is now no tax policy division in the Inland Revenue,
with the result that people on the policy side know nothing, or very
little, or certainly very much less, about how the system works in
reality. The knitting together of policy and administration is
crucially important. So I am not surprised—although I do not
think that it is the only reason—that the Government’s
response to our report was so pathetically
lamentable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:31:52"></hs_TimeCode>. I

I say anything more that my noble friend the Minister might find
disagreeable, I will say one thing that pleased me about the
Government’s response. Perhaps he would like to speak about it.
One recommendation that we made was that the Government should look
again at the different treatment of debt and equity capital in a
company’s accounts. This completely different treatment, in
which there is a tax allowance for interest on debt but no allowance of
any kind for the dividends paid on equity, encourages the accumulation
of debt. The noble Lord, Lord McFall mentioned that he was a member of
the Parliamentary Commission on Banking Standards, as was I.
We made a recommendation on that, because it is real Alice
in Wonderland; you have the regulator telling the banks that they must
have less debt and more equity and the tax system saying that they must
have more debt and less equity. That really cannot be very sensible.
Even apart from banks, as the Mirrlees report pointed out, and as we
point out in our report, there are very good reasons why this should to
be looked at<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:33:42"></hs_TimeCode>

are a number of fallacies there. First, it is certainly desirable that
we should have in this country as benign a tax regime as we can,
consistent with finding the finance to pay for necessary public
expenditure. 
<?notus-xml column=1627?>But in my experience, what people look to when they are thinking about
where to locate their investment and do business is, first, the size of
the market, and how prosperous and good it is; whether the rule of law
can be relied on; and whether the overall tax regime is attractive. The
personal tax regime has, in my experience, more of an effect in many
cases on how people see the jurisdiction than corporate tax or other
forms of taxation. They also take into account the social legislation
and whether there is too much
regulation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:36:17"></hs_TimeCode>. All
those things are taken into account. The idea that somehow, if we go it

have to go it alone, because there has been a fundamental change in the
world economy. Nothing in this world that I have ever come across is
all good; there are always some disadvantages. Some of our witnesses
tried to pretend that a lot of modern commerce has become
dematerialised through the internet age. Nothing could be as material
as a cup of coffee, yet Starbucks was among the most prominent of the
early users of tax avoidance, which, I may say, is totally legal. That
is the point: it is totally and completely legal. But globalisation has
changed things—and, overwhelmingly, it has done good. If I had
to choose the single best thing that has happened as a result of
globalisation, it would be the success of so much of the developing
world. The emerging world has really emerged successfully, which would
not have been possible without globalisation or the freedom of trade
and capital movements. Those private capital movements dwarf aid flows
into complete insignificance, as well as being of rather better quality
than aid flows. Globalisation has enabled China and a number of other
countries, most but not all of them in Asia, to develop in the most
wonderful way in the past 25 years. But nothing is without its
drawbacks<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:38:34"></hs_TimeCode> and
disadvantages.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103069000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103069000038">The
Government have to face up to the fact that globalisation means that
the corporation tax system is no longer fit for purpose, and will not
and cannot be fit for purpose, because multinational companies will
move profits legally to wherever the tax regime is lowest. A number of
ill effects flow from this. One is that the Chancellor loses
much-needed revenue—and I feel for him, particularly when we
have a deficit the size of the one we still have, although happily it
has gone down a great deal. Loss of revenue is a serious business. A
second flaw, defect or downside, as other noble Lords said, is that it
brings the whole tax system into
disrepute<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:39:32"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:39:21"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:39:11"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>.

third thing is that it is grossly inequitable. Although all those
multinationals—I have nothing against multinationals—can
shift their profits and intangible assets around the world in such a
way that they pay little or, in some cases, no UK corporation tax, the
backbone of this country is the small and medium-sized enterprises that
are national companies, not multinationals. They still have to pay the
full rigour of corporation tax. There is no level playing field. It is

often they go to a conference and make a statement that they have
reached a great understanding or agreement, but they have not. The
system is just the same. The problem is just the same; it has not gone
away. Then they say, “We will approach it this way, but we could
not possibly take a lead”. God forbid that the United Kingdom
should take a lead and introduce a sensible tax system of its own,
which would probably comprise—although we do not lay down what
it should be—a very low level of tax on corporate profits with a
low level of corporate sales tax, because sales in this country are

what is the answer? We should take a lead, but instead, nothing

even getting nowhere fast; you’re getting nowhere

of revenue. We have to find a new system. The modest proposal that we
made, which was that there should be a review, is incontrovertible. I

and fro-ing between 
<?notus-xml column=1630?>the members of the Public Accounts Committee and the witness. That
to-ing and fro-ing is calculated to leave everybody utterly confused
about how those figures are made up and how reliable they are. What is
unequivocal is that the tax gap is going up. That is the evidence that
was given only a few months after the Minister who will respond to this
debate unfortunately told your Lordships’ House that it was
lower than that and going down. That was the best information with
which he was provided from the same sources. I understand that because
I have been in that position
myself<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:50:08"></hs_TimeCode>. The

first question is: what is the current estimate of the tax gap? Is it
£32 billion, the figure which was being deployed in June? Is it
£34 billion which was apparently the unadjusted figure for last

the gap going up or
down?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103070000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103070000010">Secondly,
this evidence makes it clear that the tax gap does not include any
estimate of the taxation we as a country are being denied by the
practices identified in this report, with which we have all become
familiar. This is for good reason. As the noble Lord, Lord Lawson,
said, this is not illegal. Until the policy and the law change, there
is no way of estimating what it is. From page 8 onwards in the
transcript of the evidence there were some interesting exchanges
between Austin Mitchell, a Member of Parliament, and the same witness.
The committee tries to put some scale to the taxation avoided by these
processes. The way it does so is interesting. The scale is drawn from
information communicated to the SEC in the United States of America by
companies discussed before in the debate—Google, Starbucks,
others—about the scale and nature of their sales in the United
Kingdom. The disparity between the figures is astounding. These
companies are telling the United States regulators and others that they
are doing billions of pounds’ worth of business in the United
Kingdom whereas they are telling Her Majesty’s Revenue and
Customs that they are doing at most hundreds of millions of
pounds’ worth of trading
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:53:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103070000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103070000011">The
most interesting thing about this evidence is that nowhere does there
appear to be any estimate of the revenue lost. Nowhere does there
appear to be an estimated figure we can put to the nature and scale of
this problem. That passage of evidence alone—I shall end on this
because I want to do service to this report but I cannot go into all
the detail of it—generates an incontrovertible argument for the
recommendation of the Select Committee for some method of coherent and
appropriate accountability to Parliament. That method should follow the
example of the Intelligence and Security Committee. The reason the
argument is incontrovertible is that as you follow the evidence you
discover that HMRC witnesses cannot give any answers. They cannot
answer for policy because apparently they have no involvement in
policy. They cannot answer for estimates because their business is
collecting the taxation that is due, not estimating. They cannot answer
in relation to individual taxpayers’ experience with Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs because that is confidential. Thus
there is no accountability at

accountability and a shared knowledge of what is going on inside our
tax system lie at the heart of the matter. As to what the noble Lord,
Lord Lawson, has suggested about restructuring the taxation system, I
should have to look at the details carefully, but what is necessary is
accountability in Parliament. We, at least, need to know who owes what

an issue, as every inward investment had to have an agreed structure
negotiated in advance. At that time, some 30 years ago, the mood was
changing dramatically and suddenly the United Kingdom became an
attractive place to invest after years where businesses had felt that

in several companies and partnerships, which are listed in the register
of interests. As has been said, corporation tax makes an important
contribution to public finances, accounting for between 9% and 10% of
total tax receipts over the past decade. As we know, for the vast
majority of companies—SMEs and companies that are based
here—tax payment is a matter of routine: taxes are calculated,
reviewed and audited, and payment is made. However, for many large
companies, some based here but also some multinational companies
headquartered elsewhere, the tax charge can be manipulated
downwards—in some cases, near to vanishing point—to boost
profits, to the great benefit of owners. This is because of the sheer
complexity and asymmetry of tax laws here and in other

HMRC on the detailed framing and operation of tax

they return to the commercial world. It is a case of foxes

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:06:45"></hs_TimeCode> opportunity

In HMRC’s eyes, legal form triumphs over substance, so a

Nevertheless, it is accepted by HMRC. Google has been referenced.
Interestingly, the group profit margin of Google is 22.5%. Assuming

same margin on a turnover last year of £3.5 billion,
it would make a profit of just short of £800 million,

This compares with the £11 million that was

mentioned, the tax gap does not include any of this. It is a very
difficult number to put your finger on but in one company, Google, that

Starbucks and Apple are not going to leave the UK, which is a major

we require them to pay the right level of tax. It is important that the

sustainable, happier future. The noble Lord, Lord Leigh, is a giver. He

MacGregor started with the complexity of the UK tax regime. He spoke
about multinationals and the infamous example of Starbucks which, from
2006 to 2011, had UK revenues of $18 billion yet paid UK
corporation tax of only $16 million. As the noble Lord said, there is a
serious issue of avoidance. The Select Committee on Economic
Affairs—I am proud to have been a member of the Finance Bill
sub-committee every year—has produced a thorough report,
<I>Tackling Corporate Tax Avoidance in a Global Economy</I><I>:</I>
<I>I</I><I>s</I><I> </I><I>a New Approach</I><I> </I><I>Needed?</I> The
report says right up front that the present system is not working and
urgently needs reform. It says that it is confident that the Treasury
will bear this in mind as it conducts its proposed review. However, we
have heard that the Government have not really listened to the report,
and will not be taking much of it into
account<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:22:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that UK corporation tax, having come down to 20%, is the
lowest in the G20. The German rate is 29%, France’s
is 33% and the United States’s is 40%. This is wonderful news.
On the other hand, the report also highlights something which
is not understood by the public: a significant feature of
the UK’s corporation tax regime is the low rate of allowances
for capital spending. Our regime does not encourage investment. In
fact, within the OECD and the G20 countries, only one country, Chile,
has a less generous allowance than the UK. We must look at
this as a
whole<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:23:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which has not yet been highlighted in today’s debate is how much
corporation tax yields as a percentage of GDP. Again, the report lays
this out clearly in a table comparing us with other countries such as
France, Germany and the United States. Our UK share of corporation tax
receipts has held up pretty well in spite of falling headline rates. As
a percentage of GDP, in 2005 corporation tax was 3.2%; today it is 2.7%
in spite of rates having fallen. The nub of it all is that, of the
contribution by tax to total HMRC receipts, corporation tax stands out
in that it is only 8.7%. It is dwarfed by income tax at 32.2%. National
insurance contributions constitute 21.8% and VAT constitutes 21.4%.
This clearly shows that, yes, everyone is getting upset about
corporation tax not being paid by certain companies, but are people
talking about all the other taxes that these companies are generating,
predominantly through creating employment. Employment generates a far
greater proportion of taxes than corporation tax. We are not quite
getting the context of and perspective on this. I will come back to
that point at the end of my
speech<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:25:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103080000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103080000005">In
fact, 81% of UK corporation tax is paid by the top 1% of companies.
Here we are getting upset about 1% of companies; 99%—SMEs have
been mentioned—are paying the full rate of corporation tax in
many cases. We are losing a sense of perspective. The report

multinational company is not taxed as a single entity but as a number

present tax system around the world encourages multinationals to move

sub-committee for the previous Finance Bill, we focused on the GAAR. As
the noble Lord, Lord Hollick, said, when he came up in the business
world he was taught the distinction between evasion and avoidance. To a
chartered accountant it is very simple: evasion is illegal; avoidance
is allowed. Now we are going one step further and saying
“abuse” as well. However, it is clear that the GAAR will
not catch everything. It is narrowly focused. It will not, for example,
catch the Starbucks situation at all. That needs to be communicated. I

now come to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, which I

corporation tax in the modern world is inequitable between

moment, it has had its day. He has summed it up. The noble Lord, Lord

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:31:18"></hs_TimeCode> want to refer

headed, “Tax compliance should be judged by rules and
not morals”. This was when the Starbucks issue was at its

Lord Hollick, referred to this. The Prime Minister, David Cameron, at

Vindi<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:39:35"></hs_TimeCode> Banga then
talked about IP royalties; the way companies move profits around the
world, perfectly legally. One 
<?notus-xml column=1640?>way, of course, is to charge royalties from where the IP is
headquartered. Let us say that the IP is headquartered in a country
outside the UK; royalties are charged and paid, reducing the tax here
in the UK. However, what we overlook is that the UK is also a recipient
of royalties and we encourage IP. We encourage the innovation of IP,
the generating of IP and the holding of IP. In net receipt terms, the
UK receives more royalty income than we pay out. So it will go against
us if we stop that in trying to address tax

other point that Vindi Banga made—this is my main
point—is that our tax system has to be competitive because we,
as companies, operate in a really competitive environment. In fact,
while evasion is immoral, avoidance, if it is legal, is a duty:
companies almost have a duty to try to pay as little tax as possible in
order to be as competitive as possible and to survive and compete in
the global environment. However, there is something that could and
should be done. Could the Government bring in even more regulation for
companies to disclose all the tax that they are paying in one simple
table? Every company would disclose how much it generates as a result
of its operations in terms of PAYE paid, employer national insurance
paid, employee national insurance paid, VAT collected as a result of
sales, and corporation tax. In my company’s case, there would
also be the excise duty generated as a result of the company’s
existence. That would put into perspective how much tax a company is

noble Lord, Lord Leigh, said, very correctly, that it is not fit for
purpose and that we must continue to try for a global solution. He
spoke very clearly about SMEs, which are paying too much tax, in

tax regime overall. Our corporation tax rate may be one of the lowest,
but our capital allowances, on the other hand, are not good enough and

want to deal in particular with the international aspect of corporate
tax reform. It was described by the noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, echoing
the Government, as a topic of key importance. So, what can be done
internationally that will prevent our country losing its competitive
advantage and yet achieve a more stable and just tax regime? We want to
achieve as level an international playing field as possible. The
importance of this topic was recognised this year by the G8, by the
OECD it its initial report of February and its action plan of July, and
by the G20 in calling for action in Mexico last year and in Moscow this
year, endorsing the OECD action plan. What does the OECD say needs to
be done? There are five principal points. The first is transparency:
that is obvious. The second is evidence of beneficial ownership. Who
actually owns which companies in which jurisdictions and how are they
interconnected? The third is the automatic transfer of tax information.
This already applies to the three NAFTA countries, applying to
individuals and companies. It is a three-country market of 450 million
people and hundreds of thousands of companies. It can be done: it is
being done. The fourth and fifth are two interrelated topics:

that country-by-country reporting and transfer

essential element in tax fairness across countries. The G8 agrees that
this is essential. The OECD is neither amateur nor academic. It has a

these two issues in its action plan of July, the OECD promised an
urgent response. That response was given 10 days ago, on 17 October. It
precedes a consultation meeting in Paris in mid-November on
country-by-country reporting and transfer pricing. By this rapid
interim report it anticipates a set of rules to be developed that will
include a requirement that multinational companies provide all relevant
Governments with necessary information on their global allocation of
income, economic activity and taxes paid in the relevant countries,
according to a common template. That has been produced in three months.
It requires a consultation response, including from our Government, by
mid-November. Action is sought, and expected. Despite the
understandable concerns of those in this 
<?notus-xml column=1642?>House about the difficulty of obtaining international co-operation, the
OECD reminds us all that the Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative and the Publish What You Pay initiative have both been put
into practice by Governments and international energy companies. It can
work and it is working. There is no reason why the OECD recommendations
should not be accepted in the next month or two on these topics.

no oversight over the body responsible for creating them, nor on the

days are long gone when tax collectors could stand at the gates of
towns and cities and levy tax in cash on goods brought in for sale.
They could raise taxation successfully by that means because there was
a clear border and goods were visible. As we have heard, HMRC estimates
our loss of tax today through avoidance, evasion and non-payment at
£35 billion, 
<?notus-xml column=1643?>which begs the question of how it knows. There is a lot of evidence to

it is reasonable for the Government to assess what has been achieved.
Our report poses the question: “Is a new approach needed to
tackle corporate tax avoidance in a global economy?”. The answer
is, “Without a doubt”. The general public certainly
agree, because they see it as an issue of fairness. Perhaps, therefore,
the Government’s response to this report should have been a bit
warmer. As the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton, explained, that
response can be construed in the verbs used. I will add one verb to his
list of “agrees”, “notes” and
“disagrees”. The Government “welcome” what
we say just
once.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103074000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103074000034">The
constant use of the word “notes” seems odd when the word

self-evidently true, but rather than say that they agree, the
Government in their response simply “note” what we have
to say. I am puzzled as to why this should be. It seems to relate to
the fact that the Government agreed at G8 that work to minimise
avoidance is an international matter and that we should therefore await
the progress of the OECD. It implies that there is little that the
Government can do on their own. However, as we have heard, is this
true? It is
not.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103074000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103074000036">Our

is no doubt that following the G8 decision the latter is starting to be

tax haven, which can then lend the money on to another company
elsewhere in the world? If so, what if that company lent via a tax
haven to a sister company? Would tax be saved twice—in the UK
because the money is borrowed, and in the receiving country because it
is borrowed there, too? Can the Minister tell the House how extensive
this practice is thought to be, and what action HMRC is taking to block
the loophole? I understand that many other countries are now doing
that. Surely the UK should not encourage offshore tax havens at a

to our democratic processes. So, why is there to be no Treasury review?
Why is there no publication of corporation tax paid? Why is there to be

we have heard, developing countries are some of the worst affected by
profit shifting. Christian Aid claims that developing countries lose
more revenues as a result of tax avoidance and evasion than they
receive in aid. That means that while we are delivering the 0.7% target
through the front door, a bigger sum is seemingly going out of the back
door. The problems of developing countries are implicit in our report,
but perhaps we should ensure that as the OECD, the G8 and the G20 lead
reform, developing countries get involved and that due account is taken
of their needs. Effective tax collection is vital if poor countries are
to reduce their dependency on
aid.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103074000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103074000046">Will the

Christian Aid estimates that if Zambia had received the same price for

noble friend Lord McFall wasted no time in identifying the context in
which the report was presented. The committee feels very hard done by
in terms of the Government’s response given the serious level of
public discontent about corporation tax that has manifested itself over
the past 18 months. The public outcry was sufficient for Starbucks to
decide that it merited a gesture on its part in the form of making a
contribution to the Revenue. My noble friend said that the public felt
there was a breakdown of the national contract. That may not be putting
it too high. After all, everyone knows that in this time of great
austerity and difficulty, when wages have not increased over the past
10 years, people are paying their taxes, as they are obliged to do, and
they find it scandalous that some large organisations can treat
corporation tax almost as a voluntary levy to which they pay mere lip
service. That is why the Government’s response ought to be much

have encountered many difficulties with regard to these issues. My
noble friend Lord Browne referred to the scale of the tax gap and asked

that in the last recorded year the gap was £34 billion, and that
it has gone up £1 billion since then. However, as my noble
friend indicated, it is very difficult to put the basis on which these
figures are presented into clear perspective. That is why it has been
constantly argued throughout the debate that the first thing we need is
transparency on the part of companies and the second is accountability
on the part of HMRC. We all know what the Government’s response

Newby (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to respond to
this debate. I start by thanking the committee for its work and for the
characteristically thoughtful way in which the noble Lord, Lord
MacGregor of Pulham Market, introduced the debate. I congratulate the
noble Lord, Lord Leigh of Hurley, on his maiden speech. I hope that his
understanding of the advantage of brevity does not diminish with the
passing of the years as, sadly, it sometimes does among other Members
of your Lordships’ House. His speech was extremely thoughtful,
in a House that prides itself on its expertise but which in fact has
relatively few experts on financial affairs. Those we have are
extremely distinguished. Compared to, say, debates on anti-social
behaviour, in debates on any aspect of the economy or finances, we are
pretty short on people with real current or past expertise, so I am
doubly pleased to welcome the noble Lord to your Lordships’
House and look forward to taking part in many more debates with
him<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:10:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000002">I
start with a confession. I am an alumnus of the lamentable side of
Customs and Excise. I worked for a number of years in that part of
Customs and Excise that provided tax policy advice to the Treasury at a
time when it had virtually no tax officials of its own. Although things
have changed, I like to think that we were at least able to match our
colleagues in the Inland Revenue, with whom we had an extremely
friendly rivalry at the time. I do not want to go into detail about the
way in which tax policy is currently organised, but say simply that
both departments have a clear remit. HMRC has a strong operational tax
policy role, whereas the Treasury is responsible for strategic tax
policy, but they work very closely together—literally as well as
figuratively. When I worked in Customs and Excise my office was several
miles away from the Treasury, which meant that even if I wanted to have
a quick chat with somebody it was quite difficult. There is a common
and regular movement of staff between HMRC and the Treasury, so there
is quite a lot of joined-up
working<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000003">I
shall deal with the complaint from all sides of the House that the
Government are complacent about the issues. We are not complacent in
respect of three aspects of the problem that we are facing. First, we
accept and completely understand the level of public 
<?notus-xml column=1649?>discontent. Secondly, we believe that that discontent is realistic and
soundly based, and thirdly, that we are dealing with a major problem.
We are far from complacent about the need to do more. I hope to explain
both what we are doing and why we will be doing more. One thing that I
must say, having been a Treasury spokesman for the Liberal Democrats in
your Lordships’ House for nearly 15 years, is that for the first
part of that 15 years there was never any movement on the
issues that we are talking about today. Pressure groups came year after
year, asking why we were not doing this or that. Many of the things
that we argued for to no avail for a decade have now been implemented,
and a whole raft of other initiatives that have been started very
recently have the ability to make fundamental improvements in how we
deal with this problem. We are now in the middle of a rapidly moving
series of national and international activity, which definitely goes in
the direction that the committee wants, and I shall attempt to set that
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:13:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000004">I
should perhaps state the blindingly obvious—that the
Government’s view on corporation tax is that while we are keen
to drive forward tax competitiveness, such a policy does not mean that
we should be soft on tackling tax avoidance. We are determined to
rebalance the tax regime to ensure that it supports growth and
investment, and we want a corporate tax regime that improves our
business environment, helps to attract multinational companies and
encourages investment. That is why, alongside other reforms, we have
reduced the headline rate of corporation tax. Having created a
competitive tax regime, we expect companies to play by the rules and to
pay the tax that is due. I completely agree with the noble Lord, Lord
Hollick, that companies have wider duties than simply to minimise the
amount of tax they pay. The Companies Act 2006 lays out clear
directors’ duties as well as duties for the company as a whole
in terms of having regard to the impact of its activities on society,
which was a new and welcome initiative by the previous Government. It
means that the
two-dimensional<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:14:46"></hs_TimeCode>
view that anything that increases profit is good and anything else is
bad is no longer acceptable and no longer recognised in

shall deal with the question of whether corporation tax has had its
day. Corporation tax at the moment raises 8.7% of HMRC revenue, as the
noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, pointed out. It is not as much as the top
three but it is far above any other in that middle league. As I said
earlier today, from a pragmatic point of view, a tax that raises 8.7%
of revenue is one that should be made to work better but not, in my
view, replaced. The Government have a credible record to date in
dealing with companies avoiding tax. That has been demonstrated both
through the legislative and operational changes we have made since 2010
and by HMRC’s success in litigating through the courts. The
number of cases has not only dramatically increased manyfold, the
proportion of cases heard in 2012-13 resulted in a more than 80%
success rate for
HMRC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>. So far, we
have made 33 changes to tax laws to close down numerous avoidance
loopholes<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:16:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000006">As
noble Lords mentioned, we have introduced the first general anti-abuse
rule, which is designed to tackle abusive tax avoidance schemes and is
a key part of our 
<?notus-xml column=1650?>plans to drive down tax avoidance. Now that it is happening it is put to
one side as though it is a little tick in the box, but it is an issue
on which we campaigned for years to get some movement on a general
anti-avoidance law. At long last it has happened, and while I accept
that, as the law beds in, we might over time want to strengthen it, it
is a major shift for the better. We have updated the public procurement
rules so that any potential government suppliers bidding for large
contracts must now declare occasions of significant tax non-compliance.
The noble Lord, Lord MacGregor, specifically asked me about this point.
These rules were introduced on 1 April this year. It is not so much a
case of naming and shaming suppliers who avoid tax but of suppliers
disclosing occasions of significant non-compliance so that departments
can have a number of remedies at their disposal, up to and including
contract

top of our domestic action, we have taken a lead in the international
field. Indeed, a lot of the debate today has been around the
international initiative that is now being carried forward through the
OECD. The noble Lord, Lord Lawson, said that the Government should

why the Government have taken the lead in pressing for international
action. A number of noble Lords said that it is about time the
Government took a lead. They made it clear that in their chairmanship
of the G8, tackling tax avoidance was their top priority. The OECD
initiative has come about largely because this Government have taken an
international lead. I strongly agree with the noble Lord, Lord Brennan,
that the OECD is a body that is capable of getting to grips with this.
There is a key component that will be absolutely crucial in determining

to home, as a number of noble Lords have said and as the committee

<?notus-xml column=1651?>this spending review period, specifically to tackle tax avoidance and

pricing, as the rules already allow us to deal with some aspects at
least of egregious transfer pricing. That requires highly skilled

absolute outrage. I believe that the way forward is for the NAO to

conference that the United Nations Secretary-General has called in
January 2014, and then to fully and speedily honour their commitments?

other impassioned word from the Lebanese humanitarian worker was that,
without a comprehensive solution to the humanitarian situation in
Syria, and to the conflict itself, the wider region will continue to
deteriorate. The United Nations Security Council endorsement of
Resolution 2118 of the Geneva Communiqué and the backing for a
follow-up conference provides a much-needed consensus among the P5.

hostilities in Syria, as set out in paragraph 5 of the original Geneva
Communiqué, will not be easy. However, a ceasefire is essential
to improve the humanitarian situation and to allow, at the very least,
a short humanitarian pause in hostilities. Furthermore, surely a
complete and immediate halt to arms and ammunition to Syria, as set out

unhindered passage of humanitarian convoys in areas under their

uncomfortable as we, so comfortably ensconced on these red Benches,

trustee of UNICEF UK, I have of course been briefed on a regular basis
about its activities on the ground and I, too, pay tribute to it and to
the other NGOs and agencies providing humanitarian aid in almost
impossible circumstances. Operating any form of assistance in Syria is
increasingly challenging, dangerous and highly complex. There is no
security for aid workers and rising numbers of armed groups across the
country will do little to improve stability or safety. Thousands of aid
workers are risking their lives daily to reach those who are most in
need. The pace of change in the conflict and the vast array of armed
groups all threaten agencies attempting to provide aid. The safety of
aid workers must be guaranteed if we are to effectively provide
assistance to the people of Syria. The right reverend Prelate pointed
out in his speech that we can take pride in the fact that Britain is
leading the way in providing aid and assistance. We are the second
largest bilateral donor and the £500 million earmarked by DfID
for Syria will go a long way to alleviating the suffering of those on

“Here is the freedom you wanted”, which is a phrase
similar to ones other women have reported hearing while

reality is that the victims of sexual abuse have much to lose and
little to gain from speaking out. It takes a lot of courage and
strength for a victim to speak up and they may be on their own with
little support as they do it. In addition to the shame and isolation a
victim may feel, they now are living in an insecure environment due to
the war. They may be in a large refugee camp with no privacy,
surrounded by people they do not know or trust. If they tell someone,
to whom and where does that information go? It may be hard to put their
trust in a stranger when, time and again, there has been little justice
for the victims of wartime rape. Added to that must be the physical,
psychological and emotional trauma that victims are already suffering
from the war and displacement. It is not surprising that they are
reluctant to come

there are others whose stories are beginning to come out. Now at a safe
house in Turkey near the Syrian border, a 25 year-old Sunni woman spoke
of how she was detained for more than eight months. Her first days in
detention were largely spent without sleep and being relentlessly
interrogated for information. She could hear the screams of fellow
prisoners being beaten and was continually threatened with sexual
violence. She was taken to a cell full of male prisoners in their
underwear. Leering, the jailers told her that they would leave her
alone with the prisoners, “to take care of her”. To a
conservative young Sunni woman, this was unthinkable. She began to
scream for them to let her out of the jail. “I thought I was
being given to these men for them to rape me”, she said.
“I think I screamed for three hours. They wanted to break me,
and it worked. Finally I said, ‘Okay, I will tell you the
truth’”. When speaking of the degradations she had
experienced, she would not use the word “rape”. However,
an NGO worker who had been looking after her confirmed that she had
been subject to sexual abuse. “But she needs to rebuild her
life, and you can imagine what rape means in Syria. She has said that
she feels more than violated; she feels ruined”.</hs_para>

of Inquiry report on Syria cites five instances of women who committed

crime. The sheer misery of women who have been forced to flee their
homes is difficult to convey, and once they have reached supposed
safety 
<?notus-xml column=1658?>across the border, the nightmare does not end. Along
with the risk of maltreatment and food shortages, there are accusations
that Turkish security forces have abused refugee girls and women.
According to some Turkish media and news networks, since August 2012
some 400 Syrian women have been raped, with 250 of those rape cases
resulting in pregnancy. Increasing numbers of women living as refugees
report that they would rather return to their homes, under horrendous
conditions, than remain at the risk of rape and sexual abuse in the
camps. It is heartbreaking that these women flee their homes
with their families seeking safety, only to exchange one place of
violence for another.</hs_para>

conflict in Syria has obviously had a huge impact on the politics of
the whole of the Middle East region, and of course it has divided

attempting to find a way forward to stop the fighting and the use of
chemical weapons are issues all very well known to

outlook is grim. Only this week United Nations envoy Lakhdar Brahimi
was told by Bashar al-Assad that the civil war in Syria would end only
if foreign powers ended their support for those trying to overthrow
him. Yesterday brought the depressing news of the sacking of the Syrian
Deputy Prime Minister, who had been among those pressing for reform in
Syria. He had been liaising with Russian and American officials about
peace talks which it was hoped would end the tragic civil war. Qadri
Jamil has now been dismissed for allegedly spending too much time
outside Syria, neglecting his duties and holding meetings without

debating the politics of the situation but the impact of the failure of

the Red Cross. One million of those people are children. It is the
worst refugee crisis in 20 years, and we have seen nothing like it
since Rwanda in 1994. Every day another 4,000 people cross over into
other countries to seek safety elsewhere. They are often women with
their children, without their husbands or fathers who have been left to
fight. They are escaping brutality and violence which, as the noble
Baroness said a moment ago, are almost unimaginable to us. Yet I am
bound to say that the appalling pictures that we see in our newspapers

concentrate the rest of my remarks on the impact of this humanitarian
crisis on Syria’s neighbour, Jordan. There are now more than
600,000 Syrian refugees in Jordan, representing an increase in
Jordan’s population of around 10%. That is like us having 6
million more people in this country. Since Jordan opened the
Za’atari refugee camp 14 months ago, it has become a place where
there are 145,000 Syrians, and it is now the fourth largest
city in Jordan. The country has often dealt with the arrival of
refugees in the past; what makes this influx so different is that the
Syrians arriving in Jordan have little or no money, are living
alongside their hosts and put a huge strain on Jordan’s limited
resources and job
opportunities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000057">Those<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T20:56:16"></hs_TimeCode>
of us who know Jordan well know that it is a terrific country; it is
beautiful, has wonderful historic sites and vibrant and articulate
people. But it has no natural energy source and little water. It has
nothing like enough jobs for its own young people. Education, health
and water infrastructure and the job market are under enormous strain.
To accommodate the 78,000 Syrian children in the education system,
schools are now working on double shift in Jordan. Health services are
deteriorating, particularly in the northern governorates, and medicines

Organisation estimates that 160,000 Syrians are now working in Jordan

now running at something approaching 16%. This is a recipe for real

the past year or so. As a result of being good hosts to their
neighbours, Jordanian communities are really suffering. What are Her
Majesty’s Government doing to assist not only Syrian refugees in
Jordan but Jordanian people in need? They, too, are part of this
humanitarian crisis. The estimated additional costs continue to rise in
hosting the more than 600,000 Syrians, and now stand at $1.68

of 1989, which gradually ended the 15-year civil war there. He was also
the UN representative in Iraq in 2004, following the American invasion

our hopes cannot be set too high. The regional powers will first have
to come to some understanding. The diplomatic wheel is turning all the
time, and it now seems that Turkey and Saudi Arabia are even aligning
themselves with Israel in an attempt to prevent US rapprochement with
Iran. I believe that some member states of the EU could take a much
firmer stand to resist that process, because Iran is surely one of the
powers influencing and financing the civil war. As long as there are
proxy combatants inside Syria, the war and the suffering will

having so warmly welcomed the refugees, is usually seen as aligned with
the opposition in Syria, but it also accommodates a substantial Shia
Alawite minority in Istanbul. Only last week, a prominent Turkish
socialist MP visiting Westminster criticised 
<?notus-xml column=1661?>his Government for their open-door policy. It is
obvious that Turkey is allowing arms and al-Qaeda fighters, among other
jihadis, through the border with Syria, but it is also extremely wary
of more Kurdish autonomy on its doorstep. That is another
dimension.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000065">I
understand that Mr Brahimi has angered the Syrian opposition by
advocating Iran’s presence at the negotiating table in Geneva.
Of course, Iran is financing fighters, just like the Saudis, the
Qataris and others. That is the whole point. I hope that the Minister
will accept that all those engaged in those proxy wars should be
invited to the talks, and Iran has already declared its willingness to
attend. Meanwhile, as the noble Baroness, Lady Symons, said, Jordan is
under severe pressure to look after a huge refugee population, which
may now be equivalent to more than 20% of its own population. One can
compare that situation to that of UNWRA with the Palestinian refugees
in 1948 and 1967. Although Palestinians now have their own
services through the United Nations, in Jordan, 90% of the
Syrian refugees are not in camps but have had to be absorbed into
already stretched urban areas. As has been said, that makes increasing
demands on education, health and, especially, water
resources.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000066">One
could suggest that a comprehensive agency like UNRWA be set up for
Syrian refugees, but that would be a public admission that this could
be a very long-term issue. Something has to be done. The enormous

Jordanian society from stress and possible
friction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103081000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103081000067">In
these conflicts, it is of course the dead and the wounded who claim
attention from aid workers and the media. The figure of
100,000 dead, which includes many civilians, is bad enough,
but the media can rarely show the number of displaced. To the total
number of refugees of 2.2 million must be added the number
of people displaced or trapped in conflict areas—up to 7 million
or 8 million. Those are the figures that really bring home the scale of
the crisis. They are victims such as those described by the noble

motivated to speak by my frustration at what I see as a long-term
policy of western Governments towards the Middle East which has been
failing for many years. At the time of the Arab spring, and when the
trouble began in Syria, we had leaders saying Assad was finished and
that he would be going within a few weeks. The implication, and the
encouragement that this was giving, led many of the opposition to
believe that if they took up arms against the Government of Syria at
that time, that Government could be overthrown. That reminded me of the
rhetoric directed at the Marsh Arabs in Iraq. They were encouraged to
stand up and fight for their freedom against Saddam Hussein. They were
led to believe that the first Bush Administration would ride to the
rescue. No such thing occurred and the Marsh Arabs were

country were ever in a similar situation, it would have the same

nearly 700,000 refugees in Lebanon and nearly 550,000 in Jordan. The

this can be a chaotic situation, there are now proper child protection
and security measures in place in the refugee camps? Has my noble

looking to purchase young women are seeking out Syrian refugees and
that criminal gangs are being paid to traffic people including,

displaced. The patriarch was resolute in his view that the church in
Syria would survive but the plight of religious minorities in any
future Syria is uncertain. It is clear from the comments of the noble
Baroness, Lady Symons, that the region may not be able to accommodate
all of these people. Are discussions being held at EU and UN level
about an appropriate response if, at the end of the war, it is not safe
for some communities—whether Shia, Alawite, Muslim or

have looked closely at the images on the internet. One can see that
there are satellite dishes and TV aerials on some of the tents and
containers in which people are living. Arab culture is oral, which is
one reason why TV is so popular even when people have barely enough to
live on. Is this small opportunity being taken by the UN to ensure that
the programming into these camps includes messages on reconciliation,
on remembering the Syria where Sunni, Alawite and Christians lived side
by side, and on how to forgive your neighbour? I know that some will
consider this a premature drop in the ocean. However, it is never too

becoming increasingly difficult to contain the Syrian conflict and the
humanitarian crisis. Neighbours such as Turkey and Jordan have long
been affected, but above all Lebanon, a tiny country where I was in
charge of UN operations at the onset of this crisis in 2010, is in
grave danger. Last week alone—in one week
—13,000 new Syrian refugees were registered by the United
Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon, bringing the total
number there to over 800,000. That is more than two and a half times
the population of the city of Coventry and more than the population of
some of our largest cities such as Liverpool or Newcastle. The noble
Baroness, Lady Symons, referred to the terrible burdens on Jordan, but
those on Lebanon are even greater. By way of comparison, the equivalent
of Lebanon’s acceptance of 800,000 refugees would be equivalent
to the UK taking more than 10 million refugees over a period of less
than three years. The conflict in Syria, a country linked by
historical, economic and social ties with Lebanon, is severely and
negatively impacting that
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103082000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-0002.htm#13103082000032">Inevitably,
this puts great strains on Lebanon, its people and its economy.
Lebanese schools, hospitals and homes have been opened to refugees in
the spirit of generosity for which that country is renowned. However,
given the country’s weak public finances the inevitably large
costs are unsustainable. Furthermore, the Syrian conflict has
challenged the already delicate balance between Lebanon’s myriad
communities of Christians, Sunni and Shia Muslims. In order to help
Syria in its hour of deep crisis more must be done to stabilise Lebanon
lest the Levant as a whole is drawn into a vortex of deep sectarian
violence. Already in recent weeks the situation in
Lebanon’s second city, Tripoli, has deteriorated markedly, with
sectarian violence between Sunni and Alawite communities. In Syria
itself the situation continues to deteriorate. On the BBC’s
“Today” programme this morning its intrepid foreign
correspondent Lyse Doucet reported that thousands of civilians are
trapped in three besieged suburbs of Damascus, especially the suburb of
Muadhamiya.</hs_para>

of basic services. It is extremely difficult to access water, food,
medical and other supplies; 60% of all hospitals are affected by the
conflict, with nearly 40% completely out of service. A further

bureaucratic procedures imposed by the Government of Syria, including
delays in issuing visas and lengthy customs procedures, multiple

taken to bring forward the peace process with talks planned in
November, as we have heard tonight, with the UK Government
focusing efforts on bringing the opposition coalition to the

navigate the most likely path to peace. As we have heard, many NGOs are
concerned that without a clearly planned process of moving towards
ceasefires the conflict could intensify as the sides seek to establish
or gain territorial advantage. Initial areas of focus should
concentrate on creating openings for looking at reinforcing locally
defined ceasefires, as so ably expressed by the right reverend Prelate,
and creating opportunities for wider ceasefires and humanitarian
causes. As the right reverend Prelate said, Geneva II should seek to
establish a process of negotiation and efforts towards building the
foundations of peace through inclusive talks, civil society engagement
and establishing conditions for ceasefires in a much broader

across the region, and the UK has rightly been at the forefront of the

than 1.2 million people, and medical consultations to more than 315,000
people. We are working with partners to ensure that our own and the
international response addresses the immediate and longer-term
development needs of Syrians and host communities. The UK has taken a
leading role on the international stage. Following UK lobbying at the
G20 and the UN General Assembly, $1 billion in new funding has been
pledged by the international community. The UK also spearheaded efforts

General Assembly. It is imperative that that happens, but what pressure
can we put on them other than leading by example? Many noble Lords
referred to the commitment of this Government of $784 million in aid,
which is the second largest donation. Several noble Lords asked what
other countries were doing in this regard. It may be of interest to the

Lingfield (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the four amendments in my name,
which are necessarily probing amendments, have as their purpose to
include higher education in the Bill in cases where there is a
reference to local authority duties related to education provision for
young people up to the age of

in the past, more and more young people with disabilities are now
entering university courses. Sometimes they receive first-class
support; other times, alas, it is very much wanting. There should be
a seamless pattern of support whether or not a student aims
at further education, which is catered for in the Bill, or for higher
education. My amendment to Clause 27(3)(h) includes higher education
institutions among the bodies with which a local authority must consult
as part of its duty to keep education and care provision under
review; the amendment to Clause 28(2)(e) adds higher education
institutions to the local partners with which a local authority must
co-operate; my amendment to Clause 29(2)(d) adds higher education
institutions to the list of bodies that must co-operate with
the local authority and vice versa; and, on the preparation of draft
EHC plans, the amendment to Clause 38(3)(d) adds higher education to
the institutions whose naming in the draft plan can be requested by a

Second Reading I greatly welcomed the extension of the coverage of
legislation from birth to 25 years of age, unlike the current system,
which applies only to the end of school-based education. At that point
under the current system, to quote a parent who gave evidence to my own
commission on special needs, a child will often fall off an educational
cliff<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. In light
of the welcome extension of legislation to the age of 25, it is
particularly important to make sure that higher education is included
explicitly in this primary legislation in order that it will be
regarded in the same way as further education and other post-16
provision under the new system of assessments and EHC plans. Without
such amendments I fear that we will not improve the current and, in my
view and the view of many parents 
<?notus-xml column=594?>and students, imperfect system, where there is a separate and often
disconnected process for assessing and meeting the needs of young
people with special educational needs who are successful in reaching
higher

is not often understood that currently a young person with a statement
at school will not automatically have the same provision at university,
and that the previous support that has come via a statement of needs
has to be reassessed by Student Finance England before university
entrance. I am told by those with direct exposure to this process that
Student Finance England’s reassessment process does not provide
for as thorough an assessment as that which would come through the
current statutory assessment or, it is to be hoped, through the new EHC
plan. As a result there is a clear risk of delay in support for these
young people, especially where, as in many cases, there is no reason
whatever why the provision that has supported them for years beforehand
should
cease<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T15:48:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000007">I
also note a separate but related concern that the expertise available
to Student Finance England may be very different from, and possibly
more limited than, that available to local authorities, healthcare
providers and others for EHC plans. Indeed, it is rather surprising
that Student Finance England and universities do not as a matter of
course currently accept the advice of local authorities, expressed in
the form of a statement, bearing in mind that local authorities have
considerably more expertise available to them in the form of access to
educational psychologists, speech and language therapists and
occupational
therapists.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000008">All
this is illustrated very clearly by a case that was drawn to my
attention, of Michael. Michael has dyspraxia, including severe oral and
motor dyspraxia, and had a statement of special needs from the age of
three. Nevertheless, despite Michael’s statement being reviewed
annually, Student Finance England declined to accept this as evidence
of his disability. A fresh set of reports were required and had to be
paid for by Michael’s parents in order to compel Student Finance
England to recognise that there was a pre-existing disability. Michael
has now, with continuing and appropriate support, obtained a
first-class honours degree in philosophy at his
university.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000009">In
the new system, designed to cater for the needs of children and young
people up to the age of 25, maintaining a different assessment process
for those who are capable of entering university, as opposed to further
education or other provision, will perpetuate an unfortunate anomaly
which, in my view, could put off young people with disabilities from
attempting a degree course. Surely the repetition of the process by two
state-funded bodies is a waste of money. Any moves to address this
disconnect, such as those sought in these amendments, surely must be
welcomed. I very much hope that the Minister will give this her full
consideration. I beg to

stalled rather at the moment. The question is: of the care leavers
going to university, what proportion have special educational needs?

Brinton (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare an interest as my sister
is a BSL interpreter at a university in the UK and I worked in the
higher education sector for 20 years. I will pick up on the last point
of the noble Earl, Lord Listowel. Part of the problem in the HE sector
is that there is not always consistency. “Care leaver”
can be defined by an individual institution. There are usually generous
grants, and they are usually on top of any SEN support, but the
definition of care can be quite limited. Certainly it would not always
cover guardianship or kinship carers, where children have come out of
care. Those are some of the issues that
remain.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000012">The
reason that I wanted to speak to these amendments is that I absolutely
applaud the sentiment behind them. If we are truly to have an SEN offer
that covers young people to the age of 25, it is ridiculous that an
entire sector of education is not covered by it. My fear is that this
amendment tries to tack universities on to a much more local offer,
thereby causing problems. I will ask the Minister a couple of questions
on this
later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000013">The
university provision can be very generous. However, as
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T15:53:14"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Lingfield, outlined, for some students, where there is perhaps the
possibility to have diverse views, such as with dyspraxia, dyslexia or
one of a number of other SENs, it can be very difficult to get past the
first hurdle. I would welcome a transition arrangement, as we have for
young people with learning disabilities and social care support moving
from child support into adult services, for those with special
educational needs entering universities. At the moment they stand
completely separate, and frankly that is where the holes start to
appear. If a child has a statement under the old system, or an EHC
under the new system, they should have that information passed on
automatically, along with the level of support that they have had in
the past, providing the young person is happy for that to
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000014">I
notice that the Minister in the Commons said that he would provide
further detail as to the proposed contents of the code of practice
relating to the transition to university, and made a commitment to
consult widely with practitioners in university in drafting the code. I
think that that would be extremely helpful. I would also welcome
further details from the Minister—perhaps in writing as it is
not directly within her field—as to what action the Government
will take to ensure disabled students have disability support in place
as soon as possible in their course of study. In particular, there
needs to be a commitment for the code of practice to recommend that
local authorities support and encourage DSA applications as soon as
possible the year before entry, and that such support in applying for
the DSA is stipulated in the plans of young people intending to study
at university. The problem is that that conflicts with the current
timescale for young people to be encouraged to apply through student
finance, which most people do not do until 
<?notus-xml column=596?>they are well into their final exams in the summer term before they plan
to go up to university. That is too late for students with statements
and support because there is not enough time for receiving universities
to do the research necessary to provide the right
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000015">I
have said before that I am concerned about local authorities having a
duty to secure a place in higher education for students, as would be
the implication of this group of amendments. I would encourage
mechanisms, perhaps through an alternative amendment, to make sure that
there is dialogue so that not just the statement is carried through. If
the student has concerns, the local authority may know and understand
the case better, and sometimes it is useful if the young person is not
the only one arguing their
case.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000016">I have

Low of Dalston (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I speak to Amendment 155 in
my name. Clause 38(3) sets out the types of institution that may be
named in an education, health and care plan. Ministers have stressed
the importance of a joined-up approach and that a system that goes from
nought to 25 will improve the lives of children and young people with
special educational needs. I was therefore a bit surprised to see that
higher education institutions were omitted from the list. That means
that if a young person with a special educational need decides that
they wish to pursue a university education, they must do so without the
support of an education, health and care
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000019">Disabled
young people and those with special educational needs need all the
support they can get to go to university. Disabled graduates are much
more likely to get a job than those without a degree. In 2012, 71% of
disabled graduates were in employment compared with only 42% of
disabled non-graduates. Yet disabled young people are less likely to go
on to higher education than their non-disabled peers: in 2009-10, it

19.<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_time UID="13103084000406" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000406">4

support between school and university takes a variety of forms. Many
examples have been given to me but I will instance just three of the
more important ones. The first form is comprehensive, impartial and
quality-assured careers guidance from at least year 9, to enable young
people to make an informed 
<?notus-xml column=597?>choice of course and university. Secondly, there is help with accessing
financial support and practical help through the application process,
because take-up of disabled students allowance and disclosure of
disability is not as high as it should be and there is robust evidence
that disabled students with that allowance achieve better than those
without. Thirdly, there is support to access the full range of
adjustments available in higher education, which may well be different
from those appropriate at school level but have to be in place at the
start of the young person’s course.</hs_para>

local authority needs to provide a care package away from home at
university, as well as in the home area in vacations. Students are
still prevented from going to university because their care package is
not portable during their studies. Disabled students allowance does not
cover care costs, whereas adult social care does. In recent research by
Trailblazers, 30% of young disabled people said that they felt limited
in choice of university because of concerns about securing their care
package, and three-quarters stated that organising care from their
local authority was not easy or straightforward.</hs_para>

support compared with current statutory guidance on learning difficulty
assessments would mean a loss of rights and protections, which the
Minister has rightly said that nobody should experience as a result of
the Bill. I therefore believe that this amendment would help enormously
in ensuring all the transitional support that disabled young people
need to get from school to university and which is clearly so important
in enabling them to achieve at university, when going to university is
so important in enabling disabled young people to achieve in life. In
view of all these things, it would be particularly helpful if higher
education institutions were added to the list of institutions covered

at one with the Government, it is in our shared ambition to encourage
young disabled people to have the highest aspirations for their lives

I can appreciate that there might be slight delays because of the
timescale of applying and getting to know and getting to grips with the
university, but it seems common sense that if a young person has
special needs, whatever they are, and they are contained in the plan,

attend university are administered by the funding bodies, which, in the
case of students domiciled in England, is Student Finance England. The

students in the higher education sector are already successfully
supported by institutions and directly by the Government through the
disabled students allowance. DSAs are not means-tested, are awarded in
addition to the standard package of support and do not have to be
repaid. My noble friend Lady Brinton made reference to that generosity.
We should not seek to duplicate or replace this system, which
provisional figures for the academic year 2011-12 show provided 51,900
full-time students with support totalling £117.2
million. The number of students in receipt of DSA increased by over

agree, however, that local authorities must ensure that young people

well managed handover between health and care services. That is why,
following commitments made by my honourable friend the Minister for
Children and Families in the other place, we have updated draft

local authorities to make young people aware of the support available
to them—this is of key importance—in higher education

they start their course. That picks up the issue referred to by the
noble Lord, Lord Lingfield. The code makes it extremely clear that, as
soon as the student finance application service opens, applications for
DSA can be made. It varies from year to year, but it is generally at
least six months before the start of the academic year in which the
young person is expecting to take up a place in higher
education—so, long before they discover where they are going,
the principle of what kind of support they are going to need can be
investigated. Local authorities should encourage young people to make
an early claim for DSA so that support is in place when their course

have already been raised in Committee but I should be interested to

me that some of the concerns he had would be addressed by the way that
the care of a particular individual moving from one area to another
should be looked after. He highlighted cases of students who wished to
move from home to study at particular universities—just like all
other young people who had those ambitions—but their personal
situation stood in their way. We clearly need to ensure that that is
not the case. The Care Bill should help in that regard because of the

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:29:31"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, what
my noble friend said about that is very encouraging but it is not
always a pre-existing condition. In particular at university,
mental conditions can become apparent that were not before because the
environment is that much more challenging. I am sure there are many
occasions when it works, but certainly on occasion universities find
that getting provision for a student who clearly demonstrates the need
for mental-health assistance can be extremely difficult where the local
authority and clinical commissioning group feel they have other
priorities for their permanent residents. This would not be a transfer.
It is getting help within the context of a university for a student,
rather than having to send them home—which misses the point of
supporting them at
university<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:27:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000057"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Northover" PimsId="2142" UID="13103084000442" xid="1368" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000442">Baroness

noble friend Lord Lucas, who wished to “keep me company”
in discussing this Bill. I am very happy to keep his company—and
that of any other noble Lords or Baronesses, should they wish. He is
absolutely right: supporting students with mental health challenges is
a vital area. I hope that he will be reassured that in the National
Health Service now there is parity of esteem between mental health and
physical health. We know that good mental health underpins better
physical health. The challenges that students face when they leave home
and are at university under all sorts of pressures are something we are

<?notus-xml column=604?>acutely aware of, as are the higher education institutions. If there are
instances where students are not being looked after within those
institutions and health services locally, that is obviously a cause for
concern<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:28:27"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T16:28:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000058"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lingfield" PimsId="5882" UID="13103084000443" xid="2096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000443">Lord
Lingfield:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for her reassurance. As
she and my noble friend Lady Brinton will be glad to know, these were
simply probing amendments aimed at debating this terribly important
subject. As my noble kinsman Lord Addington said, the move from school
into higher education is terribly important. Other noble Lords
underlined that. Higher education is terribly important for these young
people, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, illustrated with the statistics
that he brought to
us.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000059">One point
that my noble friend Lady Brinton made concerned the fact that while,
of course, a young person can start early in their application to
Student Finance England, most young people know only late in August,
when they get their A-level results, which university they will go to.
That leaves about a month and a bit to get all this straightened out.
As the noble Lord, Lord Touhig, and the report that he commented on
have shown, sometimes first-class accommodation that is entirely
suitable for young people of this kind is provided. I am afraid that
other universities do not have it. Neither I nor any of the young
persons or their parents who have spoken to me are concerned as to
which silo the funding for this should come from. All one is concerned
about is that the provision should be as seamless as possible and that,
unlike at the moment, the new plan should at the very least be taken
into account when consideration is given to funding a young person who
is going into university. Perhaps, along with the noble Lord, Lord
Lucas, I should keep the noble Baroness company in order to discuss
this

slippery and imprecise. Expects when? On what does the fulfilment of
the expectation depend? Parents, practitioners and the special

like to make a couple of other points. We should be clear about who the
local offer covers and who it does not. Independent research by the
University of Bath, to which we have already referred in these
proceedings, has shown that 25% of disabled children and young people
do not have a special educational need and as such will not be entitled
to an education, health and care plan or to access the local offer
because it is only for those with a special educational need. It is not
clear how these 400,000-odd children and young people who have a
disability but not a special educational need will secure the support
they need if they are not entitled to access an education, health and
care plan or the local offer.</hs_para>

I underline the importance of the local offer including provision which
exists to meet the needs of children and young people with special
educational needs outside the authority’s own area. This can be
especially important in the case of those with particularly severe
disabilities, who need to know about the full range of services, often
consisting of highly specialised provision not available in the local

is a concern that local authorities will provide information on
provision available in only their own area. This is not the same as
providing all the relevant information about what is available to meet
special educational needs, including provision out of the local

off the list, it will undermine young people’s

<?notus-xml column=606?>to access the provision which best meets their needs, as well as

having massive aspirations. Of course I wish that the local authorities
had funding to meet every child’s needs, but if that is not

budgets have been a great liberator for many adults and families, but
for others they have caused extraordinary difficulty. Those of us who
work in both the adult and children’s fields have seen in the
adult field how many people have found extraordinary problems in
managing employment and the financial complexities of budgets. Families
are making it clear that they require support to manage personal
budgets, and parents with experience of direct payments have spoken of
difficulties that they have had in finding, recruiting and CRB-checking
good staff, managing money and transactions with the local authority,
identifying quality services to purchase, and co-ordinating a package
of care. Currently, only 25% of local authorities provide key workers
to help manage payments. I find that extraordinary. This leaves
families to manage the often burdensome responsibilities of direct
payments alone. I hope that discussion around this amendment will help
us to better understand the Government’s thinking about the
support that they envisage local authorities will provide for those
families who opt for personal budgets. Does the Minister accept that
all families should have some access to support?</hs_parafo>

I would add “consistent and detailed”. If parents are
comparing different authorities, as they may have the option to move,
they must be able to see apples and apples rather than completely
different things. Despite our need for individualism within local
authorities, it would be very helpful if the offer were expressed in a

also needs to be some detail in it. I shall come on to that in a later
group that also looks at the publication of the offer. Without that
detail, it can be very difficult for parents to understand what is on
offer. I know a qualified teacher of the deaf who has just retired.
When I first met her 15 years ago, she was based in one school with a
number of children who were being integrated into the mainstream there.
She spent the last five years before she retired in her car tearing
around the county from appointment to appointment. As far as the local
authority was concerned, deaf children were being taught sign language,
but a 20-minute session every other day is not good enough for a child
just starting sign language. Parents might think that they are going to
get a level of offer that they are not going to get if the information
in the offer is not explicit.</hs_para>

Touhig</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I shall speak to
Amendment 110, which is in my name. It ties in with other
amendments tabled which seek to ensure that the local offer has both
teeth and some meaning for parents looking for support. The amendment
places a duty on the responsible agencies to deliver the services that
they say will be in the local offer. The Government have already placed
a duty on health bodies to deliver what they outline in EHC plans.
However, a corresponding commitment in relation to the local offer
remains sadly absent from the Bill. It is the local offer that most
children with additional needs—and there are 1.4 million of
them—will be relying upon.</hs_para>

other place, the Minister said that to have such a duty would limit the
services which groups such as voluntary and community organisations
were prepared to offer. He also said that the local offer already
increased accountability by involving children and young people and
their families more and allowing them to compare what is offered. I
agree that listening to children and young people and their parents,
and ensuring that they have adequate information, is the right approach
but the omission from the Bill of a duty on responsible agencies to
deliver services is simply not right in terms of accountability, or in
ensuring that families will actually receive the services specified as
being needed in the local offer. It is important that there is real
accountability. The Bill is currently lacking in this area for the
delivery of the local offer.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T15:45:00"></hs_TimeCode>If we do nothing
about it, there is a serious danger that the local offer will serve as

Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I make a general point. The
notion or the policy of a local offer is hugely important as, for the
first time, parents and families will know what is available and it
will be clear, concise and jargon-free. I have sympathy with most of
the amendments that have been tabled but if we read the code of conduct
it makes it clear what should happen. What is the local offer? It says
clearly in the code of conduct that it must include both local
provision and provision outside that particular area, given what is
available in other areas. It refers to how it has to be clear,
comprehensive and accessible and to engaging parents, children and
young people. Hallelujah! It says that it should be easy to understand,
and so on. So when the Bill is linked to the code of conduct, many of
our concerns are dealt with there. Some word changes in the code would
perhaps help it in some way. However, I am very much reassured, since
in the code “should” is often replaced by
“must”.</hs_para>

concerns about the impact of Part 3 of the Bill. As a number of noble
Lords have said, of course we welcome the principle of a published
local offer—it has been widely welcomed by many in the
sector—but our concern is what the local offer will mean in
practice and what certainty of provision will underpin it. Like many
other noble Lords, we feel that there is an urgent need to clarify this

be a legal duty on local authorities to provide what is set out in the
local offer. As the noble Lord, Lord Low, made clear in moving the
amendment, the solution could be relatively simple. Subsection (1)
currently states that the local authority must publish information
about the provision which it “expects to be available”;
our amendment would simply switch that from “expects to
be” to “is”. As I say, it is a simple solution.
However, it is important because making that change will give those

this was discussed in the Commons the Minister said that the word
“expects” reflects ambition rather than weakness. He said
that the local offer will make it clear how parents and young people
can complain or appeal if they are unhappy with any of the provisions
set out in it so that the matter can be taken up with the service
provider concerned. This seems a strange way to go about it. Why rely
on an effective appeals system when we should be getting the provision
right in the first place? This is particularly so when you consider how
difficult it is for people to bring forward an appeal. You need to look

addition, there is a worrying reliance on the detail of the
arrangements to be prescribed in regulation and in the code of
practice, which again makes it difficult to challenge. I say to the

that need. The local offer, introduced by Clause 30, has two
fundamental purposes: first, to provide clear, comprehensive and
accessible information on provision available to support children and
young people with SEN and their parents; and, secondly, to help make
provision more responsive to local needs. Paragraph 5.1 of the draft
SEN code of practice makes this crystal-clear.</hs_parafo>

effective, the local offer must be a collaborative venture. We are
requiring local authorities and schools, colleges and others providing
services to work together in developing it through the duty in Clause
28. Crucially, we are requiring local authorities to involve local
parents of children with SEN, and children and young people with SEN,
in developing and reviewing the local offer. The local offer should
enable local people to see what services are available, how they can be
accessed, who provides them and where to go if things do not work out.
It will also improve local accountability by making services more
transparent and more responsive. I have to say that my discussions with
pathfinders have been encouraging in this
regard.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000100">The

currently available, families will not be informed about what provision
the local authority expects to become available in the near future,

164A and 164B cover a part of the Bill where it seems that the wording
reverses the current relationship between local authority and parent
when it comes to education. Our education legislation is written so
that the responsibility for educating children rests with the parent,
and the local authority then has duties in support of that. The way in
which the Bill is worded at the moment seems to place the duty on the
local authority, with the parent in support. If that is the case, I
hope to put the situation back to where it always has been and, to my
mind, where it should

157ZA are on a more optimistic note. In recent years, there has been a
considerable improvement in relationships between local authorities and
the home education community. We have escaped from the cloud cast by
the Badman report and are entering a period where there is a spirit of
co-operation and mutual understanding. It seems to me that we ought to
look for a situation where a statement of special educational needs can
encompass education otherwise, as it is known; that is, that the
provision might be made otherwise than at school and as part of a home
education package.</hs_para>

the local authority and the home education parents would have to agree
that this was a suitable package. There would have to be rapprochement
between the two sides but, as I have said, this is becoming much more
common. It therefore seems sensible that we should have an arrangement
where it is possible for local authority and home-educating parents to
co-operate in the interests of the child, rather than the current
arrangement, with the rather strange Catch-22 situation where if a
home-educating parent asks a local authority for help for a child with
special educational needs, that is taken as proof that they are not
able to provide properly for that child and that child must go straight
to school. If the parent therefore does not ask for help, the local
authority has no right, role or responsibility for making any provision
whatsoever. That seems a dichotomy that does not act in the best
interests of the children
concerned.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13103084000411" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000411">5.15

education out of desperation, as they have not been able to get the
support that they feel that their child needs, or have been let down by
the very services which should be supporting them. While I continue to
support parents’ right to choose home education, I sincerely
hope that our reforms will mean that parents no longer feel that they

broad terms, the Bill seeks to keep the same legal position for
children with SEN who are home educated as now, but it does so within
the important wider context of the Bill including a much greater focus
on the views, wishes and feelings of parents as set out in Clause 19
and throughout Part 3 and the code of practice. Where a child or young
person has an EHC assessment and the outcome of that assessment is that
a plan is needed, the local authority is under a duty to 
<?notus-xml column=617?>prepare such a plan. If the local authority considers that home
education is the right provision for the child or young person, that
will be specified in the plan. It will then be under a duty to secure
the special educational provision specified in the plan, with the home
educator providing the core education provision. Likewise health
commissioners will be under a duty to provide the health provision
specified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000125">Amendments
152ZA and 157ZA seek to strengthen parents’ right to request
that a plan specifies home education. They would mean that local
authorities would have to treat such a request in the same way as a
request for a particular school or institution. I think that there is a
delicate balance to be struck here. Parents can already make
representations for home education and will continue to be able to do
so under Clause 38(2(b)(i). Moreover, the principles set out in Clause
19 mean that local authorities must give more weight to parents’
wishes, and as a result we may see local authorities naming home
education more often. However, the choice to home educate is a choice
to opt out of the state-supported system and is therefore not the same
as the choice of a particular school or institution. Therefore these
amendments would shift the balance too

this does not prevent parents from home educating. In such
circumstances the local authority can only absolve itself of its duty

is suitable for the child’s SEN. I know from the debate on
Report in the other place that there are differences of view on this
legal point, and these amendments aim to shift the balance of
responsibilities between local authorities and parents. However, our
view is that not only do local authorities have this duty but it is

should emphasise here that local authorities do not have draconian
powers available to them to make this check. For instance, they have no
right to enter the parental home to check the provision that is being
made. They can enter the home only at the parents’ invitation.
The check on the suitability of the parents’ provision could be
made through the parents providing a description of that provision or
by the parents passing on examples of the child’s work. Neither
should they define “suitable” as necessarily being the

I may raise a tenuously related but important question. It arises from
previous debates and is relevant to this clause: how will the local

see in the code the great pains that the Government are taking to
ensure that parents and young people are consulted about what is on
offer to them, but we know from all the evidence that family learning
is tremendously important to children’s outcomes. In my
experience of fostering, helping foster parents to gain the confidence
to sit with their children on a regular basis over a period of time,
and teaching them the techniques of paired reading with their children,
is immensely beneficial for the literacy of those children. Anecdotally
at least, it strengthens the relationships of the foster carers and the

responsiveness to parents. He is also right to say how immensely

been extraordinarily successful and most productive. It is the

the list, does that mean that parents can expect their child to have
access to one of those schools if they 
<?notus-xml column=620?>satisfy the criteria for any particular school? What the code of
practice does not say is that the special schools in other local
authority areas are part of that individual local authority’s
offer; it is simply about where to find the list. That is not clear
enough in terms of specifying such provision as a possible element in
the local offer of that local authority. The Minister should state the

employment once they have got a job. They need the support of someone

solutions for dozens of different types of problems. You can now get a
computer which bounces light off the user’s eyes to transfer the
user around the screen. This was pure science fiction a few years ago.
You have to run to keep up with the ideas and even the names of the

people to act independently. I could have stuck something at the end of
another list about independence. I could have added a paragraph (d) to
subsection (3) to provide that when you go into adult life you get a
package to go with you. You probably already do. Access to work will
give you 
<?notus-xml column=623?>some assistance, so there is a degree of consensus around this. Getting
assistive technology early is very important because it allows people
independence. I hope my noble friend will be able to give me some idea
about how it is being taken on. What is being done to allow people to
work like this? It is great to have somebody at your shoulder who
assists you all the time. Unfortunately, you cannot take them home with
you or guarantee that they will be with you when you are middle-aged,
so learning to use other forms of assistance is vital. I hope that we

idea of the expression “assessment settings” is to find
out how we will integrate the use of information technology into the
examination system. The noble Lord, Lord Nash, has proved himself
tough, durable but human by not being here. I have had some discussions
with him on this subject. The Government seem interested in making sure
that you can get into the examination system properly—I will
return to this subject when we reach apprenticeships—but only if
you make sure that the examination that is set online is compatible
with the assistive technology that is used. If you get the wrong
format, the two computing systems cannot talk to each other, so you
cannot take the examination. In many parts of the examination system we
go back to nurse—an amanuensis or extra time. It does not take a
genius to figure out that those are two fairly blunt instruments. The
first removes a great deal of responsibility from you, and the other is
of limited utility. Extra time has attracted a great deal of attention
because people say people are getting more of it. I have always
wondered how much assistance extra time is if you do not know the
answer. I suspect that 25% extra time to stare at a blank page does not
help very much.</hs_para>

some idea of how that is progressing in the Government’s

115, I make no apology for continuing to major on speech, language and
communication needs, despite the Minister’s welcome reassurance
to me that they were climbing up the list of priorities. As I have
said, bearing in mind that speech, language and communication needs are
a growing 21st-century scourge, I would like to see them coupled with
special educational needs in education, health and care plans, which
are made for everyone—not just those with such needs. Amendment
115 is a probing amendment to ensure that children and young people
with speech, language and communication needs who are not eligible for
an EHC plan will not be overlooked by services available under local
offers. In that connection, I am very glad to see that paragraph 11(a)
of the 
<?notus-xml column=624?>schedule to the draft code of practice states that local offers must set
out what speech language therapy provision is available. The Government
should therefore also stipulate that local authorities’ local
offers must be backed up by evidence-based research, on which I commend
to the Government the Better Communications Research Programme, whose
reports they published last year.</hs_para>

117. Local offers, however well intentioned, are bound to end up as
postcode lotteries if we are not careful—hence my call for a
strategy. The Minister told the Committee that a strategy was in place
for the period when a child was in school during its nought to 25
pathway, but it is not apparent for the periods before and after that,
or indeed in linking those three periods together in what I call the
child development strategy. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Nash, for his
recent letter on teacher training but I am not wholly reassured. He
referred to assessments and professional judgment but did not confirm
whether child development is taught, compulsorily, during all teacher
training to enable teachers to do what he describes in his letter. I
would be grateful for confirmation that that is
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T17:48:04"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Communications Research Programme, which I mentioned, showed that too
many children enter school without their speech, language and
communication needs being satisfactorily addressed, or even identified.
This is being addressed in the early years foundation stage. I have
already drawn attention to the need for health visitors and others who
carry out assessments to be trained by speech and language therapists
to identify the indicators of speech, language and communication needs.
In an overall strategy there would then be a “So
what?”—remedial treatment designed to enable every child
to engage with its teacher, and so with education, to the best of his
or her ability. However, to ensure that this happens, local authorities
must be held to account for their service provision, including their
mechanisms for identifying needs. I believe that is best done by
independent quality assurance by an inspector or regulator.</hs_para>

Minister. I am trying to put myself in the position of a local
authority or the relevant responsible people in a local authority. The
better the service they provide or purport to provide, the more people
they will have to provide that service for because people will
immigrate into their area. Does the money follow the quality of the
service that is being supplied or is the pupil premium all they get? If
the latter, the local authority has a very strong incentive to tone
down its prospectus as far as possible because it does not want to
attract more people into its area at the expense of the council tax

Amendment 109. I welcome Clause 30(3) because it outlines the provision
to assist young people in preparation for adulthood. This preparation
includes, among other things, assistance in finding employment. This is
welcome but I am not sure that it goes far enough, and that is why I

help to prepare young people to stay in work or to access any benefits
that they need or are entitled to. The inclusion would also form part

finding employment, many skills are involved in retaining it. Support

information relating to training, the sharing of good practice and
local authority support is made available. We believe that this detail

admissions authority for the vast majority of schools in its area. That
position has changed dramatically, with most schools now being their
own admissions authority. We understand that noble Lords want
admissions to operate fairly. The Government share that aim and a
number of measures are in place to support it. They are set out in
Section 6.8 of the draft SEN code of practice and include
the requirements of the school admissions code and the Equality Act
2010. I hope that my noble friend will take that back to my other noble

108A from my noble friend Lord Addington, we recognise the importance
of specialist support, assistive technology and accessible publications

to Amendment 109, we can assure the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, and

is. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, noted, the draft code of

accessing any benefits from the Department of Work and Pensions, both
when looking for work and when employed.</hs_para>

said that Amendment 106B, in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe

amendments are about introducing a degree of accountability,
consistency and quality control into the local offer. These ideas have
already been broached but the amendments seek to take the discussion
further and perhaps anchor it even more firmly. I imagine that I am not

the information is intended to benefit effectively to police the system

all be the same. I understand that the Minister will not want to

in the introduction of new systems such as this, it would be rash not
to build any element of accountability or quality control into the
process. The amendment therefore seeks to have both Ofsted and the Care
Quality Commission involved in reviewing local offers to make sure that
they provide an accurate picture of the services available to young
people and their families so that they have access to accurate and
quality information. This would ensure that the services provided by
all providers were described and assessed on a comparable basis. Under
current arrangements there is no parity between providers, which all
have different audit and inspection arrangements, thereby making it
difficult for young people and their families to make like-for-like
comparisons of services included in the local offer.</hs_para>

Ramsbotham:</Member></B> My Lords, I take up the offer made by my noble
friend Lord Low to say a little a bit about the quality assurance I
have in mind. Noble Lords may remember two extremely good safeguarding
reports produced by the joint inspectorates involved in education,
health and the criminal justice system, one in 1999 and the other in
2003. Those came about in the balmy days before the then Chancellor of
the Exchequer, Mr Gordon Brown, axed what had been the Social Services
Inspectorate and became the Commission for Social Care Inspection. The
role of social care responsibility for children was then taken on by
Ofsted and that of adult social care by the Care Quality Commission,
which was instigated by the reforms that had to follow the axing of the
Social Services Inspectorate. I have always regretted strongly that
although this House was able to preserve Her Majesty’s
Inspectorate of Prisons we were unable to preserve the Social Services
Inspectorate. Frankly, we have been reaping the wind every
since.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000208" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000208">My
feeling about what we are talking about here is that we need something
akin to the inspections for the safeguarding of children carried out by
the joint inspectorates. They were led by someone with overall
responsibility but able to call on the quality assurance addition of
the inspectors of particular elements of the system. In this case, we
have healthcare and education but also other things including the local
offer, how that is made and so on. That is why I laid this false trail,
as it were, to the Children’s Commissioner. I suggest to the
Minister that in thinking about the quality of what we are
proposing—and what the Government are very definitely interested
in introducing—the assurance on that is carried out by those
best able to do it working together, rather than giving it to any one
person, because there are so many aspects to it. Quality assurance is
absolutely essential and must be objective and consistent in every part

Brinton:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 113 in my
name and to Amendment 114 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Low.
Amendment 113 is a probing amendment to seek clarity from the
Government on whether they are willing to provide a national or common
framework to support the development of local offers so that parents
can easily identify how provision varies. Parents of children with
sensory impairments support proposals to improve transparency. This
amendment was suggested to some 
<?notus-xml column=633?>of us by the National Deaf Children’s Society, RNIB and Sense.
Some parents have reported that under the current
arrangements:</hs_para>

information pack when my child was diagnosed, but half of it
wasn’t relevant to deaf children and it didn’t include
information on the local deaf
school”.</hs_quote><hs_para UID="13103084000210" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000210">The
three charities I mentioned support the concept of the local offer, and
it is very important to the 75% of deaf children and 57% of children
with sight loss who do not have a statement of SEN. The draft code of
practice and regulations set out what information is to be included as
part of the local offer and are very detailed. However, they do not
specify how information should be broken down, nor do they set out a
template that local authorities should work to that would make that
comparison easier. In the absence of a common format, I am not sure
that I can believe that the local offer will genuinely improve
transparency over what help is available to these children. The local
offer will be helpful only if local authorities are required to publish
information about support available for different types of SEN. The
needs of children with SEN are very different; for example, sensory
needs are very different from the needs of autistic children. If the
Government are not minded to create a set template so that parents can
easily compare provision between different areas, I hope they will
discuss it with the Local Government Association so that it can
create a common template, because it would ease local
government’s passage into the new arrangements if there is one
framework to
follow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000211" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000211">Moving
to Amendment 114, the overall accountability framework around the Bill
looks somewhat weak. Noble Lords will have gathered that from my
previous amendment. There seems to be very little to stop a local
authority publishing a weak local offer that is poorly understood or
inaccessible. Despite the Bill frequently referring to improving
accountability, the available rights of recourse for parents are
limited. It is good that parents have the right to leave comments on
the local offer and that they will be published, but there is no
obligation on the local authority to address any of the concerns
raised. Parents have the right to seek a judicial review against the
local authority for failing to meet the requirements set out in the
Bill, but this is not an option that many parents will be able or
willing to pursue.</hs_para>

significant amount of funding is spent on supporting children with high
needs. More than £500 million has been allocated by the
Department for Education for this year. Many are concerned that there
is relatively weak oversight of how this funding is spent and of
whether it leads to improved outcomes. As well as leading to doubts
about whether SEN provision is effective, it also raises questions
about value for money and scrutiny of expenditure. There needs to be a
stronger external accountability around the local offer. As has been
already outlined by the noble Lords, Lord Ramsbotham and Lord Low, this
could be taken up by Ofsted or the Children’s
Commissioner<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:29:39"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:29:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13103084000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000214">In
another place, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Children

about SEN provision could be covered under Ofsted’s existing

This statement was made in the spring of this year and, unfortunately,
no update has been provided since. I am sure that there needs to be
further certainty on the local offer and accountability before the Bill

the amendments reflect the strong view that the local offer should be
strengthened to ensure that it is a statement that parents, children
and young people can rely on and for which, particularly—the
noble Lord, Lord Low, stressed this—the local authority can be
held accountable. In order to do this, the amendments would create the
minimum standards that have been called for both by the SEN sector and
by the Education Select
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000217" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000217">It
is right to acknowledge that in the lead up to the Bill arriving in
this House, and, indeed, while it was in the other place, there was
considerable debate across the sector as to whether minimum standards
for the local offer were a good idea. People tried to evaluate the
impact of having minimum standards or not. It is also fair to say that
the broad and strong consensus now is that minimum standards are
necessary to ensure reliability and accountability, otherwise there is
a danger that we may end up with a postcode lottery of
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:31:46"></hs_TimeCode>. Again
as the noble Lord, Lord Low said, this is not about being prescriptive
with local authorities but rather ensuring that no child or young
person is left behind or suffers from a poorer service because of where
they

said, and probably will say again, that they feel that minimum
standards will create a race to the bottom, that they will constrain
parents’ and young people’s ability to influence the
local authority to increase service provision, and that that is to be
avoided. The opposite is true. Equally one could argue that if you do
not set a minimum there is a risk that councils will deliberately
weaken their offer and undercut other councils to avoid families moving
in because of resource constraints. There is a real risk that the
quality of service locally will be entirely dependent on budgets and
will be
reduced<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000219">Some
organisations within the sector, for example, the RNIB, NDCS and Sense,
have said that in the absence of any expectations on minimum standards,
local authorities with better provision could reduce it in line with
poorer neighbouring provision, and that too many services—I
agree with this—are already at the bottom or below what parents
should reasonably expect. The Government should move on

Eaton (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I seem to be a lone voice in the
Committee today as I support Clause 30 in its current form.
We should resist making any further amendment to the clause that would
make the measures more prescriptive than they are already. To do so
would needlessly hinder local provision for local issues that are not
foreseeable from a national point of view. I therefore cannot support
Amendment 118 and the others in the group which seek to introduce
minimum standards for the local
offer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:34:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000221">It
is of concern to me that by introducing central prescription we would
reduce the flexibility of local authorities to allow for local
solutions. Government departments are unable to see the detail that is
based on the daily contact and conversations with parents and young
people and are unable to respond to individual and local needs. They
cannot do that in the way that a local authority can. With a variance
in funding for education, including SEN provision, across the
nation’s local authorities such prescriptive measures could
damage in a very real way the ability of local government to cater for
the needs of local
residents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000222">SEN
provision varies between local authorities due to the nature and size
of the local population, with greater needs for levels of service in
some areas and much less requirement in others. By allowing local
authorities to control their own provision, which these amendments
would restrict, those authorities will be better able to provide those
required specialist services. I always think of the example of a child
with severe autism, who may require ballet lessons which would not be
part of an offer. If a local authority is stretched to provide
financial support for the things that it has to do, this removes its
flexibility to deal with individuals on the basis of their
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000223">A
serious concern regarding these amendments is that they would place
duties on local authorities to secure a minimum level of health
provision, when the body responsible for this is not the local
authority but the National Health Service. It is entirely
understandable that local authorities should be very wary of being
responsible for provision over which they have no

flexibility and innovation in service

often heard negative comments today about local authorities’
provision. There is of course always room for improvement but with so
many good quality provisions being made and so much work going on with

should not set expectations at a level that just will not be available

Perhaps more thought could be given between now and Report to how we
ensure that local authorities provide a range of services. I know that
the code says quite a lot about this. My great worry is that if you do
not have something which can be inspected and monitored, and an
expectation of a range of services, some local authorities might end up
with very little indeed in their local offer—and it will be a
postcode lottery. There is a real dilemma in how you maintain that
flexibility yet ensure that families have something they can turn to
which is monitored by either Ofsted or the Care Quality Commission. It
would be quite useful to give some thought to this between now and

brief because most of what I was to say has been said. The aim of
Amendment 118 is to improve accountability around the local offer by
requiring local authorities to meet basic expectations around provision

acute, as we have heard, for children with low incidence special

Walmsley (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have a few additional comments
to make in support of Amendment 113, to which I have added my name. I
reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, that in our amendment we do
not seek a one-size-fits-all approach as far as local authorities are
concerned. Of course we understand, 
<?notus-xml column=637?>and hope, that the provision made will vary from area to area, depending
on the needs of the local population. We are simply looking for some
commonality in the way the offer is expressed. The advantage would be
that it would not just be helpful to parents in enabling them to choose
between one local authority or another if they were able to move from
one to another; there would be two other benefits.</hs_para>

it would deter a local authority from publishing a weak offer, because
it would be very obvious that it was a weak offer. The “very
little indeed”, as expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady
Howarth, would jump off the pages if there were some commonality in the
way that offer was expressed. Secondly, it would help policymakers
because this is a very new system. Undoubtedly the Government will wish
to monitor how it is going and assess where it is going well and where
it is going badly, and whether the regulations need to be tightened up
at some point in the future. It would be very much easier to do that if
there were a common way in which the local offer could be expressed;
otherwise, I can see civil servants spending months digging into all

there is an added complication, as has already been mentioned, that
these are busy people who are already fighting other bits of the
system. It is also not something that affects every citizen. This is a
small and particular group of people. It has not got the voice of the
nation behind it. It is not like “all our schools”,
“all our universities” or “all our elderly care
people”, it is a very small group of people who will have to
fight the good fight. So my starting point is that I am not entirely
confident that there is enough in the system at the moment to guarantee
that it will grow into a strong part of special educational needs

prepared to say that there might be better ways of doing this. I like
the idea of an Ofsted inspection or some other kind of inspection. It
should not be beyond our wit, with so much experience of inspection, to
produce something that does not squeeze the innovation and flexibility
out of the system. This issue must be raised to the top and Ministers
and Government ought to be able to find some ways of creating
incentives to make that
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000236">Three
things need to happen. First, there must be a clear message to parents
that there will be a voice speaking on their behalf to make sure that
the offer is of a good quality. Secondly, there must be incentives to
stop people going below the minimum standards, because if they are not
there, they will. This must be matched by the third
point—incentivising good, innovative and flexible offers that
will be the best that they can be. That may come from inspections
picking out the best examples so that other people can learn from them.
I do not know. That is why I think that the suggestion
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:46:05"></hs_TimeCode> the noble

that if we let this legislation go through with no underpinning in
these early years, it will be very difficult to backtrack because
parents will have lost confidence in it. I do not think that you get a
second go at this. That is my message to the Ministers. It may take the
form of an inspection framework or minimum standards—both are
real runners and could do the job. However, I am not averse to saying
that there might be something else that could accommodate the concerns
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:46:34"></hs_TimeCode> the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton. Finally, I strongly believe that it ought not to

that suggestion, as it fits in with what I was saying earlier. What is
needed is a positive rather than a negative incentive to the local

difficult cases. Would the Government consider the

think that we are all trying to aim for the right result and that we
are probably getting there. I have a number of fears, which were
expressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Eaton. First, there must be some
sort of quality assurance. We must be assured about what is happening
in the local offer. In a sense the clue is in the title: it is a local
offer, not a national offer, and that is really important, so I am not
sure that wielding the inspection stick is the right quality assurance.
I think that it has to be more of a partnership assurance. I fear that,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, said, there would be not so much a
race to the bottom as a race to the minimum. Many local authorities
would be in that position.</hs_para>

inspections—and I am talking about the safeguarding

they were partnership inspections. I call them inspections because they
were carried out by inspectorates but they were partnerships of all the
people involved. The theme always was looking for the Government saying

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been a wide-ranging,
constructive, informed and thoughtful debate. There has been a focus in
these amendments on the accountability of the local offer; they
consider the issue of inspection; and some of them seek to place in the
Bill requirements for minimum standards in the local offer.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:51:36"></hs_TimeCode> noble Lord,
Lord Low, referred to accountability, consistency and quality, and
those themes ran through the
debate<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:51:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000245">On
Amendment 111, the noble Lords, Lord Low and Lord Ramsbotham, raised
the issue of whether the local offer should be inspected by the Care
Quality Commission and Ofsted. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham,
indicated that he was thinking widely around this area, as did other
noble Lords. We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:52:12"></hs_TimeCode>
certainly believe that accountability to parents and young people will
be improved by the transparency which the local offer will bring, with
the direct involvement of children and young people with SEN and their
parents in shaping and reviewing it.</hs_para>

recognise the importance of joint working between clinical
commissioning groups and local authorities in developing the services
in the local offer.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:52:34"></hs_TimeCode> understand
the views that have been expressed about the value of external
inspection in relation to accountability, a major theme of the debate.
I would point out that the democratic accountability that local
authorities must face is one element of the issue.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:53:14"></hs_TimeCode> have heard
what noble Lords have said and I hope that they will be pleased that we
have asked Ofsted to study and report on how best to identify best
practice in preparing for SEN reforms—a fact picked up by the
noble Baroness, Lady Morris—and to consider particularly whether
there is a need for an inspection framework to drive improvements.
Ofsted will link with the CQC in this work and I hope that noble Lords
will welcome that. We will flag this debate to those organisations
because it will help to focus minds and inform
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T18:53:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000247">I
hope noble Lords will agree that, at this point, we should not place a
requirement to inspect on either the CQC or Ofsted until we have the
findings of that study. Once the survey is complete, I assure noble

noble Lord, Lord Low, and others are right to say that we would not
wish to be over-prescriptive. There was a wide-ranging debate about the
pros and cons of that approach. We want the local offer to encourage
local authorities to be innovative, develop a sense of partnership with
local children, young people and families, and reflect local need. I
thank my noble friends Lady Eaton and Lord Storey, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Howarth, for their understanding and support on that
perspective. I certainly found very encouraging the reports that we
heard the other day from the pathfinders on the different, imaginative
approaches they take to this area. I hope that noble Lords who were not
at that meeting will have an opportunity to hear more about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000249" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000249">Some
noble Lords referred to minimum standards. I can tell the noble
Baroness, Lady Hughes, that indeed we feel that minimum standards could
weaken parents’ and young people’s ability to influence
their local authority and provide local accountability. As
other 
<?notus-xml column=641?>noble Lords indicated, local authorities could simply point to the fact
that they have met the minimum standard and that would be that. There
could indeed be a race to the bottom, which we must avoid. I agree with

top.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000250" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000250">On
Amendment 113, I recognise the good intentions of my noble friends Lady
Brinton and Lady Walmsley in terms of the format of the local offer in
the Bill. Again, I stress that transparency and accessibility are key
themes of the local offer and we agree that a level of consistency will
help with that. The local offer regulations and chapter 5 of the code
of practice, in our view, provide a common framework to secure
consistency. I know that noble Lords recognise that and debated whether
it was really the case but we feel it provides a common framework so
that families have the information they need to make comparisons
between local authorities. Noble Lords may wish to look specifically at
page 44 of the new code of practice, which lists what a local offer
must include. However, we deliberately did not require a specific
format for the local offer because we want to see local people shape
each one, including the format it should take. We have already seen
this happening on the ground, as illustrated in what the pathfinders
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000251" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0001.htm#13103084000251">On the

debate we were going along quite nicely and there was a lot of
agreement on four propositions: first, that the local offer is a
statement of expectation, not provision; secondly, that the local offer
is essentially a statement of information on education, health and
social care provision; thirdly, that 25% of children and young people
with a disability do not have a special educational need and therefore
would not be able to access the local offer; and, finally, that the
local offer is not enforceable. Therefore, while parents are given
information about provision there is no requirement on the authority to
make the
provision<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:01:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

widened. I want to avoid saying that the rot set in with the noble
Baroness, Lady Eaton, because, as I will make clear, the contributions
from her and the noble Baronesses, Lady Howarth and Lady Morris,
towards the end of the debate added a considerable element of richness
and sophistication to the discussion, and we need to take them on
board. The noble Baroness, Lady Eaton, was worried that there was an
anti-local authority spirit in the amendments, and she and others were
concerned that the thrust of the amendments was too prescriptive. I
want to be clear that there was no intention on my part or anyone
else’s to be anti-local authority or to manifest a down on those
authorities. Anyone who is familiar with the educational work of local
authorities, especially in the field of special education, knows the

amendments are prescriptive, I should say that this would not be the
first time that there was guidance from the centre on the
implementation of policy locally. The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, who
I think has a background in local government—she was leaning to
embrace the local authority perspective—got it absolutely right
when she said that it would be too risky to dispense with guidance
entirely when implementing a wholly new system of this kind. We have to
strike the right balance as regards central guidance. The noble Lords
behind these amendments had no intention of talking in terms of

Low of Dalston:</Member></B> This is beginning to feel a bit like hard
work. I shall speak also to my Amendment 126, which is in
this group. I am not quite sure why it is in this group but it is, so I
shall speak to it. Clause 33 provides that a local authority is not
required to secure the education of a child or young person with 
<?notus-xml column=644?>special educational needs in a maintained nursery school, mainstream
school or mainstream post-16 institution where it is incompatible with
the provision of efficient education for others. This reproduces the
wording of the current legislation relating to school education but is
not present in the current learning difficulty assessment guidance that
covers learners moving to and within post-16 provision. It has been put
to me that subsection (2)(b) should be deleted to ensure that colleges
and post-16 institutions continue to make the necessary adjustments to
include disabled applicants. This includes making adjustments to
provisions, criteria and practices, and the provision of auxiliary aids
and services.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103084000265" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000265">In the context of
post-16 education, the retention of subsection (2)(b) could undermine
students’ existing rights and protections under the Equality
Act, and provide an excuse for colleges to exclude learners with
learning difficulties and/or disabilities on the grounds of cost or
inconvenience to other students. In other words, it would interpose a
hurdle that does not exist at present in relation to post-16 education.
Furthermore, there is an inconsistency in that those learners without
an education, health and care plan cannot be refused a place on these
grounds. The implication is that a disabled person with a plan
potentially has fewer rights than one without. It is not quite clear
why subsection (2)(b) is needed when the Equality Act is clear on the
requirements around reasonable adjustments.</hs_para>

arguments clearly have force so far as post-school education is
concerned but, thinking about it, they have just as much force as
regards school education. In any case, in a Bill which introduces a
unified approach for all those aged nought to 25, it seems clear that
the language should be consistent across the whole age
range. It therefore seems only right to delete subsection
(2)(b) altogether, which is what Amendment 123A would
achieve.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000267" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000267">The
purpose of Amendment 126 is to protect a child or young person with a
special educational need and ensure that they get the education and
support best suited to them. The provision contained in
Clause 34(9) would allow a special school, academy or free
school to admit a child without a statutory assessment of their needs
and without an education, health and care plan. Currently, any child
who has special educational needs but who does not have a statement
must be educated in a mainstream school. The change that Clause 34(9)
would bring about undermines a long-standing consensus that children
and young people should be placed in special schools only where this
has been identified as being the most appropriate placement, following
a statutory assessment process, and where it is in line with the wishes
of the parent.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103084000268" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000268">The draft code of
practice suggests that an individual professional, such as an
educational psychologist, could provide a report to support a
child’s admission to a special academy or free school. This
could constitute a diminution in parents’ rights to express a
preference for a particular school in the full knowledge of the nature
of their child’s needs, as assessed by a range of professionals.
Inclusion of this provision seems to devalue the assessment and
planning process which sits at the heart of the Government’s
reforms. It seems 
<?notus-xml column=645?>obvious, too, that any head teacher would want as much information as
possible about a new child or young person with a special educational
need to be sure that the school could meet their needs.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13103084000269" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000269">There
is also concern that a placement agreed in this way without an
assessment and a plan would provide parents and carers with no
entitlement to an annual review or any right of appeal. This provision
would also make it easier for those head teachers who are reluctant to
accept a child or young person with a special educational need to try
to persuade parents that their child would be better off in a special
school, thus undermining the principle of inclusion we were talking
about last week. Therefore, it seems clear that the process of
admission of children and young people with special educational needs
to special schools should continue to be based on assessment, as at
present. It would be dangerous to dispense with that, as I think would
be the result of Clause 34(9). I beg to

about inclusion and access to mainstream education in Committee last
week, but I am very pleased to have the opportunity to return to some
of those issues. During that debate, the Minister sought to reassure us
that duties were already in existence, including under the Equality Act
2010, to prevent discrimination against disabled people and that that
addressed some of the issues about which we were concerned. However, I
support the amendments that have been tabled by the noble Baroness,
Lady Howe, because she has identified some of the remaining
contradictions between the Equality Act and some of the duties that
this Bill is spelling out. It is important that those issues are
bottomed out, and I support her amendments.</hs_para>

that, by agreeing to this wording unamended, we will be introducing a
get-out clause which would allow schools to duck out of their
responsibilities to provide mainstream education when requested. As the
noble Lord, Lord Low, pointed out, Clause 33 places a duty on local
authorities to ensure that children and young people with an EHC plan
are placed in mainstream education. There are two important caveats.
The first is if a place is incompatible with the wishes of the
child’s parents or the young person. Obviously we support that
caveat. As we have said before, parental choice and the views of young
people are crucial in identifying the best educational provision for a
particular child.</hs_para>

wording raises questions about who defines what level of disruption is
incompatible with efficient education. For example, could it be argued
that any 
<?notus-xml column=646?>child with health issues in a school environment could potentially
interfere with the efficient education of others? Or could any child
whose educational needs required additional attention from a teacher
arguably be taking the teacher’s time away from others, thereby
affecting their education? How far are we going to apply this
wording?</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103084000275" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000275">The
Minister said that the Equality Act protects against discrimination,
but is there not something rather worrying about defining disabled
children’s rights by the level of inconvenience that they might
cause? Therefore, our amendment would remove that reference and replace
it with a much more positive commitment to meet the specific needs of
children and young
people.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000276" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000276">Reference
has been made to the draft code of conduct. It appears to me that it
adds a further reason why a request for mainstream education could be
refused, and that is the incompatibility with the efficient use of
resources. As I understand it, this used to be a factor that schools
could fall back on, basically arguing that it was too costly to educate
children with SEN in mainstream schools. However, it was removed by the
previous Government in 2001, so it now appears that we are going
backwards, making it more difficult to access mainstream
education.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13103084000277" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000277">We
believe that ensuring that the needs and wishes of children, young
people and their families ought to be the only justifiable basis on
which they should be placed in a non-mainstream setting. We acknowledge
that many mainstream schools still lack the capacity to provide a good
education to children with certain learning difficulties and
disabilities, but surely the solution is to address those failings in a
structured and positive way within a given timetable, not to give those
schools an opt-out. However, we have to accept that some schools are
reluctant to admit children with special educational needs or to take
the steps necessary to modify their facilities, particularly with the
pressure of league tables uppermost in their minds. There is no doubt
that some academies and free schools are seeking to operate more
stringent admissions policies. This comes back to the issues raised by
the Equality and Human Rights Commission about the alignment of the
reasonable adjustment duty with the duties in the Bill. We need to make
sure that they are properly aligned. Our concern is that the provisions
in the Bill and the draft code of conduct give schools an excuse not to
make any changes.</hs_para>

issue was addressed with some passion by several noble Lords, including
the noble Baroness, Lady Grey-Thompson. We feel there is a need to
address the failings in the Bill and the code in this respect. The
Green Paper referred to creating a bias towards inclusion. If we are
serious about that, we should remove Clause 33(2)(b). In his letter to
Peers after Second Reading, the Minister referred to the fact that the
Bill already provides for the wishes of children, young people and
their parents to be taken into account and, of course, it does, but
that misses the point if their wishes can be overridden by the needs of
so-called efficient education for others or the efficient use of
resources. I hope the Minister will take these issues seriously and
look again at what we believe 
<?notus-xml column=647?>is increasingly backward-looking wording which goes so far against the

any child who has special educational needs but does not have a
statement must be educated in a mainstream school. There are no
exceptions to this duty, which helps ensure that children and young
people are not inappropriately placed in special schools. The concern
is that Clause 34(3) allows special academies, including free schools,
to admit children or young people permanently without them having had
their special educational needs statutorily assessed or an EHC plan
having been put in place for them. This proposal seems to undermine the
principle that a mainstream school must be able to make provision for
all children without a statement or plan and for most children with a
statement or plan.</hs_para>

academies will need to make it clear through their funding agreement
that a child or young person with SEN but no EHC plan should be placed
there only at the request of their parents or at their own request and
with the support of professional advice, such as a report from an
educational psychologist, the concern is that there is no formal role
for the local authority in this process. The worry is that this
proposal will make the local authority’s role of planning
provision for pupils with SEN, including provision for children and
young persons with EHC plans, extremely difficult.</hs_para>

through, there would be a danger that mainstream special schools would
be incentivised to persuade parents that their child would be better
off in a special school just because they do not want them in their
schools. This would take us back to the situation that existed before
the Education Act 1981. There could also be a situation where special
academies increasingly enrolled pupils with less complex needs, which
would beg the question of where children with complex needs would go.
If this clause remains, I would question the point of mainstream places
within a special
school.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000283" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000283">I fear
that this proposal would result in medical labels determining whether a
child secures a place in a special academy. If a special academy had
been set up for a particular type of SEN—for example, SpLD or
ASD/Asperger’s—would it result in an increase in the
number of children being diagnosed with that condition? How can the
Government ensure that there is a framework process so that
inappropriate placements do not
occur?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000284" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000284">There
are also concerns about the practical impact on admissions and places.
Would decisions be taken solely by schools and parents, and how would
educational psychologists’ views be protected and advocated? How
would places be allocated within school year groups? If there was
parental demand, could the funding agreement be varied to allow more
non-EHC plan 
<?notus-xml column=648?>places? The policy also begs the key question what the aspiration would
be for a child without an EHC plan in a special academy. Would there be
an exit plan? Who would set the child targets and ensure that they are
making adequate
progress?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000285" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000285">This
amendment has been tabled because it is hoped that the Minister will
look again at the proposals and help to allay serious concerns in the
SEN sector that this clause could result in children and young people
being inappropriately placed in special schools. Ideally, the
Association of Educational Psychologists would like to see the clause
amended so that special academies are not able to admit children and
young people without an EHC plan. I hope that when the Minister replies

nothing extra. However, some disabled pupils will not have special

needs will still need reasonable adjustments to be made for them in
addition to any support they receive through the special educational

school to take positive steps to ensure that disabled students can

adjustments are inexpensive and will often involve a change of practice
rather than the provision of expensive pieces of equipment or
additional staff. Many of the reasonable adjustments that schools 
<?notus-xml column=649?>are already making for disabled pupils undoubtedly include the use of
some auxiliary aids, such as coloured layovers for dyslexic pupils, pen
grips, adapted PE equipment and adapted keyboards and computer
software. These adjustments are often low cost and easily
available—indeed, some of them were mentioned by the noble Lord,
Lord Addington. For example, a disabled pupil has a statement of
special educational needs and attends a mainstream secondary school.
Through her statement, she receives two hours a week of specialist
teaching and uses an electronic note-taker in lessons. Since the
support that she requires is provided through her statement, the school
does not have to make reasonable adjustments by providing these
auxiliary aids and services for her. A second example would be where a
disabled pupil at an infants’ school has diabetes and requires
daily support with reading blood sugar levels and insulin injections.
He is not classified as having special educational needs and therefore
receives no support through the SEN framework. He is, however,
disabled, and if the lack of daily support places him at a substantial
disadvantage, the school is under a duty to make the adjustment of
providing support if it would be reasonable to do so.</hs_para>

the whole school. It is nevertheless challenging to try as far as
possible to include every child in schools. I am reminded of the

high-status teaching profession and for many years has successfully
recruited and retained high-calibre graduates who work seamlessly with
health and other social services in that country.</hs_para>

good opportunity to thank the Minister for his recent letter following
our debate on child development training for teachers. He highlighted
that, in these standards for teachers, there is a now a clear standard
for child development. That is very welcome. I think of an experience a
few years ago, working with a child psychotherapist on a paper. He
provided support to staff groups in 10 schools in Brent, north London.
He found that teachers and school staff who had this support—a
group discussion of work in the school—on a regular basis were
found, over a period of time, to have a lower rate of sickness absence
because they had the opportunity to think about what they were doing,
and were supported in that by a professional. He also offered the
service to Westminster School, around the corner from here, of which he

Amendment 125. I was slightly surprised by this amendment and spent
some time puzzling as to what the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, meant by
it. I am not totally sure when my name got attached to it but it did
and I therefore briefed myself accordingly. I think I am right that the

I have a question about this area. I really saw this as a probing
amendment because I cannot quite see how it is compatible with Clause
59, which deals with the local authority paying fees for special
educational provision and makes it quite clear. My reading of Clause 34
is that it effectively says that no child may go to a special school
except in very special circumstances and when everybody else agrees.
Then Clause 59 makes it clear that a child without an EHC plan may be
at a special school and paid for by a local authority. Yet it may be
that that child, without an EHC plan and paid for by a local authority,
needs to be assessed and sent to a special school. It strikes me that

Nash:</Member></B> I thank noble Lords for their amendments on
inclusive provision. This is the second debate that we have had on the
principle of inclusion. Today’s debate has focused on how
decisions are made about where individual children and young people
with EHC plans are taught. As I said in responding to our earlier
debate, our aim with this Bill is to build on what has gone before and
to create a new framework that improves 
<?notus-xml column=651?>both support for children and young people so that they achieve better
outcomes and choice for parents and young people.</hs_para>

123A and 124, from the noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baronesses,
Lady Hughes and Lady Jones, together, as they both relate to the
factors that local authorities should take into account when naming an
education setting in a child or young person’s EHC plan, where
no request has been made for a particular institution or the parent or
young person’s request for one has not been met. The statutory
provisions in the Bill are designed to ensure that a mainstream place
is considered thoroughly and properly, recognising that, with the right
support, children and young people with special educational needs are
successfully supported in mainstream settings. They also recognise that
there will be occasions where a child’s inclusion in a
mainstream setting would significantly impact on the education of
others, whose interests should also be safeguarded. This could occur,
for example, when the extremely challenging and disruptive behaviour of
a child or young person could not be managed. The provision for local
authorities to consider the efficient education of others is important
in this
respect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000300" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000300">I
understand concerns about this condition being used indiscriminately.
Clause 33(3) and (4) guard against this. A local authority can only
rely on it if there are no reasonable steps that could be taken to
prevent the placement of the child or young person being incompatible
with the efficient education of others. In section 7.11 of the draft
SEN code of practice, we set out a number of examples of reasonable
steps that can be taken to support inclusion. I believe that provision
on meeting the specific needs of the child should not be the preserve
of a single clause. It is at the heart of Part 3 and is reflected in
Clause 19 on general principles, Clause 36 on assessments and EHC
plans, Clause 42 on duties to secure provision in EHC plans and
Clause 62 on the duty on schools to use their best
endeavours to meet children’s
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000301">Regarding

colleges a get-out clause by allowing them to refuse entry to disabled
students that they previously would have accepted in line with their
duties under the Equality Act, I can assure noble Lords that the
Equality Act 2010 will continue to apply in full to colleges, and that
they must continue to make reasonable adjustments to support the
participation of disabled young people. Nothing in this Bill overrides
these very important duties imposed by the Equality
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000302">We
believe that the principle behind Clause 33 is the right one. Young
people with EHC plans should have the right to be educated in a
mainstream setting if that is what they want. This Bill, for the first

requesting that a particular school or college is named in their EHC

<?notus-xml column=652?>drawn attention to the Equality Act duties in the SEN code of practice,
in Chapters 1 and 6, and referred to other relevant guidance on those
duties. We recognise the importance of making appropriate links between
SEN and the Equality Act duties in the code of practice, and in last

Amendment 125 in the name of the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, and my
noble friend Lady Sharp. The provision in Clause 34(3) is designed to
allow children and young people with special educational needs who do
not have an education, health and care plan to be educated in an
independent school, non-maintained special school or independent
special post-16 institution where someone other than the local
authority or the Secretary of State—most likely the
child’s parents or the young person themselves—makes the
arrangements and meets the costs. I am concerned that
Amendment 125 would remove that possibility and deny those
without EHC plans the chance to be taught in such settings where it was
their wish and public funds were not involved. I assure the noble
Baroness that there is no dark plan here. We are merely trying to
expand provision and choice. Choice for parents and young people is
essential, and I do not wish to restrict
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000305" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000305">I
thank the noble Lord, Lord Low, for tabling Amendment 126 and enabling
us to debate the provision in Clause 34(9). This provision would enable
a child or young person with SEN but without an EHC plan to be educated
in a special academy, special free school or special post-16 academy
whose academy arrangements permitted this. It is intended to allow some
flexibility in the application of the general principle of inclusion
for children and young people with special educational needs who do not
have an EHC
plan.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000306" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000306">The
admission of children or young people without education, health and
care plans to special academies or special post-16 academies would be
limited to those where the Secretary of State for Education had agreed
to permit this in their funding agreement. The Government’s
intention is to facilitate innovative new approaches and new provision.
The Secretary of State would look carefully at the detail of any
proposal made by a special academy or special post-16 academy,
considering its educational merits and
viability.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000307" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000307">It
is important for noble Lords to note that a child or young person
without an EHC plan would be placed at such an institution only if
their parents or the young person themselves requested it. Funding
agreements would stipulate that the special academy or special post-16
academy could admit only children or young people with the type of SEN
for which they were designated and that their admission should be
supported by relevant professional opinion, such as that of an
educational psychologist. The academy would also have to adopt fair
practices and arrangements in accordance with those in the school
admissions code for the admission of children without an EHC plan.
Therefore, this is not a blanket policy. It is  
<?notus-xml column=653?>designed to improve provision for those without plans while putting
safeguards in place to address the concerns expressed by the noble
Lord, Lord Low, and
others.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000308" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000308">Concerning
the point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Low, that the proposal to
allow special academies and free schools to admit children without EHC
plans will encourage schools to turn away children with SEN, no pupil
should leave the roll of their school unless they are either
permanently excluded or their parent wishes them to move to a different
school. For that reason, no academy or indeed any school will be able
to use the new provisions in this way. The regulations and statutory
guidance on exclusions apply to academies and maintained schools.
Therefore, if a school or academy wishes to exclude a child, it must
follow proper statutory processes, and we will take a very firm
approach with any school abusing those processes. Also, knowing, as I
do, the sort of people who are responsible for running academies, I do
not believe that this approach is one with which they would wish to be
associated. Certainly in my own school, we did not believe in exclusion
other than in absolute extremis which, thankfully, in more than five
years, we had to resort to in only a couple of
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-30T19:49:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103084000309" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-gc0002.htm#13103084000309">We

to improve outcomes for all children and young people with special

reflect the principle that mainstream education is right for most
children and young people, and they seek to improve choice and
safeguard appropriately the interests of other children. As I said
before, I would be happy to have further discussions with noble Lords

adopting the list of legislative and non-legislative ‘A’
items, Environment Ministers had an exchange of views on the proposal
to amend the Shipments of Waste Regulation. The Commission emphasised
the potentially severe environmental impact of the dumping or
mismanagement of waste. The strengthening of inspections could bring
economic benefits for Member States. All Member States welcomed the
potential of the proposals to improve compliance with the waste
shipments regulation. The UK and Bulgaria argued that further
consideration was required as the proposal risked failing to achieve
its objectives. Several Member States agreed with the UK’s
concern that requiring the publication of detailed inspection plans
could be counterproductive. The UK argued that such detailed proposals
were contrary to the principle of subsidiarity. The UK would prefer an
obligation on Member States 
<?notus-xml column=137?>and their authorities to plan effectively for inspections, without being
overly prescriptive. A number of Member States, including Germany,
supported the
UK.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103057000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-wms0001.htm#13103057000015">Council
Conclusions were adopted on the preparations for the 19th session of
the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework
Convention on Climate Change (the “Warsaw COP”). Mr Davey
and Ministerial colleagues focussed their discussions on paragraphs
relating to pre-2020 mitigation ambition and the process towards the
new 2015 global agreement, including the UN Secretary General's
announcement to host a Leaders’ Summit in
2014.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103057000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-wms0001.htm#13103057000016">There
was a great deal of discussion on the importance of a timetable for the
proposal of commitments for the new 2015 global agreement. Mr Davey,
supported by many colleagues, emphasised that the aim was to ensure
countries left the Warsaw COP knowing they had to do their
“homework” on commitments in 2014. This was consistent
with the EU’s previous public statements proposing a stepwise
approach to the 2015 agreement. Mr Davey also pressed firmly for
Ministerial engagement on pre-2020 mitigation ambition at the Warsaw
COP. Conclusions meeting UK objectives in these areas were adopted.
Ministers then broke for a working lunch, during which Green
Infrastructure was
discussed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103057000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-wms0001.htm#13103057000017">In
the afternoon session the Presidency introduced the agenda item on
CO<Sub>2</Sub> emissions from new passenger cars, inviting
interventions from any Member States who could not agree with or had
misgivings about the text negotiated in June under the Irish
Presidency. The German Minister for Environment, Nature Conversation
and Nuclear Safety, Peter Altmaier, explained he was committed to
reaching a first reading agreement on the basis of the previous
trilogue discussions that accepted the target of 95g/km for 2020, but
that allowed some further limited

Member States supported the request for further consideration, and
others offered support for finding a compromise. Mr Davey supported the
request for further consideration in the light of these concerns, and
the suggestion that the Presidency and Commission develop further
proposals that would generate greater consensus. He nonetheless noted
that the compromise package on the table was a good compromise
and we should only be looking to minor amendments. The
Presidency concluded that it would talk to the Commission, keeping in
mind that a resolution was needed as soon as possible, and that it
would keep Member States informed of
developments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103057000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030-wms0001.htm#13103057000019">In

Sustainable Development; the Special Event towards achieving the
Millennium Development Goals; and the Diplomatic Conference for the
Minamata Convention on Mercury. There were no interventions from Member

Luxembourg Rail Protocol is intended to facilitate the financing of
high-value railway rolling stock by seeking to ensure protection, for
example of a leasing company's rights against defaulters, by a method
of central registration, priority and common contractual terms. One of
the purposes of this is to reduce the costs of leasing contracts for
rolling stock. The Rail Protocol does this by providing an
international mechanism whereby financial interests in railway rolling
stock may be registered in a central database. Where an interest is
registered a rule of priority would operate in favour of that interest,
so protecting the investment where the operator of the rolling stock
defaults on his obligations. The financial interest is protected and
recoverable except when those financial interests rest in public
service rolling stock in respect of which an appropriate declaration
has been made. Protecting an investment in this way increases
the confidence of leasing companies, and could thereby lead to a
reduction in costs for industry.</hs_para>

published with a legal base falling within Title V of Part Three of the
Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU)—Justice
and Home Affairs (JHA) matters. The citation of a Title V (JHA) legal
base would usually mean that there would be universal acceptance that
the UK’s JHA Opt-in Protocol applies and that the UK would
therefore be free to choose whether to participate. However, the EU
Institutions do not accept that the JHA Opt-in Protocol applies when
the relevant JHA provisions fall in an area of exclusive external
competence —as is the case here. The Government believes that
the UK opt in under the Protocol to Title V of the Treaty on the
Functioning of the European Union applies and it has therefore asserted
its right to choose whether to opt in; it has decided it is in the
UK’s best interests to do so.</hs_para>

Ahmad of Wimbledon (Con):</Member> We have introduced changes to the
Prison and YOI rules that enable Governors and Independent Adjudicators
to order compensation from individuals in custody who intentionally
cause damage to property or the fabric of the custodial institution.
The imposition of a compensation order will always take into account
the particular circumstances of the individual concerned and will never
exceed the value of the damage caused. Young people who are at risk of
harm, who have special educational needs or who have mental health
difficulties will not be excluded from the requirement to pay
compensation where they have damaged property or the fabric of the
custodial institution, but Governors are obliged to consider each young
person’s particular circumstances when considering the amount of
compensation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13103061000227" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131030w0001.htm#13103061000227">The
changes to the Prison and YOI rules are supported by a Prison Service
Instruction (PSI 31/2013). Although the Children's Commissioner was not
