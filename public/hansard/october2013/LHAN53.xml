people greater powers to tackle problem drinking late at night. I am
pleased to say that Newcastle is scheduled to be the first area to
introduce a late night levy on 1 November. This will make premises
selling alcohol late at night contribute to the cost of policing. A

that since only two late night levies—and no early morning

years ago, these measures should be more closely targeted on areas and
premises that cause the problems, particularly areas of cumulative
impact? Secondly, will my noble friend explain how the

curb the number of licences issued, particularly in areas of cumulative

measures we have introduced enables licensing authorities to target
problem premises and areas; for example, we have reduced the evidential

policies that can apply now to the on and off trade

discussion with the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, on the question of

clearly harmful if taken to excess and is responsible for considerable
economic damage to the country as well as for health service

Smith of Basildon (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is worth noting that
alcohol consumption dropped by 13% between 2004 and 2010, though it
seems to have increased since that time. I cannot imagine why. However,
we recognise that problems remain, and more needs to be done to tackle
anti-social behaviour connected with the excess drinking of alcohol. I
am rather concerned at what the Minister said in response to my noble
friend Lord Mackenzie, who has been President of the Police
Superintendents Association, about the late-night levy and the actions
that police superintendents can take. This has not been a success.
Problems still continue. Only one late-night levy is about to be
introduced and others have not been. Can the Minister assure me that,
when the anti-social behaviour Bill is debated in your
Lordships’ House, the Government will seriously consider our
amendments, rather than reject them, as they did in the
Commons?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Taylor of Holbeach" PimsId="5065" UID="13101672000704" xid="1920" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000704">Lord

amendments to the Bill, but I am sure that noble Lords will consider
all amendments that are tabled. However, I can assure the noble
Baroness that this is an important piece of legislation, and I hope she
recognises that the measures being introduced by the Government are
designed to tackle the anti-social elements that drinking can
cause.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000011"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Finlay of Llandaff" PimsId="3238" UID="13101672000705" xid="1634" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000705">Baroness
Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, do the Government
recognise that the current below-cost sales of alcohol are responsible
for at least 900 major crimes per year? Do they also recognise that the
introduction of minimum pricing, on top of banning low-cost sales,
would probably cut out 32,000 crimes per year? When are the Government
going to revise their policy on minimum pricing and below-cost
sales?</hs_para>

Taylor of Holbeach:</Member></B> The noble Baroness will know that the
Government have made an announcement on this. Although minimum pricing
is always there to be considered, the policy that we are going to
introduce is that no drink can be sold at less than the cost of duty
plus VAT. I can give some examples. It will mean that a 4% can of lager
will have a floor price of 40 pence and a 70 centilitre
bottle of vodka will not be able to be sold at below
£8.89.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Forsyth of Drumlean" PimsId="3285" UID="13101672000707" xid="1225" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000707">Lord
Forsyth of Drumlean (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, does my noble friend
not agree that, while dealing with irresponsible drinking, we should
not penalise responsible drinkers and those who run responsible
premises with policies like minimum alcohol pricing or, indeed, the
levy? It means that people who are out celebrating—perhaps the
return of good government—end up paying more than they would
otherwise because of those who behave

do not get it until you are a certain age; probably the national health
number, which you get at birth, would be the sensible one. Would he

voluntary and costs the public purse

raises some very difficult issues and is very distressing. However, the
current difference in legislation means that women travelling to
England for an abortion generally make their own arrangements and fund
the procedure themselves. To make exceptions to that would be a major
departure from the system of residence-based responsibility and the
separation of powers between the health services in the four
jurisdictions of the
UK<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:38:47"></hs_TimeCode>. The noble

Gould of Potternewton (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am a little
surprised by the Minister’s first reply and I would be grateful
for clarification. In 2011, the Government supported a report from the
Irish Family Planning Association to the CEDAW periodic review saying
that there should be a revision of abortion law in Northern Ireland. I
fail to understand why the Government did that if the Minister is right
in her argument. I add that this year, again, CEDAW has told the
British Government that they need to expedite an amendment to the
anti-abortion law in Northern Ireland and create a law to ensure that
legal abortion covers circumstances such as threats to a woman’s
health and cases of serious malformation of the foetus. As a signatory
to CEDAW, when are the Government going to honour their
commitments?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000057"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:40:15"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Randerson" PimsId="5929" UID="13101672000750" xid="2139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000750">Baroness

observe the devolution settlement. However, I think it is also

of the situation in Northern Ireland. I draw the attention of noble

Ireland Executive, who has made it very clear that this issue needs to
be reconsidered. Indeed, the Health Minister in Northern Ireland has

be—abortion law in Northern Ireland is left to the Northern
Ireland Assembly. It would not be acceptable—I am sure that it
would not be acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland—for us
to seek to change that unilaterally. I also draw the attention of noble

occur in Northern Ireland and that there is an ongoing legal duty to
recognise that the unborn child, whatever its state of health, is
deserving of protection? Is it not the case that England and Wales now
needs to reconsider the law on abortion, given that we have a situation

point, it is, of course, very much an issue for the people of Northern
Ireland. It is a devolved matter and I believe that there is no wish in
Northern Ireland for that to change. I would, however, make it
absolutely clear to the noble Baroness that it is very certainly not
legal to terminate a pregnancy on the grounds of the sex of the child.
An investigation into a recent case made that absolutely clear and the
Chief Medical Officer will be issuing additional guidance to doctors in
the very near future to make sure that that is perfectly clear to all

Low of Dalston (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak also to
Amendments 138A and 138B, which are in my name in this group. I shall
get those amendments out of the way first, as the debate is likely to
focus principally on Amendment 83. Clause 75(6) says that anything done
or not done by a third party authorised to carry out a particular
function is treated as done or not done by the local authority. In
effect, the local authority is solely responsible for the third
party’s acts or omissions, subject to a couple of exceptions in
subsection (7).</hs_para>

the draft Care and Support Bill recommended an amendment to make clear
that a person with delegated authority is subject to the same legal
obligations as a local authority itself. This reflected concerns that
there should be a clear chain of accountability by which the individual
could hold the third party, not just the local authority, responsible
if their rights were infringed. The Government have contended that the
clause already provides for continued accountability. They said that
the local
authority,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13101672000198" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000198">“will

what the Joint Committee was recommending. The Government are viewing
accountability solely in terms of the relationship between the third
party and the local authority. Subsection (6) precludes the possibility
of the individual seeking redress from the third party, so it does not
accord with the Joint Committee’s recommendation. The Minister
in Committee said that care providers with delegated functions must
carry them out in a way that complies with the Human Rights Act 1998
and that any failure to do so will be a failure by the local authority.
That is not the same as the third party being subject to the Human
Rights Act; the third party would be failing its obligations to the
local authority, but to no one else. The Minister effectively conceded
as much when she
said:</hs_parafo><hs_quote UID="13101672000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000191">“By

out the arguments in detail in Committee and shall not repeat them at
length here. The matter is really quite simple and straightforward and
can be stated briefly. The Human Rights Act 1998 applies to all public
authorities and to other bodies when they are performing functions of a
public nature. That means that it should apply to all providers of
care, given that the provision of care is a public function. However,
the matter was thrown into doubt in 2007 by the case of YL v Birmingham
City Council, which held that care home services provided by private
and third sector organisations under a 
<?notus-xml column=545?>contract with the local authority did not come under the definition of
“public function” for the purposes of the Human Rights
Act. This meant that thousands of service users had no direct remedy
against their care provider for abuse, neglect or undignified
treatment. Though the public body commissioning the care remained bound
by the Human Rights Act, that was of little practical value to the
individual on the receiving end of poor or abusive treatment, or the
person given four weeks’ notice to leave because they had
antagonised their provider, about whom the noble Lord, Lord Warner,
told us in Committee.</hs_para>

145 was introduced into the Health and Social Care Act 2008 to clarify
that residential care services provided or arranged by local
authorities are covered by the Human Rights Act. There has been concern
that this Bill would undo Section 145 by repealing Sections 21A and 26
of the National Assistance Act 1948, under which persons were placed in
residential care and through which Section 145 has operated. However,
the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, responding to the debate in
Committee, set minds at rest on that when she provided the assurance
that,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13101672000199" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000199">“there
will be a consequential amendment to Section 145 of the Health and

there remains concern that Section 145 does not cover all care service
users, or even all residential care service users. It only protects
those placed in residential care under the National Assistance Act.
That being so, it is anomalous not to treat residential care provided
under other legislation and domiciliary care in the same
way.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13101672000073" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000073">The

not the same as “covered in law”. Secondly, the Joint
Committee was not convinced. It concluded that, as a result of the
decision in the YL case, statutory provision is required to ensure
this. As I said in Committee, I have seen a letter in which it is
stated that the Government’s position is that care providers are
covered, and should not just “consider themselves to be
bound”. However, the House of Lords in YL said that they were
not and the Joint Committee was not convinced either. Given such
uncertainty, it is surely essential that the matter is put beyond doubt
in legislation and Amendment 83 would achieve this by deeming that all
those providing social care services regulated by the CQC are
exercising a public function for the purposes of Section 6 of the Human
Rights
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:55:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo>

also include those who are eligible for care but who, due to means
testing, have to arrange and/or pay for their own care—so-called
“self funders”—and therefore currently lack the
full protection 
<?notus-xml column=546?>of the Human Rights Act. To date, it has been the
case, at least for those who were found to be eligible for care in
their own home, that the obligation for the local authority to arrange
care regardless of the person’s resources provided them with a
degree of protection under the Human Rights Act. However, the changes
to the system of arranging care to be introduced by the Bill weaken
this protection. My amendment follows the approach of the Joint
Committee and, if accepted, would provide equal protection to all users
of regulated social care regardless of where that care is provided and
who is paying for
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:56:46"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:56:43"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

as the Explanatory Notes to the draft Bill make clear, that protection
under the Human Rights Act extends to care arranged by a local
authority, even if it is self-funded, but the Joint Committee does not
accept that this does not require explicit statutory provision.
However, regardless of this view, it makes the point that it does not
address the situation of self-funders, who arrange their own care and
support. The Government, they say, will need to consider whether it is
right that, of all adults in need of care, only this group
should lack the protection of the Human Rights
Act<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:57:31"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:57:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

opponent for that clarification and I certainly would not wish to
contradict him. The reality is that the previous Government did, in
fact, try to find a way out of this judgment and to correct it in a way
which they thought would be beneficial for the people of England and
Wales. Instead, they introduced an amendment to the Health and Social
Care Act 2008 to extend human rights protection to those receiving
residential care arranged by a public authority. The amendment did not
extend, as the noble Lord, Lord Low, rightly said, to home care
services, even though they were provided under a similar statutory
framework. It is that gap that this amendment is designed to fill.
Surely there is precious little difference between a local authority
securing care services of an individual in a residential care setting

in support of Amendment 83 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Low.
Before I say anything I will follow the example of the noble Lord, Lord
Willis, and apologise for not having taken part in proceedings on this
Bill before. As the Minister may know, I have recently returned from a
period of disqualification, which has now been lifted on my retirement
from the UK Supreme Court, so I am now able to speak, which I was not
able to before. I thought I might contribute just a few thoughts to

Section 6(3)(b) of the Human Rights Act is one of the few provisions in

great respect to the noble Lord, Lord Willis, it is not helpful to ask
at this stage whether YL was wrongly decided; we have to take the
decision as we find it. That is how the law works. Of course,
it is always open to Parliament to take a
different view and judges—and, I am certain, noble Lords in that
case—appreciate that entirely, as the noble Lord, Lord
Neuberger, did for a reason I will come to in a moment. We have to
assume that the judges in the lower courts will follow the decision in
YL if other cases come before them, and it may not be all that easy for
the Supreme Court—if the issue comes back before it in
some future case—to depart from the basic reasoning
in YL. I therefore suggest that one has simply to approach these issues
on the basis that YL is there, and proceed accordingly.</hs_para>

it would be right for the legislature to spell that out in terms and

could not be relied upon, for example, in a court to guide a judge
about the meaning of Section 6(3)(b) in the particular context.

ourselves once again faced with the gap to which other speakers have
drawn attention. It is perfectly true that YL was a decision on its own
facts, but I respectfully suggest that the implications of the decision
go wider than that. If you read the judgments, there is a distinction
between private, profit-making bodies on the one hand and state or
government-owned bodies with public functions on the other. One can

amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low, that the answer is to do as the

considered, “If we make a pronouncement about this, it may
affect other circumstances and situations”. There is a
difference, of course, between a judge making that kind of
pronouncement and Parliament’s putting forward or putting into a
measure a precisely targeted measure which deals with a particular
problem. It is the difference between a sledgehammer, I would say, to
crack a nut, and a rapier which deals with a particular issue. I do not
see that there is any real risk that, by dealing with the matter in the
targeted way that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Low, seeks to

will speak briefly in support of Amendment 83. I would have
spoken on this in Committee, but unfortunately I was drowning in
continuity of care. I feel that we are missing an important aspect in
the debate: namely, the provider’s voice. I will give noble
Lords an example 
<?notus-xml column=551?>from the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We ran an
inquiry into Article 13 of the UN convention on the rights of disabled
people. We took evidence from a range of providers, including private
sector providers. We heard very good evidence from a private sector
provider. When they were questioned about the Human Rights Act, it
became evident that there was a great deal of confusion about when
their homes were covered and when they were not. They erred towards
saying, “No, we don’t think we’re covered because
we haven’t been trained in that
area”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000107">It
became very evident to me that there was a crying need for
clarification in this area. I asked a very simple question about what
the witness thought that this meant for her private sector homes. She
said, “Well, to be honest, we already do it. We allow our
residents to go to bed at whatever time they like before 10 pm”.
I feel that the misunderstanding of how the Human Rights Act covers
private sector care homes was illustrated in that one moment.
Therefore, the law needs clarifying—and this clarification would

providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000108"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mackay of Clashfern" PimsId="1610" UID="13101672000765" xid="1761" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000765">Lord

previous legal history, or repeat what I said in Committee, other than
to emphasise a particular aspect of the case to which I drew attention
then. That case related to an elderly woman in her 90s who
was resident in a private care home and was totally self-funded. She
had been a resident for some time and had the temerity to air her views
on assisted dying, which did not please some of the home’s
staff. She did not seek anybody’s help to commit suicide; she
just expressed her views. The home’s management gave her four
weeks’ notice to leave the home as a result. When her son raised
the issue of her rights under the Human Rights Act with legal counsel,
the opinion he was given was that she lacked protection under that Act
because she was not in receipt of a service from a body providing a
function of a public nature as her placement was neither publicly
provided nor in a publicly funded
home.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000113">As a

clear that there are differences of legal opinion on this matter when

far as I am aware this is the first time an attempt has been made to
include, within the scope of the Human Rights Act, what may be a purely

important to consider what protection would be available anyway, in the
absence of this amendment. If a poor standard of care is provided to an
individual, it is likely that the provider will be in breach of an
express term of any contract or in breach of a term implied by the
Supply of Goods and Services Act 1982. There will almost
certainly be a claim in tort, probably relying on the tort of
negligence. There is, of course, a further safeguard in relation to all
providers of publicly arranged care, in that all such providers have a
duty imposed by Section 6 of the Human Rights Act, at least following
what I would submit was the closing of the YL loophole by Section 145

provided by, the NHS. They would therefore be covered by the Human

some official somewhere said that they did not fall within the bar for
continuing care funding, would not be covered. The decision as to

to remove them from premises that they occupy. It is that reach and the

that a court can give just satisfaction, and the remedy may include

with what is a long-standing anomaly in the scope of the Human Rights
Act, which was created originally by the YL case. As the noble and
learned Lord, Lord Hope, has said, it is not for politicians to
determine whether cases are rightly or wrongly decided. It was the
considered view of the previous Government—and it remains my own
view—that that case produced a result that was not compatible
with the original intentions of Parliament in passing the Human Rights
Act. With respect to the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, and to all the
discussion we have just heard, the intent of the Human Rights Act was
not only to provide specific remedies in the sort of case that the
noble Lord, Lord Warner, has just described. 
<?notus-xml column=556?>Among other things, it was also to try to create a
new culture in the delivery of public services—a culture of
dignity and respect for the individual in relation to the state. It
seems to me that this is precisely what this amendment sets out to do.
As the noble Lord, Lord Low, said in introducing it, it seeks to
extend, and to put beyond all doubt, the fundamental protections of the
Human Rights Act to some of the most vulnerable members of our society.
I support everything that has been said today in favour of this
amendment; there have been very powerful speeches putting forward the
argument far better than I can.</hs_para>

significant that two of the proposers of the amendment—the noble

a lack of certainty about the scope of the Human Rights Act, arising

performing a public function and its residents were therefore excluded
from the protection of the Human Rights Act.</hs_para>

that the vulnerability of the person receiving care and the risk of
abuse is the reason why he thought the law should impose duties on the

Committee, we heard from the then Minister, the noble Baroness, Lady
Northover, who relied on two defences of the Government’s
position. The first was—as the noble and learned Lord, Lord
Hope, has reminded us—that those providers of publicly arranged
health and social care services, including those in the private and
voluntary sectors, should consider themselves bound by the duty. I am
sure that we should all consider ourselves to be bound by many things,

Government’s second defence was that the Care Quality Commission
as the regulator is subject to the Human Rights Act and that may give
rise to a positive obligation to ensure that individuals are protected
from treatment that is contrary to their convention rights. It is a
duty that falls on the CQC itself, and I remind the House that we are
talking about thousands and thousands of providers of services. I do
not think that it is a sufficient defence for people who are caught in
a vulnerable situation. The noble Lord, Lord Faulks, expressed doubts
about including a private function and he pointed to a
number of safeguards that already exist, including Section 6
and the CQC, but the vulnerability of so many of the people who we are
concerned about seems to express a need for greater statutory
provision.</hs_para>

also remind noble Lords that many of the people we are talking about
will move in and out of private care and public care, and at some point
under this legislation will actually be in receipt of public support as
well as contributing to the cost of their care. We know that when the
cap comes in, people will then be entitled to public support, but that
does not cover the hotel costs which are estimated at around
£12,000 a year. Many people will be in receipt of public support
while also having some form of private contract and top-ups, which we
have discussed. It would ensure that people had a relationship both in
terms of public support and a personal relationship with their private
providers. For all these reasons, the argument put by the noble Lord,
Lord Low, is very persuasive

essentially move on. I respectfully agree with that, but I suggest that
the key point in this context is what the previous Government did

people which could not be pursued before the European Court of Human

that the previous Government had addressed the issue that I have been
talking about. They addressed part of the issue in the Health and

I think will make much more of a difference are the stronger measures

improvements in commissioning and the safe routes for whistleblowers.

the CQC to take effective action against providers that do not provide
acceptable levels of care. With these things in place, it is my view
that when things go wrong we will have a strong and effective mechanism

now turn to Amendments 138A and 138B, also in the name of the noble
Lord, Lord Low. Their effect would be that, where a local authority
delegates a function, in addition to the local authority remaining
subject to all of its legal obligations in the way the function is
discharged, the person authorised under the delegation would also be
directly subject to those same obligations. These would include, for
example, obligations arising under the Human Rights Act. The amendments
are unnecessary because when it delegates its functions, Clause 75(6)
is clear that the local authority remains responsible for the way that
that function is discharged. The person using care and support will
therefore always have a route of redress against the local authority

that the ultimate responsibility lies with the
local authority and that it cannot absolve

Warner:</Member></B> Before the noble Earl sits down, can he clarify
something from his earlier remarks about the Human Rights Act? I ask
with a certain amount of humility but also from the perspective of one
of the people who wrote the Labour Party’s policy in 1996 on the
incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into what
became the Human Rights Act in this
country<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>. When
that Act was framed, the definition of a public function, or the nature
of a public function, was one which did not to a great
extent anticipate the move over the next 10 to 15 years in
which public services would actually be undertaken and provided by
private and voluntary bodies. It simply did not do that. However, the
terminology was wide enough at the time to embrace an
organisation like Channel 4, which had a mix of public and
private functions. It was incorporated, as I recall, into
that legislation on the basis of its partial role in performing public
functions.</hs_para>

noble Earl seems to accept that, over time, case law can change the
definition of the nature of a public function. He seems to be saying
that we have to plod through the courts, case by case, to change the
definition. I rather lost him when he then tried to argue that you
cannot do it by groups of cases, which is effectively what this
amendment does. Is the noble Earl saying that the definition of the
nature of a public function—in the law as it is—cannot be
changed by cases and can only be changed by amending the primary
legislation itself?</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> I think that I covered that point when I said that
the courts have ruled that there is no single test to determine whether
a function is of a public or a private nature. They have also pointed
out that there are serious dangers in trying to formulate such a test,
which is what the amendment is trying to do, in its own way. If we go
back to the noble Lord’s example of the 90 year-old lady in the
care home and even if the Human Rights Act were to apply, it is
impossible to predict the outcome of an application to a court
for—let us say—an injunction to prevent her removal,
because each case is fact-specific. It may be found that the
lady’s human rights were not violated, but it is not possible to
predict that in advance. I hope that clarifies the position and answers

I thank all noble Lords who have spoken, especially those who have
spoken in support from all quarters of the House. It has been a
high-calibre debate which does credit to a House noted for
characteristically engaging in debate of a high calibre. This one was,
I think, particularly authoritative. Without wishing to be invidious in
any way, I particularly give thanks for the exceptionally thoughtful,
careful and authoritative analysis to which we were treated by the
noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope of
Craighead<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:56:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000161" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000161">I

supporters who attached their names to the amendment, the
noble Lords, Lord Pannick and Lord Lester, who were unable

have spoken and those who would have spoken had they been

line-up in support of the amendment in this

has been general agreement that the matter should be put beyond doubt.
Indeed, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, pointed out, it would
actually be dangerous if we were not to do so. If I understood the
noble Earl correctly, he said that we should stick with the position
that was arrived at as a result of Section 145 of the Health and Social
Care Act. As the noble Lord, Lord Wills, made clear, when he said that
noble Lords should not pray in aid the position arrived at by the
previous Government, this is unfinished business. No one can pretend
that we have reached a final resolution of these matters with Section
145 of the Health and Social Care Act. That is why it is so important
that we should take the opportunity presented by the Bill to take the
further steps necessary to put the matter beyond
doubt.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000163">We have
heard what the noble Earl had to say in response to the debate, but I
confess that I am baffled. Between Committee and Report, the Government
seem to have executed a complete volte face and completely changed
their position. The position explained to us in Committee was that the
Government did not believe that the amendment was necessary because the
matters that it sought to put beyond doubt were already provided for.
Today, the noble Earl tells us that he must urge the House to reject
the amendment because the matters should not be provided for. The
Government need to make up their mind what their position
is.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101672000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101672000164">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:01:36"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister also made the point that we should not take this step because
it would deliver to service users rights over and above those available
under the ECHR. I am sorry, but I simply do not understand that point.
The amendment simply delivers to service users rights which are
available under the Human Rights Act, which is predicated upon the
ECHR. Even the noble Lord, Lord Faulks, agrees, I think, that we should
put the matter beyond doubt; he just does not think that we should put
it beyond doubt in this way or that the Human Rights Act should be
extended this far. Having listened to all the debate, I submit that the
noble Lord, Lord Faulks, and of course the Minister in adopting his
remarks, are on their own in this matter in the House. There is general
agreement not only that we should put the matter beyond doubt,
but  
<?notus-xml column=562?>that we should put it beyond doubt in the manner which this amendment
secures. Indeed, until today this agreement used to include the

very much welcome the fact that the Government have amended the Bill to
ensure that when it appears to a local authority that the child or
their carer is like to have needs for care and support after the child
becomes 18, the local authority must assess them. I appreciate, too,
the Government’s stated position that the needs of very young

ages of 14 and 18 in a variety of ways.
However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:19:26"></hs_TimeCode>, our
amendments would provide flexibility by ensuring that assessments could
be initiated before the age of 14 if requested by the child or parent
or if it appears to the local authority that an assessment is necessary
and appropriate. Local authorities would have until the age of 16 to
assess the child’s needs. They would not be prevented from
reassessing a young person if their needs changed before they reached
18. They would also enable local authorities a period of two years to
assess the child’s needs in cases where their care needs become
apparent only after the age of
14<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:23:21"></hs_TimeCode>. Without

the age threshold for a child’s needs assessment at 14 is also
based on the existing statutory requirement for every young person in
year 9—that is, aged 14 to 15—with a statement
of special educational needs to have a transition plan. Our amendment
would ensure that transition planning correlates with that requirement
and reflects best practice in exemplary palliative care services in
England. It is entirely reasonable that some young people with
life-limiting conditions, including those with conditions such as
Duchenne muscular dystrophy and cerebral palsy, could be expected from 
<?notus-xml column=567?>an early stage to live beyond 18. Assessing and planning for their
future needs should therefore begin at the age of 14. Our amendments
would ensure that this is the case without disadvantaging young people
with other disabilities, which is the concern that was expressed. The
Bill already stipulates that where a local authority deems a
child’s assessment not to be in the best interest of the young

assessed, an assessment will not take

89B, which is a long amendment, corrects the anomaly of the transition

provisions to enable local authorities to carry out a child’s
needs assessment, there is no duty on local authorities to use the
assessment to create a transition plan for the young person. Amendment
89B would ensure that, if a child’s needs assessment finds that
a young person is likely to need health or social care when they reach
adulthood, a statutory five-year rolling transition plan should be
prepared by the time they are

amendment has a number of other important features. It would ensure
that children, parents and carers were involved in the transition
planning process and that transition plans are maintained until the
young person reaches the age of 25, which 10% of these children would
probably reach. Further, one of the provisions included in the Children
and Families Bill is to introduce an integrated education, health and
care plan—or EHC plan—for young people who have special
educational needs. This will include many—but, crucially, not
all—young people who need palliative care. Where a young person
stays in education or training, they will be eligible for an EHC plan
until the age of 25. I recognise that an EHC plan could fulfil the
functions which I intend the transition plan in my amendment to fulfil.
An optimal position would be for EHC plans to be available to all young
disabled people up to the age of 25—but that is not the case.

to do so and the amendment that the Government have already tabled to
strengthen the Bill. However, as with the clauses relating to planning
for young people’s needs on transition, we need to go further in
order to ensure that planning for carers also happens in a timely

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am
most grateful to my noble friend Lord Patel for the way in which he has
introduced our amendments. I greatly welcome the Government’s
amendments in this area of transition. The reason that our amendments
are written as they are is because this group of children are different
to adults who are terminally ill. They have life-limiting conditions,
but their prognosis may be years. However, during that time they know
that they will deteriorate, as do their parents. We are therefore
looking at completely different timeframes, and with completely
unpredictable prognoses, except for the likelihood that they will live
through into adulthood. Some of them, of course, live surprisingly long
periods of time and may live several decades into adulthood. They tend
to have the inherited disorders of metabolism. They are a different
cohort from those who have terminal illnesses such as cancer. There are
also those children who, for example, have had very severe sudden
injuries, such as a severe head injury, and then develop epilepsy,
which can then become so severe that it is life threatening. Many of
the children also have learning difficulties and educational
needs.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13101676000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000125">5.30 pm</hs_time>

will create the triangulation that is required between health,
education, and social care in the context of this Bill so that many of
the young people can carry on having their educational needs provided
for. This group of young people often describes leaving paediatric care
and entering adult care as “falling off a cliff”. They
feel that they are going into an enormous chasm.
They have been under the care of one service in paediatrics, but there
is not a neat fit for adult services with the different specialities.
That creates a major difficulty for them. That is why we feel that the
assessments have to happen early. It is important for the young person
to develop confidence in the assessment process in order to disclose
what their needs are and to develop confidence in those doing the
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000003">The other reason
that it is important to do it early is for the sake of the parents.
These parents are getting older. They know that their lives may not
carry on. They may well be outlived by their child. That is an enormous
worry to many of them. Often the families have already split apart;
many marriages break up with the strain that caring for some of these
young people has imposed. The remaining parent really needs to know
that the plans are in place and will be maintained. The reason for
continuing to 25 is precisely that. Most educational services for these
children stop at 21. It is very unusual for them to have anywhere to go
after that. They have housing needs and care needs. However much one
hopes that they may live independently, not all of them achieve
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000004">Placing
them for care can be very complex. A young person
with all the needs of a young person and all the emotional needs and
sexual-development needs does not want to be placed in an
institution which is full of people over 85, some of whom
have got dementia, 
<?notus-xml column=569?>where the staff are not comfortable even
discussing with them some of their more intimate needs and desires.
These young people want to discuss contraception; they want to discuss
sexual experience; they may want to drink alcohol. In an older
person’s environment, that is not always the atmosphere. As the
parents get older, they know that the physical strain of providing care
is becoming too great, and they will not be able to do it anymore. That
is why we feel strongly that the government amendments are fantastic,
as far as they go, but having an extension with clear timelines to make
sure that this is a gentle process is particularly important. I hope
that the Minister might have some words of comfort for us, if it is not
to accept the amendment but certainly within regulational guidance
later, that this period of transition will be looked at because it is
so difficult for both the young people and for their parents or
carers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000005"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Gardner of Parkes" PimsId="3383" UID="13101676000129" xid="1170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000129">Baroness
Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I particularly wish to
speak on Amendments 83A and 84, but I could just as easily
have spoken on any one of these amendments—there is such a big
group of them—because the issue that I wish to raise is my
concern over this care issue falling down between this Bill and the
Children and Families Bill. The timing of these two Bills makes it very
difficult unless the Minister, having heard all these debates that
everyone will give now, and the comments on these issues, gives us an
undertaking that he will liaise with the noble Lord, Lord Nash, and
that between them they might try and sort out where it is going to go.
This is what worries me: that it will end up going nowhere or come up
from the noble Lord, Lord Nash, in a form that will make it too late to
bring back here, unless the Minister says that he will look at
everything said today and bring back an amendment—or at least
accept an amendment if we could all agree on one.</hs_para>

been said made sense. The comments of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay,
were fascinating, and the noble Lord, Lord Patel, put it all very
clearly. The noble Baroness spoke more on issues about which I am
particularly concerned. My eldest grandson is a Down’s child.
His Down’s is fairly severe. He has been fortunate in having
wonderful care at a Mencap home. He is 22 and this is his last year of
receiving full support. He was very happy at the home for some years,
until a glitch appeared in the past year. In his unit, a number of
residents are put together to live a normal life and to learn how to go
out and live in society. Unfortunately, a very aggressive boy was put
into the group. No one knew that he was aggressive. He attacked the
staff quite violently. As a result, others—I do not know whether
it was just my grandson, or whether it was others as well—copied
him. This is a terrible risk. If we do not supervise people and have
continuing care and assessment of them, how do we know that they will
not meet a violent person who behaves in this way, either deliberately
or for some other reason—for example, because they are violent
and cannot help trying to impose violence on everyone else? It is a
real worry not only for the person but for society and the
community.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000007">The
noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, spoke about the parents who care so much.
The parents of this boy are both very clever doctors. One of his
siblings is just 
<?notus-xml column=570?>starting medicine and the other hopes to in the next year or so. So he
has siblings who would be able to care if his parents die before him.
However, people with Down’s syndrome can live to a considerable
age. I have met people of 50 and 60 who have the syndrome. In many
cases, their parents will not be alive. It is a huge responsibility to
pass on to siblings. Therefore, it is important that, as far as
possible, these people should be brought into society to live as
normally as they can. As they grow older, they usually grow bigger and
stronger. Therefore, they are more of a worry to themselves and to
other people. It is terribly important that the assessment of cases for
continuing care should be made, and should continue to be
made—and not just at 25. If people are going to live to 50, they
may need support until
then.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000008">A number
of the amendments put down by the noble Earl, Lord Howe,
cover that issue, but without defining it clearly. This is why I am
speaking in general on the amendments in this group. It is
important that this should be clear. I have added my name to an
amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Rix, in the Children and Families
Bill. It is in response to the implication that the Government are
thinking of taking out care completely: that once education finishes,
nothing more will follow. That is why it is so important to be assured
in this Bill that something else will
follow.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000009">My
daughter tells me—and she has sent me a letter from another
parent—that there is great concern that parents are not listened
to nearly as much as other people are. The noble Earl’s
Amendment 84 does not really cover anyone except a remote person in a
local authority who will be responsible for needs. There is nothing to
say that they will consult, or even consider the views of, parents or
the person who is doing most of the caring for the person concerned.
None of the amendments in this group quite reaches what is necessary to
cover the issue. I hope that when the Minister sums up, he will give an
assurance that will leave the way open for this to be considered at
Third Reading. The rules on what can be brought back at Third Reading
are very specific. If today we all ended up either winning or losing on
some particular thing, it would not necessarily mean that we could
modify it in a way that we all thought was better and brought a better
answer. I support Amendment 83A and probably quite a number of others,
but I will not go into the details because my argument applies both for
and against so many of these amendments and I do not want to waste the
House’s time by speaking more than
once.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000010"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="13101676000130" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000130">Earl

the case. Amendments 83A, 84A, 89A, 93A, 94A and 94B, tabled
by the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay,
reflect concern that a local authority may leave it too late to carry
out an assessment. I need to be very clear about this. The amendments I
have tabled place a duty on local authorities that they must assess at
the time where it appears to them that there is likely to be a need
when the young person turns 18, and it is of significant benefit to
that individual to assess at that time. My noble friend Lady Gardner
was worried that the government amendments might not be sufficiently
precise or prescriptive. The clauses are formulated in this way
precisely so that assessments happen at the right time, whether that is
before or after the age of 14, depending on the individual.
The Bill approaches transition planning with a firm focus on assessing
at the right time for the individual by the new duty to assess where it
would be of significant benefit to the individual. I am not persuaded

assessment should take

Amendment 89B, which concerns a number of elements of transition
planning. In response to proposed new subsection (8), I simply say that
provision 
<?notus-xml column=572?>that the plan must run until the age of 25 is not appropriate because it
does not take account of whether this is appropriate for each
individual and would create a blanket rule irrespective of the
individual’s needs and wishes. We agree that information and
planning are crucial. They form the cornerstone of these provisions.
Clauses 59, 61 and 64 already provide that the information provided
will include an indication of whether they are likely to be eligible,
and advice and information about what can be done to meet any needs and
about what can be done to prevent or delay the development of
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000017">The
noble Lord and the noble Baroness seek additional detail in the Bill.
The clauses, as drafted, are focused on the outcomes that the
individual wants to achieve. I will address some of the particular
concerns in turn. First, I can give a commitment, as I confirmed in
Committee, that outcomes may include employment, education or housing.
Further, the Bill already specifies that the individual must be
involved in the assessment. However, details about the name of the
document arising out of this assessment, what its contents should be
and the practicalities of its preparation should not be prescribed in
the Bill but will be addressed in guidance. Statutory guidance will
provide clear direction to local authorities about how we expect them
to exercise this function.</hs_para>

noble Baroness are concerned about co-operation between agencies and
about the link to education, health and care plans. My noble friend
Lady Gardner also expressed concern around this. The Bill and the
Children and Families Bill include provision that assessment can be
joint, including for joined-up assessments in relation to an education,
health and care plan. Practical questions about how to achieve a
joined-up approach will be addressed by the guidance supporting the
Care Bill, informed by learning from the pathfinders that have been
exploring how best to streamline the assessment process, putting
families and young people at the
centre.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000019">I
reiterate that where a young person over the age of 18 has an EHC plan
and, as such, the “care” part of that plan is provided
under this Bill, we expect co-operation between adult and
children’s services in relation to any review of the plan.
Co-operation with the preparation, maintenance and review of the EHC
plan, as provided for by the Children and Families Bill in respect of
children, would be required by Clause 6(3), which sets a clear duty on
the local authority in this respect, and by Clause 6(5)(c), which
underlines that this duty relates to transition cases. Guidance can be
used to ensure that this is clear.</hs_para>

local authority to make arrangements to secure provision for children
and young people with a transition plan is not appropriate or
necessary. Services to children cannot, and should not, be provided
under this Bill—children’s legislation provides for this.
Services to young people over the age of 18 would be provided, if
necessary, under provisions earlier in Part
1<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:48:46"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000021">I
am keen to respond to my noble friend Lady Gardner, who asked me
whether the local authority has to consider the parent carer in the
kind of situation that she outlined. Yes—Clauses 60 and 61
provide the 
<?notus-xml column=573?>duty to assess this group of people in a similar manner to young people
with needs and young carers. I have a note setting out the clear links
between this Bill and the Children and Families Bill. If it would help
my noble friend, I would be happy to send it to her. However, it is
rather lengthy and I hope that she will forgive me if I do not read
them all
out.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101676000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000022">I trust

Patel:</Member></B> I am grateful to the Minister for his comments. If
I had known before I started speaking that he was going to produce the
guidance to cover all these issues, I might have said that I would not
move this amendment. But having heard him say that there will be
guidance in statute to cover all these issues, I am extremely grateful.
I thank the other noble Lords and noble Baronesses who spoke. I thought
for a minute that the Opposition were going to remain silent on this
amendment but I am glad that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath,
felt obliged to intervene, and I am grateful to him for that. I
withdraw the
amendment.</hs_para><hs_Procedure UID="13101676000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0001.htm#13101676000168">Amendment

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend.
In our debates, both in Committee and on Report, we spent a
considerable time talking about some of the complexity of the decisions
that have to be made when it comes to the financial affairs of many
people who require long-term care. In our debate on Clause 4, we talked
about the need for regulated financial advice, because these issues are
so complex. It is quite likely that people who are providing
information to a local authority will make slip-ups. The kind of forms
that have to be filled in can be very difficult. Clause 67(4)
states:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13101677000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101677000019">“Where

to change this would lead to some perverse incentives in that people

those concerns with his amendment because 
<?notus-xml column=581?>he has clearly drawn a distinction between
fraudulent activity and claims, and slips and mistakes which are
inevitably going to be made. Even at this late stage, it would be
helpful if the noble Earl could reconsider this matter. I think my

talking about very vulnerable people who will find the
information required to be given to a local authority very complex. We

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, it occurs to me that the
problem has been created by the use of the word
“fraudulent”. It tends to suggest that the word
“otherwise” is in some way connected with that. I wonder
whether one could not take out that whole phrase in brackets. The idea
is that, because of some mistake, something extra has been paid out.
Ordinarily, it might be perfectly all right to recover that. You do not
need to look into the detail of why it was wrong. The person in
question—vulnerable people particularly, and those who are not
so vulnerable, more recently arrived—may fall into error. The
error may result in extra payments out by the local authority which, in
ordinary circumstances, it should be able to recover.
“Fraudulently” gives an idea of people trying to put
something over on someone, and “otherwise” tends to be
coloured by the same adverb. Perhaps this problem could be dealt with
in that
way.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:05:28"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, we agree with the general view expressed
by noble Lords that we must ensure that vulnerable elderly people are
protected and are not discouraged from seeking help when they need it.
However, I do not agree with the conclusions reached by the noble Lord,
Lord Lipsey, and I regret to have to say that the manner in which he
has expressed his concerns risks causing unnecessary worry to people
who need care and support. Let me be clear: this power is not there to
punish people, as the noble Lord put it, and should be used by local
authorities only as a last resort, as I shall explain. Its purpose is
to ensure that any charges that should have been paid can subsequently
be recovered. It is not to penalise people unduly. But neither should
the system reward mistakes or prevent unpaid charges being
recovered. This would not only undermine the principle of
personal responsibility, 
<?notus-xml column=582?>it could also result in local authorities having less
money to provide care and support to those who need
it the most. In practice, it means in some cases a licence to subsidise
the better off at the expense of the worse off. Is that really what the
noble Lord
wants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:07:03"></hs_TimeCode>? The use
of this power is to recover a debt and is not intended to imply a
judgment about the person’s culpability. It does not look for
the mens rea; it exists to ensure only that charges not paid can be
recovered, as the equivalent current powers do now.</hs_para>

principle of this provision is not new; the power is 60 years old. The
noble Lord likes to make out that we are doing something radically new,
but that is not the case. We recognise that there may be a number of
reasons why someone has not paid the full amount of the charges due to
the local authority, including misrepresentations of their assets which
were entirely unintentional. But even where the reason is an accident
or a mistake, local authorities still suffer a loss and must be able to
recover that loss if there is no other means of doing so. This is
public
money<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:08:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

of the Bill is to make access to care and support easier and more
focused on people with care and support needs and their families. We
expect local authorities to help and support people with care and
support needs, discussing any concerns they have and providing advice
and assistance as appropriate. This would include advice to help people
understand the process of financial assessment and their responsibility
to disclose financial assets. I absolutely fail to see why the noble
Lord thinks it is socially just to allow people who misrepresent or
fail to disclose their assets, whether intentionally or not, to receive
more than their fair share of financial support. I reiterate that to do
so would reduce the resources available to other people with care and
support needs. That is what his prescription amounts to. I am concerned
that this amendment would risk making it much easier for people to take
advantage of the system and avoid charges and subsequent legal action.
What the noble Lord is suggesting is that people could be as careless
as they liked when filling out the form. Is that what he
wants<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:09:17"></hs_TimeCode>? The high
evidential burden that local authorities would have to meet to recover
debts risks making this power largely useless in practice. It would
leave local authorities facing costly and uncertain legal action if
they chose to pursue the
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:09:34"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

another point. A local authority should not, as a matter of course, use
these powers to recover debts without first having discussed other
options with the individual concerned. In most cases, especially those
where the failure to pay the correct charges was inadvertent, there
would be other simpler routes to follow, such as agreeing a repayment
plan which allows for recovery over time in a way that is manageable.
The noble Lord suggests that local authorities may exercise these
powers in a way that will drive people out of their own homes. Quite
aside from the fact that we have no evidence that local authorities
behave in that way and have used their existing powers like that, I
have to say that I find that assertion particularly
unconvincing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:10:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

bound by the public law principle of acting reasonably at all times and
must act in accordance with human rights legislation, as well
as  
<?notus-xml column=583?>the well-being principle, which we have already debated.
That alone should prevent a local authority using
this power to force someone out of their home. The noble Lord is
stretching our credulity if he is asking us to imagine a set of
circumstances in which a court would make an order in favour of a local
authority knowingly to evict a person from their home in this kind of
situation. It would be counterproductive in the extreme. Should there
be any possibility of this happening, we would use statutory guidance
to make the position clear. Indeed, where I do think further action is
needed is in the form of guidance. We will use statutory guidance under
the Bill to set out the steps that we expect local authorities to take.
For example, we would expect a local authority to discuss the situation
with the cared-for person and their family when appropriate to
establish what, if anything, is owed to the local authority; if there
is a debt, to establish whether it is appropriate to recover it,
because the local authority does not have to recover it—it can
choose not to do so; and, lastly, if money needs to be recovered, to
find an affordable way for the money to be repaid. As I have said,
whether or not the person could have been reasonably aware of something
that needed to be included in the financial assessment is one of the
factors that the local authority should consider when deciding whether
it is appropriate to recover a
debt<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:11:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

local authorities in the wider sector on what happens at present and
how this could be improved. I accept the need for effective
communication about financial assessment and the recovery of charges.
This highlights the importance of high quality information and advice,
including financial advice, which was debated last week, and the
importance of the new duties we are placing on local authorities in
this regard. Should mistakes be made, people will not be criminalised,
nor will any punitive charges be imposed, but ultimately it
is right that mistakes are rectified so that individuals do not benefit
from any errors they make, whether they were intentional or not.
Neither local authorities nor those who rely on their services should

I predict that in the handbook which all civil servants use to train
themselves in their art, his reply will figure as an example of how
best to argue an indefensible case, because that is what I think he has
just done. “Resent” would be too strong a word, but the
argument that by raising this matter I am creating a problem and
raising the fears of old people is not plausible. This is what
Governments do the whole time: they try to do something wicked, but
when that is pointed out to them, they say,
“Oh no, it is you who is causing the trouble because you are
pointing out  
<?notus-xml column=584?>that it is wicked”. The fears are raised not

that this power is all right because it is 60 years old. To that I have
two things to say. If a power like this has been lurking around in
legislation for 60 years, it is about time we took a little look at it,
and I hope the noble Earl will start some such operation. Wherever that
power exists now, this is a different case because here we are dealing
with elderly people. As my noble friend Lady Bakewell so graphically
pointed out, with the best will in the world, older people can make
mistakes. Whether it applies to other social security legislation, I
cannot say. It may do so, but I do not think it is appropriate to this
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:15:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

rightly said that if a local authority goes to court, the court will
not grant the order. But before the local authority goes to court, it
will have to deliver a letter to the old lady
saying that it is going to do so. What will be the impact of that? Is
she going to say, “Oh, that is fine. The court will turn it
down. I will see my solicitor or my son and get this defeated”.
No, the old lady will be thrown into a panic as a result of what the
local authority is
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:15:32"></hs_TimeCode>. I agree
totally with the Minister that most of the time, most local authorities
act perfectly reasonably. That is not what is at issue here. What is at
issue is whether on the face of primary legislation there should be the
scope for the odd authority to act unreasonably and thereby cause
terrible fear and distress to older people. That is what the
noble Earl, I am sure inadvertently, is
doing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:16:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

most powerful of the Minister’s arguments. He said that this
would be very unfair because people would get away with it and they
would gain at the expense of others who are also claiming benefits. But
I beg the Minister and the House to study my amendment. It does not
say, “Well, if you fill in the form inattentively and get it
totally wrong, you will get away with it”. That would come under
the phrase in my amendment, “they might have reasonably been
aware”. In most conceivable circumstances, my amendment would
allow recovery in just the same way as the Government’s
drafting, but it would do so without that frightful “or
otherwise”. It is a sword of Damocles being held over the heads
of many innocent older people, and they should be spared from

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said on Monday, the
principles which underpin this Bill are widely supported, although
recent revelations around deferred payments have put a considerable
damper on that. We have been concerned in our debates mostly with
trying to improve the Bill. A major feature of discussions has been the
capacity of local authorities to do what is required, including
responsibilities around assessment, providing information, preventing
needs for care and support, promotion of integration, provision of
information and support, direct payments, promotion of diversity and
quality in the provision of services, and dealing with provider
failure. Another<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>
concern has been about the amount of resources that will be
available to make the Bill effective—the more so when
one considers the number of self-funders who will in the end
receive support as a result of the introduction of the
cap.</hs_para>

is done in the context a very tight funding situation for health and
care generally. The Minister will be aware of reports from both the
King’s Fund and the Nuffield Trust, and, more recently, from the
NHS Confederation, which talked of the problems in healthcare and of
there being basically no growth in real-terms funding in the next few

Minister cannot be in ignorance of the widespread concern among local
authorities that, in essence, the Bill places many additional financial
responsibilities on local authorities for which they have little
confidence they will receive proper support from the Government. Let me
give one example. We know that the settlement for 2013 provided
£335 million so that councils can prepare for reforms in the
system of social care funding, including the introduction of a cap, and
a universal offer of deferred payment agreements from April
2015—this was in the guidance issued by CLG. That money was
intended to cover assessment and reviews, capital investment in
systems, capacity-building in individual councils, information and
advice, and introduction of deferred payments from April 2015. However,
my understanding from the Local Government Association is that that
£335 million was not new money; indeed, it was top-sliced from
the local government settlement. So the cost associated with funding
reform should be 
<?notus-xml column=589?>seen as a new burden and funded as such. If that is
only associated with the
introduction—essentially with helping local
authorities prepare for the provisions in this Bill—how much
more will the additional funding responsibilities be when it is
actually up and
running<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:34:21"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_parafo>

is widespread concern and doubt about local authorities’
capacity to set up the infrastructure to do the job, but the funding
issue is even more important. That is why my Amendment 121 suggests
that the Secretary of State asks the Office for Budget Responsibility
to complete a review of the funding of social care that assesses the
adequacy of current public funding of these services, the proposals for
the funding of provisions in this Act, the
implications of the Act and its funding for the NHS over the next five

eligibility criteria at the level set out in the

has prevailed over much of our discussions, I think it would
be very good if the Government agreed to do this. It would

the Government’s assurances on funding and I think this is
hardly surprising because the Government’s social care funding
strategy seems almost designed to confuse. We have Eric Pickles signing
up to quite swingeing cuts to local authority grants which inevitably
reduces social care funding substantially. We then see Health
Secretaries having to scrabble around to slip NHS cheques to local
government to mitigate some of the Pickles cuts. Of course I do not
want to be ungenerous to Health Secretaries, and these cheques are
better than nothing, but they do not make good the shrinking base

takes no account of the base budget deficit from which we are starting.
That deficit is due only to get worse because there is another set of

However, as the Minister acknowledged in Committee, only half of that
£3.8 billion is new money, and only half of the new money will
be paid upfront to local authorities as they start to implement the

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I have listened with care to noble Lords
as they have introduced their respective amendments and I am confident
that we can all agree 
<?notus-xml column=591?>that the issues that they raise are vital to the successful
implementation of government policy and are essential parts of good
policy-making. Let me first address the questions about the cost and
funding of these reforms. We have taken and will continue to take a
robust, evidence-based approach to assessing the cost of the reforms.
We are working closely with local authorities to help them to
understand the costs at a local level, and we will use this knowledge
to refine our national modelling further. Funding of care and support,
including the reforms in Part 1, will be reviewed regularly as part of
the spending review process, and the core elements of the capped-costs
system will be reviewed within each five-year
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000002">Turning
to the specific issue of the short and long-term costs of the national
eligibility threshold, I can assure noble Lords that we have published
an impact assessment fully setting up the costs and benefits of the
policy. We have comprehensively assessed and funded those provisions.
We have published impact assessments for all elements of the Bill and,
in line with the Government’s approach to all new burdens on
local authorities, those costs were fully funded in this year’s
spending round. Those estimates are based on the best available
evidence in the area. They have been produced in co-operation with
academic experts and officials from across

I can assure the noble Lords and the noble Baroness that we have fully
considered the wider impact of the reforms, including the impact on
the NHS. It really would not be productive to ask the OBR to
repeat that analysis in 2014. That would simply repeat what has already
been done, and it would have no further evidence on which to base its
work, even if it were to do it. Nor would that be an appropriate role
for the OBR, which is independent and has complete discretion to
determine the content of its publications and its programme of research

noble Lords and the noble Baroness are of course absolutely right that
it is essential that sufficient funding is made available for the
successful implementation of these reforms. In addition, when
allocating funding for its policies, the Government need to take a
broad overview of activity across all public services so that we can
make the best possible decisions. That is the purpose of the spending
review process and why a spending review is the best place to make
funding decisions. I struggle to see how a separate official process
considering funding for care and support in isolation is either
appropriate or
desirable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000005">The
noble Lord, Lord Hunt, also suggests that we review the adequacy of
public funding for social care services, a point reiterated by the
noble Lord, Lord Warner. I can assure them that we have done precisely
that in the recent spending round. As a response to the increasing
demand for care and support, we have taken steps to ensure that
adequate funding will be available. We have increased the NHS
contribution to care and support with the health benefit by
£200 million in 2013-14, taking the total amount to
£1.1 billion and have gone further in 2015-16 by
creating a £3.8 billion pooled budget for health and social
care, which will

of course, spending decisions for care and support will ultimately be
taken by local authorities. Perhaps I could deal with the point raised
by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, when he suggested that the
£335 million to which he referred had been topsliced
from the local government settlement. That funding will be allocated by
DCLG in 2015-16 as part of the local government settlement. That was
agreed as part of the spending round, which reviewed all government
spending, as I mentioned. There was no pre-existing settlement for
2015-16 before the spending round, so it is not true that this money
has been
topsliced.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000007">I
turn to the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Warner, that the

conduct post-legislative scrutiny, as the Government have committed to
do across the board for all new Acts. The agreement we have with the
House Liaison Committee in another place is that that should be done
between three and five years after Royal Assent. The joint programme

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the
Minister, although I am disappointed by his response. He argues that
the cost and funding elements in the Bill have been subject to a
robust, evidence-based approach and are reviewed regularly, and he
prays in aid the spending reviews. However, there is often a distance
from ministerial assurances about well-being and the reality on the
ground floor, and I have to say to him that the experience up and down
the country is of a health and social care system under huge pressure.
The Bill brings more pressures and many local authorities do not see
how they will be able to find resources in order to pay for the extra
demands and responsibilities the Bill places upon them. That is the

clause. During the debate in Committee, I highlighted the importance of
Section 117 in providing a comprehensive care package of health and
social care services to a very specific and extremely vulnerable group
of patients when they are discharged after detention in a psychiatric
hospital. Without appropriate community health and social care support
they may relapse, come to harm or even present a risk to

recognition of the inherent vulnerability of these patients and the
risks involved, and to encourage take-up by them, after-care services
under Section 117 have required local authorities and clinical
commissioning groups to provide after-care services free of charge and
are deliberately not defined in statue, as there is a wide range of
services that a detained patient might need in order to leave hospital
and live in the community. Mental health professionals need to have the
widest flexibility possible to devise creative care packages to keep
patients who have been detained well and prevent them relapsing. The
concept appears well understood by both health and local authorities

years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000017">There
is also a clear public health policy purpose behind Section 117, which
is to help get vulnerable people out of hospitals and back into the

and after-care services should be provided to enable a safe discharge
and to avoid all the emotional harm and exposure of a deterioration.

was highly unusual and complex. First, it is critical to recognise that
it was a migrant case. The family had no immigration status and so were
cut out of mainstream benefits and sources of
support, including housing. Their possible routes 
<?notus-xml column=596?>to support and, in particular, accommodation were
therefore very limited. Normally, accommodation is not an issue because
people get it from any number of other routes. Not so here . . .
Second, the Section 117 issue had to be addressed here, despite how
difficult it was, because of the way the other possible route to
accommodation (Section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948), works.
That provision cannot provide accommodation if there is an alternative.
Hence, to resolve where a Section 21 duty was owed, the court had first
to decide whether Section 117 applied . . . We were, in other words,

devising the Care Bill’s Explanatory Notes, but I do not think

putting Mwanza aside, I have consulted widely on the proposed

No one operating in the mental health field that I have spoken to, no
experts or professionals, agrees that this is the right way forward. I
have had discussions with, among others, representatives from Mind, the
national mental health charity, the mental health and disability
committee of the Law Society and the Mental Health Lawyers Association,
all of which have reached a consensus that, even with the extended
Explanatory Notes, they still believe that the best outcome would be to
remove Clause 71(5)(a). The Care and Support Alliance, representing
over 70 organisations, after having taken extensive legal advice,
firmly believes that paragraph (a) is too

are that, first, the proposed definition as it stands is too
restrictive and will not clarify the purpose or content of aftercare
packages; rather, it will narrow and limit the services that can be
regarded as aftercare services, so it runs the risk of imposing a
medical model. Secondly, it opens the way for legal disputes and
conflicts about whether or not a service is directly linked to a
person’s mental disorder, and there is a real risk that
aftercare services will be narrowly interpreted, encompassing only
health provision.</hs_para>

real case examples provided by Mind and others although, again, I will
not share them with the House today. Given all these points and 
<?notus-xml column=597?>all the consultation that I have done, my preference
would be for the Government to delete Clause 71 altogether. However, if
a definition is to be introduced, it must retain a broad, flexible
approach. Therefore, in the spirit of co-operation, which I know that
the Minister always aims for, and in trying to reach a way forward, I

that is a potential result that we will have to live with, in

that. The question that I had when I first met the Law Commission still
remains: when everything else in the legislation is geared towards
enabling health and social care to work together to enable the transfer
of people from acute health settings back into the community, why rip
up the one piece of legislation that has been there doing that for 30
years? It is not just that some of us see Section 117 as being
important with regard to the individuals whom we might know or come
across; rather, we see it as an important means of bringing about the
transfer that some of us have long hoped would happen in mental health
services whereby, instead of having patients who revolve between acute
and the community, we could have proper care planning in which
people’s mental health needs were addressed by some of the same
people, whichever setting they were in. It is not just about trying to
preserve a pot of money; it is about trying to keep open a pathway to
good and better practice. That is why the noble Lord, Lord Patel, as he

agree that setting out a definition of mental health aftercare in
legislation is important. A clear legal definition will mean that the
scope of aftercare will no longer be entirely open to interpretation by
the courts, whose views have varied over time. The question is what
that definition should be. As updated by government Amendments 129, 130
and 131, our proposed definition contains a carefully framed duty that
reflects the Government's policy on the appropriate scope of the duty
to provide free aftercare services for a very small group of patients
who have been detained for treatment under certain sections of the
Mental Health Act. It has carefully drawn limits because the Government
do not consider that it would be appropriate for the Mental Health Act
to impose a duty on local authorities to commission services that are
based on needs which neither arise from, nor are related to, a mental
disorder.</hs_para>

that the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Patel of Bradford,
goes too far and would create an inequity between this group of people
and others with equivalent needs for care and support who are not
eligible for free aftercare, either because they have been detained
under other provisions of the Act or not detained at all. They will be
means tested and will have to meet eligibility criteria for the social
care part of their aftercare package, so may not receive any
social care from the local authority. In addition, with an
ageing population, local authorities will have to be able to
differentiate “mental health aftercare” in
order to know when the “aftercare” finishes and ongoing
support for other reasons
begins.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000043">The

good idea and, if so, how it can most helpfully be drafted. The
Government’s definition of mental health aftercare services
builds on the definition recommended by the Law Commission. The
Government accepted the recommendation of the Law Commission as a
sensible starting point, but we have gone further. We propose a wider
definition than that suggested by the Law Commission, including that
Section 117 services may relate to as well as just arise from the

Marks of Henley-on-Thames (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, the probation
service is facing fundamental changes, yet during the passage of the
Offender Rehabilitation Bill through this House, there was very little
chance to debate these changes in any depth. The central issue I wish
to explore in this debate is how far, when these changes are made, can
we maintain and even improve the quality of probation services for the
rehabilitation of
offenders<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:32:59"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000057">That
issue raises a number of questions. First, can we retain our existing
probation officers within the new structure when the bulk of the
service is in private ownership? Secondly, how do we maintain the
standards, morale and ethos of the probation service? Thirdly, how can
we maintain the high quality recruitment and training in the future?
Fourthly, will the new structure deliver the promised new services we
all want to see: the through-the-gate supervision, and supervision for
offenders on release from short sentences? Fifthly, will the
reorganisation genuinely lead to more diversity, more innovation, and
better results or are we heading, as some fear, for low-cost
uniformity, led by commercial  
<?notus-xml column=607?>organisations with bad records of failure which will be of no long-term
benefit? Finally, will payment by results actually deliver results or
will the targets be either too hard to reach to make them worth aiming
for or insufficiently challenging so that they make no
difference<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:34:14"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000058" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000058">It
might help if I set out my understanding of how the proposals stand
now. On 1 April next year the probation service is to be split. The
existing 35 probation trusts will be wound up, the new National
Probation Service will be charged with looking after offenders
classified as high risk, with providing advice to courts, with
conducting the risk assessment of new clients and with handling cases
of breach. They will have a clear responsibility for public protection.
The NPS will look after 20% of the probation trusts’ current
case load, while 21 new community rehabilitation companies will take
over the remaining case load. It is intended that existing staff will
be reassigned between the NPS and the
CRCs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000059">Initially<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:35:17"></hs_TimeCode>,
each of the CRCs will be wholly owned by the Ministry of Justice. They
will cover England and Wales split into areas and each will be charged
with delivering the relevant orders of the court in its own area,
including community payback, unpaid work, curfews and drug
rehabilitation. The CRCs will generally be located in the same premises
as the NPS and, initially at least, those will be the existing
probation trust
buildings.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000060">Starting<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:36:06"></hs_TimeCode>
in late 2014, the intention is that the CRCs will be taken over by the
successful bidders in the competition which is being organised. The
bids will be judged on which provide the best package within what the
department calls an affordability envelope. So there is a slightly
uncomfortable compromise between competition on price, which risks
reducing quality, and competition on quality. However, in this area, of
course, an objective comparison of quality is very difficult because
bidders are expected to propose a range of different ways of delivering
the orders of the
court<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:36:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000061">In
the first stage, following 1 April, the probation services will look to
their clients and to the public much like the services provided by the
existing probation trusts; the same staff doing much the same work in
the same premises, though with some change in the allocation of work.
However, after the new contracts are let, the shape of the probation
services is going to be much more difficult to predict. The new
through-the-gate resettlement and supervision following short sentences
will only be implemented at this second stage, so the CRCs’
contractual obligations will then have to change. What other changes
will there be in the obligations of the CRCs under their new ownership
and will they vary from one CRC to the
next<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:37:38"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000062">These
substantial changes take place against a background of considerable
success for the probation trusts. Reoffending rates have been steadily
falling for all offenders apart from those serving short prison
sentences and they, to date, have had no contact with the probation
service anyway. The trusts’ performance has generally been rated
by the Ministry of Justice as good or excellent. The Merseyside Trust
was last year 
<?notus-xml column=608?>the first public sector winner of the British Quality
Foundation’s UK Excellence Award. All this has been achieved
within a falling budget. It is therefore unsurprising that there is
some bewilderment among the probation services as to why they need such
reorganisation at
all<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000063">Against
that background, I turn to my first question on the retention of
existing probation officers. We currently have a highly professional,
skilled and committed body of probation officers who are an asset of
great value, impossible to price but once lost very difficult to
replace. My concern is how far the new owners of the CRCs will in the
medium and long term retain the staff they take over. Will
they be required by their contracts to involve qualified probation
officers in the delivery of their
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:39:13"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

concerning the standards, morale and ethos of the probation service is
closely linked. My concern is not for the new NPS. Indeed, as a
national service, the NPS may develop more influence within the
criminal justice system than could the individual probation
trusts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:39:27"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
how far will standards be safe under the umbrella of the new providers?
Who are they likely to be? What mix will there be between commercial
and voluntary sectors? What role will there be for mutuals? How will
performance be monitored, and will that monitoring be
effective<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:39:56"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000065">My
third question concerned recruitment and training. In relation to all
these questions so far, one hopeful development is the proposed
establishment by the Probation Association and the Probation Chiefs
Association, with government approval, of an institute to be known as
the “Probation Institute”. Such an institute could offer
accreditation of courses and qualifications. It could maintain a
register of qualified probation officers, and could ultimately take on
the role of monitoring and enforcing professional performance
standards. That would assist providers when recruiting, and probation
officers when seeking new employment. The institute could also act as
an information exchange on innovation and best practice and would be a
valuable resource if it did so. The proposed institute might one day
apply for charter status, and would establish probation officers as a
strong and independent profession. In a world of diverse new providers,
this would be a significant
benefit<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:41:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000066">My
fourth question concerned the delivery of the new services. How
confident are the Government that satisfactory bidders will commit to
supplying through-the-gate resettlement and the extra supervision,
within the same overall price package as we pay for current services?
If the bidders do not emerge, the CRCs will stay with the Ministry of
Justice and the reorganisation will have failed to achieve its
object<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:41:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

on diversity of provision. Will we genuinely secure more voluntary
sector involvement—more local partnerships between smaller local
organisations and the main contractors? Will we secure the special
arrangements we need and which have been promised for women and young
offenders? Finally, will payment by results lead to improved
reoffending rates? Was the Social Market Foundation right or wrong to
conclude, as it did in its report this summer, that the extra payments
would not make it worth while for providers to pay the extra money to 
<?notus-xml column=609?>improve the service? Will the payment by results
provisions affect the prospect of more partnerships, even if main
contractors cannot pass on the risk—as they should not be able
to do—to their smaller
providers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:42:31"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000068">I
am not opposed to these reforms in principle. If they go well, they
could lead to more diversity, to more imaginative and effective
rehabilitation, to the provision of the new services, to lower
reoffending rates, and to the prospect of fewer people in prison, with
improved lives and substantial savings of public funds. However, I am
concerned that there are many pitfalls on the road to these desirable
outcomes. Perhaps some further time might be desirable for the transfer
to private ownership. I look forward to hearing other contributions to
this debate and to the response from my noble friend the

confess to the House that I feel very sad. If I was asked to pick an
exemplary area of effective public service in British social
history, I would pick the probation service. It has dedicated people of
quality; people of education, training and practical experience. They
do not just run a system or prove themselves as efficient in economic
terms, but they have a mission to relate to the individuals, the young
men, women and children —and not only
young—who are their responsibility, and to work with them as
individuals, trying to enable them to become productive. Rehabilitation
is a sort of artificial word—it does not get to the human centre
of all this. They enable these people to become constructive members of
society, to feel that they belong to society, and to grow in
confidence. I see that all that is in jeopardy because of a
preoccupation with change—as far as I can see, almost for the
sake of
change<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:44:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000071">Look
at what has happened in recent years. We have seen reoffending down and
the 35 probation trusts in England and Wales have been
described as being good or exceptional. Why change a situation that is
going so well? We have also seen—this is crucial—that
reoffending has been coming down. The latest set of statistics
published by the Ministry of Justice shows that for everyone under
probation supervision, the probation service will reduce reoffending by
5%. The fall in reoffending has been even higher: when the
figures for those serving community sentences are separated from those
released from custody, there has been a 6% reduction for those serving
community sentences. This is positive; it is not dramatic but is steady
progress, which matters in this area. It is about working
with people as people, not dramatic schemes against artificial

have another concern which I will share with the House. I have spent a
great deal of my life in the voluntary sector. I was a director of
Oxfam, which is quite a significant organisation. I am sure that if
these proposals go ahead, a lot of voluntary organisations will have a
great contribution to make. They will bring a great deal of sensitivity
and commitment. However, I am anxious. Why? The real centre of purpose
in the voluntary sector should be experimentation. It should be about
becoming a catalyst for society as a whole, about vision and new
approaches. Increasingly, the voluntary sector is being asked to become
an extension of the public sector—subcontracting to get the work
done more cheaply than it would be done under existing
arrangements is usually a governing factor. That is the objective;
rather like privatisation, we shall have to wait and
see<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:49:18"></hs_TimeCode> whether it
will work out like

concerned that all this may be affecting the historical culture and
ethos of the voluntary sector. It may be becoming a subcontracting
culture as distinct from an innovative, imaginative, visionary,
sensitive, dynamic purpose-challenging society with new experiences. I
think of a very practical example. I have referred to my experience at
Oxfam and other organisations in the voluntary sector, and I had for
nine years the joy of being national president of YMCA England and
Wales. I became particularly struck by the work the YMCA was doing with
young offenders. I remember going to a young offender institution where
it had won a contract to work. This, of course, was under the previous
Government; I am not disguising that reality—it is a fact. The
contract was to get young people into jobs—into work. It was
judged by the Home Office in terms of how successful it was in getting
those results against targets. What the team was discovering, as
sensitive, imaginative people, was that some of those with whom it
worked were not ready to go into a job straight away. They needed a lot
more support and preparation for making a success of their life. To get
them into a job straight away might be a recipe for
disaster<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:51:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000076">The
YMCA therefore began to do more work on this area because it
thought that it was its responsibility. It was told in no uncertain
terms to stop doing that because, if it did not meet the
targets on getting people into jobs, it would lose the
contract to somebody else. This is the sort of problem I see ahead.
These are the practical problems of the front line. I would like
to hear much more reassurance from the Government on
this<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:51:37"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the myriad agencies—statutory, voluntary and

know that the cost of the service is considerable, as one would expect
of a national public service. Indeed, the MoJ budget is second only to
the costs of the Prison Service, and cuts are inevitably constantly
sought by the Government, particularly in these times of recession.
Savings of 20% have been found between 2008-9 and 2012-13, while the
budget also fell by 19%, but costs are a persistent issue as they are
in all the social services. What also matters, however, is the quality
and professionalism of the service, which is dealing, in the community,
with some of the most damaged, difficult, vulnerable and often
dangerous members of our society. This requires skill and experience
that comes only with time. It also depends on relationships with the
police and on “integrated offender management” with a
host of other colleagues in the social services world, health,
education, employment and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000083" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000083">It is
worth reminding the House that, in the recent past, prison numbers have
been dropping. Last year there was a 5% decrease in those being
sentenced on the year before, and the prison population itself fell in 
<?notus-xml column=612?>the past 12 months for the first time since 1999. Recorded levels of
crime are at their lowest for 30 years, and youth crime is
down 47%. This illustrates the effectiveness and significance of
probation in helping to keep people out of prison, by managing them in
the community, where they are less likely to reoffend, at a fraction of
the cost of imprisonment. Where the figures go the other way relates to
those 50,000 minor, persistent offenders, of whom 57% reoffend, serving
a year or less in prison. Until now this group has never had any
statutory probation support; hence the high reoffending rate which the
Minister now wants to include.</hs_para>

the light of the probation service’s performance and background,
it beggars belief that the Minister, Chris Grayling, should be
contemplating handing over 80% of the probation service’s work
to an almost untried and untested system of payment by results, which
is still being assessed, to be administered by 21 crime
reduction companies (CRCs) with no earthly idea of what the outcomes
are likely to be. Probation officers will still have a guaranteed job
for the first year up to 1 April 2015, when the scheme goes live, when
their jobs will be “sold to the market”. There is no
indication of what the workforce will consist of, except possibly most
of those redundant probation officers. Their task will be to manage the
150,000 offenders that probation currently manages in the community
each year—excluding the high-risk offenders —and at the
same time to provide a year’s support to the 50,000 additional
group of low-level offenders that the Minister now wants to be
supervised for the first time. It is of course an admirable aim to have
additional support for this group, and it could be of great benefit to
offenders and public alike, but only if there is the skilled
supervision available in appropriate numbers. The Minister’s
solution of handing over the whole task to the new private sector,
divided into 21 community rehabilitation companies, in contract package
areas and overseen by six divisional heads, is what is being announced.
Beyond this there is absolutely no indication where the staff on the
ground are going to come from, who they will be, let alone what
experience and skill sets these newcomers will have. I understand that
this information comes under the heading of “commercial
confidentiality”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000085">We
know, however, that the 20% of current probation service staff who will
be left will be required to manage all the high-risk, most challenging
offenders, who will be assigned to them. Here their skills are
recognised. This is very important and welcome. They will also have
responsibility for bringing back all breach cases to the courts for
review and sentence.</hs_para>

management is part of probation’s professional work. It is a
delicate skill, and the assessment and allocation of risk is inevitably
subject to change. Of course, with professional help, people come off
the risk register, but they can also fluctuate, which raises the
question of whether each time offenders become low risk they will be
transferred to a CRC and will then have to be reassigned again if
circumstances change once more—as well they might. This is
another “detail” of some significance, because continuity
of offender management, as anybody in the business knows, is of extreme
importance. However, how these issues will be expected to be dealt with
remains unclear—as 
<?notus-xml column=613?>does whether people will be shifted between CRCs and probation depending
on their assessed level of risk. What is clear is that the
division of management between low and medium-risk, and high-risk,
offenders means that the service will inevitably be fragmented, thus
compromising accountability and effective community support. 1 would be
grateful for the Minister’s comments on
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000087">The
additional cohort of 50,000 offenders will be required to remain on
supervision for a whole year, regardless of the length of the short
sentence served or the nature of the offence. For example, it could be
a two or three-month sentence for a driving offence. How appropriate is
a year’s supervision for
that?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000088">Apart
from issues of staff training and experience, there are considerable
risks in the management of a whole year’s supervision. Offenders
and professionals are likely to find a year disproportionate, which
will make compliance very difficult and almost inevitably will increase
the risk of breach by this
group.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000089" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000089">It is
estimated by the Government that around 13,000 offenders each year will
be recalled or will breach their conditions and end up in prison again,
because for many a year is inappropriate and too long. It is not clear
how the CRCs will manage this potentially enormous addition to their
workload, and it will increase the prison population by an estimated
600 people. This in turn will impact on current prison management,
which is simultaneously dealing with unprecedented cuts on the one hand
and the reorganisation of resettlement prisons on the other.
Resettlement is another big issue because it has already resulted,
inevitably, in the mixing of young people, who are often vulnerable,
with adults. This is highly undesirable and destabilising to the normal
allocation of prisoners, which is an important part of prison life. It
has already led to increased violence and drug use in HMP/YOI Portland,
as reported by the IMB, and to a 50% increase in self-harm among young
people within a year of mixing with adult
prisoners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101684000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#13101684000090">I
regret that the Government have not wanted to take more time and have
not tried out the ideas in some pilot areas, for example. Instead,

the goal posts shift. Probation trust chairs are finding the

questions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000002">When
we were dealing with the Offender Rehabilitation Bill, I visited a
number of very senior professionals in the probation service. From a
management point of view, they made one central point to me. It is a
point that the noble Baroness, Lady Linklater, made, but I think that
it is worth expanding on it after what they said to me. Currently, the
probation trusts arrange their management in multi-expert groups of
different levels of experience and expertise. The reason is that they
can provide continuity of access to, and supervision of, the offenders
they are now looking after. The point that was made very forcefully to
me by senior probation trust managers was that they experience
problems when offenders move between different institutions.
Whether the move is from prison into the community or from one place in
the community to a different address that is under the supervision of a
different probation trust, there is always a dropout of
people breaching conditions or not maintaining contact with probation
officers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000003">The
point that was made to me—which the noble Baroness, Lady
Linklater, made—is that built into the proposed new system is
the certainty that there will be more changes between institutions. You
will be moving from the National Probation Service, which will make the
initial assessment, to a private provider that will then run the
supervision for whatever the period is. Then, if there is a breach or a
change in circumstances—for example, if the offender starts
taking drugs again—they will go back to the National
Probation Service for a reassessment. Perhaps there will be a
reassignment or perhaps they will go back to court. The point that the
managers made to me was that with every transfer you get
dropout, which builds inefficiency into the system. Therefore, my first
question to the noble Lord, Lord Ahmad, is: has this point been
addressed in the contracts that are being bid for? It is the central
point that was made to me by senior probation trust
managers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000004" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000004">My
second question is about the Through the Gates pilots that I understand
are currently being run. When will the results of these pilots be
available? From what I have heard in unofficial gossip, if one may put
it like that, a number of these pilots have been inadequately resourced
and inadequately managed. Therefore, the results may be worse than the
Government had hoped for. If this is the case, it would be a shame,
because I for one think that the model of providing through-the-gate
provision, perhaps with somebody who has experience of coming out of
prison helping with supervision, is a good one. However, it needs to be
properly supported and funded for it to
work.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000005">I close

mean time, the Government have displayed their contempt for the views
of this House by embarking on yet another bout of pre-emption, or as I
have described it in respect of other matters, pre-legislative
implementation of the kind roundly criticised by the Constitution
Committee, by pressing ahead with arrangements to dismember the service

“clinical judgment of risk”.

establish a hierarchy of officers—a responsible officer, a
supervising officer and a supervisor, all with different roles, piling
complexity upon confusion and fragmentation. The model

arrangements, but not local authorities, clinical commissioning groups

offenders who may have served as little as one day of a custodial
sentence? I repeat some of the questions that I raised on Report, to
which no answer was given. In relation to payment by results, what
performance indicators will be used to measure service delivery? How
will the Ministry of Justice decide to deduct—and on what
basis—a proportion of the fee for underperformance? What weight
will be given to the nature of any reoffending? Will a motoring offence
count the same as a burglary or crime of violence? How long is the
period in which reoffending occurs to be measured? The
Minister’s letter on the subject suggested 12
months—surely too
short.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000014">What of

September, we published details of how the new model for supervision of
offenders will work, alongside the launch of the competition to find
future providers of rehabilitation services.
Questions have 
<?notus-xml column=618?>been raised, and the noble Lord, Lord Judd, asked
the obvious question of “why?”. The Government’s
position is that these reforms are vital if we are to break the
depressing cycle of reoffending. At the moment, nearly half of all
offenders released from our prisons offend again within a year. I will
look at a couple of reoffending figures—my noble friend Lady
Linklater referred to one of them—almost 60% of prisoners
released from under 12 months of custody go on to reoffend. That is a
statistic that we cannot ignore. Equally, there is the cost of
reoffending. The National Audit Office, back in 2010, estimated that
the crimes committed by recent ex-prisoners cost anything between
£9.5 billion and £13 billion to the economy.
Notwithstanding some of the information about the probation service and
its success, which I will come to in a moment or two, these
provide valid reasons why it is important we also address
the issue of reoffending, particularly among those serving sentences of
under a year, which has not yet been
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000022">Legislating
to provide that virtually all offenders released from custody will be
subject to supervision is just one important aspect and benefit of our
overall package of Transforming Rehabilitation reforms. The noble Lord,
Lord Judd, asked why we need to change when probation trusts are
performing so well. Under the current system, the most prolific group
of reoffenders are those released form short custodial sentences. They
receive no statutory rehabilitation support. Trusts currently do not
have the opportunity to work with them, and we believe that our reforms
will go towards addressing that particular issue. We need to stop
offenders passing through the system again and again, creating more
victims and damaging communities, and we need to have a system that is
sustainable given our current financial constraints. That is, in
essence, what is behind our
reforms.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000023">The
noble Lord, Lord Marks, and the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, mentioned
Through the Gate. In response, I will start with the impact of the
reforms. First, there is the support that prisoners will get through
the gate from custody into the community. This is an important reform.
Providers will offer a resettlement service for all offenders in
custody before their release. That may include support in finding
accommodation, family support, mentoring and financial advice. I share
the sentiment expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Judd. We want to ensure
that every citizen of this country, if they commit a crime, is given an
opportunity to reform but also to then become a productive citizen and
contribute to the economy of our country. The services in custody will
be underpinned by changes to the way the prison estate is organised.
Through new resettlement prisons, in most cases, the same offender
manager will work with offenders in custody and continue their
rehabilitation work in the community. That continuity is very
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000024">The

to the voluntary sector. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, raised this
particularly important point. Its expertise is part and parcel of what
we are seeking 
<?notus-xml column=619?>to integrate into the reforms. We are creating a much greater level of
opportunity for voluntary and community sector organisations to play a
role in rehabilitating offenders. I do not quite share the sentiment
that they are there just for experimentation—they are there for
their expertise. They are often best placed to tackle the issues that
lead offenders back to crime, whether that is substance misuse,
homelessness or a lack of training and education. They are often best
placed to work with particular groups with complex needs; for example,
many female offenders. I have seen during visits to different
prisons—I have often cited Peterborough prison
—where voluntary organisations such as the St Giles
Trust play a vital role in the rehabilitation of
prisoners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000026">The
Government are committed to ensuring that the market is not simply
cornered by the big players. In July, the Ministry of Justice awarded
£150,000 to AVECO to deliver a series of skills and information
workshops aimed at supporting the voluntary sector and mutuals to
compete for contracts and deliver services to cut reoffending. As part
of the rehabilitation competition, we are also running a registration
process for smaller providers in order to maximise, as far as possible,
the opportunities for them to be involved. We want to draw on the best
services that can be offered by practitioners across the public,
private and voluntary sectors. I say that to underline the driving
force behind these reforms. They are about improving the support we
give to offenders to turn away from crime. We will be judging potential
bidders on the quality of the service they offer, not just on
price.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000027">I turn
to probation professionals and staff. All noble Lords, I believe,
referred to this, including my noble friend Lord Marks in his opening
remarks. The Government’s position remains that we cannot
deliver these improvements unless we retain the skills and expertise of
probation professionals as we move into the new system. Their
excellence is not something to be ignored. I have the very greatest
respect and admiration for the work that our probation officers do and
am sure that the sentiment echoes across the Chamber. They play a
fundamental role in protecting the public and helping offenders
reintegrate into society. We do not want to lose their expertise. That
is why the national framework for the transfer of staff to the new
system gives an absolute commitment to fair processes and protection
for staff within the system, including: a guarantee of employment for
all probation staff employed by a probation trust on 31 March 2014, in
either the appropriate community rehabilitation company or the National
Probation Service; protection of current terms and conditions at the
point of transfer; and no compulsory
redundancies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000028">My
noble friend Lady Linklater talked about 20% of probation staff going
to the NPS. The proportion of staff who will actually move to the

still being finalised. There is certainly no set target of 20%. It will
be the proportion needed to effectively manage the appropriate service.
Alongside that, we will place contractual requirements on community
rehabilitation companies to have and maintain a workforce with
appropriate levels of training and competence throughout the life of
their contracts.</hs_para>

other questions. The noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, asked about the
disruption caused by offenders moving. There will be 21 CRCs, which
will cover larger areas. The Bill also makes sure that offenders
subject to community orders do not move residence where such a move
will hinder the offender’s rehabilitation. That is a very
important
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000030">My noble

by results and performance management were mentioned by several noble

work with all offenders, including the most prolific, and have proposed
important safeguards. We continue to test and refine this particular
model. We will also put in place a clear performance framework to
ensure that community rehabilitation companies meet the standards
required of them in managing their cases and delivering the sentences
of the courts. The system will be regulated through a combination of
robust contract management, audit and independent inspections by the

turn to risk and public protection, which were raised by the noble
Lords, Lord Judd and Lord Beecham, and by my noble friend Lady
Linklater. Public protection is absolutely at the heart of these
reforms, and the National Probation Service will have a crucial role to
play in this. It will risk assess every offender at the outset and
retain the management of offenders who pose a high risk of serious harm
to the public and who have committed more serious offences. Community
rehabilitation companies will be contractually obliged to work with the
National Probation Service to manage those offenders at risk of causing
serious harm. Any offender whose risk level escalates to
“high” during their sentence will be transferred back to
the National Probation
Service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000033" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0002.htm#1310171000033">The

authorities need to be directly involved in all interventions in
prisons or that local safeguarding teams would need to be called upon
to intervene in every safeguarding concern raised. However, directors
of adult services need to be confident that their standards are
consistent with those set out in the report <I>No Secrets </I>and any
exceptions are explicit and jointly agreed. Therefore, I believe that
an inquiry by a local authority will not duplicate the excellent work
undertaken by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Prisons, or by the
prison itself. It will complement and enhance it, and could potentially
help save
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T20:36:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the noble Baroness did not provide an answer as to who would
be responsible for the safeguarding of people in approved premises, if
it is not the local authority. For the sake of clarity, I will ask the
question again. As I understand it, approved premises are the
responsibility of the probation service and not of the prison service.
Any responsibilities that prison governors have for safeguarding adult
offenders end once that person is released and physically leaves the
premises. As the Bill currently stands, people living in approved
premises will not be the responsibility of local authorities as is
everybody else who lives in the community. So if someone is living in
approved premises, such as a probation hostel, and is part of the
community, as is anybody else, and that person has been abused or
neglected or is at serious risk, who will have the obligation to carry
out a safeguarding
inquiry<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T20:37:36"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para>

inquiries by the local authority, not providing people in prison or who
reside in approved premises with the same equivalence of care as for
other people in the community makes little sense. The Bill establishes
that equivalence of care applies to prisoners, and this should extend
to safeguarding and to how safeguarding concerns are dealt
with. Local authority adult safeguarding procedures are well
established within local communities and the safeguarding of people in
prisons and of those residing in approved premises should not be
excluded from this body of
expertise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T20:38:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

approved premises, such as hospitals and care homes, should have their
own internal safeguarding arrangements and responses to safeguarding
concerns. However, by excluding prisons and approved premises from
safeguarding inquiries by the local authority, prisoners and people
residing in approved premises will be denied the equivalent protections
afforded to other vulnerable adults. Further, the opportunity for
constructive dialogue and shared learning, which some prisons and local
authorities currently enjoy, may also be lost. As the Bill stands, this
is a serious gap which places a very vulnerable group at risk.
Therefore, I hope the Minister can provide some clarification,
reassurance or, better still, accept my amendments. I beg to

pleased that further guidance is to be issued to encourage governors
and directors to attend local authority safeguarding adults board

liaison with local authorities. However, for clarification, if someone
is living in approved premises, my understanding is that that has
nothing to do with the prison governor or the prison because they are
in the community living in, say, a bail hostel. Who has responsibility
for any serious issue of neglect? I do not think that the probation
service undertakes safeguarding inquiries. It would be the local
authority, but this clause seems to suggest that it would not be;
rather, that it would be the prison governor. That does not make sense
to me, although perhaps I do not understand it

raised issues in connection with this Bill. The issues remain the same,
but the legislative landscape is changing quite considerably, and the
practical nature of services for people who will be affected by the
Bill is also changing radically. Given these immense changes, coupled
with the demographic developments that we know about, it is important
to remind ourselves that there are still some gaps in the

will be to promote and protect the rights of children, and to have
regard to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Their primary
job is to involve children who are living away from home or are in

another group of amendments before us on Report been dealt with in a

as firmly and as strongly as the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that

we next convene to discuss this Bill on Report, we will turn our
attention to some amendments tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, on
behalf of the Government about the appointment of the chief inspectors.
The appointment of chief inspectors as officers within the CQC is
welcome. It is welcome that there is going to be a Chief Inspector of
Hospitals; it is a good thing that there is going to be Chief Inspector
of Adult Social Care—I imagine that we have begun to receive
information from the Chief Inspector of Adult Social Care, who took up
her position this

be in no doubt that, however independent, experienced and formidable
are the individuals, their role is limited. The CQC investigates merely
licensed providers; it does not even investigate pathways of care. We
know that the majority of care and help in the future will take place
in the community—that is where the bulk of older people will be.

Commissioner, in Wales. I know it has not been set up with this
particularly in mind but I hope that somebody, somewhere, begins to
research the economic benefit of having an older persons’
commissioner. We are going to have to look at the whole economics of
ageing in a completely different way. The post of a commissioner could
be very important and it would help if we started to move Government
along to seeing older people as potentially economic assets in our

here. I was a civil servant in Whitehall for a long time. There were
many different departments dealing with different aspects of
children’s policy but no one was joining it all up. When
the children’s commissioner came on the scene, the

£34 billion, and so many volunteers are older people. We do not

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity to
discuss this extremely well crafted amendment, which proposes the
establishment of an older persons’ commissioner. Our ambition is
to make this country one of the best places to grow old in and I begin
by saying that I have some sympathy with the intention behind the
amendment; to ensure that older people receive the high-quality care
they need and also to support them to use the complaints system
effectively when things go wrong. However, disappointingly for the
noble Baronesses, I cannot subscribe to the solution that is proposed
in the amendment. The main reason for this is that the provisions
contained in the amendment are, by and large, covered by work already
being undertaken elsewhere. The interests of service users are already

begin by citing the role of the CQC. The Care Quality
Commission’s role is to ensure providers of regulated activities
in England provide people with safe, effective, compassionate and
high-quality care. The new chief inspectors for hospitals, adult social
care and general practice will champion the views of patients and
service users and judge the quality of care. Then, separate from the
CQC, the new chief social worker will ensure that social work practice
is directly inputting into policy development and we now have
Healthwatch, whose function it is to represent service users’
views. If noble Lords look at what we are doing in the Bill, new
statutory obligations are being introduced, such as the duties to
establish safeguarding adults boards and to undertake safeguarding
inquiries and/or reviews. We also have the government amendment to
require independent advocacy in certain

beyond the Bill, the vulnerable older people’s plan is working

needs. Furthermore, 
<?notus-xml column=635?>we want older people to have a major
voice in issues that affect them. The Minister for Care and Support and
the Pensions Minister take part in the UK Advisory Forum on Ageing.
This group gives Ministers the opportunity to engage with and hear
directly from older people on the key issues affecting them. I suggest
that all these steps, taken together, go a considerable way towards
addressing the concerns at which the amendment is aimed, but I need to
be clear that, to minimise the impact on the public purse, we would not
envisage setting up a new public authority alongside those
functions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T21:07:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0003.htm#1310171000085">My
noble friend Lady Barker asked why we should not have an older
persons’ commissioner since there is a children’s
commissioner? If an older persons’ commissioner were
established, the supporting structure would potentially be very large
and would cost significantly more than the children’s
commissioner. This is not only because of the comparatively larger
number of older people who receive services compared to children, but
also because the amendment confers a wider range of functions on the
older persons’ commissioner than the children’s
commissioner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0003.htm#1310171000086">Michelle<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T21:09:38"></hs_TimeCode>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, this amendment concerns the new statutory
duty of candour. This will place a requirement on registered providers
of health and adult social care to be open with patients and service
users about failings in care. The Francis report made a clear
recommendation that there should be a statutory obligation to observe a
duty of candour on providers of healthcare who believe that treatment
or care provided by them to a patient has caused death or serious
injury. This would require the provider to inform the patient of that

Government’s approach is to introduce this duty as a requirement
for registration with the CQC. In Committee, noble Lords tabled
amendments that sought to place the duty of candour in the Bill. The
amendment that I am presenting today seeks to strike a balance; I make
no apology for that, since it allows us to have the best of both
worlds. The amendment tabled in my name makes it clear that the
Government must introduce such a regulation. It does not present the
Government with a choice; rather, it imposes a crystal clear obligation
on the Government to put such a regulation in place. I hope that it
will be welcome to noble Lords for those reasons. I beg to

happened to their loved ones if they are not told and given an apology.

Mid Staffordshire hospital? Recently I heard of a former police
superintendent who had had a brain injury due to an accident, and was a
patient in a well known central London hospital. When his wife and
young son went to visit him, they smelt him before they saw him. They
found him facing the wall in bed, unable to move and lying in soiled
sheets and wearing a filthy gown. His wife was so upset that she told a
nurse, who just said that they were overworked. The next time the wife
visited she found him sitting alone,

changed. She said to her children, “We are taking Daddy

refer to the Francis report, which calls for a common culture to be
shared throughout the system. These three characteristics are required:
openness, enabling concerns to be raised and disclosed freely, without
fear, and questions to be answered; transparency, allowing true
information about performance and outcomes to be shared with staff,
patients and the public; and candour, ensuring that patients harmed by
a healthcare service are informed of the fact and an appropriate remedy
is offered, whether or not a complaint has been made or a question
asked about it. That requires all organisations and those working in
them to be honest, open and truthful in all their dealings with

Hunt of Kings Heath:</Member></B> My Lords, the Opposition strongly
support the thrust of the Francis report in its determination that the
NHS be honest with patients who have been harmed. I very much echo the
comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, in describing why we
need an open culture. I welcome government Amendment 140. It is very
important; we welcome the duty of candour being placed in the Bill. The
amendment is less detailed than my own and will rely on regulations, as
the noble Earl, Lord Howe, has said. The important thing is to get this
in the Bill.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="1310171000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0003.htm#1310171000098">I
have a couple of questions for the noble Earl. First, can he confirm
that the regulations will be affirmative? Secondly, in considering the
regulations, will he look at the issue of the threshold? For instance,
the regulations might restrict the statutory duty of candour to cases
that could be described as of severe harm or fatal; or it might go
wider. In his report, Robert Francis used the word
“serious”. Clearly, there is a distinction between severe
harm and seriousness, but most patients and their relatives, or anyone
involved in anything that could be described as a serious case, would
wish the organisation in the health service to be as open as possible
about what had happened.</hs_para>

issues; but it is noticeable that the being open guidance is clear that
cases of moderate harm and above must be disclosed. The NHS
constitution does not put any limit on the level of harm that would be
disclosed. I do not expect the noble Earl to respond to the detail of
those questions tonight, but in drafting the regulations it would be
reassuring to know, first, that consultation will take place with
patient groups on the contents of those regulations before they are
published and, secondly, that the question of the threshold by which
the seriousness of the case would come within the regulations will be
given very great consideration.</hs_para>

Barker:</Member></B> I have a quick follow-up to the question of the
noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. Sir Robert Francis’s
recommendations were clear that the duty of candour should apply where
death or serious harm “may have been caused” or were
believed or suspected to have been caused. That is an important
distinction; it is not merely playing with words. When the Minister
comes to respond, perhaps in writing, will he say whether that point
will be covered in
regulations?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310171000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0003.htm#1310171000102"><B><Member ContinuationText="Earl Howe" PimsId="1035" UID="1310171000234" xid="1749" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-0003.htm#1310171000234">Earl
Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that we all aiming for the same
effect and that there is little difference in the approach that we are
taking. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is drafted as a
stand-alone duty: it would place a duty of candour on providers, but it
would operate outside of the CQC registration system. As such, it is
not clear who would enforce the duty of candour or what would be the
consequences for a provider who did not observe the duty.</hs_para>

a requirement for registration with the CQC comes with a ready-made
enforcement vehicle, including the power to prosecute providers who do
not meet the duty. In Committee, we explained why this is our preferred
approach. It would give the flexibility to develop the duty in
consultation with service users and carers. I can indeed confirm that
patient groups will be included. The duty itself will have the same
legal power in secondary legislation as it would in primary
legislation.</hs_para>

progress in taking this forward. In the summer, the CQC consulted on
plans to introduce a duty of candour set through its registration
requirements. The CQC is due to publish the findings from the
consultation shortly. The department plans to consult on a draft
regulation later in the autumn. I assure noble Lords that both I and my
officials would be pleased to discuss the content of the draft duty of
candour regulation with them in detail as we develop the final
regulation. I confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that these will be
affirmative regulations.</hs_para>

the Francis and the Berwick reports recommended that the statutory duty
of candour for CQC-registered providers should apply in instances of
death or serious injury/incident. There is a balance to be struck. We
accept the Berwick report finding that an automatic duty of candour
covering every single error could lead to defensive documentation and
large bureaucratic overheads that would distract from care.</hs_para>

such cases? I can see the distinction with regard to the seriousness

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 40 focuses
on the impact of the underoccupancy charge on would-be adopters,
special guardians and foster parents. We know that there is a widely
held concern about the negative impact of the housing underoccupancy
charge or, as we call it, the bedroom tax. The plight of those who are
unable to move to smaller properties, or who need the extra
accommodation for obviously justifiable reasons is regularly
highlighted in the media.</hs_para>

concentrate our concerns today on a very specific consequence of the
new charge, which is how it impacts on the already chronic shortage of
existing and potential foster carers. As noble Lords will know, the
bedroom tax restricts housing benefit to one bedroom per person or per
couple living as part of a household. Tenants affected will face a 14%
cut in housing benefit for the first “excess” bedroom and
a 25% cut where two or more bedrooms are underoccupied. The average
loss of income is estimated to be around £14 per week. Our
concern is that foster children are not counted as part of the
household for benefit purposes and therefore that, technically, all
foster carers could face cuts in housing benefit.</hs_para>

by our colleagues in the Commons and last-minute changes announced in
Committee by the Minister mean that foster carers are allowed one
additional room in their homes, as long as they have registered as a
foster carer or fostered a child within the past 12 months. This means
that around 5,000 foster carers would be exempt from the bedroom 
<?notus-xml column=228?>tax, and obviously we welcome that concession. However, foster carers
with more than one child will still face the bedroom tax. The reforms
still apply to foster carers who have two or three bedrooms for
fostering children.</hs_para>

situation can apply to a discretionary housing fund for support with
their housing costs but because of its discretionary nature, this is
not guaranteed—and carers will have to reapply for this benefit
every six weeks, even if they have fostered a child on a long-term
basis. We do not believe that this is satisfactory. It shows a lack of
joined-up thinking by the Government, given the current acute shortage
of foster carers. We believe that if the rules remain as they are,
foster carers will be deterred from providing foster care for more than
one child at a time. This means, for example, that children in foster
care are more likely to be separated from their siblings. With there
already being a shortage of foster carers in the UK, these reforms are
likely to mean fewer new recruits coming forward and children’s
well-being suffering as a result.</hs_para>

the Government are committed to helping people foster, adopt and be
special guardians to some of the most vulnerable children. We want to
ensure that government policy supports this aim. As has already been
pointed out, on 12 March my right honourable friend the Secretary of
State for Work and Pensions announced an easement of the treatment of
foster carers under the housing benefit policy to remove the spare room
subsidy. Foster carers are now allowed one additional room under this
policy, as are those who have a child placed with them for adoption.
That will ensure that many foster carers will no longer be affected by
removal of the spare room
subsidy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000014">Adopted
children, those placed for adoption and those being looked after by
special guardians are treated as part of the family in the same way as
birth children, so these children’s bedrooms are also included
in the bedroom assessment for the household. Prospective adopters and
prospective special guardians awaiting a child being placed with them
are treated differently. This is because these are temporary
situations. People in these circumstances will be able to apply to the
local authority for short-term assistance from the discretionary
housing payment fund. My honourable friends the Minister for Children
and Families and the Minister for Welfare Reform have written to local
authorities highlighting that these groups should be a priority for
discretionary housing payment funding. The measures the Government have
taken should ensure that foster carers, prospective adopters and

brutal and shocking business. Trafficked people are modern-day slaves
and are among the most vulnerable people in our society. They are
deprived of their liberty and brought to a foreign country where they
do not speak the language. They have no friends or family, and they do
not know whom they can trust or where they can go for help. They have
their passports taken away and are then imprisoned, sometimes behind
locked doors but more effectively through physical and psychological
threats, often to the safety of their families at home, even
abroad<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:57:27"></hs_TimeCode>. This

2012, a number of noble Lords spoke passionately about the plight of
trafficked children and the care they receive after they have been
rescued. They emphasised the large number of trafficked children who
had been lost from local authority care. The figures may have improved
a little since 2010, when, over the preceding five years, 301 of the
942 trafficked children who were rescued then went missing from
care<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T15:58:35"></hs_TimeCode>. However,

what do they do? The role of a child trafficking guardian has been
developed by UNICEF, and my amendment is based on its model as set out
in its important 2006 publication guidelines on the protection of child
victims of trafficking. Child trafficking guardians have two main
functions. First, they provide a constant point of reference. Child
victims of trafficking are, for the reasons I have explained,
especially vulnerable. When they are rescued they find themselves in a
situation where they have to engage with multiple state
agencies—the police, the courts, local authorities, social
workers, education and so on. That is a daunting prospect for an adult
in a foreign country—how much more so for a child.</hs_para>

engaging with each agency, they have to deal with a different person
and go through the process of telling their painful story again and
again. In this context a child trafficking guardian provides an
absolutely crucial role. It is not about creating an additional layer
of bureaucracy as some people have alleged: the whole point is that the
child trafficking guardian places no additional burden on the child but
helps them to navigate their way through the existing bureaucracy. They
are appointed as a constant in a bewildering sea of different agencies
to help the child negotiate that
sea<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:02:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000025">The
second main function of a child trafficking guardian is that they have
a legal recognition to advocate on the child’s behalf and in the

state agencies. If the child does not want the burden of having to

reminded noble Lords of the remit of child trafficking guardians, I now
turn to the arguments that the Government have previously advanced to
suggest that the law already effectively makes provision for child
trafficking guardians. In the first instance, the Government pointed
out that the Children Act places on local authorities a general
obligation to protect the welfare of all children within their
boundaries. The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:03:32"></hs_TimeCode>
Government have further pointed to three specific roles in the Children
Act that assist the local authority in this task—namely, Section
26 advocates, independent visitors and independent reviewing officers.
After close examination, as I explained in February 2012, I and other
noble Lords have concluded that none of these meets the requirements of
a child trafficking guardian, either according to the UNICEF definition
or our obligations under the EU anti-trafficking
directive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:04:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the advocates. Advocates appointed under Section 26A of the Children
Act act on the child’s behalf only in relation to local
authority case reviews and are not appointed from the moment  a
child is identified as a victim of trafficking. They 
<?notus-xml column=234?>become involved in supporting a child only if the child chooses to take
advantage of the service. As one solicitor pointed out to me, this
assumes the child in question is mature enough to make this decision.
The solicitor wanted to know how this would help the very young
trafficked children with whom they had worked, some of whom were under
two years
old<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:04:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000028">Secondly,
independent visitors can be appointed under Section 23ZB if a local
authority considers it is in a child’s best interest. However,
we should remember they provide only a befriending or visiting role and
do not have the right to advocate on a child’s behalf. Section
25A requires the appointment of an independent reviewing officer for
every looked-after child, with a specific function in relation to
reviews of a child’s care. These officers are not required to
have regular contact with a child between the review meetings and do
not accompany or support the child in other
contexts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:05:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000029">Having
considered what child trafficking guardians do and the reasons why
current legislation does not provide an equivalent, I now come to the
research findings of the <I>Still at Risk</I> report, commissioned by
the Government in preference to accepting my child trafficking guardian
amendment of February 2012.  I have to tell noble Lords that
when I read the report, I felt that we had been absolutely correct to
move Amendment 57A to the Protection of Freedoms Bill in 2012, and was
convinced of the need to find the first available opportunity to
retable my amendment. I must admit to great sorrow and a little
frustration that we have been unable to move forward on this issue for
18 months. It pains me greatly to think of children who have not

need for someone who can accompany a child through the complexities of

somebody like me, I don’t know my way out. I can’t even

Josephine, said, “When I went to social services I didn’t
have a social worker and my case was from one person to another person

I didn’t have no one who really knew my case … And

a minority of the children were happy with the care and support they

widely. Children often had multiple social workers or key workers,

frequently repeat their stories of the traumatic abuse and exploitation
they had experienced. Local authorities reported that they sometimes
experience barriers to

now make some detailed comments about Amendment 42, which, although
largely identical in effect to Amendment 57A, is different in
structure. Amendment 42 requires each trafficked child to be allocated
a child trafficking guardian as soon as possible after the child is
identified as a potential victim of trafficking—a key
requirement of the EU anti-trafficking directive. The particular
responsibilities in proposed new subsection (2) have been based on
UNICEF guidelines and are focused on providing that independent and
continuous support in relation to all agencies; and that is what is
currently
lacking<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:09:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

child trafficking guardian’s responsibility is their role as an
advocate on behalf of the child, which can include, where appropriate,
instructing the child’s solicitor. This role and the need for
its recognition by all relevant agencies are set out in proposed new
subsection (6). This is vital if the advocacy function is to be
effective and would enable the guardian to speak up for the
child’s best interests to all those involved in the
case.</hs_para>

the <I>Still at Risk</I> report highlights, some voluntary
organisations currently provide excellent advocacy and support services
for children who are trafficked and, indeed, the report quotes some
children as saying that this was the most helpful of all the support
that they had
received<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:10:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
However, these organisations have no recognition in law in relation to
the child and are therefore able to assist only where the agencies and
professionals handling the child’s case are open to their
involvement. The amendment would provide  a mechanism to give
these organisations that legal
recognition<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:11:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

another noteworthy aspect of the amendment. Proposed new subsection (4)
allows for child trafficking guardians to be public sector employees,
or staff or volunteers in a voluntary organisation. This allows the
Government flexibility in determining how these services should be
provided and rises to the challenge of managing costs for the good of
our public finances—something that this Government have rightly
prioritised. It could be expensive to appoint salaried staff and create
a public sector agency to fulfil this role, whereas equipping charities

the child trafficking unit at the University of Bedfordshire, which
does amazing work in supporting young people who have been
trafficked<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:14:11"></hs_TimeCode>. The
issue foremost in its mind is the importance of guardianship and
advocacy. Children are still at risk and the present arrangements are

for guardianship, and I wish to add a few remarks.</hs_para>

Member’s Bill on human trafficking to the House in November
2011. These issues came up then. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop
of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich spoke of trafficking being an issue for
our common humanity. Nothing seems to have changed and, in particular,
children who are trafficked need all the help they can get. A guardian
who advocates in the best interests of the child is a vital element in
that
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:15:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000040">Many
of these children remain unidentified unless they are associated with
criminal offences. I am thinking of young boys who work in cannabis
factories, of which, I read in the newspaper, there are about 500,000
in this country. These boys get caught and the bosses escape. I am
thinking of girls sold into the sex trade, who have their passports
removed and are kept locked away to have sex with dozens of men a day
or are sold into domestic slavery. Sometimes, if these children escape
or are discovered, they are passed around the systems. They do not
speak much English and they have no knowledge of the support systems
that might help them. Many simply go

if they are found and receive support, it may be well meaning but
inappropriate. I remember one girl who was accommodated in a flat in a
suburb outside London with no friends. On Christmas Day, a social

isolation of such children can mean that they are at real risk of being
unprotected and retrafficked.</hs_para>

It may be the case that the people who trafficked the young person will

woman when she was about 17 and had been trafficked from a country in
Africa. Her English was poor and she was still traumatised. Two years
later she came to an event here in the Cholmondeley Room in the House

works of art and short speeches. The noble Lord, Lord McColl, attended

wish to pick up on what the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, said about
this being an issue of child protection, among other matters. As I said
earlier this week, very often when children go missing from local
authority care, the local authorities do not know that they are
trafficked children. Therefore, no one is identifying them and looking
for them with the special care that is required for this small group of
children. They are treated as ordinary missing children who will
probably come back. This is a very serious child protection
issue.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101675000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000097">The
other point made by the noble Lord, Lord McColl, is so important that I
shall repeat it. There is a real need for one constant person to take
an interest in the child, meet the child early on, offer a mobile phone
number, be at the end of a telephone and be able to answer the
questions that a child with very 
<?notus-xml column=238?>limited or no English will need to ask someone who can be there. One of
the sadnesses highlighted at the <I>Still at Risk</I> event that I was
glad to attend yesterday is that these children have multiple social
workers. We all know the underresourcing and overwork of social
workers, so can they give a special degree of care to a foreign
trafficked child who is not even under a care order? Consequently, they
have to cope with no one person in their life.</hs_para>

Lord McColl, is suggesting in this amendment is crucial. We are failing
a small number of grievously disadvantaged foreign children. We are
talking about hundreds, not thousands. There was a particularly
worrying case in Kent, where children who had been trafficked into Kent
were being trafficked out by the same traffickers. Fortunately, Kent
Police got hold of this, but if there had been a guardian, that
guardian would have kept in touch with the child, with any luck, and
would probably have been able to prevent it as they would be the one
person who would know where the child was and, in any event, would be
in touch with the suitable authorities to try to deal with
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000047">I have
been talking to Barnardo’s about whether it would be prepared to
offer some sort of service. The most important point that it makes is
that there has to be a sufficient legal status because the majority of
social services and, indeed, the NHS, talk about the confidentiality of
teenage children and so on, so they will not necessarily tell somebody
coming in what is going on. If the person has legal status, people have
to open their records. In the absence of that sufficient legal status,
a wonderful organisation, such as Barnardo’s, the NSPCC, the
Children’s Society and so on, would not be able to offer that
service, even if it were to be financially supported to do
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101675000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000048">The noble

working with these vulnerable young people. I am very taken with the
notion that there should be volunteer advocates working with them but
as a volunteer myself, who has had experience of both very poor support
and supervision and very good support and supervision, I suggest that
the regulations should be very clear about what sort of supervision,
training and support these advocates should receive. That is only fair
to volunteers and it will make them much more effective as advocates
and supporters of these young people. There is a great dearth of
resource in children’s services at the moment and the danger is,
if regulations are not clear about what the minimum requirements are,
there may be a drive to produce the lowest-cost and lowest-quality
advocates for these young people. I had only that comment to make. I

I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:29:14"></hs_TimeCode> am sorry to
delay proceedings further. I want to say a couple of sentences. First,
I thank the noble Lord, Lord McColl, for his perseverance on this issue
and the extremely powerful case that he has made this afternoon. This
idea of independent guardians is becoming an increasingly important
theme in our debates on this Bill and it is a model that is gaining
more and more credibility. My noble friend made reference to the
support of the Joint Committee on Human Rights for the concept and the
issue was also identified recently in a Commons Education Committee
report on child
protection.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000059">In
addition to the Scottish examples to which my noble friend has drawn
our attention, that report identified that this concept has also been
in operation in the Netherlands for some time, and there may well be
lessons that we could learn from
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:29:44"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:29:48"></hs_TimeCode>.<I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:29:44"></hs_TimeCode></I>
I do not want to rehearse all the arguments but there are very powerful
ones why we should consider these sorts of policies. First, it would
clearly help the children themselves. We have heard how that might
happen in terms of providing quality advice and guidance. Secondly, I
should like to think that such a measure would go some way to deterring
potential traffickers in the future if they felt that when they
trafficked children here, those children would have an alternative
authority figure with whom they could associate and be aligned. It
would be nice to think that the measure could deter traffickers
pursuing their dastardly policies in the future. Thirdly, surely this
is an area where early intervention and support could prevent children
being drawn into greater social and criminal problems in the longer
term. Therefore, there are all sorts of savings to be made if we
intervene earlier. I do not want to extend the debate. I again thank
the noble Lord and hope that he perseveres with this
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:30:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/6758A52A0143CA4BE4D2BF17A6DFE2D333ADC7E8" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 October 2013">Wednesday,

Northover (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, we share the concerns of my
noble friend Lord McColl for the victims of the terrible crime of child
trafficking. I pay tribute to his determined and enduring commitment to
these children. I am sorry if the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, and my noble friend Lord McColl feel that they are being
batted away in any sense; they are not and will not be. These debates
are extremely important in taking things
forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000061">At<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:31:33"></hs_TimeCode>
the previous session of this Committee, the failure of some local
authorities to fulfil their statutory duties towards these child
victims was discussed. We heard, as we have heard again today, some
heartrending accounts. I start by emphasising that these failures are
absolutely unacceptable. Local authorities should ensure that these
very vulnerable children receive the care and 
<?notus-xml column=241?>support that they so desperately need. In fulfilling those duties, a
looked-after child who has been trafficked should be allocated a social
worker by the local authority, as noble Lords have heard. The social
worker should be responsible for planning the care of the child,
ensuring that they are safely accommodated and that their welfare is
supported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000062">The
social worker should plan to ensure that all the needs of
the child are met. They should take particular account of the specific
needs of a trafficked child, including planning to prevent the child
going missing from care, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, said, providing safe and secure accommodation and
ensuring that the child understands any procedures in which they are
involved. Throughout this they should treat the child as a victim of
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:32:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000063" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000063">The
child should also be allocated an independent reviewing officer who
would, among many responsibilities, ensure that the child is aware of
the implications of their immigration and asylum status and that the
local authority considers these as part of its plan to meet the
child’s needs. Further, as noble Lords have said, the child
would have the right of access to an independent advocate responsible
for accurately representing the child’s wishes and feelings.
Advocates can support children on all issues, not just their care plan.
Social workers have a duty to tell all children about their right to an
advocate. Advocates can and do support children of all ages, even the
very young children to whom my noble friend referred. The
child’s needs and interests are best protected when these
professionals work well together and fulfil their statutory
responsibilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000064" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000064">Legal
status, perhaps unfortunately, is not the point. Local authorities have
a statutory duty to assess and meet the needs of trafficked children.
The issue is one of practice and, as my noble friend Lady Hamwee
pointed out, trying to ensure that what should happen legally actually
does
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000065" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000065">The
noble Baroness, Lady Lister, and others mentioned Scotland, and I
inquired as to whether this had solved the problem. I understand that
the pilot of guardians in Scotland has, thus far, had mixed results. I
can reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, that we are keeping in
touch with the Scottish Government to see what lessons we can learn
from them, but it seems again to come back to practice; even setting
the arrangements in place has not cracked it in
Scotland<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:35:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

friend Lord McColl does not accept this point but we continue to feel
that adding another person in the form of a child trafficking guardian
to those already working in the interests of the child could add
another layer of complexity. There could be a real danger of confusion
about the role of social workers, independent reviewing officers and
the new guardians. The current system is clear about who is responsible
for taking decisions about how best to support the young person.
However, we accept, as I said on Monday, that this is clearly not
working out in practice as it should do. Noble Lords will know that the
statutory framework includes specific duties to consider the particular
needs of the trafficked child and, for example, keeping the child safe
from their
traffickers<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:36:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Ofsted inspection report must say how local authorities are doing in
reducing the number of, and supporting, children who go missing. It is
therefore vital to focus on the reasons for the failure of some local

reference to the <I>Still at Risk </I>report. They may have noted that
several of its recommendations highlighted that all agencies need to

we have already put in place a major programme of reform to transform
the care system. We want to see stable and permanent placements,
high-quality education and health support, and better support for care
leavers as they transition to adulthood. We will ensure that, as we
implement these programmes, we will take account of the particular
needs of trafficked children. As I said on Monday, we have already
published revisions to the statutory guidance on missing children,
which strengthen advice on meeting the needs of child victims of
trafficking. However, I repeat that we recognise the strength of
feeling and the strong arguments around this issue. As I said on that

that the guardian would cut through those layers; my noble friend Lord
McColl put that case extremely cogently. I should like to reassure
noble Lords that we are seeking to tackle this problem as effectively
as possible. In some ways, it is perhaps slightly dispiriting to hear
that it has not been cracked by the Scottish model. It looks to me as
though we need to look further into why this is not working. That is
why it is important that we meet up for a discussion, and it is vital

of children in this group in the UK is unknown. The majority will have
arrived on visitor visas and will have overstayed. Most will be
attending school and will be registered with health services. The
adults caring for them have a duty to notify their local authority that
they are caring for the child but, as the child is a visa-overstayer,
no one does it. Given their other pressures, the majority of local
authorities do not proactively look for these children, and schools do
not check the visa status of children arriving mid-year or joining in

is that all carers claim to be an aunt or uncle. That is impossible to

their workload. We should keep in our hearts Victoria Climbié as

issue is fairly straightforward. These children are in the UK without
anyone who has legal parental responsibility. No one has overseen their
placements and no one has asked about the child’s wishes or
feelings. The real crunch comes when these children reach 18, having
been brought up here 
<?notus-xml column=244?>from childhood and English being their one language. They are probably
on their way to further education. One young person for whom I was
asked to advocate by Voice was in this exact position. Only when
preparing to go to college did he find out that he was facing the
alternative: deportation as an illegal immigrant. There is a range of
these children. It is in their best interests to know their immigration
status and to determine their future as soon as it is known, rather
than when they reach 18. The organisation Children and Families Across
Borders believes that the Home Office will accept this
amendment.</hs_para>

issues. We have spoken often about practice and its difficulties but in
this matter, while the border agency and the children’s services
are both governmental agencies and should be working together, the
organisation has found that there tends to be little if any exchange
between the two at either policy or working level. There seems to be no
sense of corporate responsibility within government for the children
who have reached British soil. The children’s services focus on
the children’s well-being and rarely take the step needed to
address durable, long-term solutions. They look at it in the narrow
context of pathway planning, which is good for other children who are
from this country.</hs_para>

valuable information about the child, which could contribute to a

given documents to officials to save time here; I am sure that your

remain indefinitely in the UK, followed by prompt child welfare
assessment and clarification of the child's immigration status. The
child could then continue in the private fostering situation with
proper security and, probably, without further intervention from social

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, here we are addressing another group
of potentially vulnerable children, as the noble Baroness, Lady
Howarth, pointed out. They are foreign-national children who are living
in this country while their parents reside elsewhere. We recognise that
the amendment seeks to improve safeguards for children privately
fostered from abroad. We sympathise with that
intention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000085">We
fully accept that local authorities should check on private fostering
arrangements when children are living apart from their close family,
and current legislation provides for this. We recognise that it is
sometimes difficult to establish if a family relationship is genuine,
as the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, made very clear, especially where
a carer is falsely claiming to be a close relative to avoid the
requirement to notify the local authority of a private fostering
arrangement. This raises a potential safeguarding issue.</hs_para>

convinced that the way forward is to apply the private fostering
arrangements to all foreign national children who live here without
their parents. This would extend the arrangements to a large number of
cases where children are safely looked after by close relatives.
However, we agree that this is an important issue, as children from
abroad are in a particularly vulnerable position. It remains crucial
that professionals who work with children from abroad, including border
staff, schools, health professionals, housing officers, et cetera, can
spot private fostering when they see it and notify the relevant local
authority.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000087">The
current private fostering guidance asks local authorities to undertake
awareness-raising activities with agencies, such as schools, to enable
professionals to encourage private foster carers and parents to notify
the local authority. Front-line professionals are also encouraged to
notify the local authority of a private fostering arrangement that
comes to their attention 
<?notus-xml column=246?>where they are not satisfied that the local authority has been, or will

also shortly be publishing revised guidance on safeguarding in schools.

addition, we have a project under way looking at the requirements on
local authorities and the role of other agencies and services with a
view to focusing efforts and strengthening the response to children
most at risk. We will be talking to relevant partners and agencies,
such as the Home Office, the British Association for Adoption and
Fostering, Children and Families Across Borders, Ofsted and local
authorities, to identify what targeted action might be taken to improve
practice in local areas. There are a number of issues that we are
looking at, and I am happy to share them with the noble
Baroness.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101675000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000090">An
important issue is whether it is better to resolve the immigration
status of children and return them to their home country as soon as
possible after their arrival in the UK, rather than leave it until they
reach the age of 18, by which time their ties with their home country
have been greatly reduced. The current practice is to consider the
needs of each child on a case-by-case basis and carry out an assessment
of what is in the child’s best interests. The child and their
social worker have a central role in this assessment, and contributions
are usually also sought from other relevant agencies.</hs_para>

with the argument about early return but, referring to other debates we
have had, we need to be aware that many of these children may be
vulnerable and have arrived in the United Kingdom having suffered very
difficult and sometimes traumatic experiences. It is often the case
that their parents cannot be traced or that the reception arrangements
in the country to which they would be returning might be inadequate.
This has meant that in practice, with the exception of transfers to
other European Union countries, the UK rarely enforces the return of
unaccompanied children to any country. The important issue is to try to
work out what is in the best interests of the
child.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101675000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101675000092">I would

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the
noble Baroness’s full reply. The only point that I would pick up
is that sometimes social workers will decide to allow children to
remain indefinitely without taking action, simply because the social
worker is anxious that if they do anything the child will immediately
be deported. It is that working together between all the agencies and
organisations, including education and the Home Office, and making sure
that 
<?notus-xml column=247?>the child’s welfare is at the centre of any decision, that needs
to be taken forward. Otherwise, people make decisions that they think
are in the best interests of the child but, in the long term, turn out
to be disastrous for their growth. I beg leave to withdraw the

family and friends carers many times before. Some colleagues may
remember the discussions, which have notably taken place in Bills
concerned with welfare. Ministers from both sides of the House have
been sympathetic, and some adjustments 
<?notus-xml column=249?>to the situation have been made, but not enough. I used to meet kinship
carers regularly when I chaired the National Treatment Agency for
Substance Misuse, because many of the carers looked after children of a
relative who had a drug or alcohol problem. I became aware of what a
brilliant job these carers do, often without or with very little
support, and often to the detriment of their own physical, emotional
and mental health, particularly if they are older carers such as
grandparents. Kinship carers take over the care of young relatives
because they want the best for them, often in an emergency, such as the
sudden death of a child’s parent. I remember a grandmother in a
London borough whose daughter died suddenly late at night, and who took
over caring for three children aged between one and 10 in a one-bedroom
flat. “You know what they call us?”, she said,
“The midnight
grannies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:58:16"></hs_TimeCode>”.</hs_para>

underline what I have to say. One is that the outcomes for children who
are looked after by a relative are better than those for children
looked after outside the family. Secondly, such care saves an enormous
amount of money. The cost of a place in independent foster care is
£40,000, and the average cost to the state of care proceedings
is more than £25,000. However, research indicates that most
family and friends care arrangements—86%—are initiated by
carers themselves, rather than social workers seeking them
out<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T16:58:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

children are being raised by relatives and friends. Only an estimated
6% of children who are raised in family and friends care are looked
after by the local authority and placed with approved foster carers. By
far the majority live with their relatives and friends outside this
care system, either with the parents’ agreement, or under a
residence order or special guardianship order granted by the courts.
Despite the lack of support, children in the care of family and friends
do better in terms of attachment. They have a sense of belonging, a
sense of safety and the confidence that they will not be moved about.
This results in better educational outcomes and fewer behavioural
problems. There is a greater likelihood of an ethnic match—88%

care may well be the best thing for children where possible and it
is<I> </I>consistent with their rights under the European convention to
support family life. It is also an increasingly practical option for
children unable to live with their parents, given the record numbers of
children-in-care proceedings and the severe shortage of unrelated
foster carers, which result in many children in care experiencing
temporary placements, being split up from siblings and having to move
from their school and family networks. Yet many kinship carers are
under severe strain. In a recent survey, 95% said that they experienced
at least one unmet need for support and most mentioned several. More
worryingly, carers who were raising the most difficult children were
receiving no support at
all.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101681000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101681000007">According
to the experience of the Kinship Care Alliance in advising thousands of
families and friend carers every year, this lack of support is due to
three major factors. First, they are not entitled to local 
<?notus-xml column=250?>authority financial or other support for these children—for
example, help with contact arrangements, bereavement counselling or
challenging behaviour. If a child is looked after by a local authority,
the carer must be approved as a foster carer and they are entitled to a
fostering allowance. However, 94% of kinship carers are not in that
category. If a child is not looked after by a local authority, then
financial support is discretionary. Yet carers often face enormous
costs—for example, the need to give up a job, to adjust their
homes, to buy extra equipment and clothing for the children, as well as
possibly some childcare. I have also heard of cases where kinship
carers have had to pay enormous sums of money in legal bills to secure
the child’s future with them. Although there is a duty on local
authorities to establish a special guardianship support service,
similar to adoption support, this does not give an individual carer the
right to a specific service. Moreover, there is no equivalent support
service for children in kinship care under a residence order or no

Massey of Darwen</B><B>:</B></Member> It was quite a welcome break in
this long speech. I am moving Amendment 44 and speaking to Amendment
45. They support financial and other support to family and friends
carers. I was summarising briefly the benefits to children of such care
and the hardships suffered by family and friends carers. Although there
is a duty on local authorities to establish a special guardianship
support service, similar to adoption support, this does not give an
individual carer the right to a specific service. Moreover, there is no
equivalent support service for children in kinship care under a
residence order or no order. A survey of family and friends carers
shows that those with special guardianship orders are the most
satisfied with the legal order compared to those who do not have such
orders.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101681000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101681000011">Secondly
in the list I started earlier, despite the Government’s 2011
guidance on family and friends care, most local authorities are not
proactive in supporting family and friends care. There is no dedicated
family and friends care team, for example, in most local authorities.
This means that the carers and children are dealt with—here we
go again—by different teams in children’s services, who
may not have specific
expertise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:14:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101681000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101681000012">The
third factor is that there are no official statistics published on the
number of children in family and friends care either nationally or
locally. One analysis 
<?notus-xml column=251?>by the University of Bristol excludes friends care, for example. Local
authorities do not routinely collect such data so it is difficult to
see how they can design and finance such services. The 2011 guidance is
clear: it requires all English local authorities to have a family and
friends care policy stating what support they would provide by
September 2011. Sadly, much later after that deadline, more than 30% of
local authorities still have not published a family and friends care
policy. The guidance does not change the legal position but while local
authorities have to provide support for looked-after children placed
with family and friends carers, which is 6% of children, they do not
have to provide support for the 94% of children in family and friends
care who are classified as not looked
after<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:16:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

climate of financial restrictions, local authorities are seeking to
reduce service provision and that non-statutory services are being cut.
My Amendment 44, which mirrors the special guardianship support service
required, seeks to redress the shortcoming by requiring local
authorities to provide support to meet the identified needs of children
being raised by family or friends under a private arrangement or
residence order<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:16:31"></hs_TimeCode>.

children who would otherwise be in the care system because they are at
risk or their parents are incapacitated, dead or in
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:16:48"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
the Minister will be able to address these concerns and meet with the

45 seeks to insert a new Section 77A into the Social Security
Contributions and Benefits Act 1992. It aims to ensure that family and
friends carers receive a basic financial allowance from central
government to support them in raising a child who cannot remain with
their parents and would otherwise be in the care system. Support would
be restricted to cases of children whose parents are incapacitated,
dead or in
prison<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:17:29"></hs_TimeCode>. The
amendment would provide the mechanism for local authorities to provide
discretionary support to meet more effectively the assessed needs of
children in family and friends care under residence orders or where
there is no order at all. However, this does not address the additional
costs to family and friends carers of raising a child who is not their
own<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:17:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101681000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101681000015">Of
course, the legal liability for maintaining children lies with the
parents at all times, even if their children are cared for by someone
else. At no point does legal liability transfer to family and friends
carers, except on adoption, but these carers often have existing
financial responsibilities—for example, caring for an elderly
relative or their own existing
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:18:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

child benefit, although there are sometimes problems in transferring
this from the parents to the carer. They may apply for tax credits
according to their means, and an allowance for the child where they are
in receipt of income support. However, there is no recognition in the
benefits system of the additional costs of raising a child who is not
their own. Caring for a child, according to the Fostering Network, is
calculated to be 50% higher than the cost of caring for a birth child.
This is partly due to emotional distress in the children, maintaining
contact with parents and other family members and engaging 
<?notus-xml column=252?>with social workers and health and education staff. This is why foster
carers receive specific allowances from local authorities, paid at
substantially higher rates than state benefits and tax
credits<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:19:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101681000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101681000017">Briefly,
there are four key financial issues for family and friends carers in
raising a child outside the looked-after system. First, there is the
immediate cost of a child coming to live with a carer, often, as I said
earlier, in an unplanned or emergency situation. Secondly, there are
the costs of applying for a legal order to provide the child with
security and permanence. Thirdly, there is the lost income resulting
from the carer reducing their working hours, leaving paid work,
forgoing career opportunities or losing pension rights. Finally, there
are the actual costs of raising a child, which may include a larger
home, higher utility bills and so
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101681000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101681000018">When
special guardianship legislation was passed, it was envisaged that many
foster carers would apply for special guardianship orders for older
children in their care. There have been cases of successful orders in
such situations but many foster carers are reluctant to apply for such
orders because they fear that the financial support received would be
inadequate, as compared to the mandatory support they and the child
would receive as foster carers. It is likely that more foster carers
would apply for special guardianship orders if they could be guaranteed
continued financial support. The regulations should be amended
accordingly. I hope that these two amendments will be favourably
received by the Government, so that family and friends carers get a
much better

and I have a particular example of a friend of mine, who took over the
care of her goddaughter at very short notice. She would otherwise have
gone into care. The social workers encouraged my friend to keep the
child and to take a residence order. Eventually she got a special
guardianship order, which she has at the moment, but once she got the
residence order she discovered that the social workers were basically
saying, “That’s fine; now we don’t have to pay
you, which is a very good reason why we didn’t want you to be a
foster mother”. This is not as it should be.</hs_para>

unusual for this to happen. Family and friends who are carers are quite
often treated this way. Because they are prepared to care for one of
their own family or somebody close to them, it does not become the
requirement of the local authority to give them any support. I battled
for this friend of mine to have some support and they gave her a small
amount as a sort of honorarium. It really was very small indeed. It
happens that some quite young grandparents or other carers, having
achieved a good position in a job and a comfortable lifestyle, suddenly
find themselves, after a daughter or daughter-in-law dies, taking over
the care of a child or children at short notice. Their standard of
living drops dramatically, often because they can no longer keep their
job. They are therefore losing their comfortable lifestyle. Not only do
they have an extremely exhausting time caring for their grandchildren,
who of course they love dearly. It is also very trying because

Drake (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I support my noble friend Lady
Massey’s amendments because it is worth restating that we are
addressing here a community of an estimated 300,000 children. It is not
a minor group of children; this is a major group for whom friend and
family carers are caring. They are being raised by these carers, in
many instances as an alternative to being in the care system. In most
instances, that produces better outcomes for these children than
entering the care system and with huge savings to the state. Yet many
of them get too little help and too little support. Therefore, on the
one hand as a society we depend on them to protect many children, but
we reciprocate with such limited
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:24:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

minority of kinship carers receive financial or practical support from
their local authority. Only the foster carers—about 5% of all
kinship carers—are entitled to financial support, as my noble
friend said. For other carers, the support is discretionary. Yet
kinship and family and friends care is the most common form of
permanency for children who cannot live with their birth families.
Research from Joan Hunt at the University of Oxford shows that there is
no relationship between a child’s needs and whether they receive
support from the local authority, and that those with the highest needs
may in fact be less likely to get any help. This disparity between
those needing support and those getting support is reinforced by
research findings, which suggest that most family and friends care
arrangements—86%—are initiated by the carers themselves
rather than the social workers, so giving rise to some of the
situations that the noble and learned Baroness referred to a moment
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:26:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

sense at all that such vulnerable children and their carers should face
such a lottery when it comes to support. Kinship carers have done the
right thing by taking in a child who cannot live at home but then they
are often left to struggle alone. However, the children for whom they
care have similar  
<?notus-xml column=254?>high needs to those of the children looked after by the local authority.
As a survey conducted by Grandparents Plus found, 45% of kinship carers
were looking after children who had experienced abuse or neglect, 44%
cared for children who had experienced parental drug or alcohol misuse,
22% were in kinship care because of parental illness, mental illness or
disability, and 21% because of domestic violence. Therefore, despite
the importance of these placements and the experience of the children,

the existing statutory guidance on providing support for carers, to

provide support for looked-after children, they do not have to support
the remaining vast majority of children in family and friends care who
are not looked after. These amendments would begin to address that
failure by putting the onus on local authorities to provide support to
meet the identified needs of children who cannot live with their

that many of these grandparents and kinship carers are living in
poverty or on low incomes. Analysis of census micro-data from 2001

found that many informal kinship carers lived in grinding poverty,
which wore them down and reduced their quality of life. Yet, this was
often a consequence of caring for the kinship children—many had
given up good jobs to take the children … or in the case of

Fostering Network found that extra costs are rooted partly in the
emotional distress the children have experienced, the challenging
behaviour, maintaining contact with family members and engaging with
social workers, health and education staff. Those costs are faced by
family and friendship carers too, but an overwhelming
majority—94%—of family and friend carers are not in the
category entitled to financial support. For them it is discretionary,
at a time when most local authorities are reducing service provision.
Carers are entitled to apply for child benefit and tax credits and for
an allowance for the child if they are in receipt of income support,
but I stress again the point made by my noble friend that there is no
recognition in the benefits system of the additional costs of raising 
<?notus-xml column=255?>a child who is not your own. Such carers may well be impacted by the
benefit cap. Many will have lost their jobs, an issue that we shall

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> I rise briefly to support these
amendments and to make three points. First, above all, children who
have experienced trauma—indeed, all children—need parents
who stick with them through their lives. Children who have experienced
abuse over periods of time need carers who stick with them over the
years and who are reliable and
consistent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000013">Last
night, I was at a meeting and met psychiatrists from all over the world
who have just published a book on the mental health of looked-after
children. The final point in the editor’s chapter in the book
was that he encouraged all clinicians always to remember that the most
important thing to help these children recover from past trauma is to
enable them to have relationships with people who care about them and
stick with them. Family relationships—long-term committed
relationships—are what they need. If they cannot find that at
that particular time in their lives then, as a clinician, you need to
equip them to be able to make and keep those kinds of relationships. It
seems to me that that is much more likely to happen in these kinship
care models than in foster care, although it often happens there
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000014">Secondly,
good social care interventions can make a difference. The most popular
intervention that foster carers talk to me about is support to
understand how they manage the behaviour of their young people. All
young people can, at different times in their lives, be difficult to
manage, but young people who have been traumatised, abused or neglected
will often display very difficult behaviours. In fact, in 2004 a report
from the Office for National Statistics on the mental health of
looked-after children highlighted that those in foster care had, I
think, a 40% rate of mental disorder compared with, I think, a 5% rate
in the general population. The rate for those in residential care was
70% or so. A very high percentage of those mental disorders are conduct
disorders, things such as troubling behaviours from young people.
Carers need support to understand and manage those behaviours, and they
tell me they really appreciate it.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101686000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000015">They also need to be
connected with other carers with the same experience. When foster
carers are helped to connect regularly with other foster carers in the
same position and the same job, they value being part of a community of
carers and being able to share experience and learn from it.</hs_para>

opportunity to highlight the letter sent to me by the noble Lord, Lord
Nash, regarding the recruitment and retention of child and 
<?notus-xml column=256?>family social workers. It is key to this area, to trafficked children
and to children returning from care. In this brief debate, we have
heard examples of poor and variable practice in child and family social
work. I know that several noble Lords trained and practised as social
workers. It is enormously encouraging that, in recent years, in the
previous Government and in this Government, there has been a real
commitment to raising the professional status of child and family
social work—to raising entry requirements and training
standards. In his letter, among several other things, the Minister drew
my attention to a review by Sir Martin Narey commissioned by the
Government into the initial training of social workers, which is being
published in January, and to new data-collecting on social workers on
the front line in local authorities, so that we will have a better
understanding of how well we are retaining the new social workers that
we are recruiting. I draw that to your Lordships’ attention
because I think it is
important.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000017" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000017">I
also want to commend the Government for taking this consistent stance
towards social work, which in the past has been far too neglected. One
of the key ingredients for getting better outcomes for children,
whether they are in kinship, foster or other settings, is to get
support from the right professionals, and I hope we are moving in that
direction now. I strongly support these

Ponsonby of Shulbrede (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I wanted to speak
briefly in support of these amendments. My noble friend Lady Massey has
set out the framework and how important it is statistically, but I was
sitting as a family magistrate only last week and I thought it might be
interesting for the Committee to hear the decisions that we were
invited to make as a court. The scenario was of a two year-old boy in a
successful fostering arrangement. His uncle had come forward with his
wife. They already had three children and they were willing to take on
the boy. That would put them in the situation of having four children
under the age of six in a two-bedroom flat in London. All parties
supported the arrangement that was to be made by the court and the
decisions that we were invited to make as a court were to finalise the
financial arrangements between the local authority and the carers.
There was a bit of brokering and toing and froing on what those
payments were to be. As far as I know, they were discretionary but
nevertheless they were offered. As I say, it was a bit of a haggle but
a figure was agreed for the kinship arrangements to go
ahead.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000019">The
second decision we were asked to make was whether to put in place a
special guardianship order. This was opposed by the local authority but
we decided to put it in place in any case, very much for the reasons
that my noble friend has said. We believed that it would help the
carers to have the support of the local authority for the first 12
months. That was no reflection on their ability to be good
parents—in fact, we were sure they would be—but we wanted
to help them. So we went against the local authority’s wishes on
that particular decision. The other decision we made was to put in
place the contact arrangements for the mother. The mother was a
recovering drug addict. She was in 
<?notus-xml column=257?>court and we wished her well. We arranged that she would have contact on
a yearly basis and that can be reviewed in due
course.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000020">Another
issue that we were invited to address was the housing arrangements of
this family. As I said, they would have four children in a two-bedroom
flat. There was really very little we could do about that other than
include a sympathetic paragraph in the judgment, urging local
authorities to review their situation sympathetically. Realistically,
they were looking at a two or three-year wait for a transfer.
Nevertheless, that was something we put in the judgment. The final
thing we put in, which we thought about very carefully, were the
transfer arrangements. As I said, this particular little boy had been
in a successful fostering arrangement where he had blossomed for two
years and now he was moving to another arrangement. Obviously, however
well-meaning everyone was, it would be a difficult transition
arrangement for the
boy.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000021">The
point that I wanted to make is that all the parties supported this. The
local authorities put extra money in and the mother agreed to the
arrangement, even though she was losing her boy and the kinship carers
would have to take the child on. This is a good solution for all
concerned, and if it can be put on a more statutorily substantial
footing, I think that that will be to the benefit of all
concerned<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T17:40:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/14756D20B09E928574EF10DF41108164A9AE0CC5" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 October 2013">Wednesday,

say at once that I am entirely supportive of the Government’s
approach in trying to get parents to agree on their children and to get
those who have had failed relationships to agree on how to dispose of
any cases they may wish to bring. The problem is the
word  
<?notus-xml column=260?>“mediation”. I have heard from various sources,
particularly from lawyers, and one has to bear in mind that there is no
longer legal aid in private law cases. Therefore, both parties will be
litigants in person and one quite simply has to recognise that we are
talking about people who have parted, some of them in extreme acrimony,
and all with the real trauma of a failed relationship. They would not
be in the family court if there were no failed relationship.</hs_para>

of them, I think the majority, are very sensible about making the
arrangements that have to be made after their relationship is over, but
there are some who need some help and they will not get it from lawyers
any more. There is also a small minority, perhaps no more than 5 %, who
absolutely cannot agree on anything and take their failed relationship,
covered in acrimony and hate for each other, into the arena of the
family dispute in the family court. They fight over the house, they
fight particularly over the children and they use the arena of the
children to fight through their failed relationship. Sitting as a
judge, as I did in this area for 35 years, I can tell you how many
acrimonious failed relationships came through my hands.</hs_para>

minority of people who are brought to a meeting, which is a requirement
before you go to court, mediation is like a red rag to a bull. They
absolutely will not accept it, but they will have to accept an
information and assessment meeting, which is thoroughly sensible. The
word “mediation” may well mean that a number of people
will refuse to go to the meeting. They are not going to meet the other

these issues were debated in the Commons, the Minister stated that the
Government had invited the Family Procedure Rule Committee to draw up
rules specifying areas where exemptions to the proposed procedure would
be appropriate, including domestic violence. The Minister also
identified at that time other areas where exemptions might be relevant.
These included: a need for urgency; where there is a risk to the life,
liberty or physical safety of the applicant or their family; when any
delay would cause a risk or significant harm to a child; or where a
miscarriage of justice might occur. At the time, we welcomed this
commitment. However, we requested that the draft rules be made
available to Parliament before scrutiny of the Bill is over. We have
now received the letter and its attachments from the noble Lord, Lord
McNally, which again states that the Family Procedure Rule Committee
will be invited to make rules on these matters. Given that we still
have not seen the rules, we ask the Minister again: when will these be
made available? How can we be expected to judge whether this provision
is sufficient to address our concerns in their absence?</hs_para>

amendments in this group would insert a definition of an
“approved mediator” as someone who satisfies defined
training and quality standards assurances and would specify that a
mediation, information and assessment meeting would always be held with
an approved mediator. These amendments originate from concerns
expressed to the Justice Committee in pre-legislative scrutiny that the
quality of mediators is often far too low. They tie in with the
concerns we have just touched upon: that mediators might have to screen
for domestic abuse and safeguarding concerns, which require specialist
skills. For example, the Children’s Commissioner for England has
highlighted research showing that around 50% of all private law cases
involve domestic violence or child abuse. For this reason, it is
crucial that mediators are trained and skilled in spotting these
issues. It is also important that mediators are trained to listen to
and draw out the voices of the children and young people
involved.</hs_para>

in the Commons, the Minister said that he had asked the president of
the Family Division to revise the existing pre-application protocol to
make it explicit that family mediators must be approved by the Family
Mediation Council. He said that meant that they would also have to
adhere to the code of practice of that council. However, we do not
believe that the provision in the code of practice is strong enough. We
emphasise again that concerns have been raised about the quality of
mediators, even working under this code. We would prefer that
safeguards be set out in the Bill.</hs_para>

Wigley:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments
50 and 52, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes of Stretford,
which would ensure that any mediator who is to deal with family
disputes through a family mediation, information and assessment
meeting—known somewhat inelegantly as MIAMs—would have to
be approved and would need to have undergone relevant training and
quality assurance. I also signal my support for Amendments 46 to 49 and
Amendment 51, as tabled by the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, which would remove the introduction of compulsory
mediation.</hs_para>

attendance at a MIAM is voluntary. Solicitors make a referral to a
mediator, allowing clients to receive legal advice prior to the
mediation process. Since April 2011, parties have been required to send
an FM1 form to the court alongside court applications to show that they
have considered or attempted mediation. I should also point out that
there is currently no regulation of mediators and that many have no
formal training, although of course many are also qualified
solicitors<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:00:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

attendance at MIAMs will be made compulsory. There is great concern
that this may be used to further domestic abuse in certain cases. Since
MIAMs will be compulsory, mediators will be given the task of screening
for domestic abuse and children’s safeguarding issues, yet
without training there can be no knowing whether the skills these
mediators possess will be appropriate or adequate to undertake such
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:00:14"></hs_TimeCode>. Legal aid
will still be available for mediation but since legal aid has been
withdrawn for private family law cases, except those involving recent
domestic abuse, parties will be entering into the mediation without
having received prior legal advice. That puts children and abused
adults in a particularly vulnerable
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:00:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000054">Finally,
since the majority of parents settle contact arrangements between
themselves, the cases which go through to the courts process are by
necessity the most complex and the most likely to involve abuse.
Forcing parties through mediation in these circumstances would be
highly damaging and potentially dangerous. At the very least,
accreditation of mediators should be made compulsory. I urge
the Minister to accept these

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> My Lords, my name is attached to a

came across in eight years’ involvement in CAFCASS and many
years before that as a social worker. I hope that the Government will
look at these issues between now and Report. I would like mediation to
be replaced by meetings where information is given. At these meetings,
people can find out what they should be doing next; they are

that they will not intervene to give direct information and advice,
certainly not as regards helping parties to think directly about the
implications of their behaviour. Mediation is often about sitting back
and thinking things through. When you are using the court arena simply
to fight your battles, as the noble and learned Baroness, Lady
Butler-Sloss, so eloquently described, that type of mediation is
totally unhelpful. I have been allowed to sit in and watch CAFCASS
officers intervene on parties in an extremely direct way. That has had
much more impact than the kind of therapeutic situation which is often
delivered through the mediation association—I chaired a
government working party on this many years ago—in which people,

important that we have recognised mediators but I hope that mediation

although it could have been another—I have been here too long. A
number of people from mediation groups came to talk about how they
could not direct, or be directed themselves, in their work with
families. These families often need a much more behavioural approach,
rather than a reflective one. We need to think through some of these
issues before we come to a conclusion. However, I stand by my name

amendments tabled by the noble Baronesses, Lady Hughes and Lady Jones,
I recognise the concerns about safeguarding access to the courts. The
Government do not intend that vulnerable parties should be put at risk
or be prevented accessing the court. However, involving the court in
every case at the stage before proceedings have started to determine
whether it is reasonable for an applicant to attend a MIAM would be
unworkable. It would impact on the courts and cause delay, particularly
in public law care and supervision cases, and would undermine our
efforts to ensure that court involvement is avoided wherever
appropriate and safe in private family disputes. We agree that the
requirement to attend a MIAM should not apply in circumstances where it
is appropriate or necessary for a court to make decisions. That
includes where there is evidence of domestic violence, child protection
concerns or other reasonable grounds for exemption such as urgency or
the significant risk of a miscarriage of justice.</hs_para>

protocol in operation since April 2011 already places an expectation on
a prospective applicant in relevant family proceedings first to attend
a MIAM, but allows for exemptions in the circumstances I just
mentioned. A family mediator may also determine, on the basis of their
professional judgment, that the nature of the case makes it unsuitable
for a MIAM. A mediator might make such a determination on the basis of
a telephone discussion with the prospective parties. The current
exemptions already reflect our position that adequate safeguards should
be in place, and we intend to invite the rule committee broadly to
replicate these in making rules under this clause.</hs_para>

are already required by the Family Mediation Council, or FMC, to meet
minimum standards and other detailed requirements, and only certified
mediators can conduct

(2)(b), which makes specific reference to those requirements. The rule

the committee makes these rules about statutory MIAMs.</hs_para>

my limited knowledge, I know of the confusion that there is between
mediation and marriage guidance counselling. People who have long
decided to get out of a marriage do not want to be guided; they want to
be helped through what is a traumatic period. However, I hope that we
have this right. The accreditation of mediators is safeguarded. We do
not believe that the Government are best placed to undertake a

was about to prompt withdrawal of the amendment by the noble and

my eloquence. What I was saying when the bell went is that the term
“mediation” in the title helps people to know what the
purpose is and encourages them to be brought into it. The debate has
been interesting. There are those who are arguing that it will frighten
people away. We have commissioned some research and perhaps we should
await that research and then return to this debate. When the noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, has seen the research she will
say, “Oh, my goodness, I was wrong. The noble Lord, Lord
McNally, was right all along”. Mind you, we are paying for the

conveys a range of different concepts, even within the professional

we should not indicate what is going to happen in the

noble Lord knows that it is the practice in the Moses Room to withdraw

like to make one or two points. I am extremely indebted to the noble
Viscount, Lord Eccles, for making the point that the title should be
neutral. That was what I was searching for, although I did not use that
word. The neutral title could be “family information
meetings” or, as has been sensibly suggested by the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, “family meetings”. Family
information meetings might be slightly better as people would know that
that was what they were going to

am entirely supportive of mediation in the right cases, and in all but
5% of cases it will be right, if they ever go to court at all, which
most of them do not. Where neither party is legally aided, they will
both battle through the real difficulties of making their applications
and so on in the county court or magistrates’ court and try to
cope with something which is completely unfamiliar to them. Therefore,
the information meeting, and a requirement to have one, seem to me
entirely
admirable<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:32:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000079">The
only problem is that there are in a sense two stages to this because
mediation is different from information and assessment. It imposes upon
people a requirement to try to settle. You cannot have compulsory
mediation. You can have compulsory information and assessment, but you
cannot require people to settle. That is something I was taught as a
young barrister and I have learnt all the way through my legal and
judicial career that people cannot be made to settle. The purpose of
mediation is to get them to settle or to try to tackle the issue in a
better way, but that could be achieved through the provision of
information and an assessment. One has to understand that mediation is
in a different class from information and
assessment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T18:34:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point as a possibility for the Family Procedure Rule Committee and the
Minister’s experts to look at. I am not suggesting that this is
necessarily a good idea but I throw it out for consideration. I would
be content if the forms that the parties receive put the words
“information”, “assessment” and
“mediation” in brackets. Parties could cross out the word
“mediation” to show that they are prepared to opt for
information and assessment but are not prepared to go through a process
of trying to make them settle. That might just do the trick if you want
to keep the word “mediation”.</hs_para>

I am very concerned about the small number of people who are most
likely to go to court. You do not go to court if you can reach
agreement. Some 90% do not go to court or go to court only to obtain an
agreed order, 5% can be persuaded to go through mediation, and probably
mediation is just what they need, but 5% cannot. What could happen if
there is a requirement for mediation is that particularly the man,
although sometimes the woman, will get to the meeting with the trained
mediator and the minute the mediator starts to say, “Well, could
you not agree to this?”, he will storm out and not listen to
what he needs to understand as to how the court proceedings will go.
That is my real worry. However, for the moment, I beg leave to withdraw

11 would require a court, in considering arrangements to promote a
child’s future, to presume, unless there are reasons to the
contrary, that continued involvement of each parent would be conducive
to the child’s welfare. I move Amendments 53 and 55 as much to
probe the complex issues inherent in this matter as to propose a
definitive solution. Indeed, it is not clear yet whether the
Government’s proposal or any of the amendments before us today
are the best route to achieving the policy objective of meaningful,
continuing contact between children and both parents when the parents
break up. I hope that this debate will clarify those issues so we can
move to a sensible position that maximises the chances of achieving
that policy objective, with which I wholly concur, while minimising the
possibility of unintended, negative consequences for the children. Much
of the debate 
<?notus-xml column=269?>outside this place has turned on the nuances of different legal
interpretations of the impact of Clause 11 on the current overriding
requirement in Section 1 of the Children Act that

Government are right to try to do
so.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101686000084" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000084">We do
not yet have a society in which mothers and fathers are accorded equal
status as parents. Certainly by much of our public policy, public
services and professional practice, whether health, education, social
care, policing or the family courts, the default position is very often
that parent equals mother. Often this disadvantages mothers because
they are held more to account for children’s well-being. They
are blamed more when things go wrong and the kids go off the rails and
fathers are often let off the hook by professionals and organisations.
In other instances, however, this default position can work against
fathers who can struggle to get recognition from professionals. When
parents separate, if the father becomes the non-resident parent, as is
often the case, they are often not supported adequately by the courts
or professionals to maintain contact with their children. So I start
from the position of sharing the Government’s desire to put in
public policy the principle of shared parental responsibility and
involvement in a child’s life. Indeed, I would argue—I am
sure all of us would argue—that for most children the paramount
principle of the child’s welfare enshrined in the Children Act
cannot be fully met unless both parents are fully involved in a
child’s life and have a continuing relationship with the child,
so it may be that there is a need to strengthen the principle of
parental
involvement.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000085">I
was a Member of Parliament for 13 years and during that time I had many
cases in which fathers—and they were all fathers—had
become excluded from their children’s lives, either because of
the minimal contact arrangements decreed by the court in the first
place or by the failure of the court to enforce the contact
arrangements that had originally been made. Noble Lords may be aware of
the recent decision in June this year by the Court of Appeal. Their
exceptional but very welcome decision to publish their judgment and
findings on one such case—Re A—has revealed the extent to
which the system is sometimes failing to enable children to maintain
relationships with non-resident parents, usually, but not always, the
father. In this case, the father fought for more than 10 years, the
family courts made 82 orders, but in the end a senior family court
judge decided the impasse should be resolved by banning the father from
further attempts to see his child. The Court of Appeal ruled that

but not all, of the system a culture that does not always regard the
non-resident parent as equally important either in initial decisions or
in enforcement. When that happens, as the cases I had as an MP showed,
it often means that children lose contact not only with their fathers
but with their paternal grandparents and their entire paternal
family.</hs_para>

view that the change in the law proposed by Clause 11, which introduces
a presumption of parental involvement, would dilute the paramountcy
principle of the welfare of the child in Section 1 of the Children Act.
I have seen the Minister’s note which contends that the
paramountcy principle is not a rebuttable presumption and therefore
cannot be in conflict with the presumption in Clause 11 which is
rebuttable if it needs to be on the grounds of the child’s
welfare. The Minister’s view is that there is no potential
conflict for the courts in juxtaposing the paramountcy principle, which
is the overriding one, and the presumption in Clause 11. I am sure we
will hear many views on that during the course of this debate, and I
look forward to hearing them because this is a complex issue and we
need to think about it very
carefully.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000088">Another
argument raised against Clause 11 is that it is unnecessary, as only
around 10% of cases are currently decided in courts and in 2010, for
example, only 0.3% of the large number of applications for contact was
refused. However, that is to assume that in all other cases contact
arrangements are satisfactory, whereas many non-resident parents feel
that they are forced—advised, in fact—to accept
arrangements for quite low levels of contact between them and their
children because that is the cultural norm set by the courts in these
contested cases.</hs_para>

paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and that this
principle should not be jeopardised or diluted. However, we argue that
the welfare of most children depends on substantial contact with both
parents and the shared involvement of each parent, resident and
non-resident, in the child’s life, unless there are reasons to
the contrary and subject to the detail of arrangements which give the
child as stable and enriched an experience as possible. With the focus
on the child, any arbitrary splitting of the child’s time on a
50/50 or other basis would not be acceptable because this is about the
child’s rights, not the parents’ rights. Equally, it is
not acceptable for a parent to use the child to score points or vent
frustration with an ex-partner by opposing or frustrating contact and
involvement. Amendment 55 therefore clarifies that parental involvement
does not and should not equate to shared parenting or shared time and
that the involvement must promote the welfare of the child.</hs_para>

11 raises a technical legal point of considerable importance. It will
affect the way in which all family judges and family magistrates try
private law cases where the arrangements in relation to children have
to be decided by the court. The noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, would be
affected by it sitting in the family proceedings court. I have
discussed this clause with some members of the judiciary, who view it
with some
concern.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000094">I
start with a problem. If the clause becomes law, it will raise two
potentially conflicting presumptions for the court to tackle. I regret
to say, with the greatest respect, that the Minister will be wrong if
he says what the noble Baroness said was in his brief. Under Clause 11
the court, in the various circumstances, is to presume, unless the
contrary is shown, that the involvement of each parent in the life of
the child concerned will further the child’s welfare. That is a
presumption. However, the whole basis of family child law is the
presumption of the paramountcy of the welfare of the child, which is in
Section 1(1) of the Children Act 1989.</hs_para>

effect of Clause 11 is to bring in a second presumption. You cannot
help it because you are presuming in Clause 11 and you are presuming in
Section 1 of the Children Act. Those two presumptions potentially
clash. Quite simply, a court can have only one presumption at a
time.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101686000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000096">This is
not just me making a legalistic technical point. People might be
forgiven for thinking that I am going back to my judicial days, but I
promise that this is far broader than a legalistic point. The NSPCC and
Coram are very concerned, and I am happy to adopt the points that they
make. They make three very important points: this clause could lead to
a shift in emphasis away from what is best for the child towards the
feelings and desires of parents; it could inadvertently increase risk
to children by putting pressure on parents to agree to contact
arrangements that are unsuitable  
<?notus-xml column=272?>or dangerous in the erroneous belief that a court would order that kind
of contact; and the proposed change is unnecessary because no evidence
of a bias in the court system has been
found.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000097">It is
not good enough to have two presumptions that the judge has to juggle
which could clash. It is particularly difficult for family magistrates
who are not lawyers. It is also important to bear in mind that the
litigants in the cases to which this clause applies will be
unrepresented in the absence of legal aid. As to the increased risk of
harm to which the NSPCC and Coram refer, these unrepresented litigants
have gone through the traumatic experience of a failed relationship. As
I said earlier, 90% will not go to court, or only for an agreed order,
5% can be persuaded by the family information and assessment meeting
and the remaining hardcore 5% will be extremely antagonistic towards
each other. Some of them actually hate each other. They can hardly bear
to be in the same room and the failed relationship has become
corrosive. That is not a happy situation in which to make arrangements
for their children. I regret to say that I have said from time to time
that when parents are in dispute about their children, they are the
last people who should ever make arrangements for their future. They
are simply unsuitable.</hs_para>

the other may give way and agree to unsuitable
access/contact—two failed words—because of the way in
which this clause is framed and in the mistaken belief that that is
what a court would order. Although the phrase “shared
parenting” has been deleted, the public perception is that they
will get 50% of the time. When they are not necessarily going to court,
that is what one parent will try to impose on the other. Those who
cannot agree are likely to hold out for more contact, and this will
lead to increased litigation before the courts. The courts are already
beginning to be clogged up as a result of the absence of legal aid in
private family law cases, particularly at district judge level, where,
I am told, district judge first appointments, which used to last half
an hour, now go on for at least 45 minutes. The backlog of cases is
bound to grow. Of course, the children will suffer while the parents go
on fighting and carrying on their dispute about child arrangements
because it will take longer for these cases to be heard.</hs_para>

family judge and then as head of the family court is that judges look
to parents rather than impose gender discrimination in favour of
mothers. I made a very large number of decisions in favour of fathers,
although Fathers 4 Justice did not believe me. If it had looked at my
track record, it might have seen that that was the case. I cannot tell
the Committee what Fathers 4 Justice did for me, but its members did
lock the gate on one occasion so that I could not get out and I had to
get my husband to get the bolt cutters to open it. They also had Batman
and Robin on the roof of the law courts. Noble Lords may remember that
they stopped Tower Bridge functioning for a week by climbing up to the
top, and they also climbed up on to Buckingham Palace.</hs_para>

not accept that there is no gender discrimination against them and in
favour of mothers. However, as the NSPCC said, there is
no  
<?notus-xml column=273?>independent evidence of a bias. The Justice Select Committee accepted
that there was no such evidence, as did, I understand, the
Children’s Minister in the other place. There is no evidence of
bias in the courts in favour of one parent. Therefore, the changes
appear to be based on perceived rather than actual bias. I hope that
the Minister and those behind him will look at the experience in
Australia. At this stage of the evening, I shall not go into that, but
it has been unhappy, and it has used similar phraseology. Much of this
otherwise admirable Bill is very much based on the Norgrove report,
which interestingly does not support a change to the Children
Act.</hs_para>

said all that, I recognise and support the intention behind the clause
that the importance of both parents should be at the forefront of the
court’s mind. It is very sad that countless children are losing
one parent, generally the father, who leaves home and there is no
further relationship between him and his children. That is a very sad
situation. Of course, we must encourage the continuing involvement of
both parents so that after they separate, both are encouraged to stay
in touch. However, to make it a presumption is a step too far, and that
is why I have not sought to delete this clause. I have sought to amend
it to highlight the importance of both parents, but not to create a
second presumption. My amendment leaves out the word
“presume” and inserts “pay particular
regard” to highlight to the judge that he or she
must,</hs_para><hs_quotefo UID="13101686000173" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000173">“pay

an important matter that cannot be brushed aside. I am speaking because
of the issue of presumption and the effect that it will have on the
public who come to court. From my practical experience, I am extremely
concerned about the impact on the overriding presumption of welfare not
just in the courts—where I think most judges could cope with the
provision, although they do not like to have two clashing
presumptions—but in the minds of the public who are trying to
come to some sort of settlement. That is worrying, and I ask the
Government to look at this issue carefully. My amendment would meet the
need to emphasise the importance of the relationship between the child
and both parents and the continuing involvement of both parents, but
would not create the real problem of competing
presumptions.</hs_para>

Tyler of Enfield (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise briefly to speak
to Amendments 54 and 55. I have a lot of sympathy with both of them. I
should declare an interest as chair of CAFCASS. I, too, fully recognise
and support the intention of Clause 11. In the vast majority of cases
it is always desirable that both parents continue to be involved in the
bringing up of their children after separation, but we all know that
there are some cases where that is simply not possible, and that is
what this clause is all about.</hs_para>

the Minister for his helpful letter setting  out how Clause 11
might be put into operation. I will leave it to those far more learned
than I am in  legal technicalities to consider whether this

focus is on the practicalities and how this will impact on a
child-centred approach. Our experience at CAFCASS is that sometimes
these distinctions, these legal technicalities, are harder in practice
to observe in the often very feverish atmosphere of a family court
case, something that the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss,
set out clearly for us. Our work at CAFCASS shows how hard it can be to
help parents in cases in which there are high degrees of hostility and
acrimony to focus on the needs of their children rather than on
themselves. Anything that distracts from the focus on the child can
sometimes be of questionable value.</hs_para>

CAFCASS, as ever, will be to promote as full an involvement of both
parents as possible to reduce the number of caring mothers and fathers
who lose contact with their children after separation in a way that
does not make things worse for children. The difficulty that we are
discussing can be very much compounded by the invisible nature of the
emotional harm that many children experience through no fault of their
own when parents separate or divorce. A no-fault approach to
separation—it was accepted in divorce cases some time
ago—needs to be carried through. Courts can help children who
often feel that they are at fault and to blame in some way for their
parents’ separation. This emotional harm, unless acknowledged
and dealt with properly with all necessary support, can cause a
concealed social problem and have long-term costs attached to
it.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101686000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000107">My key
concern about the clause is that parental involvement—I very
much support the principle of joint involvement—is seen through
a child’s eyes. The situation in which a child finds themselves
in after separation or divorce can be difficult, affects schooling and
friendships and often undermines a child’s healthy development.
Decisions about parental involvement need to support a child’s
healthy development, schooling and adaptation to the new situation in
which they find themselves.</hs_para>

unique and a formula of any kind about parental involvement has to be
subject to the test of relevance to an individual child, and when
courts or CAFCASS are asked to intervene, this is the assessment that
they have to make. A statement about the importance of parental
involvement is absolutely right in general terms but if in practical
terms it is to have real meaning and value for the individual child,
that child must also receive the support that they need in the very
complex adaptation that they are making.</hs_para>

research has shown us that children want and need different levels of
contact with parents and relatives, and particularly with siblings and
friends. It is not just about the parents. We need to ensure that we
avoid—and I am sure that we will avoid it—this
legislation polarising the contact in any way, in terms of one or both
parents agreeing on an enforced basis. Children need a range of
contacts with siblings and other relatives to be maintained after
separation. I think we all recognise that the law can be a fairly blunt
tool, both in its current and proposed forms, to deal 
<?notus-xml column=275?>with a child’s bespoke and individual contact needs. My plea this
afternoon is that this should very much be seen in a child-centred
way.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/A9D08B361302AD4E7994BF7233EE3858487C503A" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 October 2013">Wednesday,

friend’s amendment and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes.
Listening to the noble Baroness, I remember hearing recently a male
acquaintance speaking passionately about his despair at not having
access to his child. It seemed that his wife, a wealthy woman, had
really done him down. He is poor and does not have the access to legal
help that she has. Listening to men talk about this so often is very
sad.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101686000111" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0001.htm#13101686000111">I will
speak during the debate on the amendment  of my noble friend
Lord Northbourne about the issue of children having access to their
fathers, which is desperately important. It is also important to
remember that the evidence seemed very clear that while there is a
perception that courts are finding favour more with women and that
women are too effective at frustrating what the courts want, in
practice this is not happening. I heard a presentation of the evidence
a few months back but am ashamed to say that I cannot remember the
presenter of the
details<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:02:00"></hs_TimeCode>. As my
noble and learned friend has just said, the Justice Committee agrees
with that. It seems that the Minister agrees too, so I would be
grateful if he could help me by providing the information. I think this
was a careful and thorough look at cases by an academic to check the
perception that there was a bias towards women. In fact, the research
showed, quite conclusively and clearly, that this was not the case. I
would be grateful if the Minister’s expert advisors might help
with that information. He can write to me with it. It is a perceived
problem but it is not a real problem. What is true, however, is how
tragic and difficult these issues so often are.</hs_para>

I cannot support the Government on this occasion. I examined a similar
proposal to that in the Bill in great detail on a previous occasion. In
doing so, I visited two contact centres and spoke to staff and parents
there. I also spoke with professionals from the Anna Freud Centre who
supported such families. My concern is that, at best, the Government
may be raising expectations in parents which will only add to
litigation and harm children as the conflict between their parents is
prolonged. This is the point that my noble and learned friend made and
it was also a concern that Norgrove had. In Norgrove’s family
review, at first he was favourable to the idea of having some
stipulation in the law that this should happen. Then he looked at what
happened in Australia and became determinedly against going forward in
this way. At worst, my fear is that the Government may be putting

other perception issue is very clearly, as one or two noble Lords have
intimated, what is in the press—and that is that the father, it
is usually the father, will be able to gain shared parenting. What they
mean by shared parenting is half and half. We know how damaging that
would be to a child, as the noble Baroness, Lady Tyler, said, when seen
through the child’s eyes. If you talk to children and young
people who are before the court, they want their parents to stay
together—you have to work through all that—and then they
want their lives disrupted as little as possible. They want to remain
in the same school; they want to be able to see their friends at the
weekend; they do not want to take a suitcase somewhere else every two
weeks—although, I have to say, some children quite enjoy it. I
have talked to kids who really enjoy having two places and adjust to
it. However, many do not, and therefore it is important that the
child’s wishes and feelings are taken firmly into consideration.
I 
<?notus-xml column=277?>think the perception will be that fathers, in particular, can get a
different agreement from the court, rather than the paramountcy
of the welfare of the child being the main

children’s time was divided increased substantially. The whole

Government were forced to legislate again to prioritise the safety of
children over the wishes of adults. I am quite sure that this

the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, and the noble Earl, Lord
Listowel<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>, who
both recognise that there are times when fathers are locked out of

There is no question about that, but there have been times when that
has been lost and the feeling has been that as long as a child has a
mother, perhaps that is okay. That is my  
<?notus-xml column=278?>concern. I fully recognise what my noble and learned friend Lady
Butler-Sloss said about the research. I am not suggesting here that
there have been wholesale miscarriages of justice but every single
miscarriage of justice in terms of parenting one’s own children
is a personal tragedy and we therefore need to take these things
extremely
seriously.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000123">This
is being made worse in the modern world because fathers are often
intimately involved in their child’s upbringing from birth. In
my day it did not happen. Father was a long way away for quite a long
time so the big bonding went on with mother, not with father. Often
parents are genuinely sharing the parental role. At times a father will
be the primary carer—I cannot remember fathers being primary
carers in my day—or maybe a better parent than the mother. On
occasions a mother may be neglectful, selfish and unloving. They may
even emotionally abuse their child. Of course, all these things can
apply to fathers, except that fathers, instead of emotionally abusing
their child, will tend to hit out. That has been one of the big
problems in decision-making on parenting, separation and childcare. As
a former social worker, I can say that we found it quite easy to see a
bump on someone’s head but found it very difficult to identify
and to codify emotional abuse of
children.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101686000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000183"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:14:26"></hs_TimeCode></I>7.15

of the things I want to put on record is that I agree that it has been
a difficult area and will probably continue to be so, but it does not
make it any more okay for the father to lose out. I am aware of cases
where it has taken inordinate amounts of time for the system to record
that it was the mother who was the abusive and disruptive parent. There
was an enormous amount of upset and disruption to the children in that
long process. In the end they get there—I am sure the research
shows that they get there—but I am not sure that the research
has looked at the costs of the whole process and at the difficulty for
people of getting to grips with emotional abuse and trying to avoid the
much simpler assumption that perhaps the child can be with the mother
and that will be all right. It is a little

revolution, as I see it, that has come about in family dynamics in our

modern. Having said that, I realise that there are many traditional
families and many bad fathers—there is no question about
that—and it is incredibly difficult for the people with the

is very difficult to lay down anything that looks like rules about how
you decide that because, as has been said already, the variation in

it would be quite wrong for the father to have contact with the
children for reasons that are sad and serious. On the other hand, there
are sometimes occasions when it is thought to oust the father for no
good reason at all. That also is serious. However, they are very

importance of trying to preserve the relationship between a child and

find very dangerous—and they appear in more than one

shown”. One can see immediately what 
<?notus-xml column=280?>might happen. Let us say that the wife decides that she wants to have

important factor is the relationship between both parents, as expressed
in the clause, and that should be one of the factors that have to be
taken into account in considering the welfare of the child. It is
obviously important that the relationship with both parents should be
preserved if possible. A factor in the checklist that includes that
would obviate a great deal of the difficulty that this kind of clause
could produce in putting a focus on one party trying to show that the
other party is not suitable for some reason or other. It would be much
better for the judge or magistrates, in approaching the matter, to take
account of the fact that it is very much in the interests of the child
and of the paramountcy of the child’s welfare that both parents
take an interest and be involved. Precisely how that is done can be
looked at as part of the general picture, but it strikes me that
focusing on this as a separate matter is very likely to make matters
worse rather than better.</hs_para>

As the noble Baroness says, this situation often arises. I feel that a

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> If that is addressed to me, the
answer is certainly yes. I have a distinct recollection of a case in
which the mother left the family at a very early stage and the father
and his mother had to look after the child. After a while, the
child’s mother decided to come back. She had had a relationship
which soured after a year or two and she thought that she would come
back. You have to take account of the existing situation and the
paramountcy of the welfare of the child, which may alter over time and
need to be reviewed from time to time. There is plenty of machinery to
do that, although, as my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss

McNally:</Member></B> My Lords, this has been an extremely important
and high-quality debate. I am not a lawyer but I have spent three and a
half years at the MoJ. Therefore, when the noble and learned Baroness,
Lady Butler-Sloss, said that she had the greatest possible respect for
my opinion, I am aware that the term “greatest possible
respect” is reserved for the most insulting comment that a
lawyer is about to deliver to an
opponent.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000140">I
was interested in the joust between the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay. When I was first given
this ministerial responsibility, I had speaking engagements in
Birmingham and Putney that arose within a few days of each other. I
experienced some of the doubts that have been expressed in
today’s debate about the road we were going down. What
interested me was that at both meetings two social workers in the
audience said quite unprompted exactly the same thing to me. They said,
“Don’t underestimate the willingness of women to use
their children in these battles”. The noble Baroness, Lady
Meacher, pointed out that in the 25 years since the original
legislation was passed there has been a change in what she described as
family dynamics. We are trying to deal with the situation and get the
wording
right.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000141">Even in
this debate there are things that take us down cul-de-sacs. We are not
following the Australian model; in fact we have learnt from it. Our
proposal does not require the court to balance these two
factors—I will come back to this. There is no idea of 50/50
parenting. One of the problems when this was debated down at the other
end was that the press coverage was very much in terms of this being a
major step change. I welcome the approach of the noble Baroness, Lady
Hughes, in her opening remarks. The paramountcy of the welfare of the
child is still there in this legislation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101686000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000142">The noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, from her vast experience, claims that the
way it is worded produces a contradiction. Let me try to explain our
approach to see whether we can convince her, but I 
<?notus-xml column=282?>suspect that we will be coming back to this issue on Report. It is not
possible for the presumption to clash with the paramountcy principle.
The paramountcy principle is not a rebuttable presumption. The
child’s welfare must be the court’s paramount
consideration. If the court does not believe that the child’s
welfare is served by the involvement of a parent, it will not order any
such involvement, and the clause does not require it to do so. We are
not saying that the court must make an order that involves both
parents, nor are we seeking to define the nature of the involvement
which the court may order. We are certainly not making any assumption
about how the child’s time may be divided. That is not what the
clause is
about.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000143">The
Explanatory Notes set out clearly how the clause operates. We have
included a process chart as well as an example situation to demonstrate
how we would expect the presumption to work in practice. In addition, I
have provided further information on the clause, which sets out in
detail how the clause will work in practice, and it addresses the
concerns that have been raised. We will also ensure that clear and
accessible information is available for parents about the range of
changes we are making. This will help to address wider concerns about
the risk that the clause may be misunderstood. We have deliberately
avoided defining the nature of involvement, which the court may order.
The presumption stands if any form of involvement can take place
without risk of harm to the child and would further the child’s
welfare. We have used the word “involvement” as the
simplest, most neutral approach to express the full spectrum of ways in
which a child can have a relationship with a parent. We believe that
the introduction of a presumption in legislation is the best and
clearest way to ensure that children are able to benefit from the
involvement of both parents following family
separation.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101686000144" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131016-gc0002.htm#13101686000144">This
clause is part of the consistent messaging that will be conveyed
throughout the dispute resolution process about the valuable role that
both parents can play in their child’s life, whether they are
together or apart. The deliberate reference to a presumption sends a
strong signal to both parents and others as to how the court makes its
decision. It makes clear that it is the norm rather than the exception
for both parents to be involved in the child’s life. On the
points raised, I think that I have already referred to the point made
by the noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, about whether it was 50/50. The
wording in the clause does not suggest or imply in any way equal or
substantial shared time. The Explanatory Notes make it clear that this
is not the
expectation.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/1C9F411A4F5DF865D891E095E2873146DDDB6B9F" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 16 October 2013">Wednesday,

there is a generational gap here and whether at the other end there is
more appreciation of the new dynamics of family that need to be

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, whatever I do, I hope that
I will do it gracefully. We have had an excellent debate because we
knew before we started that there would be a variety of views. It has
been a very constructive debate from which a great deal of consensus
has emerged and become evident. We are all agreed that the welfare of
the child should be paramount and that this principle should not be
diluted. We are all agreed that continued involvement of both parents
in a child’s life is desirable, indeed essential, to the
child’s welfare, unless there are reasons to the contrary. We
are all agreed, or at least will accept, that a change in the law of
one kind or another to put greater emphasis on parental involvement
would be acceptable; and we are all agreed that parental involvement
should be determined from a child-centred point of view—that is,
reference to the child’s experience and not any particular
division of the child’s
time<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T19:48:40"></hs_TimeCode>. I can
reassure the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, that our reference to
indirect involvement is not intended to suggest that, say, three

differences of opinion are evident, particularly around whether the
courts and professionals do enough at the moment to promote contact by
fathers and whether there is an issue there. I feel that there is an
issue there, and not just as a result of cases from when I was an MP. I
take the point of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, about that.
None the less, when as a Member of Parliament you get a large number of
cases such as that, it behoves you to ask whether things are working
properly. That is what you are there for.</hs_para>

Court of Appeal judgment, which was very strong on the fact that many
courts in that case had issued 82 orders and none of them had resulted
in the contact that they had sought the father to make. The noble and
learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, said that there is no evidence of
bias. Of course, we do not get information from family courts about
their individual decisions but there are certainly concerns among
fathers themselves. I do not think that many people can top the noble
and learned Baroness but in relation to Fathers 4 Justice I think I
can, because they actually handcuffed me. However, as your Lordships
can see, my wrists are so slender that I was able to slip out of it,
much to the man’s consternation. However, I talked to some other
very reasonable fathers’ groups over many years when I was
Minister for Children. They testify to having difficulties and we have
to take them seriously.</hs_para>

am not sure whether we are any further forward because it depends on
the Minister’s contention that the paramountcy principle cannot
be overridden by a rebuttal presumption, which is that in Clause 11. So
that we do not rehearse these same arguments at Report, I suggest to
him with respect that he could arrange some meetings and further
briefings so that we could have a discussion in a smaller environment
to see whether we can find a way forward before Report. With that, I

UNAIDS Global Reports, the latest of which reported HIV prevalence
rates among men who have sex with men increasing in 2012 from already
high-levels, with 76 of 193 countries still criminalizing same-sex
relations. We are acutely aware of the substantial barriers that men
who have sex with men face in accessing essential services for HIV
prevention and treatment due to stigma and discrimination caused by
punitive laws. That is why we recently announced new resources to
support global and regional networks to improve HIV responses reaching
key populations, including men who have sex with
