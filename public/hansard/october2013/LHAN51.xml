The Government agree that supermarket prices should be clear so that
consumers can make informed choices. The Minister for Employment
Relations and Consumer Affairs held a working group meeting with the
supermarkets in May to discuss unit pricing and clarity of
shelf-edge labels. We are working closely with the supermarkets and

Gardner of Parkes (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, is the Minister aware
of the problem for older people, or people in single family units? The
advantageous deals are three for two, or buy two and get one for a much
cheaper price. While I think that is very desirable for people who have
large numbers to feed, it is definitely a disadvantage for people who
want smaller quantities. Quite a lot of food must also be wasted,
because people cannot use it. Will he take up with the supermarkets the
possibility of providing these large super-deductions, but also
providing things that can be
bought<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T14:48:22"></hs_TimeCode> in

Younger of Leckie:</Member></B> My noble friend makes a good point, and
it is one of the issues that we are discussing earnestly with the
supermarkets. However I should point out that “buy one, get one
free” deals represent a small proportion of supermarket
promotions, the majority of which are temporary price reductions. We
are also in discussions over the Waste and Resources Action Programme,
which works with retailers to encourage alternative promotions for
perishable
goods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T14:48:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Kinnock" PimsId="1319" UID="1310145000304" xid="1852" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000304">Lord
Kinnock (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, is not the sense of crisis
heightened by the fact that the Prime Minister appears not to know the
price of a loaf of bread? Could the Minister show rather more urgency
in trying to insist that retailers, including supermarkets, have a
uniformity of descriptions of the pound and kilogram cost of items on
their shelves so that people can make a cogent choice in deciding what
the best value for money is?</hs_para>

important point. He may be aware that there is legislation in place, in
the form of the Price Marking Order 2004, which requires the selling
price and, where appropriate, the unit price—65p per 100 grams,
for example—to be clearly displayed on products being offered by
traders to consumers. We take this seriously and we are working hard to
improve communication about and the display of these

the details of that particular Bill. Much is being done with the OFT,
which is working with the supermarkets to develop a set of principles
to address the concerns over special offers and promotions for food and

Barnett (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord for his
initial comments. In the light of those, I had better be kind to him,
but I am afraid that when he answered a similar question on 9 July, I
believe that he misled the House on an important issue of the
independence of the Monetary Policy Committee and the Governor of the
Bank of England. I gather that he was depending on a command paper and
on an exchange of letters between the Chancellor and the governor, but
surely you cannot change a major Act of Parliament—the Bank of
England Act 1998—by an exchange of letters and a command paper.
That is clearly impossible. Can he explain how he has done that? The
independence of the Monetary Policy Committee is important, as the new
governor has told the country that he believes in long-term forecasts.
He has forecast interest rates which clearly would be affected by QE,
on which he is apparently being given unfettered power. Whether or not
he has those powers, could the Minister explain and confirm that the
Chancellor has agreed to allow the governor and the Monetary Policy
Committee unfettered control over interest rates and
QE?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000026"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="1310145000322" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000322">Lord

says. The Monetary Policy Committee is operationally independent. The
remit of the Monetary Policy Committee has to be set by the Governor of
the 
<?notus-xml column=263?>Bank of England. It has to be renewed every year. It was renewed this
year. The difference between this year and previous years is that the
Chancellor asked the governor to look at possible methods of forward
guidance which would give greater certainty to the markets about the
medium-term movement of interest rates and, indeed, QE. That is exactly
what the governor did, in line with the request from the Chancellor
which was in line with the provisions of the Bank of England
Act.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000027"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Bilimoria" PimsId="5110" UID="1310145000323" xid="1960" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000323">Lord
Bilimoria (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I join in wishing the noble
Lord, Lord Barnett, a very happy 90th birthday. He has asked
an excellent question in that it relates to forward guidance. For a
long time I have been saying that when setting interest rates the
Governor of the Bank of England and the Monetary Policy Committee
should look not just at inflation targeting but at the wider economy.
This is excellent news. However, is it wise that the governor should
tie himself down to a specific level of 7% unemployment, after which
interest rates are to be raised, unless inflation is going out of
control? When does the Minister think that the 7% will be
achieved? Secondly, would it not have been wiser to have had a wider
remit taking into account other aspects of the economy, not just
inflation
targeting?</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000028" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000028"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Newby" PimsId="2095" UID="1310145000324" xid="1358" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000324">Lord
Newby:</Member></B> As the noble Lord says, the governor is now looking
at unemployment in terms of when interest rates might change, but there
is no iron rule that the moment unemployment rates hit 7%, interest
rates will go up. There are three potential arguments which would
mitigate against that, of which by far the most important is if the
outlook for inflation was higher. As to when we might reach 7%, in
August when the Bank of England published its report suggesting this,
it thought it would be in the third quarter of 2016. The good news is
that since then the economy has grown more quickly, and the consensus
is now settling around summer
2015.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Peston" PimsId="165" UID="1310145000325" xid="1171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000325">Lord
Peston (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, will the Minister cast his mind
back to when your Lordships debated what is now the Bank of England
Act? My noble friend Lord Barnett and I put down an amendment precisely
to achieve the flexibility which is in this command paper. We were not
told that the flexibility was already there, which is what the command
paper says. We were told that we were idiots, and that the remit of the
Monetary Policy Committee was to hit the inflation target—only
after that could it look at anything else. The Government have produced
a sleight of hand here. I favour it, let me add, but it is a sleight of
hand.</hs_para>

the fact that, for the first time, the Bank of England is looking at
the employment rate as a way of deciding on the speed at which interest
rates might change. I am sure he would agree, as Keynes probably would,
that the quickest way to bring the rate of unemployment down is to get
the growth rate moving more quickly. I am sure that he will be pleased
that all the projections of growth are now being revised rapidly
upwards. The IMF, for example, last week revised upwards its growth
rate for this year from 0.09% to 1.4% and for next year from 1.5% to
1.9<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:01:13"></hs_TimeCode>%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000032" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000032"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Flight" PimsId="5908" UID="1310145000327" xid="2118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000327">Lord

dogs’ welfare is a primary consideration during and after their
service. The MoD rehomes all suitable dogs, often with someone closely

The situation in this country is that the decision to put a dog to
sleep is taken by a veterinary officer and only after all possible
avenues have been exhausted. From 2010 to June 2013, sadly, 300 dogs
had to be put down, and the reasons for this included injury, illness
and age-related welfare reasons. As I have said, those cases were
looked at by veterinary officers and the decision was taken only as a

commitment that no dogs are put down for financial reasons. The vast
majority of dogs had to be put down as the animals’ condition
impeded and reduced their quality of life. As noble Lords may know from
sad personal experience, everyone will at times have to put animals to
sleep when it is the only option. The death or destruction of a
military working dog is subject to formal investigation and report, as

Committee, we considered a provision which was intended to ensure a
focus on the adult’s strengths and how these can contribute
towards the outcomes they want to achieve as part of the assessment.
This provision was drafted to support our aim to build the care and
support system around the person and to consider the adult’s own
capabilities: what they can do—as well as their needs—and
what they cannot do. While most noble Lords agreed with the principle,
a concern in Committee was that the provision set out in the Bill might
be wrongly interpreted by local authorities as allowing them to place
additional caring responsibilities 
<?notus-xml column=270?>on family and friends rather than providing care and support. Amendments
32 and 33 look to address the concerns that
arose<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:19:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000071">Amendment
32 removes the requirement to assess the adult’s capabilities
and other matters as part of the needs assessment. Amendment 33
provides for a consideration of such matters to happen separate to, but
alongside, the needs assessment. Local authorities should have a
discussion with adults or carers in parallel to the assessment,
considering how their own capabilities and any other matters can help
to achieve the outcomes they want to achieve on a daily basis. These
amendments remove the source of concern, while retaining the important
point of policy on which we
agree.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000072" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000072">In
Committee, there was also concern as to whether the assessment process
was sufficiently supportive of the focus of the Bill on the prevention
of need. We have considered this and have also brought forward
amendments to strengthen this focus. The second part of Amendment 33
and Amendment 45 require a local authority to consider at the time of
the assessment whether any universal services available locally,
whether provided by the local authority under Clause 2 or Clause 4 or
by another organisation, would be of benefit to the person. This
replaces the previous provision in which such a consideration took
place only after the eligibility determination. This would support
situations where, for example, a local authority might decide to defer
the final eligibility determination until the person or carer has taken
part in a preventive service, such as a reablement programme.
Amendments 36 and 37 make similar provision in relation to
carer’s assessments. Amendments 90, 91, 100, 101, 109 and 112
make equivalent changes in relation to the assessment of children,
child carers and young

provisions to ensure they provided for this. Having considered the
provisions I have concluded that they needed to be strengthened to
provide for when an expert must carry out an assessment for complex
needs, such as for a person who is deafblind. Amendment 39 rectifies
this, and I would like to thank the noble Lord for raising this in

42, 43, 44, 62, 115, 116 and 117. Members of the Committee asked to see
clear links between this Bill and the Children and Families Bill, which
is also before the House. I share their view that both Bills must work
together so that no one falls through a gap in the legislation.
Amendment 42 ensures that a local authority can combine an
adult’s assessment with any other assessment it is 
<?notus-xml column=271?>carrying out, whether under this Bill or other legislation, as long as
the individual or individuals being assessed agree. For example, it
clarifies that the authority can carry out a needs assessment with a
young carer’s assessment. Amendment 43 allows the authority to
carry out a needs or carer’s assessment jointly with another
assessment being carried out by another body, whether of that person or
a person relevant to the situation, as long as the individual or
individuals being assessed agree. Amendment 62 ensures similarly that
local authorities have powers to combine care and support plans and
support plans with any other plan of that individual or another.
Amendments 115, 116 and 117 make similar provision for a child’s
assessment, a child carer’s assessment and a young
carer’s assessment when they are transitioning to adult
services. These amendments reflect similar government amendments tabled
to the Children and Families Bill and reflect the synergy between both
Bills and how they work together to ensure that the needs of children
and young carers are considered during the adult’s
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000076" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000076">I

32, which removes the reference to support available from families and

this wording is included in the Bill, it is vital that strong guidance
is given to local authorities not to run the risk of negative,
unintended consequences. There will be guidance, regulations and

intend local authorities to look to families and friends to provide
care and support, potentially taking on a greater caring role. Can the
Minister give assurances that local authorities should also not be
looking to families and carers to provide more care as a get-out
clause, if you like, from providing statutory services? This is
particularly important given the great variability in so-called
community services from area to area and, of course, the huge stress on
local authority budgets, which is a fact of life for all local

Low of Dalston (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I very much welcome the
Government’s Amendments 33, 39 and 40. So far as Amendments 39
and 40 are concerned, in Committee, as the Minister has remarked, I
sought a strengthening of Clause 12(1)(f) to ensure that regulations
would specify the circumstances in which a specially trained person
must carry out an assessment or a reassessment of persons who need one.
The Minister was kind enough to thank me for raising the point, and I
thank him very much for bringing forward these amendments. I am
delighted that the Government have come forward with amendments that
effectively meet my wishes, recognising that the Bill, as initially
presented to the House, did not precisely reflect the
Government’s

provision, I kick myself that I forgot to refer to this in connection
with Amendment 26 from the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher,
about the need for local authorities to commission a full range of
services to meet the diversity of their residents’ needs. I
meant to illustrate this by reference to the situation of deafblind
people who are all too often offered mainstream services or services
designed for those with a single sensory loss instead of the specialist
provision appropriate to their particular needs. Perhaps, in welcoming
the Government’s amendment on specialist assessments, I can slip
in the thought that if local authorities are required to ensure that
sufficient services are available for meeting the needs for care and
support of adults in their area, they would rightly be under some
pressure to identify the full range of deafblind people’s needs,
and those with other specialised needs as well, and plan
accordingly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:29:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Amendment 33, I argued in Committee—I fear at too great a length
for some, but I shall try not to repeat that mistake today—that
the Bill would be much stronger if local authorities were also placed
under a duty to take prevention into account in exercising any of their
functions under Part 1, not just those relating to direct provision of
care. Failure to do this meant that there was little in the Bill for
those not deemed eligible for care and support, even though their needs
might be quite considerable. It also did little to advance the
Government’s own strategy of rebalancing the care system away
from crisis intervention and in a more preventive
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:30:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment, however, embraces a more strategic approach by obliging
local authorities to consider whether measures short of full care and 
<?notus-xml column=273?>support, including anything which might be available in the community
and not just directed at individual care, could assist the individual.
This could ensure that those who did not reach the eligibility
threshold were not bereft of support entirely and would in effect make
the eligibility threshold go further. This is very much to be welcomed,
and makes the Government’s setting of the eligibility threshold
at the equivalent of “substantial” somewhat easier to

explicit reassurance on one or two points; perhaps the Minister might
like to make a note of them in order to respond to them when he comes
to wind up. I would like a reassurance that preventive services will
remain universal and free of charge. We know that entitlement to many
reablement services is assessed against the FACS criteria. We also know
that councils have previously tried to charge for them even though it
is illegal to do so. An explicit commitment has been made to minor aids
and adaptations continuing to be provided free and without the need for
a financial assessment. No similar statement has been made about
intermediate care. I believe that the House would very much welcome the
Minister giving the same explicit commitment to intermediate care
services, including most reablement services, continuing to be free of
charge. There is evidence to indicate that councils will look to
restrict access to preventive support. I therefore welcome the

Meacher (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, Amendment 41 is a probing
amendment, so I will speak briefly. Before I say anything else, I
applaud the Minister for the raft of amendments in this group. I was
particularly pleased to see the amendments in relation to young carers,
although this is not relevant to Amendment 41. However, government
Amendments 32, 33, 36 to 38 and—perhaps in particular—39
and 40 are, of course, relevant to this amendment. My Amendment 41
requires that regulations that make further provision for carrying out
a needs or carers’ assessment will specify the circumstances in
which a person’s social care needs are to be regarded as
complex—the amendments do not refer to that term, so I would
like a further clarification of that—and that having defined
“complex needs”, social workers should always be involved
in the assessment of cases meeting that criterion. That is the proposal
of the College of Social Work. I should say that the involvement of a
professional social worker does not mean the exclusion of all others.
Clearly, if a professional social worker is dealing with a deafblind
person, he would need to involve a specialist in that particular group
of
disabilities.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000090">The
college makes the first point that a good assessor sets out to create a
complete picture of a person’s situation, strengths,
capabilities and aspirations. Social workers are trained and recruited
on the basis that they have the necessary cognitive and emotional depth
to undertake those assessments. The second point is that people with
complex needs generally have an awful lot of different services to
which they need to relate if all their complex needs are to be met. The

noble Earl knows, the Law Commission argued that where a person has
complex or multiple needs, a proportionate assessment would require an
in-depth and comprehensive exploration of those needs. It is difficult

as complex cases include: where a person is subject to legislation or
national guidance; where a person is or may be subject to abuse; where
there is conflict between a person and a member of their family or
their carer; and where there is a need to support the applications of
individuals or their families for continuing healthcare

dementia—people whose needs will be quite complex and difficult
to assess. You need people who have been trained in that sort of work.
Can the Minister say, with respect to these vulnerable groups, whether
regulations will clarify their need for a professional

will not deal directly with the assessment of people with complex

Dubs (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome how far the Minister has
moved from Committee to today. I hope that noble Lords will not think
it churlish of me to say that perhaps he might be persuaded to move a
little further. I will speak first to Amendment 60, which seeks to
oblige a local authority to provide advice and information about what
can be done in the event of an emergency, or if needs change. I am
specifically talking about what I think we have referred to before as
people with fluctuating conditions and needs. We know that there are
many millions of people in the country who have fluctuating conditions
such as multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, HIV, Crohn’s,
colitis, epilepsy and Parkinson’s disease, and there may be many
others. Therefore, we are talking about a significant number of people
who will be affected by the provisions of this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000094">Not long
ago I was talking to a woman in a wheelchair who had MS. She was very
lively, bubbly and sparky, and she said to me: “You know,
I’m not always like this. Some days I go down and I can’t
even get out of bed, so don’t judge my condition by the way you
see me today”. I took that very much to heart, and it is clearly
the sort of situation that this amendment is about. As the Bill is
currently drafted under Clause 25, it would not really make provision
for such
situations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000095">This
amendment is actually operationally simple. It would help to ease the
pressure placed on formal and informal carers, and would give them more
certainty. Not only will it ensure that individuals get the timely care
that they need when they need it but, equally importantly, it has the
potential to prevent costly and unnecessary hospital admissions. If
this amendment is not in place, there is always the possibility that
with a downward fluctuation in condition, the person without the
support will then have to be hospitalised. That in itself is costly and
is utterly undesirable from the point of view of the person who could
be helped in the home if this amendment were to be
passed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000096">Local
authorities are surely in a position to provide better tailored care,
to promote confidence and control and allow
people to prepare for such rises and falls in their care needs. The
current drafting does not allow for it. A snapshot was taken by the
NRAS—the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society—which
indicated that currently more than 30% of respondents with rheumatoid
arthritis have been admitted to emergency care as a result of a
flare-up in the disease in the past year. This is something which I
trust could be prevented if we changed the way in which this clause was
to operate. A survey of 1,000 people with MS revealed that 95% of
respondents felt that better services during a relapse or a sudden
deterioration of their condition would help them to maintain their
independence. More than 80% said that they want to be able to plan
their care and support in advance of that care being required. This
amendment would help people whose conditions 
<?notus-xml column=276?>might suddenly worsen and, as I said earlier, would potentially prevent
unnecessary and costly hospital
admissions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000097" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000097">I
turn to Amendment 61. As the wording of the Bill in Clause 27 states,
local authorities have the power to generally review care plans.
However, they are not required to specify when they anticipate that
these reviews will take place. This amendment seeks to put some
certainty into the process. There should be an agreed date between the
adult and the local authority upon which a review of the care and
support plan would be offered. I envisage a discussion between the
local authority and the person concerned about the best way in which
their care needs can be
met.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000098" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000098">An
anticipated review date, agreed between the local authority and the
adults, would provide stability and certainty to those being cared for.
It is not a large change but it would be beneficial for the people
concerned. I do not want to spell out with examples where people have
said what a difference it would make if they had this element of
certainty. I would like this amendment to be passed, which will give
the adult the confidence that their care would continue as agreed until
the specified date or until the adult themselves chooses to request a
review in line with Clause
27(1)(b).</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000099"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:44:11"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Mackay of Clashfern" PimsId="1610" UID="1310145000372" xid="1761" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000372">Lord
Mackay of Clashfern (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I generally support

33.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000100">I had
understood paragraph (b) of Amendment 33 to carry the implication that
if something was found that would benefit the person in question as a
result of examination of what is in (b), the needs assessment would
include that. However, I just wonder whether the last part creates the
possibility that if the benefit can be received from something in the
community, outside the provisions that the local authorities have made,
that would be excluded; in other words, it would tend to reduce the
needs assessment. I had rather thought that the proper construction of
this phrase would mean that that also should be taken into account as
included in the needs assessment, and that, where it was available, the
cost of it should be included in the needs assessment. Perhaps my noble

Bills. In particular, we welcome 
<?notus-xml column=277?>the safeguard in this group of amendments, which ensures that local
authorities are able to combine assessments relating to adults being
assessed with assessments relating to young carers only with the
consent of both. The new provisions also make it explicit that it will
be possible to join up care plans with other types of care plan only
with the consent of the relevant parties, and we welcome this
too.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000103" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000103">We were
very concerned that as originally drafted, Clause 9, which sets out the
assets-based approach to assessment, could have been misinterpreted and
used to push greater responsibility for meeting needs from the local
authority to carers, family and friends. It blurred the distinction

meeting them by looking at how needs are met by other ways through the
provision of services before any decision about eligibility has been
made.</hs_para>

Government’s amendments addressing this problem are now more in
accord with the Law Commission review of adult social care legislation,
which made a clear distinction between consideration of care and
support needs and how the needs should be met. On specialist
assessments, we are pleased to see the amendments upholding the current
practice and guidance, which provide for assessments to be undertaken
by people with expertise. It is an issue on which the House expressed
itself very strongly, especially the need for specialist assessors in
the case of people with complex health or mental health needs. The
noble Lord, Lord Low, and the noble Baroness, Lady Meacher, have set
out these issues again today very clearly, and I look forward to the

I support the intention of my noble friend Lord Dubs in Amendment 60 to
ensure that the care and support plan provides contingency planning for
an emergency, such as the carer suddenly being ill or unable to provide
care. The self-directed assessment model does include discussion on
contingency and risk but the extent to which clear provision is covered
in the care and support plan is patchy. Indeed, it is not always easy
to be specific about what would happen because often the reality is
that instant emergency cover is hard to organise when relatives live a
considerable distance away or the cared-for person is not able to
summon up emergency help. My noble friend is right to reinforce the
point about the need for emergency contingency planning, especially
where people have fluctuating health conditions, such as MS, rheumatoid
arthritis and HIV.</hs_para>

noble friend also underlines the importance of including a review date
in the plan. It would be very valuable to require social services
departments and providers to be clearer about not just the review date
for the plan but what the monitoring and review process is and what
kind of client feedback or complaints process there would be, as well
as client-carer involvement in assessing quality of care and standards
of service. I suspect that very few care plans currently measure up to
these requirements and I would be grateful if the Minister could tell
me what requirements the Government will place on local authorities and
commissioners in this
respect.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_14_PT_1/FFCD4956289E28C0552B6F4C5E71A5D05E2CEC53" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 October 2013">Monday,

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful for the support that noble
Lords have given to the government amendments. Perhaps I may start by
covering the questions that were put to me. The noble Baroness, Lady
Pitkeathley, and my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern
asked for assurances that the guidance will make clear that local
authorities cannot assume that support will be forthcoming from
community services or carers as a get-out. I assure the noble Baroness
and my noble and learned friend that the intention in Amendment 33 is
not to place extra responsibilities on carers and families, nor to
delay local authorities in providing statutory services. I will commit
to making this absolutely clear in the statutory guidance that will be
co-produced with stakeholders. I hope that that is a valuable
reassurance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000108">The
noble Lord, Lord Low, asked for reassurance about preventive services
remaining universal and free of charge, as well as intermediate care. I
can reassure him that certain services will be provided free of charge,
and regulations will set out which types of prevention services must be
provided free of charge. Regulations will also set out which types of
prevention services local authorities can charge for. It will then be
for local authorities to decide whether they charge for such services.
This will maintain the current position, where charging for preventive
services is determined locally, in accordance with local requirements.
Additionally, we would expect intermediate care, including reablement
and community equipment such as aids and minor adaptations, to remain
free of charge. That is a minimum. The regulations will allow for
flexibility, to keep the list up-to-date as services change over
time.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000109">The noble
Lord, Lord Low, also asked whether the commitments in Clause 13(2)(b)
will apply also to Clause 9. Will an assessment be deemed necessary
where preventive services may be of benefit, even if someone is
unlikely to be eligible? The duty to assess in Clause 9 is independent
of the provisions on prevention. Amendments 33 and 45 make it clear
that preventive services should be considered during the assessment
rather than having to wait for the eligibility determination. This will
mean that people can be advised during the assessment on their
preventive needs, whether or not they have eligible needs. I hope that
that is
helpful.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000110">Perhaps
it will be helpful if I move on to the amendments tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Meacher. Amendment 41 seeks to ensure that an
appropriately qualified social worker will carry out complex
assessments. I absolutely sympathise with the noble Baroness’s
amendment and believe that my Amendments 39 and 40, to which
she referred, will go some way towards addressing her concerns. I also
reassure her that, through the powers in Clause 12, we will require
local authorities to ensure that assessors have the appropriate
training to carry out the assessment. We have listened to the concerns
of adults who use care and support, and to their carers. They are right
to say that assessors should receive appropriate

am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for raising in his Amendment
60 the issue of fluctuating and emergency needs, and, in his Amendment
61, anticipated review dates in the care and support planning process.
Clause 25 sets out the minimum framework for the planning process, and
balances the need to set out standards for care and support planning
while not constraining the ability of local authorities to fit the
planning process around the person. I reassure the noble Lord that
providing advice and information on what can be done to meet or reduce
a person’s needs will include providing advice and information

addition, where it is clear that an adult experiences fluctuating

provided.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000114" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000114">The
issue of timescales of reviews is something we have considered
carefully. The review is an important part of the process as it can
identify where a person’s needs have changed and if their care
and support plan should be revised to reflect this. Clause 27 on the
review of care plans creates a general duty for the local authority to
keep plans under review as well as a specific duty to review the plan
when the authority believes the person’s needs or circumstances
have changed. In addition, the clause contains a right to request a
review. I reassure the noble Lord that nothing in the Bill prevents the
local authority and the adult agreeing a time for the next review if
they wish to do so. We believe this to be a more pragmatic way of
fitting reviews around the lives of people, and one which supports our
policy of personalised care. I reassure the House that we intend to
detail these issues in statutory guidance on care
planning.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000115">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:56:10"></hs_TimeCode>

Howe:</Member></B> In moving Amendment 49, I wish to speak also to the
other government amendments in this group, Amendments 50, 51, 52, 53,
54, 59 and 169. We are currently consulting on the detail of our
reforms to care and support funding, including charging. This
consultation and the accompanying engagement are looking at key issues
around future charging for adult care and support. We need to ensure
that the Bill has sufficient flexibility to take account of the views
expressed through this consultation and the on-going engagement. This
work has highlighted areas where the Bill as drafted may not be
sufficiently flexible. I turn to my Amendments 49, 51 and 52 concerning
local flexibility in charging
policies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000117">Currently,
local authorities are free to set their own charging policies for
non-residential care. The intention was to create a more consistent
framework for charging across local authorities. However, there was
uncertainty whether the regulation-making powers as drafted would have
allowed local authorities to contribute towards the care and support
costs of people who have resources above the financial limits. A rule
which prohibits local authorities from making any contribution towards
the care costs of such people would restrict the ability of local
authorities to use different arrangements when these would best meet
local needs. For example, local authorities sometimes subsidise
services such as telecare. We wish to allow this to continue and do not
want to require local authorities to charge people the full cost of
these
services<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:01:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000118">My
other amendments, Amendments 50, 53 and 54, concern circumstances in
which a financial assessment has not taken place or a local authority
considers that a full assessment is unnecessary. We wish to encourage
people to undertake financial assessments because this will enable
local authorities to charge them a fair contribution towards their care
costs. However, we recognise that some people are likely to refuse to
undergo a financial assessment; for example, someone may be unwilling
to allow the local authority to access their financial information. In
order best to promote these people’s well-being, it may be
appropriate for local authorities to arrange care on their behalf. The
local authority would be able to charge individuals the full cost of
this care and any arrangement fee.</hs_para>

therefore allow regulations to enable local authorities to broker care
on behalf of people who do not wish to undergo a financial assessment.
The regulations will also make provision for light-touch financial
assessments where a full financial assessment would not be
proportionate, such as for low-cost care packages, in particular for
carers. Regulations and guidance will be designed to ensure that such
assessments are used appropriately.</hs_para>

amendments in this group ensure that all those who should get an
independent personal budget receive one and that the regulation-making
powers retain their intended flexibility. I hope noble Lords agree that
the additional flexibilities provided for by these amendments will
equip local authorities with the tools they need better to promote
individual well-being and that noble Lords can therefore support my
amendments. I beg to

substance is vital if the Government’s scheme for a cap is to
work. We made good progress on the basis of the Minister’s
remarks in Committee, and further progress was made in the
Government’s consultation document, published on 17 July. I hope

argument from Committee. You cannot at the moment top up your own care
home fees. If you go into a care home, a third party—your son,
daughter or friend—can top them up but you cannot put in your
own money. That is important now, and the statutory bar is often got
around or simply ignored. However, it will be a lot more important once
the Dilnot scheme incorporated in the Bill takes effect.</hs_para>

an old person who is living in a home in which the fees are £800
a week. Suppose that the limit to what the local authority will pay in
fees is £500 a week. What happens when the person has spent up
to the cap, at the local authority rate of course? It may be that a
third party can give them the extra money to pay up, but suppose they
are isolated and on their own. I am afraid that the answer is simple
and stark. The individual would have to choose between only two
alternatives. One is to accept the £500 a week from the local
authority and move into a cheaper, perhaps worse, home, with all the
disruption to that person’s life that that would involve. The
other would be waive the local authority contribution and continue to
pay the £800 themselves. That would mean that the cap had not
done them a blind bit of good. The way round this is to permit
individual top-ups, so £500 would come from the local authority,
£300 from the individual. The noble Earl endorsed this in
Committer when he said that,</hs_para>

adopted a proposal that I made in Committee. As the House knows, I have
previous in this field, having been working on long-term care since I
was on the royal commission in 1999. I also have a bit of previous on
public policy in general because I started working for Tony Crosland
when he was shadow Environment Minister in 1972. Of all the myriad
subjects on which I have had to do reasonably serious work in this
time, this is by far the most complicated. It involves a mix of
financial and administrative problems with the most sensitive human
considerations, particularly since it concerns people at a stage of
their life when they are going into the second age of vulnerability due
to age. Public and private are inextricably mixed in a way that
complicates things. The whole cap is part of a private/public
co-operation; therefore, it is crucial to align what both parts are
doing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000126">The
scale and range of the stakeholders involved is enormous. The Care and
Support Alliance had more than 100 individual voluntary organisations
which came together to promote a solution in this Bill. There are also
a lot of nooks and crannies that are not obvious. I am going to come to
one in a speech later this afternoon, a feature of this Bill which only
became known to me on Friday which greatly changes the deferred payment
scheme under the Bill. There are nooks and crannies that can be simply
ignored. We had another one earlier in the Bill. It suddenly turned out
that if somebody had an income close to the top for which they could
claim means-tested support, they had better not claim it, because
otherwise they would lose more than they gained through attendance
allowance. So it is a hugely complicated
field.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000127">I am not
a critic of the department on this, nor of its Ministers. They have
wrestled bravely with this, helped of course by the superb Dilnot
report—I am standing behind my noble friend Lord Warner who was
involved in that process—which helped hugely to clarify the
intellectual framework. But there are complications as yet unfathomed.
As the scheme goes forward I promise that there will be lots of
unexpected and unintended effects. In particular, how people register
they are getting care needs, how they are then assessed, and how it
builds up towards a care cap, will work out quite strangely. The

the financial services industry and those who regulate it, and
government departments—that can keep on top of these things. As
major problems are identified, the committee can report to the
Minister on them. As I say, it is not a vote of no
confidence in the Department of Health. Indeed, I hope that the
department will welcome the proposal because it has shown itself to be
willing to talk openly throughout this progress of this Bill. The
Minister used a good phrase to describe it when discussing the
regulations earlier—co-production. We will need co-production as

where the costs are higher than the local authority is paying. That is
a strong argument, and I, too, welcome the progress that has been made.
However, like my noble friend, I hope that the noble Earl will be able
to give us a further report on progress on this
matter<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:12:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Amendment 56, which has been very effectively trailed by my noble
friend; in fact, it is difficult for me to do as much justice to the
amendment as he has done. It requires the establishment of an
independent ministerial advisory committee to keep under review the
workings of the cap and the means-testing arrangements set out in
Clause 17. It is fair to say that all noble Lords who have debated this
Bill have welcomed its general intent and the principles that underpin
it. The Dilnot commission marked a significant step forward in creating
consensus on how people are to be protected from financial catastrophe
if they have to fund their own care. We have debated in detail the
Government’s response as set out in this Bill: the establishment
and operation of the cap, the level of the cap, the continued financial
risk to self-funders, the deferred payment scheme, the capacity of
local authorities to accept the responsibilities being placed on them,
and in particular, I would identify the 
<?notus-xml column=285?>responsibility for assessing thousands of self-funders who will come
into contact with the local authority for the first time. We have
discussed the advice to be made available to vulnerable people in a
complex area and its interrelationship with the eligibility

general thrust of the Bill, will believe that this is the last word. I
am sure that the operation of the care packages set out in this Bill
will need to be kept under frequent review by the Government and
particularly by the noble Earl’s department. Oversight of the
system would surely benefit from a bipartisan group of people from whom
the Government could continue to take advice. My noble friend Lord
Lipsey has gone back many years in relation to the debates in this
area. Of course, he served on the 1999 Sutherland royal commission. In
parallel we have had the Turner commission on pensions and we have seen
the benefit of a bipartisan approach in relation to Dilnot.</hs_para>

Warner (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, as the self-appointed keeper to
this House of the Dilnot tablets, I support Amendments 55 and 56,
spoken to so ably by my two noble friends. Turning to Amendment 55, in
framing our recommendations in our report, it was never our intention
to impose a new set of rigidities in place of the old set of
rigidities. It is important that the new system retains as much
flexibility as possible. It is worth thinking about what lies behind
much of the argumentation in our report and the new architecture that
that report proposes. It is all about people, in as fair, orderly and
manageable a way as possible, making contributions from their own
resources to the rising costs of adult social care as we cope with,
live with and adapt to an ageing population. Given the messiness of the
present arrangements for top-ups, it would be perverse not to create
the maximum flexibility for people to top up, particularly where these
top-ups relate to their ability to stay in a home where they and their
family have been very comfortable with the arrangements. Preventing
such top-ups would be a truly perverse way of implementing the Dilnot
architecture. We need a more flexible way of coping with this.
Therefore I support my noble friend Lord Lipsey’s set of
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000137" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000137">On
Amendment 56, my noble friend has a very strong point. I say this as
someone who spent 10 years wrestling with means tests as a senior civil
servant coping with social security. In those 10 years, numerous were
the times when we had to cope with unforeseen 
<?notus-xml column=286?>consequences of what we thought were well designed social policy
changes, but which turned out not quite to work when subjected to the
scrutiny of the real world across a large population. I congratulate
the Government on taking our report and turning it into a largely
workable—we have a few doubts, but largely workable—set
of arrangements that can be brought into operation quickly. However it
would be very optimistic to think that there would be no unforeseen
consequences—wrinkles, if I may use the word—which needed
to be looked at, in particular in the areas of means-testing and the
working of the cap. I emphasise that this is not a job application from
the Dilnot commission to make, like Frank Sinatra, another return
appearance, but we do need some kind of credible, independent body to
take a look at
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000138">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:24:37"></hs_TimeCode>
would just gently remind the noble Earl that, at the end of our report,
on page 69, we talked about some of these potential wrinkles, including
the potential further changes in and around means-testing, which we did
not have time to wrestle with but which we just flagged up for the
Government. I will not go into the details but just the headlines.
Under “Consistent treatment of housing assets”, we noted
the way they are treated differently across the social care means test
in terms of domiciliary and residential care—they are not
treated on the same basis. There is also the issue of whether the
means-test taper actually disincentivises savings and the issue of
consistency between the way people in residential and nursing care,
where it is not continuing care, have to meet general living costs but
do not have to meet them where it is continuing care.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:24:37"></hs_TimeCode> know that
there are already some potential anomalies in the way that the new
architecture will interact with some of those areas. We flagged that up
in the
report.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000139">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:20:53"></hs_TimeCode>
noble friend has argued for some kind of independent advisory
committee. He may not altogether thank me for raising some of these
potential further changes but they are issues that have to be wrestled
with. The new set of arrangements will throw up their own issues, which
will also have to be wrestled with. Some kind of independent advisory
committee, looking at the way in which the new scheme has worked and
has bedded down, particularly in the area of the means test, would be a
valuable contribution. I do not think it is a partisan issue. It would
be welcomed across the parties and I hope that the Minister can look a
bit more favourably on my noble friend’s

Greengross (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, first, I add my voice in
support of Amendment 55, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. We
have not fully taken into account the impact that the Bill will have,
when it becomes an Act and is brought into being, on the many people
who are now in care homes and where the funding of those homes will
suddenly become much more public. Everybody will report to the local
authority to get on the meter and the extent of people’s
self-funding will become better known. There will be a sort of
explosion if we do not get this right and do not allow people to make
top-ups. What are we going to do: assume that some of these people will
be moved from the care home that they are in and where they are, we
hope, happy to another care home because 
<?notus-xml column=287?>there is inflexibility with the top-up system? That would be really
cruel and I hope that we can get as much flexibility and remove as many
restrictions on people as we
can.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000141">Several<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:24:37"></hs_TimeCode>

the whole amount but want to be able to top up the local authority
amount, which, at the moment, nobody is fully aware of. As this is all
going to become much more public knowledge, it is important to have as
much flexibility as possible. I hope the Minister will have another

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, first, I turn to Amendment 55,
in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, which concerns the
circumstances in which people wish to top up their own fees to pay for
more expensive accommodation. To begin with, and for the avoidance of
any doubt, I will emphasise that I agree that people should be able to
choose to spend their own money on more expensive care, provided it is
affordable. Like the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, I want people to be able
to choose to live in more expensive accommodation and gain from a cap
on care costs, so that they pay part of the cost of care from their own
savings and still receive local authority
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000143">Through

answer to the question posed by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is that
consultation will close on 25 October. The Minister of State
for Care and Support and departmental officials have, over the past
quarter, attended a variety of events covering the care and support
sector, local authorities and financial services providers. These have
been broadly supportive of the principle that people should be able to
contribute towards their care costs from their own assets. Stakeholders
have also recognised that people need to make decisions which are
financially sustainable for the long term, and that financial
information and advice need to play an important role in achieving
this. We will be able to provide a more comprehensive overview of the
views expressed in our response to the consultation in the new
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>. I repeat

56 concerns review of the operation of the capped-cost system. I am
sure we can all agree unhesitatingly that these reforms need to be
implemented effectively to deliver the outcomes we are striving for.
The capped-cost system will provide peace of mind and protection
against catastrophic costs and will target most help at those with the
greatest need. I am confident that we can further agree that to deliver
these benefits, we need good oversight. Therefore, I am with the noble
Lords opposite in spirit. To that end, we will be reviewing and
assuring both implementation and funding, and have committed to
reviewing the core elements of the capped-costs system within each
five-year period. We will also conduct post-legislative scrutiny, as
the Government have

that reason, I do not believe it would be necessary or desirable to
supplement these arrangements with a further review by additional
oversight bodies, such as an independent ministerial advisory

conducted by the Health Select Committee and cross-government planning
on spending through spending rounds. I am sure that noble Lords
opposite will not be totally satisfied with that, but I hope that they
will be sufficiently reassured by the confirmation I have given that we
will conduct a proper review of the operation and funding of these
reforms through several channels. I hope that they will agree that this

unnecessary.</hs_para>

137 follows the discussion in Committee of amendments proposed by the

alternative amendment, which has also been signed by the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross. We have done this in consultation with
voluntary organisations over the summer, and the wording of Amendment
137 reflects those discussions. To summarise, the amendment would
enable the Secretary of State, after discussion, to make regulations
that did three things: first, allow people to have their preference for
place of death recorded by local health and social care services and
for that preference to be implemented wherever practicable; secondly,
have their care and support needs and those of carers treated as urgent
in assessing needs—and we

the first part of Amendment 137 would lay down a clear marker that
Parliament wants government to move in the direction that
most people want: which is the right to choose to die at home or their

the Government plenty of time to consult on all the detailed
arrangements. It does not require those regulations to be made by any
particular time and it gives the Government a lot of freedom about what
the nature of those regulations might be. We should not miss the chance
of this Bill being before Parliament to move in this area and put this
change on the statute book. I hope the Minister will respond favourably
and be prepared to entertain at Third Reading an amendment of the kind

Patel (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I spoke about this issue when we
debated the gracious Speech, at Second Reading and in Committee, when I
supported the amendment put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and
today I support Amendment 137. Every time we have debated this, the
Minister has been sympathetic to the idea of providing free social care
to those who are dying. When I think about this amendment, I think of a
patient who has just been told of a diagnosis of terminal cancer, that
their life will now last a few months at the most, and that medicine
cannot offer much more than perhaps palliative care or treatment of
some kind. Once the patient and the family have recovered from the
shock, their immediate thoughts are, “Can I cope with my
life—which will now be very short—at home, and what
support can I get?”.</hs_para>

test for free social care can represent a barrier for those who wish to
die at home. It makes it unaffordable for some, but it also means that
the person may be passed between the local authority and the NHS while
the two systems decide who is eligible for care and whether it should
be free or means-tested. Government Amendment 57 is a demonstration of
the Minister’s clear intention. He wishes to see this happen,
and I thank him for moving this amendment, but it does not go far
enough to achieve what I think he, too, wishes to achieve.</hs_para>

amendment is to do that, is it clear enough? The final part of
Amendment 137 relates to free social care at the end of life. Research
suggests that the introduction of free social care at the end of life
has broad-based support. I believe this will help to prevent expensive,
unnecessary hospital admissions, prevent burdensome financial

Finlay of Llandaff (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare all my
interests in this field, which are listed. These amendments are
incredibly important for patients who are dying. The
Government’s amendment is to be welcomed; I can see no problems
with it. It might sound bizarre but I have some slight anxieties over
the wording in two places in Amendment 137. It refers to a preferred
place of death, whereas I would rather see the words, “preferred
place of care”. Many people who are dying know that they want to
spend their last days, weeks or months at home. They want to have
everything done to support them at home, particularly out of hours. We
have debated this for some time within my own specialist teams and
specialist services. We are worried that there could be two unintended
consequences. People who are not yet ready to confront the fact that
they really are dying will be pushed to have that conversation before
they are ready, which would be traumatic. There could also be the
unintended consequence of some kind of target developing and patients
being whipped out of one place of care.</hs_para>

difficulty we see clinically is that when clinical situations change,
patients sometimes change their mind. It is not uncommon for someone
who originally said they wanted to die at home to say, when they really
are dying, that they feel safer where they are and want their family
brought in and as much of a home environment created as possible. It
may be the regulations at ward level, or the way in which they are
interpreted, which are blocking that and need to be addressed. For
example, it does not matter at all if you have a husband on an
all-female ward, but I have occasionally known staff to think that it
does and that it is not appropriate to have a man stay overnight, which
is absolutely appalling.
Staff<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:50:14"></hs_TimeCode> need to

amendment I also tried to get some details of how many patients are
successful under the DS1500 special rules. It is quite difficult,

routinely collect that data. However, it seems as if in the year
2011-12, 11% of all successful claims were for the category of patients
who were deemed to be terminally ill. One of the difficulties when you
are looking at local authority charges for adult social care is that we
cannot predict prognosis. That is always the catch with defining
terminal illness. We are making our best guess, as it says in the
Welfare Reform Act, as to whether someone can “reasonably be
expected” to die within six months, but it is no better than
that. It is a guess. There are patients who outlive their prognosis. I
understand that the DWP does not push for reassessment inside three
years, so there is quite a lengthy period of leeway. The potential
difficulty that I can see unless this is really thought through and
costed is that if somebody turns out not to be dying, what will then
happen? Would they be forced to go through a reassessment? Would that
then be used to try to claim back money from them afterwards? I raise
those questions which would have to be thought through very

Subsection (a) of Amendment 137 is important as a way forward. However,
the difficulties to which the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay, has
referred, are quite important in this connection. Many people in
terminal situations would find a hospice one of the best places to go
if that choice were open to them. Many people, of course, would prefer
to die at home in a family situation. The hospices are normally able to
engender a family atmosphere around death. People I have spoken to in
the hospices have said, “If you have to die, this is the place

Wheeler:</Member></B> My Lords, we welcome another opportunity to
consider the very important issue of how people are cared for at the
end of their life. The 
<?notus-xml column=295?>Joint Committee on the Bill urged progress on this vital matter and
strongly endorsed the case for the introduction at the earliest
opportunity of free social care for terminally ill people. In this
context, the Government’s amendment is very much work in
progress as it makes explicit the local authority’s power to
treat end-of-life care as urgent, in a similar way to how fast-tracked
access to welfare benefits such as the disabled living allowance is
expedited and works in practice under other legislation, which the
noble Baroness, Lady Finlay referred to. The amendment makes it clear
that local authorities have the ability to consider the needs of
terminally ill people as urgent and to meet their needs ahead of
conducting
assessments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000178">We
welcome this provision. Many councils already fast track social care in
this way, and I hope that this amendment will give those councils that
do not the push and impetus that they need to take up this very
self-evident and fundamental requirement. The new clause in the Bill is
rightly welcomed by the Sue Ryder Foundation, Help the Hospices and
Macmillan Cancer Support. However, as Macmillan also points out, the
provision is permissive and does not legally require local authorities
to meet a terminally ill person’s need for care and support
without a needs or financial
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000179">We
recognise that there is still much work to be done on this matter. The
Government are currently undertaking a review and refocus of the
end-of-life strategy and I read in the press over the summer that it
was shortly to be published. It is now six years since the strategy was
introduced under Labour so I would be grateful if the Minister could
update the House on the timetable for
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000180">As we
recognised during the debate in Committee, the results of the seven
adult and one children’s palliative care pilots will be crucial
to considering the move towards the provision of free end-of-life care
as called for by the Joint Committee and as set out in
Amendment 137 in the name of my noble friend Lord Warner,
supported by the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, and the noble Lord,
Lord Patel. We need to understand current patterns and resource use
across health and social care at the end of life, and to have the vital
data—from across care provided by the NHS, social care, and the
voluntary and private sectors—from which the costs of an
integrated end-of-life care system can be properly assessed. The
Minister reassured the House that the pilots are on track, despite the
handover of responsibility to NHS England and concerns that the work
was falling behind. We certainly hope that this is the case as the
pilot findings will be so important to how future services can be
shaped and
delivered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000181">We
acknowledge and share the Government’s concerns about the issues
raised in Amendment 137 that the infrastructure may not be in place to
support people’s preferences about where they wish to die;
commissioners need to be sure that the right services are in place in
the community to support people being looked after in their home. My
own party is currently working on this as part of our policy review and
whole-person care commission, and I know that my noble friend Lord
Warner’s contribution to that work will be much appreciated and
valued. Enabling NHS patients to have the right to die in the place
they regard as home 
<?notus-xml column=296?>or their normal residence can be achieved only if end-of-life care is
fully integrated across the NHS, local councils and hospices, to foster
mechanisms to make it achievable and not simply an
aspiration.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000182">Once
again, the position of carers of people who are terminally ill, as well
as those they are caring for, needs to remain to the fore when we are
looking at this matter. In Committee my noble friend Lady Pitkeathley
cited the Carers UK survey that showed just how much more support is
needed for carers to help them think and plan for the end of life of
the person they are caring for—something that we can and should
be taking action on now. Many carers just do not know how to plan for
the death of a loved one and how to try to look ahead when caring
ends—returning to or taking up work, social contact and managing
financially<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:58:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000183">One
of our bereaved carers I spoke to recently through our local Carer
Support Elmbridge had had a nightmare experience over funding and not
being able to ascertain who was paying for what in the transition from
social care to NHS continuing care before her husband died. This
included two months’ overpayment by social services, which had
to be sorted out after the death, at a time of great anxiety about
family finances. To add to this, an ambulance turned up two months
after her husband’s death to take him to his routine blood test
at the local hospital. Your Lordships can imagine how devastating this
experience was for the carer. Sadly, this is not an isolated case, and
an integrated end-of-life strategy has to make sure that these things
do not
happen.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000184" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000184">Finally,
in Committee I raised the issue of access to palliative care and
end-of-life care for BME groups following the recent and alarming
findings of the Marie Curie Cancer Care and Public Health England
survey and the shockingly low use of these services among black, Asian
and ethnic minority groups. The report identified major problems
involving lack of knowledge about services, misunderstanding, mistrust
and a lack of cultural sensitivity on the part of providers. In his
August letter to noble Lords, the Minister referred to the work that
NHS England is undertaking on this in conjunction with palliative care
pilots. Will the Government be responding specifically to the Public
Health England report, or is it part of the strategy review and
refocus? Will the Minister set out for the House the
Government’s outline timetable for the review and
publication consultation, the timing of the publication of the
pilot’s results, as requested by my noble friend Lord Warner,
and the introduction of the new funding system for palliative care as

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for
expressing their views on this important subject so eloquently. As I
said in Committee, I support the intentions behind the amendment tabled
by the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Patel. In looking at the
amendment, the first essential question is whether we need to take
legal powers in this Bill to fulfil those
objectives.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000186" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000186">I
want to assure noble Lords that we already have the necessary legal
powers to implement both choice in end-of-life care and a new
palliative care funding 
<?notus-xml column=297?>system. In relation to choice, there is already a power in Section 6E of
the National Health Service Act 2006 to make regulations, or standing
rules, to require NHS England and clinical commissioning groups to make
arrangements for patient choice in respect of specified treatments or
services. We would use these powers to implement a choice offer in
end-of-life
care.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000187" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000187">As
noble Lords know, making the changes to the system required to offer
real choice, which includes enhancements in community palliative care
services, will not be straightforward. Not least of the issues is the
cost of making these changes. I agree with noble Lords that there is
the potential for savings to be made in moving these services out of
hospitals and into the community. However, one of the most
comprehensive studies in this area, the Cochrane review found that
while there were small but significant improvements from
community-based palliative care, the evidence for its
cost-effectiveness was
inconclusive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000188" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000188">We
must also guard against the danger of making changes too quickly, and I
am thinking of a particular danger. It would be in no one’s
interests if the upfront investment required to enhance community
services came at the expense of existing services. That is why the
Department of Health and NHS England will be working together, and with
organisations from across the end-of-life and palliative care sector,
on a review of the timescale for introducing this choice offer at a
time that will be right for patients and for those in the NHS working
in this vital area. We have to ensure that when a choice offer is
introduced, it will be a real choice backed by a system that is able to
deliver it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000189" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000189">On
palliative care funding, as I stated earlier, the Government’s

responded to that by establishing eight palliative care funding pilots,
involving more than 80 organisations. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, asked
me whether those pilots were essentially big enough to produce
meaningful results. The palliative care pilots cover 80 organisations
in those eight areas and we are confident that they will give us
sufficient evidence to design a new palliative care funding system. We
need to be absolutely sure that the evidence being gathered by the
pilots, which are running for two years, until 2014, is thoroughly
analysed and a complete picture is available to both the department and
NHS England before the details of the new funding system are finalised.
To answer the noble Lord, Lord Patel, yes, we are acutely aware of the
benefits of introducing a new system in this important
area.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="1310145000191" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000191">The
noble Baroness, Lady Wheeler, asked about the pilots. The Public Health
England review that is taking place welcomed the work that is going on.
NHS England is also looking at this, in conjunction with its review of
the end-of-life strategy. As regards the timetable for that, NHS
England is working to publish early in the new year. Supported by the
data from the pilots, we aim to have a new funding system in place by
2015, 
<?notus-xml column=298?>a year sooner than the review proposed. Similar to any new policies on
choice in end-of-life care, this can also be introduced through
secondary legislation. In this case, Clause 14(6) of the Bill provides
powers to make regulations that prohibit local authorities from making
charges in specific

the reasons why advice is absolutely crucial in the deferred payments
scheme is that this is one of the least understood and least explored
facets of the Bill. I will come on to one or two aspects of that. In a
way, it makes it hard to make the case for the importance of advice,
because so many things on which advice will be needed have not yet seen
the light of day. In Committee I referred to some of the unresolved
issues that have been raised by Partnership, the Equity Release Council
and others. They will emerge, and this will make it clearer why advice
is needed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000200" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000200">I
will first put the issue in the following context, to show how
unexplored it is. If the noble Earl, Lord Howe, will forgive me, I will
correct something that he said in Committee. He said that 40,000 people
each year have to sell their house to pay for care. I think that the
noble Earl mis-spoke and that he meant to say, “up to
40,000”. That is the explanation that has 
<?notus-xml column=300?>come to me of what he said. I make no complaint; it is hard when
one’s words are examined in such terrible
detail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000201" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000201">I have
spent a surprising—perhaps wasted—amount of my time
trying to trace the figure that 40,000 people each year are forced to
sell their home to pay for care. I have been doing it ever since I sat
on the royal commission 15 years ago. When we were sitting on the royal
commission, we eventually found a very dodgy piece of research, now
more than 20 years old, which kind of concluded that the number might
be about 40,000. Of course, what happened was not that the piece of
research was examined and found to be accurate but that the figure got
into the <I>Daily Mail</I> cuttings library, so that every time that
paper campaigned against people having to sell their house to pay for
care—I praise it for this—the figure was repeated, until
it became accepted throughout the world as the number
involved.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000202" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000202">Having
spent all these years studying the subject, I am very tempted to go
into greater detail, but I do not think that the House would thank me
for it. However, I refer any noble Lord who might be interested to the
Full Fact website. It is a fact-checking organisation, of which I am a
director, which goes into the matter in minute but very clear detail,
and points out that the Government’s claim is based on
exploratory research that is almost 20 years out of
date.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000203" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000203">More
importantly, the 40,000 figure is used as if it were the number of
people who are forced to sell their house. “Forced” is a
funny word in this context. For most people who go into a home, selling
their house is the sensible thing to do to fund the cost of care. You
do not want to leave the house empty; that benefits nobody. It does not
provide housing for anybody; the house starts to crumble and is worth
less to you and your family, so you had best sell it and get something
that is more suitable. However, the deferred payment scheme is so
important because there are people for whom that is not true. For
example, some people want their families to live in their house and
therefore cannot get cash for it. That is why we have a deferred
payment scheme. “Forced” suggests that this is something
dreadful in all cases, when in fact it is dreadful in some cases. It is
absolutely right, as I said before, that we have such a scheme for some
cases but not for all
cases.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310145000204" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0001.htm#1310145000204">I now
come to another severe complication, and I am afraid that I will have
to resort to the vernacular in order to make clear to the House what
has happened. The original scheme put forward by Dilnot has had its
balls cut off by the Government in the consultation document. That is
not too strong a way of putting it, and I will explain why. Yes, every
council will offer a scheme, but there is now a huge restriction that
will mean that very few people will take advantage of the deferred
payment scheme. It would not in any case have been 40,000, but now I
think that it will be nearly nil. Why is that? The
consultation paper makes it clear, in paragraph 150 on page 44, that
you are eligible for a deferred payment loan only if your other assets
in total come to less than £23,250. If you have more than that,
you have to spend down until you have £23,250 left in the bank
or wherever it is, and then you can consider a deferred payment scheme.
However, 
<?notus-xml column=301?>most people who have reasonably valuable houses, who are the people most
likely to want to adopt this measure, will have far more than
£23,250 worth of other assets. Most of them will not feel the
least bit happy if they have to spend down until they have only
£23,250 left in the bank before they can get any help from the
deferred payment scheme. That hardly pays for a daily delivery of the
<I>Racing Post</I> for the rest of their lives, their nightly gin and
tonic or more important things such as the literature they want to read
or all the things that make their life fuller. For those people, a

think about the timing of this measure. In theory, people could let
their money run down to the £23,250 sum and then apply for a
deferred payment scheme, but what is going to happen to the house in
the mean time? They must either let it or leave it empty. Something has
to happen with it. Usually, people make decisions about funding when
they go into a care home. That is the moment when a deferred payment
scheme has to come into effect if it is to be effective. However, the
answer given to most people with funds of £23,250 will be,

am a veteran of the long struggles that have taken place on this issue,

but, as I say, this is now a castrated deferred payment system with a
brutal limitation imposed by the consultation document, which was
nowhere heralded or mentioned when the scheme was drawn up. That is
very sad. Indeed, it is more than very sad; it will cause fury because
people have read in their newspapers that a deferred payment scheme
means they will not have to sell their house. However, they will then

thing that might help a little when people reach the stage when they
need to think about deferred payments and that sort of thing is if they

alternatives to the deferred payment scheme. For example, if you take
out a deferred payment scheme, an alternative would be to let your
house and use the money you receive in rent to pay for your care. A
financial adviser will point to that. That 
<?notus-xml column=302?>alternative has various advantages and disadvantages: for example, you
avoid paying interest on the money but you have to pay tax on the

try to dispose of a red herring that gets thrown in the way of this
subject, I am not saying in the amendment that people should be forced
to take financial advice. You cannot force people to do so. If it is
forced advice, they will not take it seriously and it will not work.
However, the council can point people in the direction of financial
advice—not to an individual financial adviser because councils
do not know which of them offers good advice—but to somebody who
is appropriately qualified to give people the advice they need. The
consultation paper pays lip service to this in paragraphs 171 to 174.
However, we need more than lips; we need teeth if people are to get the
advice they need to navigate around this very complicated aspect of the

other assets are less than the £23,250 limit. Can the noble Earl
confirm that figure? If so, can he estimate for the House how many
people he thinks are likely to want to use the scheme? The 40,000

again. There is no doubt whatever that there are worries about whether
local authorities really have the capacity to implement the legislation
as noble Lords require. Instead of these 152 local
authorities having all to develop their own deferred payment schemes,
surely there is a persuasive case for a model scheme to be drawn up

Government have given the impression in various interviews—I
have gone head to head with government spokesmen about this on a number
of programmes—that they were going to support an extended
deferred payment scheme and that it would be pretty much similar across
the country. If you had a deferred payment scheme in Cumberland, it
would look remarkably like a deferred payment scheme in Cornwall. It
seems that we are getting into a position where none of this will be
the case. It is pretty rough on the public if the Government and their
spokesmen are giving the impression that they are implementing the
Dilnot recommendations on deferred payment schemes when they are
palpably not doing so under the present set of proposals as I

two go hand in hand. It is no good having a model scheme if it is a
model scheme for a handful of cases in different parts of the country.
We need a model scheme that is actually available so that people who
want to cope with the issue of how they fund their care can access a
deferred payment scheme. It is always a risk when you are on a
committee such as the Dilnot committee that, quietly and unobtrusively,
the bureaucracies will nibble away at well intentioned recommendations.

person has strikes me as rather unnecessary. So far as a model scheme
is concerned, I would have thought that there is a lot to be said for
having a form of document which is universal. There would of course be
the possibility of different particular provisions relating to
particular cases, but the central core of a deferred payment agreement

Barker:</Member></B> My Lords, I rise only to ask a question. I agree
with the noble Lords, Lord Warner and Lord Lipsey, that a deferred
payment scheme was an important selling point for the Dilnot report.
Even though very few local authorities are running such schemes at the
moment, it is an important and live issue in the minds of older people
and their families; it is one that they dwell on quite a lot. I want to
ask the keeper of the Dilnot tablets—who is not a character from
Harry Potter—whether the commission gave any consideration to
setting a figure as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey. Did it
have a level of assets in mind that people should be able to

Lord Hunt, talks about a scheme, is it a model that would apply to
individuals or is it really a model that would apply to local
authorities and their ability to carry the costs of the Dilnot scheme
in their area for a defined period of time? I can see what the noble
Lord, Lord Hunt, is saying in terms of having a model, but I am
slightly confused about it. Perhaps when the Minister comes to reply,
in telling us about the Government’s thinking on all of this, he
might address what to me appears to be the key underlying
factor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:31:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, perhaps I may deal first with the initial
point raised by the noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, about the figure that I
quoted in Committee. He asked whether I had in fact meant to say that
up to 40,000 people might have to sell their homes every year. The
answer is that I should have said “up to 40,000”. I am
afraid that there is a conscious element of vagueness in the figure
because there is no one comprehensive source to provide information
about what the precise figure actually is. We have arrived at a figure
of up to 40,000 as the best estimate. I hope and believe that over the
summer my officials provided the noble Lord with a breakdown on how we
reached that figure and that he has found the information useful. The
point of quoting the figure is that we believe that it is around the
number of people who could benefit from the arrangements we are
discussing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:33:20"></hs_TimeCode>. I
apologise if I misled the Committee and the House in stating a figure
that sounded precise when I should have been a little more
circumspect.</hs_para>

by the noble Lord was about the deferred payment scheme and his
perception that the Government have effectively emasculated it. I do
not share that perception. There will be some circumstances in which
local authorities must offer a deferred payment, and that is when the
Bill specifies that the local authority would be under a duty to offer
a deferred payment. We are consulting on the eligibility criteria for
when people must be offered a deferred payment, which is where the
figure of 23,250 is used. The Bill has an additional power for local
authorities to offer deferred payments more widely, and we are seeking
views on this through the consultation. My noble and learned friend
Lord Mackay asked why we need limits at all. It is our policy intent
that deferred payments will be available more widely and consistently
than they currently are, which I think is what the Dilnot commission
intended us to do. We need to ensure,

Warner:</Member></B> Perhaps I may correct the noble Earl. We actually
referred to a universal and standard scheme. We assumed that such a
scheme would be wider, but we were looking for a standard scheme that
would make this widely available. That is the part which is missing
from the Government’s
reassurances<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:35:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Howe:</Member></B> I shall come on to the standard scheme
proposal in a moment. We need to ensure that this
arrangement is rolled out in a way that is financially sustainable for
the local authority in each case. We will be supporting the
implementation of the 
<?notus-xml column=306?>capped costs system and an extension of deferred payments with
£335 million, which should enable this to
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:35:39"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendments themselves. I hope that the House will forgive me if I do
not rehearse at length the same points that I made about financial
advice last week, but I should like to take a moment to reassure the
noble Lord, Lord Lipsey, on the specifics of his proposal. It is
imperative that everyone has access to sound, reliable information and
advice while making decisions about their care to ensure that any
option they choose makes good financial sense for them and is
sustainable in the long term. It is clear that local authorities have a
central role to play in ensuring that their local populations are aware
of the range of information and advice, both regulated and
non-regulated, that is available to them and that they know how to
access it. Last Wednesday, your Lordships accepted my Amendments 16 and
17 which clarify this. The noble Lord’s amendment would
underscore the need to make sure that everyone who decides to take out
a deferred payment agreement reaches that decision in a considered and
informed manner. I agree that that should be the case. All too often,
people do not plan ahead for the possibility of needing care and so can
find themselves having to make important and lasting financial
decisions in a moment of
crisis<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:37:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

agreements can be used to reduce some of this urgency and ought to be
accessible to ensure that they provide the peace of mind that they are
intended to. For this reason I would hesitate to make the process
through which a person can access a deferred payment too onerous. We
are currently consulting on the information and advice a person should
receive before taking out a deferred payment agreement. We will listen
carefully to what is said and we will use this to inform the approach
that should be taken. I have already given the noble Lord my
undertaking to discuss further what remaining differences we have about
financial advice, if any, and I hope that those discussions will allow
us to explain in more detail our policy intentions and what our own
government amendments in this area aim to achieve. I hope that the
noble Lord will agree that we are essentially of the same view about
this and that he will be content to discuss the matter with me further
outside the Chamber. That being so, I hope that he is sufficiently
reassured today to withdraw his
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and the noble Baroness, Lady
Wheeler. We are in concordance with them that a model deferred payment
agreement would help local authorities and that is why we already have
one in place for the schemes that are currently operating. What we
intend to do now is build on and improve the current model. In doing
that, we will work in partnership with local authorities to learn from
the well established schemes, some of which have a decade of
experience. While the case for a model scheme is clear, I think it
would be wrong to mandate national systems and structures for deferred
payment agreements. It is important that we strike the right balance
between local flexibility and national consistency. Systems and
structures must be developed in partnership with local government and 
<?notus-xml column=307?>allow for and, indeed, encourage local efficiencies to flourish. As
noble Lords may know, we have established with the Local Government
Association and the Association of Directors of Adult Social Services
the joint implementation and programme board to support the
implementation of these reforms more generally and, through this, we
will support local authorities to deliver the universal scheme from
April 2015. This work will include our commitment to providing a model
deferred payment scheme, based on the current model, as well as
statutory guidance to support local authorities in exercising these
functions.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000011">The
statutory guidance on deferred payments, in particular, will have a
clear legal status. Local authorities must act under this guidance.
This means that they must consider and should follow it, unless they
have a justifiable reason not to do so. This would seem to be the same
status as is envisaged by noble Lords in their amendment. I hope
therefore the noble Lord feels able to withdraw his amendment in light
of the reassurance I have given on supporting local authorities to
deliver the universal deferred payment scheme and the model agreement
in
particular.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000012">My
noble friend Lady Barker asked whether the scheme was a model for how
local authorities manage the burden on themselves. This is not designed
to be a scheme that makes a profit for local authorities. The interest
rate is likely to be set at a rate which recognises local authority
borrowing rates, and so ensures that the scheme is
cost-neutral.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000013"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Lipsey" PimsId="1516" UID="13101414000546" xid="1316" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000546">Lord
Lipsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reply. On
the first two of the three legs of his argument, I am happy to support
what he said. Through helpful discussions over the summer, I understood
that he had meant to say “up to 40,000.” I make no
criticism of him for misleading the House. Any misleading he did is on
a tiny scale compared with the misleading that has taken place with the
whole country through these repeated cuttings file references. History
will now have on record in this debate the truth about these numbers.
That is a form of progress, if not legislative
progress.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000014">Secondly,
I should like to thank the noble Earl for what he said about advice. We
are near to having another meeting before Third Reading on advice. We
are all after the same things on advice with the same constraints. We
have not quite cracked it yet, but I hope when the House comes back on
Third Reading to the matter of advice, we shall do so, either in the
form of an amendment, or of a shared understanding on where we are
going which might take the form of regulation or guidance. On those two
things, I agree with the
Minister.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000015">However
the Minister did not confront my most important point. Let us be
absolutely clear. This Bill does not provide a universal deferred
payments scheme. It provides a deferred payments scheme only for people
who have less than £23,250 in assets. There is no universal
deferred payments scheme. Further, this has been done in a back-door
manner which disgraces the Government. It was not in Dilnot. We have
heard decisive testimony on that from my noble friend Lord Warner. It
was not in the Government’s announcement of their response to
Dilnot. It was not in the Second 
<?notus-xml column=308?>Reading speeches. It came out between stages of the Bill in this
consultation document. The noble Earl suggested that there would be
people with more than £23,250 who could benefit from deferred
payments so we did not have to worry. The relevant bit from paragraph
154 of the consultation document

friend’s concern about what we have heard tonight. From what the
noble Earl said, in essence the mandated scheme will be a scheme in
which the person’s assets will have to come down below
£23,250 before a deferred payment arrangement must begin. The
noble Earl went on to say that he wanted to encourage local authorities
to use a power more widely. That local authority power is
discretionary. The great fear must be that the mandatory scheme will in
essence turn out to be the scheme that all local authorities will
adopt. That is why I link that concern to Amendment 63 for a model
scheme. In the circumstances it is absolutely 
<?notus-xml column=309?>essential. A mandated model scheme does not guarantee a universal
scheme, but at least sets the framework for one. The House should
consider it very carefully. I beg to

Lords will know from my Private Member’s Bill, the Social Care
Portability Bill, as well as my contributions to debates on this Bill,
the depth of my concern about continuity of care when an older or
disabled person moves to another local authority. It is a basic human
right to move freely within one’s country, whether to pursue
education or employment opportunities, to improve one’s family
life or to seek personal support. The Government have said on several
occasions that my Private Member’s Bill has informed the
provisions of this Bill. It is true and I am grateful to have helped; I
must say that I am also a bit flattered. We have collaborated well and
I firmly believe that workable continuity of care is in
sight.</hs_para>

Throughout the passage of this Bill, my two main areas of concern have
been the need for a reference to outcomes in the continuity provisions
and the risk of a gap in provision of care and support. We have made
good progress on the second of these concerns since Committee. I am
heartened by

equivalence of outcomes. This goes to the heart of what continuity of
care is about. The underlying purpose is to enable the person who moves
to do the same kinds of things in their day-to-day life as they

different means, but that is the aim. Certainly there are references
linking plans to outcomes elsewhere in the Bill, and that is very
welcome. However, signalling the intention in Clause 37 would send a

addresses safe and seamless transition from one authority to another.
The Bill says that if the second authority fails to deliver a new care
package by the day of the move, it has to meet the 
<?notus-xml column=313?>needs that the first authority has been meeting until it has put the new
arrangements in place. This is a temporary measure to ensure there is

have been concerned that, just as the new care package may not be ready
in time, as Clause 38(1) acknowledges, there may also be a delay in the
temporary measures, which would mean a risky gap in care and support.
My amendment proposes that, in those circumstances, the first authority
would have to continue to provide care until the new arrangements were
in place. I remain of the view that this would provide the strongest
guarantee of
continuity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000026" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000026">The
Government, however, have proposed instead a new amendment,
Amendment 63A, to improve co-ordination between the person moving and
the two local authorities—in effect acknowledging the importance
of a dialogue between all three parties. Certainly, both local
authorities working together to prepare for the person’s move is
a good template for success. The amendment will require the first
authority to contact the second authority and maintain this
relationship until the person moves. It will also require the first
authority to keep the person involved so that they are fully aware of
the arrangements in advance of their move. While this is not the
solution I favour, I recognise that it will help to strengthen the
process by bolstering the degree of collaboration and coordination
between the authorities. That would go a long way towards reducing the
risk of an interruption in care and support. It would also reassure and

smooth transition during any temporary arrangements, when the

Care and support for many older people and for disabled people underpin
and enable the enjoyment of those rights. They make possible a decent
life of dignity; they make possible the ability to enjoy family life,
for example. Ensuring that people can continue to pursue the life that
they have and that they want, with no lessening of support when they
move, is crucial. I therefore warmly support my noble friend’s
amendment on equivalence of outcomes. When considering the process for
people moving from one local authority to another, we must consider

introduce a duty on local authorities to ensure that where a person is
receiving care and support they can move home to another local
authority area, confident that they will have services in place on the
day of the move. The noble Baroness, Lady Campbell, has been a leading
advocate in this area for some time, and I acknowledge that her Private

Baroness’s Amendment 63ZA looks to ensure that when the second
authority is carrying out the assessment of the adult moving and, where
appropriate, their carer, it meets the outcomes that
they want to achieve. I reassure her that the provisions on
assessment for the person needing care and their
carer apply to when a person is being assessed for continuity of care.
Assessments must look at achieving the outcomes that the person or
carer want to achieve, and Clause 37(8) confirms that. I also give an
assurance that we will emphasise this in the statutory

that the first authority is responsible for arranging services on the
day of the move. I say immediately that I sympathise with the sentiment
of the noble Baroness’s argument; neither of us wants a gap
during which a person is left without services. However, our view is
that the second authority is best placed to maintain continuity of
care. Our reasoning is that the person will now be living in the area
of the second authority and, as for anyone who has eligible care and
support needs, the second authority has a duty to meet those needs. The
second authority will also know its local market and will be far better
placed to put in place arrangements that support the person and

would be difficult for the first authority to make such arrangements,
particularly where the person moves a long distance away. In practice,
if the first authority is responsible for making arrangements it would
have to contact the second authority to discuss the local market, which
raises the question of why the second authority is not responsible for
putting in place services in the first
instance.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101414000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000042">For
the reasons that I have explained, I believe that the second authority
must be the one responsible for delivering services on the day of the
move. However, in light of the concerns raised by the noble Baroness
during Committee, I have looked again at the provisions in the Bill. My
Amendment 63A will require the first authority to contact the second
authority and maintain this relationship so that it is aware of where
the second authority is with putting services in place. It will also
require the first authority to keep the person involved with
discussions about their services and informed of progress for putting
these in place. In other words, the amendment will put the person at
the centre of the process. Both ADASS and the Local Government

provisions in the Bill reflect the outcome of solid collaborative work

purpose of the amendments on cross-border placements is threefold.
First, they ensure that the established principle that the placing
authority retains responsibility for the care of those individuals
placed cross-border, is not interrupted should the individual receiving
care require a period in hospital or other healthcare accommodation.
Secondly, they enable regulations to provide for the cross-border
placements provisions to apply to individuals who receive direct
payments. Thirdly, they provide a regulation-making power that would
allow our cross-border provisions to apply to individuals placed in a
setting other than a traditional care home—for example,
supported living

Amendment 76 seeks to ensure that a clear process is in place by which
adults and carers can challenge decisions that have been made about
their care by local authorities, and to ensure that they are made aware
of their right to challenge such decisions. I am grateful to
<I>Which?</I><I> </I>for supplying me with background information on

support system, there are many decisions that local authorities will
take that will affect an adult’s or a carer’s access to
services and what they will be required to pay towards care. These
decisions can fundamentally affect families’ quality of life and
financial circumstances, as we have learnt. It is right 
<?notus-xml column=321?>that these decisions are subject to proper scrutiny in cases where
families feel that they have been made unfairly, and that those
receiving care and their carers are aware of their right to challenge
decisions.</hs_para>

evidence that, in a lot of decisions made by local authorities about
care, there is a certain amount of subjectivity and untransparent
variation in the way they are made, both between and within local
authorities. This includes decisions over eligibility, financial
assessments, charging, local authority rates, top-up fees, levels of
personal budgets and independent personal budgets. Under the new
system, many more people will come into contact with and be assessed by
their local authority, and a greater light is going to be shone on
these decisions, as we debated earlier today. Currently the Bill does
not contain any reference to appealing these decisions.</hs_para>

been highlighted, and in Committee amendments to establish a care and
support tribunal were tabled. The Government’s response was to
say that they recognised the need to review the current complaints
arrangement, and they have included it in their consultation on funding
reform, including the option of a tribunal. They pointed out that there
are existing regulations under separate legislation about how local
authorities handle complaints in relation to social care. However,
these regulations relate to any complaint that a local authority
receives about a care matter—for example, about the quality of
care received by a provider acting on behalf of the local
authority—but they do not include an independent review element.
They are not specifically designed to deal with issues of eligibility,
entitlements and payments where the challenge may be about the overall
decision reached, rather than the process followed. Therefore, I
believe that the mechanism for appealing these decisions should also be
included in the Bill.</hs_para>

designed to allow the Government flexibility over the exact format of
the appeals procedure, which can follow in regulations, while ensuring
that the principle is enshrined in the Bill. It also, rather
importantly, requires local authorities to make individuals aware of
their right to appeal a decision that has been made. Too often, care
recipients feel done to rather than done with, as we know. They do not
understand the basis on which decisions have been made, and they feel
very powerless regarding challenging them. Awareness of an existing
higher-level redress mechanism, such as the Local Government Ombudsman,
is very low. People just do not know about it or how to approach that
office. Making users aware of their right to appeal is therefore a key
part of ensuring a redress system that works effectively.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101414000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101414000059">Currently, people have
limited access to an independent review of decisions regarding
eligibility for continuing care. We know this is a huge problem for
many people. Amendment 124 would provide access to an independent
review process. I am grateful to the Alzheimer’s Society and the
Care and Support Alliance for providing me with some background to this
issue. NHS continuing care is a package of care arranged and funded by
the NHS free of charge to the person receiving care. The 
<?notus-xml column=322?>decision about eligibility rests not on the person’s condition
but on whether the need for care is primarily due
to health needs. However, as care provided by the NHS is free but care
provided by social services is means-tested, the outcome of any
decision can have a significant financial consequence for people who
self-fund their care. There are also significant financial consequences
to the NHS if a person is eligible. These consequences leave NHS
continuing care fraught with dispute, and there is little impetus for
the NHS to make a decision quickly, given the budgetary implications.
Many people give up or face another long wait to appeal a refusal.
While there are just over 57,000 people in receipt of continuing care
in England, it is unknown how many people eligible in law have failed
in their attempts to be assessed properly for it. At both assessment
and appeal stages, various tiers of the NHS remain—I have
mentioned this before—both judge and jury on eligibility, and it
is only once these stages have been exhausted that the Parliamentary
and Health Service Ombudsman can be involved as a truly independent
arbiter. It is unacceptable for so many people with extensive health
needs, some nearing the end of their lives, to have to deal with a
system that is riven with bureaucracy, delay and dispute. People
receiving local authority care have some hope that a council will
support their case to move on to NHS-funded care, spurred on by its own
financial interest for them to do so, but for self-funders there is no
such hope. Some may seek out a solicitor, but many, we know, just give
up.</hs_para>

which I was privileged to be a member felt that the Care Bill provides
an opportunity to explore the Government’s intentions towards a
much more effective system of complaint, appeal and redress for social
care and NHS continuing care. This amendment is to probe the Government
further on how they will address the lack of a truly independent
arbiter early in the NHS continuing care process. I remain convinced
that an initial refusal to award NHS continuing care at assessment
should lead directly to an independent review body or

authorities decide whether an elderly or disabled person should
continue to receive care support. Many will lose that support as a
result of cuts to local authority budgets. The impact of losing care
support—an entire care package in some cases—can be
catastrophic, according to Leonard Cheshire Disability and others
directly in touch with disabled or elderly people. Many years ago, I
worked with these people, and I find the very idea that a care package
could simply be removed very frightening, even as an onlooker, let
alone as somebody experiencing such a thing. People become trapped in
their homes, unable to work and unable to get out. They become
depressed and, in some cases, suicidal—and not surprisingly in
my view. There can also be risks to people’s health. As they try
to undertake tasks for which they are not well suited or which they are
unable to perform on their own, they fall. Has anyone estimated the
likely cost to the health service of increased falls, accidents and
problems of this kind? What is the Government’s view of the
economic costs to the country if family carers have to give up work in
order to step into the breach when the state withdraws? The problem is
that the local authority may save money but the DWP and the Treasury
are likely to pick up the tab. I am not quite sure what the Minister in
the other place would think about that.</hs_para>

terribly important that an appeal or review process is not only
user-friendly and accessible but really is independent of the people
making decisions about the person’s care. Can the Minister
honestly say that care decisions will in future not vary across the
country? Can he say that decisions will be made without error and
always be based on the law? I do not think so. In preparing this

Warner:</Member></B> My Lords, I support these amendments—not
necessarily the specific wording but the principles behind them. I
remind the House of a real difference between many of the appeals under
the new framework for adult care and support and what has gone before.
We are now talking about a set of arrangements with considerable
financial implications for people and their families. In the social
security system we set up a tribunal system to arbitrate, which has
worked pretty well for a long time. Many of these issues are more akin
to the social security system than to complaints about process. There
will be complaints about process but many of the things covered in
these amendments are about a failure to get a resource from the public
purse to which people think they are entitled and have evidence that
they are. This is much more akin to the arrangements in the social
security system for people who have their claims rejected. It is much
nearer to that than complaints about poor processes of work by a public
body. The Government should think long and hard about this issue
because they are in grave danger of ending up with the whole system
being overwhelmed by the number of complaints. Without a convincing
system for resolving appeals in the framework of the Care
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:43:42"></hs_TimeCode> we are
heading down a path where judicial review will start to feature quite
strongly.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000009">I
remind the noble Earl of some of the other issues where there could be
appeals. The Joint Committee looked at some of the friction points
where there was scope for dispute. There is a raft of areas for dispute
over assessment of carers and service users and a whole range of areas
for dispute about ability and whether you are going to be charged or
not. After the previous debate on deferred payment I can think of
another fruitful area for complaints—an inability to get on to
some kind of deferred payment scheme. Another area, important to
patients and service users, is setting the price for contracts to
providers. Clearly, the price-setting mechanism may be disputed between
the providers of services who may claim that the price offered by the
commissioning agent will be bad for service users and patients. I am
not suggesting that these could all come together under one process,
but we want more convincing architecture in this Bill to give
confidence that there is a sensible way of resolving and arbitrating
areas for dispute and for the service user and their carers to secure
redress without going through an excessively complicated
process.</hs_para> <hs_time UID="13101420000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000127">6.45

124 deals with the knotty problem of the boundary between health and

It was extremely difficult to be sure that you would have consistency
of assessment in different parts of the country. So much seemed to
depend on individual professionals’ judgment about dependency in
a very complicated set of arrangements. It is interesting that the Law

appropriate system of redress for disputed decisions. Many people do
not really understand social care systems and why decisions are taken
and they feel powerless, often at a time when they are facing enormous
challenges and may fear that complaining is going to lead to even more
negative changes to their support. It seems to be a matter of justice

Mackay of Clashfern:</Member></B> My Lords, I support these amendments
requiring a system of adjudication able to deal with the whole raft of
matters dealt with under the Care Bill, including the borderline with
continuing healthcare. The local authorities—152 or something of
that sort—will administer the care system. It is quite easy to
see that the same problems may arise in different local authority
areas. Having a respected system for dealing with these matters would
simplify a good deal of this area. I therefore strongly urge the
Government to have in place a system which would provide reasonably
rapid adjudication of all these issues. The social security
commissioners provide a kind of example. One possible solution would be
to extend the jurisdiction of the social security commissioners to
include this area. Social security arrangements are certainly different
from the care arrangements, but there may be sufficient similarity to
make that possible. Something along the lines of the social security
commissioners would be necessary for dealing with this and bringing
into effect a system which local authorities right across the country
would respect when one local authority’s decision was dealt with

important and complex duties on local authorities, will have a
substantial impact on the lives of older and disabled people without
providing appropriate routes for appeal against unjust or factually
inaccurate decisions. It says that there is a compelling case for the

various ways in which local authorities can impact on individuals who
have come within the care system—support eligibility criteria,
financial assessment, operation of the cap, charges, personal budgets

appeal against decisions of the local authority. In Committee, the
noble Earl relied first on the current complaints system of local
authorities and, secondly, he went on to point out that if a
complainant was not satisfied with the response from the local

a complaints system is not really what noble Lords are calling for.
Anyone who has seen responses from local authorities to complaints will
know that they tend to find in favour of themselves and rarely reopen a
question of substance. Noble Lords want an opportunity for a person
concerned to put their case and for that case to be considered by a
group of people who may be said to be independent of the local
authority. Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and my noble
friend Lord Warner, I am keen on the tribunal approach which deals with
social security cases; I have witnessed these cases. Although the noble
Earl felt in Committee that these would be expensive, I believe that it
is a cost-effective way of allowing people to put their case and for
that matter to be decided. I am sure that in the long term it will be
more expensive if there is no proper decision. I suspect that we will

briefly run through the current, essentially complaints-based,
arrangements. These arrangements were reformed via the 2009
regulations, which require local authorities to publish arrangements
for the consideration and timely handling of complaints. Local
authorities have flexibility in developing their own procedures, which
may of course result in varying user experiences. If, having raised a
complaint with a local authority, a person is not satisfied with the
response, they can refer the complaint to the Local Government
Ombudsman. The ombudsman is independent of the local authority. It can
investigate whether the decision-making process has been conducted
appropriately and make a recommendation to the local

I believe that we are doing so. Through the consultation we have heard

Decisions as to whether someone is eligible for NHS continuing
healthcare are, of course, taken by the relevant NHS body. We have a
well established process for the review of such decisions, which is
well understood by the NHS and local authorities. It is set out in the

first step is for an individual to request a review of an eligibility
decision; this would be undertaken by the relevant body itself, usually
the clinical commissioning group. In the second step, NHS England
arranges for an independent review panel to review the process
undertaken and the decision reached by the relevant body. The panel
will have an independent chair and will include NHS and local authority
representation—not, incidentally, the bodies responsible for the
original decision. The relevant body should accept and action the

noble Baronesses who have supported these amendments. I am encouraged
that the issue is being taken so seriously by the noble Earl. In a way
it is a shame that the timing of the consultation is as it is, and that
we will not get it through until December. I have always been worried
about certain aspects of 
<?notus-xml column=330?>NHS complaints procedures, when the body that looks at those procedures
is the NHS itself. I have felt for many years that that is unfortunate.
I am very pleased that the Minister has agreed to look again seriously
at all this. We need to protect these extremely vulnerable people from
not getting the best level of service that they can because of a
decision that could be to the detriment of their care, which could
leave them feeling that their situation is hopeless and that there is
nothing they can do.</hs_para>

down. This amendment and the others are about elder abuse. I have been
involved in the issue of elder abuse for very many years—it is
something that I am very familiar with. It is an issue which we have
not, as yet, focused on nearly enough in this country. We have recently
learnt, from data from the Health &amp; Social Care Information Centre
and Age UK, that there has been a “disturbing” rise in
the number of reports of possible abuse of vulnerable elderly people in
England. Unfortunately, the majority of this abuse is, as we know, by
people who are close to the person—that is, family, carers and
friends living in the same household, because the majority of abuse
happens in people’s
homes.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000040">We have
seen a 4% rise in the number of cases of alleged abuse referred for
investigation in the past year. I urge the Government to do more to
protect vulnerable adults. It is a serious issue and, in my view, the
danger might unwittingly be increased as a result of some of the
positive things that we are doing; for example, personal care planning,
which gives people the opportunity to give money to relatives and to
use the money for care which has not been planned in the way it used to
be. There are many more doors for abuse opening than there used to be,
so we have to prevent abuse even more effectively than we did in the
past.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000041">In

is going to argue about that, but we must put this principle into
practice and seek out abuse rather than passively wait for victims to
appear. Sadly, some of those victims will never appear. We know why:
people are not going to report their son or daughter who is hitting
them, being violent or stealing their money
because this might make them appear a bad mother or bring the family
into disrepute. There are all sorts of reasons why very few people

most common types of abuse reported. In 6% of cases the abuser was the
older person’s partner; in 16% it was another family member; and
in 37% it was a social care worker. Three-fifths of the referrals were

therefore, for a power of access for confidential interview, but to
occur only where the reasonable suspicion of a social worker or another

interest, of course, is with people with a learning disability and what
is increasingly referred to as mate crime. This
is where someone has befriended a person with a learning disability and
is exploiting or abusing them in some way. In some cases this person
may be living with them and, for example, concerns may have been raised
by neighbours that the person may be being abused. Currently, the local
authority would be unable to speak to the adult with a learning
disability to establish if they are all right as the other person, the
third party, always answers the door and will not let them in. This
power would change that. I understand that the power on the statute
book in Scotland is being used sparingly, and I believe that it is used
appropriately.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000053">I
now turn to Amendments 79A and 81A, which are tabled in my name, on
strengthening the safeguarding clause. Currently only financial abuse
is defined in the Bill. However, there are of course many other types
of abuse, such as physical, psychological and sexual abuse, as well as
neglect. The amendment seeks to rebalance the definition. I understand
that there has to be a definition of financial abuse in the Bill as
there is not a legal definition elsewhere. However, limiting the
definition to financial abuse, suggests that there are no other forms
of abuse or that professionals and agencies should focus on financial
abuse
alone.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000054">Although

would not wish inadvertently to elevate financial abuse above and
beyond other forms of abuse. Of course, I understand that there is a
reluctance to list types of abuse in case the list appears to be
exhaustive and never-ending. The amendment adds the option to specify
other forms as detailed in guidance, which I hope will allay such

support the need for adult safeguarding access orders and applaud the
noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, for tabling the relevant amendments.
As we discussed last week, as local authority resources shrink
further—the Minister referred to a 5% reduction so
far—the reality is that care will be left more and more in the
hands of relatives, many of whom may themselves be elderly and frail;
or indeed they may be younger, with childcare responsibilities and have
great difficulty in providing support in all directions.
Inevitably, many family carers will find it extremely hard to cope, and
there will undoubtedly be situations when elderly or disabled people
are neglected or in some way abused. I fear that the only way in which
family carers will get the help they need will be if adult safeguarding
access orders are available, so that following an alert the local
authority can become involved, assess the situation and, where
appropriate, prioritise further
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000059">As
public services shrink, the neglect of elderly and disabled
people—even gross negligence in some cases—will become a
growing problem that could very easily become a national scandal.
Having said all that, I part company with my noble friend Lady
Greengross when it comes to Amendment 79. We have the criminal law. It
may not cover absolutely everything but I would not want to see any
increase in the likelihood that an overburdened family carer could face
criminal charges if they reach the point where they cannot continue to
care appropriately for a relative. For me, the purpose of adult
safeguarding access orders is to ensure that problems are
identified—they certainly need to be—and support is made
available in order to enable a carer to cope in the style they would

At Winterbourne View there were 40 safeguarding alerts, 29 incidents

agencies did not take any action. They believed it was someone
else’s duty to report and take action. Putting this duty in the

to secure entry early on in the proceedings to see the child in their
home environment. The noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, has highlighted
a very important issue. I am still struggling to understand why the

talking about something different; we are talking about a

encourage hard-pressed local authorities to narrow their focus to
financial abuse alone. The Confidential Inquiry into Premature Deaths
of People with Learning Disabilities published its findings in March
2013. It looked at the deaths of 233 adults and 14 children with a
learning disability in the south-west and found that 20% of the people
concerned had experienced safeguarding concerns. While some of these
may have been due to financial abuse, it is more likely that they
concerned other forms of abuse: in particular, neglect. The study
showed that 37% of deaths would have been potentially avoidable if
good-quality healthcare had been provided. Neglect is undoubtedly one
of the reasons, and thus the definition in the Bill should be
broadened. I ask the Minister to look again at this and come back with
a more balanced clause reflecting other types of neglect and abuse. It
is important, for example, that hospital safeguarding leads should be
clear that the definition is broad, and should take appropriate

partner to report to the authority if they suspect that there is a
failure of care, and to set out the terms of conviction for any person
guilty of neglecting or ill treating an adult at risk of abuse. We
share some of the concerns of the LGA, for example, on these
amendments: namely, that there would need to be clarification of
exactly what the care 
<?notus-xml column=339?>quality, professional practice and safeguarding concerns would be under
the new duty, and how the duty would relate to other partners involved
in service delivery. We also share concerns that while the criminal
conviction provision may present the way forward in cases of neglect,
it might unintentionally create a lower order of offence and tariff for
older and disabled victims of
crime.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000085" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000085">Finally,

Howe:</Member></B> My Lords, for the first time the Government will,
through this Bill, place adult safeguarding in primary legislation.
Local authorities, the NHS and police will have statutory duties to
work together to help prevent and respond to abuse and neglect. This
sends a clear message that safeguarding is not the sole responsibility
of one agency but requires the very best of partnership working and
information sharing. Amendment 77, which would introduce a power of
access to a person for a confidential interview, runs counter to that
message. Having said that, I am well aware of the strength of feeling
in relation to this matter, both inside your Lordships’ House
and elsewhere. Whether there ought to be a power of access or entry is
a sensitive question. That is precisely why the Government launched a
three-month consultation in 2012 to gauge the opinions of professionals
and the public.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:40:35"></hs_TimeCode> consultation
revealed no clear consensus. Of 212 respondents, 50% backed a new
power, with 40% opposed. However, among individuals, 77% disapproved.
The majority of respondents in favour of a new power of access were
health and care professionals, yet it was very noticeable that their
responses revealed the painstaking weighing of potential benefits
against unforeseen
consequences.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000087" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000087">The

remain—how will the professionals then work with the situation
to achieve the best outcomes? Trust will have been compromised and,
short of a power of removal, which we certainly would not want to see,
the options for action seem pretty
limited.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101420000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000088">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:42:11"></hs_TimeCode>

other key point which I would like to believe may sway the House is the
following. There exists no legislative vacuum preventing care or other
professionals accessing those in urgent need of assistance. Under the
Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the police have the power to
enter premises if harm has occurred or, indeed, is likely to occur. The
Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004, the Fraud Act 2006 and,
for those lacking capacity to make decisions, the Mental Capacity Act
2005, provide a wealth of powers for use at the front line, and the
inherent jurisdiction of the courts to intervene provides a secure
safety net. Therefore, it is not the lack of legislation; rather, as
safeguarding lead directors at ADASS have put it, it is a question of a
“lack of legal literacy” within the social care and other
professions. What is needed is greater knowledge of existing
legislative options. If they have that, professionals will be fully
equipped to support people to be safe. The core role of an adult social
worker is to support people. Further legislation for a new power of
access risks undermining this approach, sending the message that legal
intervention takes primacy over negotiations and consensus. I stress
that legal intervention, on those rare occasions when it is needed, is
already possible under the law. For those reasons, I cannot accept this

understand the concerns behind Amendment 78, tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Greengross. It is, of course, imperative that anyone,
but particularly local authorities and their relevant partners such as
those in the NHS, who suspects someone is at risk of abuse or neglect
knows what action to take. Our best chance of ensuring that relevant
partners take action when they suspect abuse or neglect has occurred
will be through the adult safeguarding boards which comprise the local
authority and relevant representatives of the NHS, police and anyone
else the board considers appropriate. The duties in Schedule 2 provide
a clear foundation for boards to produce and refine their own protocols
for dealing with suspected abuse or
neglect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000092" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000092">Existing
regulations and guidance are clear that partners and staff are required
to report abuse and we will be issuing new guidance on safeguarding
under the powers in the Care Bill. Professional codes of practice,
regulators’ requirements and employers’ policies should
provide clarity in this respect. Furthermore, the changes we propose to
its registration requirements would make it easier for the CQC to take
action against registered providers in cases of
abuse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000093" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000093">A
fundamental truth at the heart of all this is that no amount of
legislation will prevent abuse of adults vulnerable to abuse. Rather,
it is through developing effective partnerships and ensuring the active
engagement of the community that we can best protect
individuals.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000094" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000094">On
Amendment 79, I agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Greengross, that
people who perpetrate or allow abuse and neglect must face serious
consequences, including prosecution where an offence has been 
<?notus-xml column=341?>committed. However, civil law already provides redress for cases of
neglect, and criminal law prohibits assault, which would include much
of what is sought by this amendment. Further specific offences exist
under health and safety legislation which would enable employees in
care establishments and agencies to be prosecuted for failing to take
reasonable care over the health and safety of others while CQC
registration requirements would enable providers of regulated
activities to be prosecuted for neglect or acts of omission which cause
harm or place service users at risk of harm. Where an adult lacks
capacity, there is an existing offence of ill treatment or neglect by a
person who has care of the adult, or is authorised to act for the adult
under the provisions of the Mental Capacity Act. A specific offence is
justified here because of the evidence that such people are highly
vulnerable to abuse or
neglect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000095" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000095">I
turn to Amendment 79A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Rix, which seeks
to make a statutory definition of “abuse”. Our decision
not to do this reflects a desire not to restrict the scope of local
authorities’ inquiry duty. It seems to us inevitable that
creating any list of types of abuse risks excluding something which a
local authority or its partners may wish to inquire into. I think that
is a real danger. We have made an exception regarding financial abuse
to be absolutely clear on our intention for financial abuse to be
included within the scope of the duty when it may not necessarily be
considered as falling within the natural meaning of
“abuse”. It is worth reminding ourselves that the Joint
Committee which carried out pre-legislative scrutiny on the draft Bill
agreed that “abuse” is an ordinary English word, capable
of being understood without being
defined.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101420000096" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-0002.htm#13101420000096">Amendments

Rix:</Member></B> I fully understand the argument that the Government
do not want a great list of what constitutes abuse. However, the
Minister said earlier that it would be possible to give local
authorities a batting order, as it were, of what is in legislation. I
realise that abuse is covered in legislation, but would it be possible
at least to make sure that local authorities do not suddenly think that
only financial abuse is to be considered when they look at this Bill?

Howe:</Member></B> I will gladly look into that point. I am sure that
it is possible to do that but, as the noble Baroness, Lady Barker,
said, many provisions on the statute book are designed to protect
individuals from abuse in one form or another and make criminal
offences of those actions. Nothing has changed as regards those
criminal provisions. If they need to be underlined, however, and if
there is scope for misunderstanding of what the Government are doing

Earl of Listowel (CB):</Member></B> Amendment 26 is in my name and that
of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen. Our two amendments relate
to support for children returning home from care. Perhaps the best way
to illustrate quickly what this is about is to give a couple of
illustrations. Here is a quotation from a female caller to
ChildLine:</hs_para><hs_quote UID="13101422000099" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000099">“I’ve
been in and out of care from a very young age due to my mum hitting me,
neglecting me and taking drugs. Social services would come and take me
away and I would spend some time in care, then mum would promise to
change and I would go back home for the whole situation to start again.
I don’t understand why social services keep giving me back to
mum if they are going to end up taking me away
again”.</hs_quote><hs_parafo UID="13101422000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000088">Recently,
I met a group of young care leavers, who shared with me their
experiences. A 15 year-old girl—a lovely, lively young
girl—had been promised that she was returning to a well equipped
home. She found that there was no cooker and no microwave, and that she
was sharing a pull-out sofa-bed with four other members of the family.
There was no support. She had been 
<?notus-xml column=130?>doing well educationally in care, but when she went home her results
plummeted. Another young woman did not want to return home. Her social
worker offered to take her to McDonald’s; lo and behold, she was
taken back to the family home and told that she had to stay there. I am
sure there is good practice, but there is clearly a lot of work to be
done<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:32:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101422000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000005">I
turn to the detail of my two amendments, which are supported by the
NSPCC, the Family Rights Group, the Who Cares? Trust, the College of
Social Work and TACT, the largest independent fostering and adoption
agency. Returning home to a parent or relative is the most common
outcome for children who have been placed in care. However,
approximately half the children who come into care because of abuse or
neglect suffer further abuse when they return home. Social workers
often feel unsupported and lack the time and resources to support the
children whom they return. In over a third of cases, children returned
home without an assessment. Parents’ problems often remain
unresolved. Practice is highly variable in different local authorities.
The Bill should be amended to require local authorities to assess,
prepare, support and monitor a child’s welfare when they return
home, and to ensure that parents know what support they are entitled
to, just as has been developed in changes to
adoption<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:33:58"></hs_TimeCode>. It is
vital that we improve support for all looked-after children if we are
to protect our most vulnerable children from harm, and thus extend the
entitlement in Clause 4 to support for children who return
home<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:34:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101422000006" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000006">Further research has
shown that two-thirds of children who returned home remained with a
suspected abuser even after concerns had been identified. Over a third
of children return home from care without an assessment, and a further
8% return after only an initial assessment. Research highlights
children returning to households with a high recurrence of drug and
alcohol misuse: 42% with drug misuse and 51% with alcohol misuse.
Recent statistics published by the Department for Education show that
almost half of children who return home re-enter care. In total,
two-thirds of children who returned home experienced one failed return
and one-third had oscillated in and out of care twice or more. A report
published by the Department for Education concluded that appropriate
services and support in place for a child and parents from the
beginning of the care episode, throughout care placement and after the
return home could significantly reduce the cost to the local authority.
It costs around £2,650 per placement in care but it
only costs £193 per month to look after a child in need. It
therefore makes good financial sense to ensure that children and
families get the support they
need.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000007">In a new
Department for Education consultation on permanence, there have been
welcome proposals in this area but they apply only to voluntarily
accommodated children and, although it is more likely for such children
to return home, it is important that support is also provided for all
children returning home from care. Most importantly, the
Government’s current proposals do not ensure effective
assessment or that children returning home—and their

want to reflect on some of the things which came up in Committee last
week about children wanting to know; children having experiences and
having a voice. We know, from children’s own stories, that
support for them is not always there when they return home from care.
Returning home to a parent or parents is the most likely outcome for
children who have been in care and this can be the best result, but
NSPCC research shows that about half the children who go into care
because of abuse and neglect suffer the same when they
return.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101422000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000012">I
will illustrate this with something I heard at the weekend, at the
opening of a centre in Brighton which supports young people whose
parents are addicted to drugs or alcohol. Children may be placed in
care because one or more parents are addicted. The parent or parents go
into treatment and are rehabilitated: they get clean. The children
return and family stress may mean that the parent turns again to drugs
or alcohol. <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:39:33"></hs_TimeCode>The
parents need support and the child needs support. I know from my
experience as chair of the National Treatment Agency for Substance
Misuse that some local authorities and drug or alcohol agencies provide
excellent information and support for parents, but others do not. So
often in services, we end up with a vicious circle of rehabilitation
and relapse—be it drugs or prison, abuse or neglect—with
children in the middle. A recent report from the Centre for Social
Justice talked of children falling between the cracks, and so they do.
We have in the Bill an opportunity to strengthen local
authorities’ responsibilities towards children returning home
from care and increase the chances of it being a successful return. If
that return is not successful, not only does it cause more stress for
children and families but it is expensive, as the noble 
<?notus-xml column=132?>Earl, Lord Listowel, said. Improving things is not likely to cause extra
expense to the LA; it is likely to save
money.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000013">One key
is assessments of the needs of the family and the child. It is worth
asking families and children what they need rather than making
assumptions about it, assuming that everyone is the same or that they
simply need information. As Amendment 26 suggests, information is
important, but it is not everything. Information about support services
should also be in place. More than a third of children return home
without an assessment taking place, and assessment is not necessarily
ongoing. Assessment should not be a one-off. Needs can change. I know
that successful treatment for an addiction means revisiting the initial
assessment regularly. The Department for Education produced a useful
data pack entitled <I>Improving Permanence for Looked After
Children</I> in September this year. It has messages and questions for
local authorities, such as: what are all the assessment and
decision-making processes for return to home from care? What services
are available for returning children to their family? How do services
link across children adult and specialist services—for example,
can access to parenting programmes and drug or alcohol programmes be
part of a “return to home” plan? What action are you
currently taking to improve return on
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:42:18"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000014">All
those questions are important, but perhaps the most important is the
linking of services. So often, services are parcelled out into child,
adult, mental health, drug and alcohol, but often there are significant
overlaps which are not recognised or responded to. Following a
child’s return home from care, neither they nor their parents
have a right to any support, and children often end up, as we have
heard, back in the same situation—as I said, a vicious circle.
Children have said, “I was left to it. I have been in care
because my dad assaulted me. Since I have been home, he has been
threatening me, pushing me around. I have been cutting myself and I
feel like I want to
die”.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000015">We
all know that behaviour change is difficult. It is perhaps especially
difficult for troubled families. The needs of such families—of
all families and their children—must be addressed before a child
returns home. Engaging with families has been identified as an
opportunity to enable the return home to be successful. Personal
budgets are important and Clause 4 suggests that they should be
available to parents of an adopted child. It is vital that that is
extended to children returning home. I hope that the Minister will
respond sympathetically to the
amendments.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000016">I

placements because, although the support is poor for post-adoption, it
is even less for post-guardianship. Any services that are extended to
adoptive parents must be looked at in relation to special
guardianships, because these very often are the same children but have
the benefit of being placed with those who know them and who loved them

totally candid with the social workers, but if a child goes home for
visits or is sent home—apparently permanently but that turns not
to be permanently—he or she knows exactly what is going on in

absolutely support the amendments but my concern is that they do not
push hard enough for support when the child initially goes into care.
This builds on something that I was trying to say last week. Our
responsibility ought to be to ensure that, while the child is in care,
work none the less goes on with the natural parents so that an
assessment can be made of whether they are capable of change and
willing for change to take place. Our 
<?notus-xml column=135?>problem is that too often children who themselves have improved are then
sent back home and no work is done with the parents before that
happens. That is often why the placement breaks down again, and that is
expensive—not just in monetary terms in trying to deal with that

“If you’re going to have another child then you’ve

Hughes of Stretford (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, I
particularly support the points made by the noble Baroness,
Lady Howarth, in relation to Amendments 26 and 27. These amendments are
important because, as she said, the statistics show us that the system
is not working well for children who return home. While going home is
the most common outcome for children in care, around half of them have
to go back into care—sometimes more than once in this
revolving-door pattern that can emerge—simply because there is
not the good social work practice in relation to children returning
home that we associate with other forms of childcare.</hs_para>

address, there is not good assessment, good identification of need or
provision of the necessary support services. There is also, very often,
no continued monitoring of how that child is faring when they go home.
That is the first point which the Government need to address: the
statistics show us that it is not working when half the children who go
home have to come back into care. That obviously not only damages them;
as the research has 
<?notus-xml column=136?>shown, the costs of the consequence of coming back into care
escalate because as children return from successive
attempted reunifications, they are more damaged. The cost of caring for
them in other placements then becomes that much greater. As the
University of Loughborough has shown, as well as the social and moral
imperative to try to reduce these failed reunifications there is,
potentially, a financial benefit. If you can prevent the escalating
cost of failed reunification, it makes financial sense as well and may
in fact reduce costs to the local authority.</hs_para>

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, no doubt the Minister will
enlighten us but what I am saying is that where local authorities have
discretion around the quality of the social work practice that they
will deliver to different groups of children, as they do, it means that
some of those groups lose out. Demonstrably, by the statistics, it
appears that children who are sent home from care are sometimes sent
too early or without thorough assessment, do not necessarily get the
ongoing support and are not monitored sufficiently. Those kinds of
things happen with other cases—with child abuse cases, perhaps.
However, it seems as if in many local authorities a decision is made
that the child can go home but the focus of attention does not continue
on to that child, which is more likely to result in
breakdown.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T15:59:26"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Amendments 26 and 29 on the issue of assessment and support for
children returning home from care to their families. As the noble Earl,
Lord Listowel, pointed out, and as research has shown, almost half the
children who return home later re-enter care, and almost one-third of
those children have very poor experiences of that return. This is
clearly unacceptable, and we recognise that. The noble Earl gave a very
compelling instance of this, which was echoed by my noble friend Lady
Hamwee.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000043">This<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:01:04"></hs_TimeCode>

expert group over a year ago to help us to understand and drive forward
the improvements that we recognise are needed. The group includes
academics, local authority representatives and sector organisations
such as the Family Rights Group, the Who Cares? Trust and the NSPCC. We
thank them for their work in this area. We are particularly pleased
that the NSPCC is undertaking research in this area to understand how
decision-making and support can be improved for these families. This
will and must include ensuring that the voice of the child is at the
heart of all decision-making, and I hope that that will reassure the
noble Baroness, Lady Howe, my noble friend Lady Walmsley, and others.
The working group has focused on how data can be used effectively to
support local authority practice improvements, identify the areas where
the statutory framework needs strengthening, and help us understand how
we can support changes in practice that are effective and
sustainable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000044">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:02:23"></hs_TimeCode>
current statutory framework clearly sets out requirements to return a
child to their parents and to provide information about the support
services available for these families. It is important to acknowledge
that the statutory framework is different for those children who are
subject to a care order and return home and those children who have
been voluntarily accommodated and then return. The current statutory
framework clearly sets out the requirements for placing a child with
their parents—that is, when a child will remain subject to a
care order after returning home. For example, a robust assessment of
the parents’ suitability to care for their child must be
undertaken; a nominated officer must be satisfied that the decision to
return a child to the care of their parents will safeguard and promote
the child’s welfare; and the local authority must continue to
review the child’s case, setting out the services and supports
in the child’s care plan and reviewing this regularly. However,
the statutory framework for voluntarily accommodated children is not as
strong—and noble Lords are clearly aware of that. That is why we
are consulting on changes that might be made  to
this.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000045" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000045">The
<I>Improving Permanence for Looked After Children</I> consultation
launched on 30 September includes a number of proposals to address the
issues faced by voluntarily accommodated children in returning home. We
want to strengthen the statutory framework to ensure that the decision
to return voluntarily accommodated children is taken by a nominated
officer, that the plan for support following the return home is clearly
set out and reviewed, and that these children and their families are
offered continuing visits and support from the local authority
following the return. Those are some of the issues that noble Lords
have

also propose to place a duty on local authorities to review a

now turn to Amendments 30 and 31, which refer to information and
support available to special guardians. Special guardians do a very
important job, which we heard from both the noble Baroness, Lady
Massey, and my noble friend Lady Walmsley. We agree that we need to
look at whether they are being given sufficient support. The department
therefore commissioned the University of York in March 2012 to carry
out a two-year research project to investigate how special guardianship
was working in practice, and the rates and reasons for any breakdowns.
The final report is expected in autumn 2014. This is a major piece of

allow us to reach an informed view about the potential for personal
budgets for special guardians. If there is a need to change the

statutory guidance needs to be brought forward and will consult on
these before implementation. I hope, again, that noble Lords are

close scrutiny. The exposure of systematic safeguarding failures in

protection conferences are a key part of the child protection process,

framework for ascertaining a child’s wishes during the child
protection process was provided by the <I>Working Together to Safeguard
Children</I> guidance, published in 2010. From April 2013, a revised
version of this guidance has been in place with the aim of reducing the
level of prescription and bureaucracy involved within safeguarding
procedures. Although the revised guidance recommends obtaining and
understanding the wishes and needs of children within a child-centred
system, it gives far less prominence to the involvement of children
during assessment and within the child protection process than the
previous version. In particular, there is no longer a presumption that
a child, subject to age and understanding, should be invited to attend
their conference with an advocate if they wish to do so. So there is
less prescriptive guidance alongside no clear statutory right to
advocacy. This risks reducing the opportunity for people to participate

there to say to the child, “We are just interested,
independently, in what your wishes and feelings are. We just want to
help you to express those things”. That is the particular niche
for independent
advocates<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:16:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000061">For
instance, it has been suggested that IROs—the independent
reviewing officers—can fulfil the role of ensuring that the
child’s wishes and feelings are heard in their reviews. However,
they have a number of different roles: they chair the meeting, draw
together the views of the child and the other professionals, and have a
duty to monitor the case. National advocacy standards require an
advocate to act on the child’s instructions about their express
wishes and feelings and to uphold their rights. Non-instructive
advocacy is provided for younger children and those with communication
difficulties. All advocates will discuss matters and seek to help the
child to understand the views of others but, ultimately, they are
required to act on the wishes and feelings of the child, reflecting the
child’s perception of their best
interest<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:17:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000062">Looked-after
children, care leavers and children in need have a statutory right to
an advocate in making or intending to make a complaint under the
Children Act 1989. We introduced this in 2004 in the Lords, and over
the years since there has been an increased recognition by the
Government of the importance of advocacy for looked-after children and
care leavers. However, there is an inconsistency in implementation
which means that children and young people still do not receive the
advocacy support to which they are entitled. In particular, provision
of services is patchy and inconsistent. A report from the
Children’s Commissioner illustrated the postcode lottery and
provision of advocacy services in general and the legal categories of
children covered by local authority contracts. For example, some
services are not commissioned to provide services to children in need.
Research by the Children’s Society showed that one-third of
local authorities do not report any spending on advocacy services.

great increase in recurrent calls from young people, many of whose home

when “consistent with their welfare”, a local authority

in a survey by the Children’s Rights Director in 2011, almost
three-quarters of children in care reported being separated from their
siblings. Young people in children’s homes are most affected
with, I am advised, 96% being separated from a sibling. Noble Lords
will agree that the current situation is unacceptable, yet there is
little recourse at present for looked-after children to enforce their
rights.</hs_parafo><hs_para UID="13101422000067" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000067">Independent
reviewing officers are supposed to intervene if a child's views and
welfare are not being taken into account in care planning, and have the
power to report cases to CAFCASS, which reports to the family courts.
However, this rarely happens in reality. Between 2004 and 2011,
independent reviewing officers reported only eight cases to CAFCASS.
Independent reviewing officers seem to lack the time, independence and
legal expertise to properly ensure children’s rights are not
breached.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000068">Similarly,
the complaints procedures available to looked-after children are both
too lengthy and insufficiently robust to make a difference in serious
cases. A survey by the Children’s Rights Director in 2012 found
that over one-third of the looked-after young people surveyed said that
making a complaint made no difference at all to their situation and
over one-fifth said it had made it
worse.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000069" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000069">Finally,
children in care already have access to legal action through judicial
reviews for very serious cases. However, while judicial reviews are
superior to complaints procedures and IROs as they are truly impartial,
robust and fast enough to make a real difference, there are also limits
to their effectiveness. First, they can question only the way a local
authority has made a decision, not the decision itself. Secondly,
judicial reviews are an extremely expensive way of enforcing rights,
costing upwards of £30,000. Given the economic climate we are
in, it is increasingly unlikely that judicial reviews will continue to
be an option for looked-after children. Thirdly, they happen after the
event and usually after significant harm has been sustained.</hs_para>

is an important legal right that looked-after
children are denied, which could provide them with a means to prevent
local authorities acting against their interests. As I am sure noble
Lords are aware, Section 8 orders such as contact, prohibited steps and
specific issue orders enable children to prevent their parents taking
actions that are against their best interests. If a parent attempts to
prevent a child seeing a family member or tries to move the child away
from their home, the child may, through their solicitor and if that
legal representative considers there to be sufficient grounds, ask a
court to make a Section 8 order. Though rarely exercised or indeed
necessary, the right to do this is a crucial protection for children in
difficult
situations.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000071" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000071">However,

is a gross inequality for looked-after children, denying them the same
rights available to all other young people. Opening up Section 8 orders
to looked-after children would give them a clear and direct means of
redress if a local authority is acting against their interests and
welfare. For instance, a child threatened with an unnecessary move far
away from home could ask a court to make a prohibited steps order. The
threat of legal action would also provide a clear incentive for local
authorities to implement existing policy concerning looked-after
children and act in their best interests. The paramountcy principle is
enshrined in the Children Act 1989; importantly, this will be driven
not by government but by the people whose lives are most
affected.</hs_parafo>

that large numbers of looked-after children will approach courts to
make Section 8 orders against local authorities. However, for those in
very serious situations where such legal action is appropriate, this
will be an enabling right which could make all the difference. The
potential gains of opening up Section 8 orders are very great. By
allowing young people to seek help from a court to prevent local
authorities acting against their interests we could prevent many
disruptive placement moves, which have such a harmful effect on the
outcomes of children in care. Opening up Section 8 orders would enable
prevention of harm rather than simply redress after the event. It is a
vital early intervention measure and this proposal will be
an historic step forward for the rights of children in care. I look
forward to hearing the Government’s

The principle behind this is one that we have discussed on a number of

I acknowledge the spirit in which the amendment has been
tabled—to give courts the same power to issue a Section 8 order
for a child in the care of a local authority that they have in respect
of children who are not in care. However, what my noble friend proposes
is unnecessary. There are separate provisions under Section 34 of the
Children Act in relation to contact arrangements for looked-after
children. We would not want to cut across the responsibilities of the
local authority in relation to any decisions made by it about placement
decisions in the best interests of the
child<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:32:44"></hs_TimeCode>. Section 8
orders are private law orders; they are used as a means of resolving
disagreements between parents about the residence and contact
arrangements for their children following separation or divorce. The
reason why children in the care of a local authority do not come within
scope of most Section 8 orders is that the local authority has shared
parental responsibility for these children. As part of care planning
arrangements, a local authority can decide a range of matters regarding
the care of a child. That includes where the child should be
placed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:33:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101422000081" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101422000081">I
recognise that there are circumstances in which children in care are
unhappy about decisions related to their placement and parental or
sibling contact. To enable courts to make Section 8 orders, however,
would fetter the ability of local authorities to make arrangements for
the placement of children. As I have said, there are separate
provisions in Section 34 of the Children Act 1989. The care planning
framework already provides

response. It seemed to me very sympathetic and reflected the very
positive attitude of this Government towards the idea of advocacy and
hearing the voice of the child. I saw that reflected in the practice of
Edward Timpson MP when he was chair of the all-party parliamentary
group on young people. I believe that he still regularly meets groups
of young people in care—groups of younger and older
people—as well as care leavers. I think that this sort of
approach will make a huge difference to policy. If good advocacy can
make a difference for one child through having contact with his
siblings and the principle is proved that children should have such
access, that raises the game for everybody and creates opportunities
for other children with similar

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, I am sure that Members of
the Committee will recall that last week we debated the importance of
kinship care and, unless there are reasons why this should not happen,
the importance of children in care keeping in touch with members of
their biological family one way or another. This amendment rehearses
some of those arguments. Indeed, the importance of family contact and
strengthening the potential for family contact for children in care
will be a theme that I will return to a number of times as we go
through the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:38:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is to clarify the existing law that any decision by a local authority
about allowing a child in care—under a care or emergency
protection order—contact with the parents or some other family
member is subject to the local authority considering whether such
contact would place the child at risk of harm. Obviously that is
essential and, although the law probably currently provides for that,
we have no objection to it being clarified here in Clause
7<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

if the Government are serious about the importance of continued family
contact, they should go further and require local authorities to give
specific consideration to enabling children in care to remain in
contact with their siblings. That is the purpose of Amendment 32. We
know that sibling contact has not always been a priority for
agencies—certainly not the priority that it seems to be for the
children themselves. We think that there is a need for the Government
to enshrine sibling contact as a priority in the legislation.</hs_para>

reasons why we think that. First, 63% of children in care whose
siblings are also in the care system are separated from them, so the
vast majority of children in care who have siblings in care as well are
not together. Those living in children’s homes are much more
likely to be separated from their siblings than those in foster care,
yet the sibling relationship is often the longest relationship in a
child’s life, potentially offering the stability that is often
absent from other aspects of the life of a child in care. The second
reason is understandable: it is that young people in care themselves
feel strongly that they generally have too little contact with their
siblings. Some 85% of children in care thought it important to keep
siblings together, and over three-quarters thought that councils should
help children and young people to keep in touch with their brothers and
sisters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:40:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000005" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000005">This
amendment would make that sibling contact a priority in social work
practice. I think we can all understand why continued contact with your
brothers and sisters when you are in care is fundamental, yet it seems
now that in many cases—the majority—siblings 
<?notus-xml column=148?>are separated and risk losing that contact, stability and link to their
biological heritage. I hope that the Minister will
accept the amendment. I beg to

Butler-Sloss (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support the
amendment. As I think I said at our previous sitting, when I chaired
the adoption committee we had two meetings with children, one with
looked-after children and the other with children who were or were
about to be adopted. Each group made it absolutely clear, particularly
younger children—the seven, eight, 10 or 12 year-old
children—how important their siblings were. They said to us that
siblings were more important to them than parents. Some of them would
have liked to have seen their parents; they all wanted to see their
siblings. It was so sad; one little boy said, “I’m so
worried about my brother. I don’t know what’s happening
to him. Nobody will tell me and I’m not allowed to see him. I
wake up at night wondering how he’s getting on”. That is
not acceptable for children. The amendment would alert everybody to the
importance of siblings, which is why I support
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:42:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000007"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Hamwee" PimsId="3737" UID="13101433000287" xid="1741" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000287">Baroness
Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much agree with all that has been
said. I remember being struck by the strength of feeling expressed by
the young people. At our previous sitting we talked about the
importance of identity; contact with one’s siblings and
understanding that family dynamic is another aspect of identity. I have
been impressed by somebody outside the group of people whom the noble
and learned Baroness saw, whose feeling of responsibility for her
younger sibling was important to her to express and fulfil. By
separating her from her younger sister—by being deprived of
caring for her—she was being deprived of the expression of her
own personality. That was of huge significance to
her<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:43:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000008"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Listowel" PimsId="1518" UID="13101433000288" xid="1317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000288">The
Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> My Lords, I would also like briefly to
support the amendment and give an example of how passionately young
people in care feel about being separated from their siblings. Delma
Hughes, who was separated from her five siblings, I believe, later went
on to become an art therapist and work with young and vulnerable
people. She felt so passionately about correcting the wrong that had
been done to her that she set up a charity called Siblings Together. It
has run for several years, organising holiday camps in the countryside
and events at the Young Vic theatre, so that young siblings who may
never see each other apart from on such occasions can spend a week or
so together. That woman is a real example of how terrible it feels to
young people when they are separated from their siblings, and how at
least one of them has become a champion in the area and made a huge
difference to many other young people who have gone through that
experience.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:45:03"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para>

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I very much agree. As we have talked
about the last three groups of amendments, it has occurred to me that
we appear to be living in a parallel universe. Ministers stand up and,
quite correctly, read out the situation as it should, theoretically,
be. Although Ministers tell us in  good faith what the
situation is in theory, it is not happening.</hs_para>

Lady Hughes of Stretford, made a point which struck me as a little odd.
She said that 60% of those siblings who are both in care and who are
not together or seeing each other are in children’s homes. I
understand that it might be quite difficult to get foster carers to
take pairs of siblings because they might be prepared to take only one
child, but it should not be that difficult to put sets of children
together in children’s homes where there are multiple places.
Might the Government consider doing some research to find out why that
is? I would have thought that was the very place where you could keep
groups of siblings. Could that be looked
into<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:47:00"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000012"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Howarth of Breckland" PimsId="1029" UID="13101433000291" xid="1642" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000291">Baroness

talked to many young people over the years, and particularly remember
two groups I saw, with the Children’s Rights Director, who
talked about the way conflict in their families was relieved by the
fact that they had siblings to share their sojourn and be a comfort
when things were really grim. They were the people who were their
in-group when all this was going on, so were even more important to
them than their parents, who were often the enemy and doing the
destructive things, while siblings were their protection. That is not
always so: there are siblings who are damaging to each other.
Professional decisions to separate siblings may be quite right, but
they must be made properly, not by accident. I fear we have reached the
position where it is by accident because of the way we arrange
placements and the shortage of good ones. We have young people in
adolescent groups because they are easier to manage with staff who can
manage them and small units with small children, but many fewer family
group homes than there were, so you do not have the mix of youngsters
together. Managing a unit of very difficult young people is about
training, and confidence.</hs_para>

families are planned for. I am a social worker so I know how easy it

amendment gives me the opportunity to say that I have published draft
regulations for your Lordships’ consideration. I completely
agree that contact between siblings can be of great importance and
extremely beneficial—this is not in dispute. However, I hear
what the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, my noble
friends Lady Hamwee, Lady Walmsley and Lady Benjamin, the noble Earl,
Lord Listowel, and the noble Lord, Lord May, have said. I am afraid
that we do not agree that amending Section 34 is the right thing to do.
The Family Justice Review recommended that the Government should
consult on whether Section 34 should be amended, along the same lines
as proposed in this amendment. We did just that. Drawing on the
experience and knowledge of a number of experts, we agreed that
amending the law was not the right thing to do, and that more work
needed to be done to improve practice and facilitate positive contact
between
siblings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T16:53:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000020">When
the child’s local authority is considering what contact there
should be—whether with the child’s parents or
siblings—the authority must ensure that it is consistent with
safeguarding and promoting the child’s welfare. In doing so, the
draft regulations require local authorities to have regard to the
child’s care plan. We consider that that is the right approach.
Current regulations already require local authorities to consider and
review contact arrangements with siblings. Local authorities are under
a duty to include in a child’s care plan details of how they
will meet the child’s needs in

develop his argument and try to convince us. First, what was the reason
given by the respondents in that consultation as to why changing the
law was not the best course of action? Secondly, picking up on the
point made earlier by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, why does the
Minister think the current requirements on local authorities in the

more work needed to be done to improve practice. I agree, and I share
the noble Baroness’s concern about this. In the light of the

siblings are looked after but are not placed together, their individual
care plan must set out the arrangements made to promote contact between
them. The care plan must be reviewed regularly, which allows for the
arrangements to be revised as the child’s circumstances change.
Sibling contact is already provided for in the Children Act 1989, and
the court must consider contact arrangements before making a care
order. The looked-after siblings can apply to court for contact. We
have specifically ensured that the court continues to consider contact
arrangements through Clause

obvious support across the Committee for this amendment and the issue.
The noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Hamwee, were able to give us some direct testimony of
children, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, as ever, gave us her
insight into what is going wrong with the system and why things are as
they

am pleased that the Minister said that he has heard the strength of
feeling on this issue. He made two points in response. The first was
that a number of experts had said that because this was a matter of
practice, changing the law was not the right way to try to improve
contact between siblings in those care cases. There is a dynamic
relationship between the law and practice, is there not? We frequently
set out what professionals ought to do in legislation. Yes, we may
flesh it out further in regulation, but practice is often defined in
legislation. His second point was that we already have regulations that
require that. Clearly, they are not working when so many children in
care—by accident, as the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, said; it is
not intended—are by default losing contact with their brothers
and
sisters<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:00:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13101433000272" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000272">5

clarification, in response to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, what I
actually said, which has come from the Children’s Rights
Director, was that of those children in care whose siblings are in
care, 63% lose contact with their siblings. The noble Baroness is right
that this is counterintuitive, but apparently those living in
children’s homes are much more likely to be separated 
<?notus-xml column=153?>than those in foster care. One would not expect that, so there are some
further questions to be asked in that

all or part of their childhood and/or adolescence in the care system,
for too many the current system simply is not working in a consistent,
helpful way. At the moment, care leavers apply under the Data
Protection Act for access to personal information held in care records,
but unfortunately the DPA is often misinterpreted by local authorities,
with some organisations severely restricting the information made
available. There are too many examples of care leavers receiving such
incomplete and heavily redacted records that their case histories are
rendered virtually meaningless. Furthermore, the service given by local
authorities is erratic and inconsistent: some are enabling and
supportive while others are bureaucratic and obstructive. Some seem so
concerned about negligence claims and media headlines that their
position is defensive from the very

relationship between practice and legislation was brought up in

of the points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, last week in
relation to Amendment 25 resonated with me, because very similar issues
concerning identity, belonging and knowledge of family history are
relevant to this amendment. The question, “Who am I?”, is
fundamental; it is a question necessary for us to recognise our sense
of self and our status as a distinctive and unique human being. We
understand that responses to that question are highly complex: we are
the sum of our experiences and memories, and of what other people tell
us and how they respond to us. Some experiences are indelible and
remain with us through memory; some experiences, even though they are
an essential part of our experience of the world, may none the less be
forgotten, especially if they have produced trauma of one kind or
another.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101433000038" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000038">If
you have been brought up in care, you come to think about what kind of
person you are and where you have come from, asking, “Who am
I?”. However, these questions may be unanswerable. Who is there
to tell you at what age you accomplished something or about a specific
difficulty you had, or the circumstances of your early life? How is it
possible to accumulate the kind of knowledge about yourself that people
brought up in conventionally caring situations take for granted? It may
be your story and your journey but it seems to belong to the state in
the form of records, whether they are hand-written, type-written or
whatever.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101433000039" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000039">Several thousand people
ask to see their records and many of these requests come from people in
their middle or later years. The lifelong needs of adult care leavers
are at least as pressing as those of adults who have been adopted,
although this is rarely recognised in respect of access to care records
and the aftermath. The DPA enables care leavers to see personal
information about them on their care files. The problem is that 
<?notus-xml column=155?>when asking a local authority to see these files, care leavers’
experiences range from a response which is at best enabling and
supportive and at worst bureaucratic, restrictive and inconsistent with
the corporate parenting role. There are some examples of good practice
but we want the Government to ensure that local authorities work with
the Information Commissioner’s Office to enable care leavers to
have all the personal information they are entitled to, and to exercise
their discretion regarding third-party information in a less
restrictive way.</hs_para>

despite the requirements already in place, we think that the standard
and quality of case-record keeping is not consistent across the
children’s services sector. Organisations need to be mindful of
keeping older records safely and under secure conditions, whether they
are paper, scanned or microfilmed. We have heard too many instances
where organisations with poor archival records and retrieval systems
respond to the care leaver’s request for personal information
with a statement that the files or records cannot be found, without any
sense of the profound impact that that can have on the post-care adult.
Without support, the persistence necessary to obtain care files places
a substantial psychological and emotional burden on the individual, who
may already be very isolated. Even if they are not isolated, the impact
of disturbing revelations can have repercussions on current
relationships and
families.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000041" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000041">We
also need to make sure that we can track where records have moved to:
for example, a children’s home might have been closed or a
voluntary organisation wound up or absorbed into another organisation.
Not being able to find records on that basis is also frustrating and
works against care leavers. Regulations could provide a framework for
the coherent transfer of care records systems across childcare service
providers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000042" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000042">Our
evidence suggests that the response from the authorities is often not
focused on the rights and needs of the individual care leaver. Again,
this echoes other points that have been made in respect of children.
Although we are clearly talking here about adults, they still have
rights and needs as care leavers that are not being respected by the
rather defensive attitudes often displayed by local authorities, which
seem to be worried about potential criticism or fearful of
litigation.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101433000043" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000043">Similarly, when it
comes to sensitive personal data, care leavers can find that many data
controllers interpret existing provisions narrowly and that the
information withheld significantly reduces clarity about the
information they want to access. There are circumstances where
organisations can withhold information, and there are plenty of
guidelines on that. However, again we come to this point: they are not
being implemented consistently or necessarily in the best interests of
the adult care leaver who is seeking to find out more about their past,
particularly when it comes to relatives.
Even<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:09:49"></hs_TimeCode> if somebody
gets hold of their care records, there is then the issue of whether
they understand how and why the data controller has made decisions
about what information is provided and about what has been withheld,
redacted or left out. In relation to that, there is also the need
for  
<?notus-xml column=156?>adult care leavers to at least be offered the opportunity to have some
kind of support in going through what is often a difficult situation to
navigate<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000044">We
understand that some data controllers feel nervous about making
disclosures of a sensitive nature that particularly affect other
people’s personal backgrounds—for example, a mother or
father or other relative—and we want to make sure that data
controllers have adequate protection in such circumstances, hence the
latter part of the
amendment<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode>. To
summarise, care leavers seek information about their past for all kinds
of reasons. It may be that they are starting a new relationship or

flavour of the experiences of some adult care leavers who have been in
touch with, particularly, the Care Leavers’ Association. In one
instance, a care leaver—let us call him Arthur—wanted to
connect with his records because he was coming to a new phase in his
life. He was told that he had come into care because his mother was
admitted to hospital but he was not told why. It was considered that
the reason for her admission was private and that he had no right to
know. It turned out that his mother had suffered from a long-term,
severe mental illness.</hs_para>

treatment of care leavers can be about blatant discrimination and
defensive responses. I have been told by two people how much distress
and frustration this has caused them. As the noble Baroness
said—I want to underline some of these matters—there are
many forms of such discrimination. Those that I have 
<?notus-xml column=157?>heard of relate to organisations which have poor information, or have a
reluctance to seek out information and respond that the records cannot
be found—that they have lost the records. In one case, I heard
that records had been moved. As the noble Baroness said,
children’s homes close and organisations merge. Where do these
records go? How does the care leaver find them? What help is there for
them to find
them?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000051">Some
local authorities or voluntary organisations become defensive or
evasive, despite the fact that a care leaver has the right to access
personal information. The request for information may also involve
another person who has to give permission, although it may be deemed
possible to give the information without permission, but some
organisations which control those data may interpret the rules very
narrowly. I know of one person who is still trying to access
information after a year of trying. Redaction of records may occur, as
the noble Baroness said. In this case, surely local authorities and
voluntary organisations should provide explanations and offer
counselling and support to those who receive their care

needs to be flexibility about who can provide the information. People
change residence. It should be possible for another local authority or

those who have been adopted may wish to access records. To remove part

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:16:13"></hs_TimeCode> amendment
moved by the noble Baroness and to speak to my Amendment 41. I support
the amendment because of the importance of human curiosity. In recent
child case reviews commentators have criticised professionals because
they simply were not curious. They did not ask, “Why was this
child bruised?” Why did somebody not ask why the child kept
coming back? They complained about the lack of curiosity among
professionals. When Anna Freud, back in the 1930s, spoke to teachers
about how to be a good teacher, she said that the most important
quality was curiosity. She said, “We need you to be curious
about the child, think about where he is, where he is going, and how to
get the child to go there”.</hs_para>

is so important and is reflected in our culture. If we think about the
stories from Genesis or of Michelangelo’s most celebrated works
of art, they are about where we come from? Another example is
Haydn’s “Creation”. We are fascinated about our
origins. The noble Lord, Lord May, is absent now, but he knows that we
spend billions on finding out about the origin of the universe. How did
we come into being? I am concerned that to deny young people the
opportunity to find out where they come from is a way of undermining
and frustrating their curiosity. It is a way of stifling their wishes
and interest in the world if you say, “No, you can’t know
where you come from; no, we will not help you with that”. This
weekend I was looking at some photographs of my father from the 1950s
which 
<?notus-xml column=158?>I had never seen before. I found them inspiring. I very much identify
with the concerns of the noble Baroness and it was a privilege to hear
her talking about her own experiences in this area. I hope that the

amendment deals with support for young people leaving the care system
and allowing all young people to have access to personal advisers up to
the age of 25. Currently, past the age of 21 it is restricted to young
people in training and education. I give the example of a young man,
Ashley Williamson, who is a care leaver of 21 or 22. He left care at
the age of 16. I have met him on a number of occasions recently. He has
chaired the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Children and Young People
in Care; he has provided advice on matters around sexual exploitation
of children in children’s homes; and he left care himself at the
age of 16 and wanted nothing more to do with the system. He washed his
hands and went on with his life. However, at the age of 20 he connected
with his local authority again and asked for help. He found a fantastic
personal adviser who was very supportive and helped him to get a
fantastic home for himself. Now, in his early twenties, he has a good,
solid base. He has been very helpful to me and I am sure he will be
helpful to other young people in care because he is articulate,
intelligent and thoughtful and has had that experience.</hs_para>

people, early trauma means it takes them longer to do what many of our
own children might do. Give them the time to make mistakes and then to
realise they need to come back and ask for help. If I remember the
story correctly, a young man who was a foster child of a social worker,
Kate Cairns, was, as the age of 19 or 20, in prison and addicted to
very nasty substances. He was a very difficult person to deal with and
yet, 10 years later, at the age of 30 he had his own family, was
employed and was providing for his children. Given time, he
changed.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101433000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000057">Let
me give more detail on this amendment. Most people continue to receive
love, advice and, perhaps, financial assistance from their parents into
their adult lives and the average age for a young person leaving home
is 26. However, young people in the care system are often thrust into
instant adulthood at just 16 and, like most 16 year-olds, they tend not
to have the life skills to be able to cope independently at this age.
Of course, they often find adult life especially hard due to the
traumatic childhoods they have endured. So young people leaving the
care system are disproportionately more likely to end up getting
involved in crime and drug abuse and very often struggle to achieve
good qualifications. Our failure to help this group of people, for whom
we have a clear responsibility, leads not only to personal tragedy but
to great cost to society.</hs_para>

people leaving the care system are designated personal advisers and
have pathway plans drawn up for them. These help to smooth their
journey to adulthood but, at present, are only available until they are
21 unless they are in education or training. Young people who are not
in training or education also need support. I recommend that personal
advisers be made available to young people up to the age of 25, whether
or not they are in education or training. These young people need that
kind of support 
<?notus-xml column=159?>even more. This would ensure that vulnerable young people leaving the
care system receive the ongoing support and advice that other young
people receive from their parents and take for granted. I look forward

leavers when they exit care early, allowing no recognition that this

the Children Act 1989  local authorities must already
accommodate any 16 or 17 year-old who is homeless. However, at present
the law does not require that the accommodation has a supported
element. This means that if a young person leaves care at 16, returns
to their birth family and the placement breaks down, as an estimated
50% of returns home do, there will be no entitlement to return to
foster or residential care. Similarly, if a young person decides to
move into independent living and struggles to live alone and manage a
tenancy, he or she is likely to be given a place in a hostel or a new
flat when what is really needed is a more supported option.</hs_para>

logic of this is that if a child is under 18 and not ready to live
independently we must continue to support them. For children who have
left care and shown that they are not ready to live independently, the
same logic must apply. It is not unreasonable that we should try to

shall speak to is Amendment 45B. This aims to question how we treat
children leaving residential care. Amendment 38, tabled by the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, would extend foster care to 21. While
this has received national funding for pilots, had explicit backing
from the Children’s Minister and is already in some stage of
implementation at local authority level, there has been no mention of
what happens to the roughly 2,500 children who exit residential care
every year. This is a very vulnerable group of young people with
challenging needs. For example, 62% of young people in
children’s homes have “clinically significant”
mental health difficulties, and 74% of young people in
children’s homes have been reported to be violent or aggressive
in the past six months. These young people are the most likely to
struggle to sustain a tenancy and live independently yet they are also
the most likely to make an early move to independent living. Currently,
more than half—56%—of children in residential care leave
care at 16 or 17 and the remainder will leave on their 18th

moving to independent living, they lose both the supported environment

understand that there are barriers to extending residential
care—primarily the cost of such provision. When I am doing my
work at Tomorrow’s People, people come up with many ideas and
the first thing that other people say is, “Oh, we can’t
afford it”. If we talked about that before we talked about the
solution, we would never do anything. The Minister knows that I am
absolutely sure that there are more innovative funding models to enable
that provision to be put in place. I stand ready to do anything I can
to make that happen because the costs of abandoning these young people
are likely to be far higher. This is a probing amendment motivated by a

I shall speak to Amendment 45C. This amendment would ensure that local
authorities provide all care leavers with the resources to stay in a
new foster, residential or semi-independent placement until 21 if they
wish to do so. It is aimed at care leavers who are not able to stay in
a former foster or residential placement but still wish or need to be
supported. Although remaining in a former care placement is likely to
be the ideal option for many looked-after young people as it preserves
existing relationships with carers, this is not always possible. Rather
than forcing young people who are unable to remain in their current
placement into independent living, the opportunity of a supportive
placement should still be
offered.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000074">The
new supportive placement could be a semi-independent placement, such as
supported lodgings or university-style accommodation. On some
occasions, it could be a new placement in residential or foster care.
What is important is that we find the right options for all care
leavers. Whether it is remaining in a former placement or finding them
something new, none should be left
unsupported.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000075">I

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> Perhaps I may say something briefly,
going back to the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Young of
Hornsey. What has happened to good recording? In the distant past when
the Data Protection Act came into being, I was involved in writing some
of the guidance—it is such a 
<?notus-xml column=162?>long time ago that I do not think I have a copy of it or any reference
to it—about how data should be made available and where we
should redact the information that should be kept separate. Good
recording demanded that there were separate parts to the record which
were absolutely clear and identified, so that if there was an appeal,
someone could look at the separate parts of the
record<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:33:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000078" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000078">What
has happened, I ask the Minister and local authorities, to personal
story books? What has happened to the need to keep packs of
photographs, which used to happen when I was in children’s
departments and, early on, in social services? What has happened to
those good social workers who shared their recording? I shared my
recording with those people I was working with, so they had a
copy—unless there was a child protection issue which could not
be shared. Therefore you asked other people involved for their
permission at the time to share
information.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000079" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000079">Some
of those principles of recording have been lost over time. Perhaps
Ofsted could look at the principles of recording these days. I am not
saying that it is a simple issue. It is not; I understand how complex
it is; but I think that some of the basic principles have been lost. If
we returned to some of those, the issue would not be a forward issue.
Clearly we have an issue going back for those people who find
themselves unable to access records. I have seen records which are so
redacted that they are unintelligible. I have had to go through them as
an information officer. I felt so strongly about the professional issue
that I wanted to intervene

amendments of the noble Baroness, Lady Stedman-Scott. I support her
welcome amendments. Of course, children in residential care are among
the most vulnerable. Unfortunately, the way it works is that there
tends to be a placement in foster care and, if that does not work out,
then it is in residential care several broken placements down the line.

welcome what the noble Baroness has said. There is an issue about price

Benjamin:</Member></B> My Lords, I support the amendment of the noble
Baroness, Lady Young. I would like to draw the Committee’s
attention to the case of a young man I know who was brought up in care
for many years. For the first 49 years of his life he kept wondering
who he was and where he came from. This affected his relationship with
his children—when he eventually had children—and with his
wife, who had to deal with his depression. He had a loss of confidence,
did not believe in himself and did not feel worthy. After much
searching he eventually found out who he was and it completely changed
his outlook on life. It changed his mental well-being. He got a better
understanding of who he was and started to accept his situation in
life. That is why I believe that it is an abuse if we deny any young
person information which can help them come to terms with their
identity, culture and background if they wish to do
so<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:38:52"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000086" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000086"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jones of Whitchurch" PimsId="5099" UID="13101433000316" xid="1945" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000316">Baroness

obviously, I welcome and endorse the points made by the noble Baroness,
Lady Young. She made an eloquent speech last week about the importance
of identity and she has raised the issue in a helpful way today in a
different but complementary context. It is no doubt important for
children as they are growing up and becoming fully rounded adults to
know about their history. It is their history and it is their right to
have access to it. We all accept that
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000088" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000088">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:48:29"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:39:44"></hs_TimeCode>
second point to make is that we have talked about children and young
people leaving care but very often adults can be well into middle age
before they really begin to question their identity and want to search
for that information. That provides a particular challenge for the
people who keep the data because we are talking about keeping it for a
very long time. Nevertheless, it is still people’s right to have
access  to
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:40:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

made last week by the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, about people in care
who had been bereaved, having lost their parents, one would have hoped
that somehow or other we could have lined up all these rights to
information and brought them together. We are talking here about the
same sorts of issues coming up in a number of different contexts. I
would have hoped that somewhere in the midst of all that would be a
universal right to that information and that we could address it in
that way rather than in a piecemeal
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:40:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000090" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000090">Thirdly,
I was alarmed to hear noble Lords today talking about data being lost,
or indeed being dumped on a doorstep. There is a real issue here
concerning the 
<?notus-xml column=164?>security of the information. It is rather alarming, and I absolutely
agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth. What has happened to all
those accurate expectations of privacy and security and of records
being kept properly? You cannot help but wonder whether there is going
to be a scandal at some point with all this stuff coming to light,
having been left on a rubbish dump somewhere. I do not think that
anybody here has a sense of reassurance that this information is being
kept securely in a proper place. Perhaps the noble Lord could address
that and say what the requirements are for keeping the information
secure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T17:41:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

add my support for the amendment. The noble Baroness has raised a very
important point, as have the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and the noble
Baroness, Lady Stedman-Scott. In particular, I hope that we will get a
chance to debate the whole question of staying in foster care until the
age of 21. I know that my noble friend Lady Hughes will respond in more
detail on that but I want to pick up one point which the noble Baroness
touched on concerning the distinction between foster care and
residential care. Clearly, there is a distinction and we have to be
careful not just to lump the two issues together. There is a difference
for young people leaving residential care, which is, after all, still
formally an institutional provision. What those young people really
need is a phased transition to independence, rather than just the
requirement to stay on until they are 21. They need help over a period
of time to find their feet and to find independence. Therefore, while
the noble Baroness raised absolutely valid points, I think that we need
to separate them out and make slightly separate provision for them. I
know that we will debate this in more detail when we come to
Amendment 38. Apart from that, we have had a very good debate and I

the noble Baronesses, Lady Young, Lady Massey and Lady Jones, the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, and my noble
friends Lady Hamwee and Lady Benjamin that all young people should be

require the local authority to open a case record in respect of each

turn to the amendment tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, on
providing welfare support for care leavers. The Government are
committed to ensuring that care leavers receive the best platform to
make their way in life but we do not think that extending Section 23C
of the Children Act is the way to improve existing practice. Statutory
guidance on care leavers already sets a clear expectation that local
authorities continue to stay in touch and support their care leavers
until age 21, and beyond if they are in education or training. Local
authorities should respond to requests by assessing the young
person’s needs and preparing a pathway plan.</hs_para>

statutory guidance to make it absolutely clear that local authorities
should ensure that all their care leavers—whether or not they

entitlement to a personal adviser up to age 25, if they wish to engage
in education. That guidance will make it clear that even where a care

importance of care leavers having the ability to stay on in their

this can be particularly important for those remaining in education. We
want local authorities to provide all young people with a menu of

answer here. In the brief life of this Committee, we have heard time

different local authorities and that there is a disconnect between
practice and what already exists, so we are not getting the impact. My

can clarify for the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, a point

desperately trying to summarise what I wanted to say. What actually
happened was that the social worker brought the box around and handed
it over to the person who was hoping for her notes and records but who
just got this box with a load of papers in it in no particular order.
There was no understanding that this was a difficult situation to
handle: the social worker was off again in her car straight away. It
was not just a box of papers dumped on the doorstep but, having said

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, Clause 8 is also about contact: contact
post-adoption. Subsection (5) sets out the points which a court must
consider when there is an application for an order for contact by any
person who has obtained the court’s leave to make that
application. The court must consider: any risk of the application
disrupting the child’s life to the extent that he or she would
be harmed; the applicant’s connection with the child; and
representations made to the court by the child or any person who has
applied for, or been granted, an adoption order. I am quite prepared to
be told I have misread this, because the amendment comes 
<?notus-xml column=168?>out of my own head: it has not been raised by anyone else with me. If I
have got it completely wrong, I apologise to my noble friend who has
put her name  to it.</hs_para>

for considering the welfare of the child. Section 1 of the 1989 Act
states that when the court determines any question with respect to a
child’s upbringing, the child’s welfare is the paramount
consideration. Is that the answer in the sense that it would apply in
any event? If so, why do we have the new subsection (5)(a) about the
risk of disruption to the child’s life, because welfare of the
child would clearly cover that? It seems to me that the balance of the
clause as drafted, the presumption, is that if the risk of disruption
to the child’s life is slim, you should not take account of it.
I am curious—to use a term used earlier in a different
context—about what has and what has not gone into the clause. I

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I am happy to support my noble friend
Lady Hamwee’s amendment, because it is never a bad thing to draw
attention to the paramountcy principle in the 1989 Act and the fact
that the welfare of the child must be pre-eminent. What she is
suggesting is really nice, because it is positive. What we have in
Clause 8(5)(a) is negative: that you should not do it if there is any
risk. My noble friend is saying that you should do it if it is to the
benefit of the child. I am a very positive person and I should like it

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope that I can reassure my noble
friends Lady Hamwee and Lady Walmsley on this point. We are very
concerned to ensure that when the child has contact, it benefits the
child. There is both the positive side, when contact benefits the
child; and the negative side, to protect the child where such contact
is not regarded as being in their interest. It is striking that
research has shown that the proportion of children suffering negative
consequences from contact after adoption is twice the proportion for
those for whom contact had a positive effect. In the light of that,
this must obviously be weighed up extremely carefully.</hs_para>

noble friends are clearly well aware that the paramount consideration
of the court must be the welfare of the child throughout his or her

states that the paramount consideration of the court when coming to a
decision relating to the adoption of a child must be the welfare of the
child throughout his life. I hope that that gives the reassurance that
my noble friend is looking for. If it does not, I am more than happy to
write to clarify, but I hope that she can be reassured that the balance
is right and that the protections  that she wants are indeed

effectiveness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000118" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000118">In
a debate on a previous amendment, I spoke about the Department for
Education’s data pack on improving the performance of local
authorities with regard to looked-after children. This data pack
contains checklists and recommendations. I will not repeat the advice
given there, but simply say that monitoring and evaluating
effectiveness is good not only for clients—in this case, care
leavers—but for the local authority. The duties on care leavers
are set out in the Children Act 1989 and are clear. We all know that
local authorities have many duties, and perhaps not much money, but
surely evaluating practice is an important one. There is also good
practice to share. After all, if local authorities do not monitor and
evaluate practice, how do they know what is going on and how it might
be improved? I was intrigued by the intervention of the noble Lord,
Lord Northbourne, which seemed to be about the difference between
“should” and “must”. Guidance is presumably
the “should” bit, but guidance is not always respected.

37 involves the improvement of safeguarding and the educational
achievement of looked-after children. I understand that the Government
are planning to revise the guidance on promoting the education of
looked-after children to reflect that the virtual school head teacher
will be statutory early next year; maybe the Minister can confirm and
clarify that. At least 15 local authorities have virtual school head
teachers already working with care leavers up to the age of 25. Pilots
have taken place, with positive results in, for example, Hertfordshire
and Oxfordshire. The purpose of my amendment is to seek to ensure that
the education of looked-after children covers young people after the
age of 18, just as local authorities have a duty to support the
educational achievement of care leavers up to the age of 25.</hs_para>

educational needs reforms proposed in the Bill, the Government have
recognised the importance of extending support to vulnerable pupils
beyond statutory school age, from birth to 25 years, through education,
health and care plans. This is, of course especially important as care
leavers are less likely than their peers to achieve academically. It is
vital that care leavers benefit from the same overview provided by

variation across the country and legislation was to ensure that this
variation was eliminated; again, I look to the Minister for

looked-after children and care leavers, not simply for reinforcing
practice which exists already. I hope for a positive response in this

9 is one of the few parts of the Bill that provides extra support for

achievement of looked-after children. The role is usually referred to
as a “virtual school head teacher” or “virtual

this amendment necessary? Well, the most recent figures we have show
that in 2011-12, just 14% of children looked after for at least one
year achieved A* to C in GCSEs, including English and Maths. That

who have entered the care system, and who are likely to have
experienced abuse or neglect before entry into care, need additional
educational support. Once in care, the disruption that can be caused by

parents and grandparents, I am sure we all know that young people
approaching their GCSEs have enough to contend with without needing to
worry about whether they will be living in the same house when they
take the exams. For many young people in care, this is a common
reality. It is little wonder that their success rates in exams lag
behind the norm. The original proposal to require local authorities to
provide a virtual head was contained in the report of the All-Party
Parliamentary Group for Looked after Children and Care Leavers,

allows for a level of financial support for eligible children, which is
currently about £600 per annum, to be used by their school. The
all-party group report also noted that virtual heads have little
control over how the pupil premium is spent and recommended that the
system would be more effective if they were given control of this
resource. As the present Children’s Minister recommended that
these changes were necessary when he chaired the all-party group, I am
sure that I am not alone in being a little disappointed that they are
not included in the Bill.</hs_parafo>

of their introduction remain and I hope that when we consider the Bill
on Report, we will ensure that these provisions are properly made. The
case for allowing the pupil premium to be controlled by the virtual
school head seems to be supported by recent comments made by
Ofsted’s chief inspector Sir Michael Wilshaw. He expressed
concern that a significant minority of schools are struggling to show
how their use of the premium is having any significant impact upon the
attainment of those pupils it was intended to assist, so clearly there
is an issue that Ofsted recognises. I hope that the Minister will see
the wisdom of this amendment, and I look forward to his

theme throughout the considerations of this Committee. It is not that

particular about the pupil premium. It is a brilliant little idea. I
admit that when I first looked at the Bill and when we were discussing
it at Second Reading, I could not be against the notion of the virtual
school head but it did not quite ring right with me. I was not against
it but I was just not sure that it would have any impact. Perhaps those
local authorities that have voluntarily carried it out and feel they
own it will make a success of it. My worry was that once you made it
statutory throughout the nation, it would become just a job to be done
and a box to be ticked. It needed some sort of bite beneath it that
would give it teeth and make sure that something happened. I did not
raise this at Second Reading because I could not think of anything at
the time, but I think that the pupil premium might be one of those
things that means that schools and other places in the education system
have to sit up and listen because there is a control of resource in
someone else’s hands.

are perhaps one or two other reasons. My noble friend Lord Touhig was
right to say that the evidence at the moment is that some schools are
not spending the money to greatest effect. Many are, and there are now
lots of things that will help them spend the pupil premium to great
effect, such as the toolkit. A lot of good work is being done by Ofsted
and a lot of people. My worry is that this could be one of the cases
where the group of people on whom it is spent least effectively are
those children who are looked after. They seem to miss out on every bit
of the system. This gives us a chance to make sure that in this we
actually give them a head
start.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000131" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000131">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:25:27"></hs_TimeCode>
envisage that those people who are virtual heads could build up a body
of expertise and experience about how best to spend the pupil premium.
In that way, they could be champions of spending quite a significant
amount of money. I am sure that teachers throughout schools in all
local authorities might then look to them for advice. I trust that they
will do it carefully. I would sooner the amendment said “in
partnership with schools” because I do not think it will work
unless it is in partnership with schools.

consideration here, if it were to be brought back on Report, my noble

years in the attainment of looked-after children, progress is nowhere

transformative—effect. One of Ofsted’s key findings in
that report referred to the very effective support virtual school heads
provide. That support not only made a difference to children’s
educational progress but often enhanced the stability of their

the aim of Amendment 36, I am sympathetic to the motivation of the
noble Lord, Lord Touhig, and the noble Baroness, Lady Morris. If we
want to maximise the benefits of pupil premium funding it is right to
expect the virtual school head to have a role. As 
<?notus-xml column=173?>looked-after children will attract a pupil premium plus of £1,900

vital.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000135" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000135">We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:24:59"></hs_TimeCode>
have therefore signalled our plans to extend the role of the virtual

ensure that the money is spent on securing the best educational support
for children in care. Discussions between the school and local
authority on the content of a child’s personal education plan
and how the pupil premium will be used to support meeting the needs set
out in that plan are crucial. That is a message that we intend strongly

outcomes are not good enough compared to their peers and I recognise
entirely how important it is that someone is there to support care
leavers who are in, or who wish to return to, education. I can see
therefore why there are calls to extend the role of the virtual school

I share the objective of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, in the
amendment, I believe that addressing the educational needs of care
leavers will not necessarily be met by adding a new duty to Section
23B. Extending in statute the role of the virtual school head to care
leavers too widely risks undermining the very reason we are making the
role statutory: to redouble our efforts to narrow the intractable
attainment gap between what looked-after children achieve compared to
their peers. If we extend the role of the virtual school head, it would
add significant burdens to the local authority and the person
undertaking that role and would dilute the impact of the role. We do
not wish to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000138">I do not

recall a couple of relevant episodes while on the All-Party

wanted to join this young man, and soon afterwards he lost his
accommodation. I think that he also ran up a big back rent. A foster
carer talked to me about a young girl who had been excited by the
prospect of moving into independent accommodation at 17 or whatever,
and his comment was, “Well, she was doing so well at school
while she was with me, but now that she’s independent she
obviously has other priorities”. We should try to normalise the
experience so that it is what we would want for our own children: we

unfortunately many of them may turn to men who will not treat them
well. For them this has been the norm and their experience. It has
been<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:34:59"></hs_TimeCode> striking
for me, in recently meeting young women who have been allowed to stay
with their foster carers past the age of 18, that they have a good
continuing relationship with their male foster carer—and one can
hope that they have a better model of how a man can relate to a woman

people are living at home longer than ever, with an average of leaving
home now at well over 24, yet many children in foster care, who are
arguably among the most vulnerable in society, are still required to
leave their foster home at the age of just 17. Those who get to stay
past their 18th birthday are either the lucky few, funded by their
local authority, or fortunate enough to have foster carers who can
afford to offer them a home for free and support them out of their own
pockets. Research shows that the longer a young person can stay with a
foster family, the more successful they are later on. In 2011-12, only
320 young people remained with their foster carers past the age of 18,
which is only 5% of care leavers; in the most recent year, only 10 more
young people stayed put. It has been put to me that, in the current

leavers are more likely to be unemployed, young single parents, mental
service users, homeless or in prison than those who grew up in their
own families. This amendment to the Children Act 1989 is really
important, in that it would allow young people to remain with their
foster carers up to the age of 21. Staying Put has been piloted already
in 10 local authorities across England, with great success. Young
people who stayed with foster carers were twice as likely to be in
full-time education at 19, compared to those who did 
<?notus-xml column=176?>not. Those staying put gave young people more control over their lives
and their transition from care. Studies have shown that allowing young
people to remain in care until 21 is associated with increased,
post-secondary educational attainment, delayed pregnancy and higher
earners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000149" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000149">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:37:31"></hs_TimeCode>
benefits to care leavers and to society of extending care have been
found to outweigh the cost to government by a factor of at least 2:1,
so staying put represents value for money. The department’s
evaluation of the pilot found that to implement the policy nationally
would require £2.7 million per year. This modest funding could
be found partly through a smarter use of existing expenditure but,
given all the burdens being placed on local authorities, it is only
reasonable, especially as central government will be the greatest
beneficiary in the long term, that a sum is set aside to enable local
authorities to make the transition to this new arrangement, with many
more—we hope that soon it will reach 25%—staying

point out the saving to state-funded services, I turn first to housing.
For every young person staying put with their former foster carer
instead of independent living before they are ready, a one-bedroom flat
is freed up locally, so this saves on local authorities paying rent on
such properties in the private sector at high expense. Many care
leavers who are forced to live independently before they are ready
build up huge rent arrears, and that money is rarely recouped. Staying
put is successful also in tackling the benefits cycle that young people
are often at risk of entering. The one-to-one support and guidance
offered by foster carers to young people in their transition to
adulthood is crucial to ensuring that they can be helped on the road to
becoming net contributors to society as adults, rather than a drain on
resources. Those who stay put are more likely to be working full-time
or part-time, or studying, and hence claim less housing benefit and
income
support.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000151" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0001.htm#13101433000151">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:39:31"></hs_TimeCode>
Children’s Minister strongly shares our belief that more young
people should be allowed to stay with their foster carers for longer,
and I am grateful to the Minister for taking a couple of occasions over
the summer to talk to me about this issue. I recognise that the
Government really want to see this happen, but they are in favour of a
voluntary
approach<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:39:38"></hs_TimeCode>. As I
have said, over the past year, only 10 more young people have taken up
the Staying Put offer, so overall there has been a 0% increase because

is happening is that, even in the current situation, many young people
and foster carers have had to fight with their local authorities to
allow and support Staying Put placements. We need an end to this
postcode lottery. It is unacceptable that at a time when young people
should be focusing on their education and training, as the noble Lord,
Lord Touhig, said, they face doubt and anxiety over their future.
Interviews with former pilots show that half had scaled back the
provision, either by reducing the maximum age from 21 to 19 or by
excluding NEETS, who are the people most in need of support and
guidance. While I welcome the Government’s current interest in
care leavers and the many important measures that they are bringing 
<?notus-xml column=177?>forward, I believe that without legislation, too few fostered young
people will have a realistic chance of staying with their foster carers
beyond the age of 18. This is a rare opportunity to change the law and
ensure that the next generation of care leavers is given a better start
in adult life. My parents would not have wished there to be any
uncertainty that I would not get the support I needed to go through my
education and go to university. I am sure that noble Lords as parents
would also want to be certain that they could support their daughters
and sons through whatever they chose to do during their transition to
adult life. So far, I have not heard anything from the Government to
reassure me that we will see this happen soon. If we introduce this
provision in the legislation, within a short time we would see hundreds
of young people on a better course as they left care. I look forward to
the Minister’s
response<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T18:41:47"></hs_TimeCode> and I

Young of Hornsey:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support this
amendment. As I said earlier, it is part of a suite of amendments aimed
at making the lives of young people in care more palatable. The idea of
being told at the age of 16, 17 or 18 that you are going to be
independent and that you will live in a flat, with minimal training in
handling a budget and coping with the unwanted visitor referred to by
my noble friend Lord Listowel who will derail your attempts to study or
work, is unthinkable in relation to our own children. There is a
concept that we should think of children in care or looked-after
children as being our children, so we should do everything we can to
ensure that they do not experience even more disadvantage.</hs_para>

repeat all the statistics, research and evidence put before the
Committee by my noble friend; suffice it to say that the Staying Put
scheme was piloted in 11 local authorities. As he has said, the
outcomes for the young people who stayed with their foster carers were
significantly and substantially better than for those who were not able
to do so. It gave them an opportunity to take more control over their
lives and to make more successful transitions from care towards
independent adulthood. The Fostering Network found that none of the
pilot authorities reported significant problems with foster carer
provision as a result of offering the Staying Put scheme, which I know
is a concern that has been expressed by some people. While a minority
did say that staying put would mean that in theory a former foster bed
would no longer be available, it is often the case that foster carers
plan to retire after the placement ends and would have been retiring at
whatever age the young person left, whether or not it was beyond the
age of 18. In addition, foster carer recruitment strategies have simply
been amended to suit the new needs of the service.</hs_para>

Indeed, because many of them now want to provide a Staying Put

it requires a slightly different approach to fostering and its role,

it actively assisted in recruitment of foster parents. He

Put has made a massive difference to [our local authority]. It has
created a feel good factor in children’s services. It is now a

want to focus on that last phrase “dumping them” because

the economic arguments are, of course, important, we should not lose
sight of the moral and compassionate arguments. It is unacceptable for
an 18 year-old coming out of the care system to harbour that feeling of
being dumped, of being discarded again by an uncaring system. Staying
Put is one way of reassuring those young people that they have not been
left without support. If it were up to me, it would probably be a
little older than 21 ideally. I see this as a rare opportunity to make
sure that the next generation of care leavers gets a much better start

Listowel, has said. I remember him stalking in the Corridor in July; he
was very excited and asked whether I would support this. I did not
indicate but walked away and reflected on what he had said. I remember
my professional circumstances, where foster parents at my school came
to talk to me about this issue and how upset they were. It was quite
traumatic for them as foster carers to lose children at 18 when they
had so much more to offer in those important years. I thought about my
own children. At 18 my daughter has just gone to university. It has
been a very difficult time for her and she has needed the support of
her parents, her family and friends.</hs_para>

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, the meeting arranged by the noble Earl
brought a number of comments about Staying Put. It was clear that there
is a shortage of accessible information—particularly because not

<?notus-xml column=179?>all authorities are operating the system—and that there are real
complications when there are cross-boundary considerations. That
follows on from the point made by the noble and learned
Baroness.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000162" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000162">Some
things were mentioned which really took me aback. When a young person
becomes 18, if he or she does stay with the foster parents a tenancy
agreement has to be signed. As a couple of the young people we met
said, “This does not reflect our relationship. They are our
foster parents; they are not our landlords”. It is necessary, I
understand, to have a tenancy agreement in order to qualify for housing
benefit and income support. I asked how the total income compared to
fostering allowances and I was told by the foster carer we met that the
total income had reduced by about 50%. He was very enthusiastic about
his foster daughter remaining with him. That foster daughter also
said—she was part of a sibling group—that she had to be
CRB checked in order to stay with her sisters. Something has gone wrong
with the
system.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000163" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000163"></hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-14?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_14_PT_1/FC4E4453F740E04225F2ED1D684DFDBE54E1DA27" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 14 October 2013">Monday,

Walmsley:</Member></B> My Lords, I, too, have my name on the amendment
and support it wholeheartedly. The noble Earl, in his introduction,
used the word “normalising”. We are trying to normalise
the relationship between the young people and their foster carers
because, as my noble friend Lord Storey pointed out, most young people
who grow up in their birth family do not leave home at 18. They stay
on.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000165">I was
interested in what the noble Baroness, Lady Young, said about the
pilots. It did not have an adverse effect on the recruitment of foster
carers; indeed, it had a beneficial effect. It occurs to me that the
Government might be a little concerned that if we make it a right for
young people, if they and their foster carers wish it, to stay on until
21, it will take away foster parenting places for other children coming
into the system. Frankly, I think that we should be putting more effort
into turning the tap off and giving more support to families so that
children can safely stay with their birth parents, but that is an
argument for another day. That might be the case, but I have a
suggestion that might fulfil some of the need without the problem of
taking away a foster-caring place for some other child. I have promoted
this idea to successive Children’s Ministers over the past few
years, who all say, “That sounds like a good idea”, but
nothing ever gets
done.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000166" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000166">Many
children go off to university or college, or to work somewhere else
when they are 18, but they maintain a close and supportive relationship
with their birth families. Why not allow foster parents, if they so
wish, and the young person wishes, to have a sort of little stipend or
retainer to act as a supporter and adviser to the care leaver for the
next few years when they have left the bedroom in the house? That
bedroom would then be freed up. A lot of young people who get on very
well with their foster parents go back and visit them and ask for
advice anyway. But many of them, knowing that the parents may have
taken on another foster child and will be busy, would be hesitant to go
back to the foster parent and ask for help and advice when things go
pear-shaped, such as their accommodation or education plans going
wrong, 
<?notus-xml column=180?>or they have trouble with their employment. Whatever it is, they would
have somebody officially who was being paid a little bit by the state
to help them and stop new arrangements breaking down. It is when they
break down that the state has a great deal more cost liability to try
to put things right. There is an existing relationship of trust,
understanding, knowledge and emotion. If the Government cannot accept
the noble Earl’s amendment—I very much hope that they
will—perhaps the Minister will consider my suggestion of a sort
of halfway house. The parent could retain that relationship formally
and, one hopes, the care leaver would have no hesitation in going back
to that person for advice if things went
wrong.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000167" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000167"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Massey of Darwen" PimsId="1738" UID="13101433000342" xid="1343" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000342">Baroness
Massey of Darwen:</Member></B> My Lords, I strongly support this
amendment. I have heard the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, talk about
this halfway house before. It is not a bad idea, but I hope that we can
go the full way, for two reasons. First, there is the
cost-effectiveness, which one or two people have mentioned. We
sometimes forget that early intervention can actually save money in the
long run; we should not forget that. Early intervention is not just
about babies or children but older people. This example applies and it
can be effective in this case. Cost-effectiveness was the first thing
that I wanted to
mention.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000168" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000168">The
second thing is the incredible importance of education, which has also
been mentioned. Young people in education tend not to get pregnant when
they are 15 or 16, they tend not to misuse drugs or alcohol, and they
tend to do better if they are encouraged in that education. Like the
noble Lord, Lord Storey, I was very impressed by the young woman at the
meeting we had last week, who talked about the importance of education
to her. As we know, education is such a key thing for all children, but
particularly for these children. Therefore for me, cost effects on
education swing this towards the Minister accepting this
amendment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000169" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000169"><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Howarth of Breckland" PimsId="1029" UID="13101433000343" xid="1642" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000343"><B>Ba</B><B>roness
Howarth of Breckland</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, I will not repeat
all the arguments that have been made, but of course, I want to support
this. However, I will take it from a slightly different angle. I am
quite sure that the Government do not want to take away from the
determination that the local authority has to do its work. I know that
devolution is important, and that the independence of the local
authorities, such as it is, is valuable. Therefore I can understand
that that might well be a government point of view. I can understand
that the Local Government Association may have some concerns about
additional responsibilities being added in statute, and I can
understand some of the arguments, such as that if we have older young
people in placements, they may block placements when we are short of
foster-parents.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000170" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000170">I
have looked at those issues. It is quite clear that unless there is
something absolutely straightforward, either legislation or regulation,
in this area, local authorities will not be consistent in their care of
over-18s. I have numerous case studies, which I will not read out now,
but they have made me think that I need to speak about this in this
way, rather than supporting the independence of local authorities, as I
usually do as a 
<?notus-xml column=181?>vice-president of the LGA. Time and again, we read of young
people—and I have met them alone, and with the noble Earl, Lord
Listowel—who tell heartbreaking stories of their education and
of how their success in other areas is being stymied because they have
to leave their family in which they have all their relationships. We
are failing significantly to understand that emotional
context.</hs_para>

on numerous occasions about their own children. Sometimes you do not
get rid of them until they are 30. They do a lot of things in between,
and you still take them back. I have not had children of my own but I
have brought up more than most, and I know about that trauma. Secondly,
I understand that fostering, and numbers, are now improving, and that
we have to look at that in a different way. It was explained to
me—and this is not an area in which I have recent
expertise—that foster parents who take adolescents often retire,
as has been said, but also tend not to take small children when they
need a placement. You need a different set of skills and you are
looking for different foster parents. The idea that these young people
are blocking a foster place is not a real
one.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000172" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000172">I can

today, in a general remand court, and I took a note of the type of
cases we heard. I had 26 defendants in front of me today, five of whom
were in the age range of 18 to 21: a perfectly typical illustration of
the age range that we see. Although it is not always obvious in court
what someone’s background is, I would make an educated guess,
based on their previous criminal history, that four of those five had
been in some sort of care: that was not a surprise. The fifth defendant
was a foreign national who was only 20 years old and was living rough
in London.</hs_para>

of the type of defendants whom I see in my adult work in central
London, and that is why I support so strongly the amendment moved by
the noble Earl. I would see a similar distribution in my youth work,
and this one amendment could make more difference than any other single
amendment we are talking about this

Morgan of Drefelin (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Baroness,
Lady Young, made a point about the age of 21. Noble Lords are sharing
their experiences of parenting today, and the thought that my 21
year-old could be launched out into the world now fills me with
anxiety. I feel that she is on a bit of elastic, will be coming back
every so often and we will be there for her as things go on. I
understand the evidence put very eloquently by the noble Earl, Lord
Listowel, for this proposition, which I support. However, this is such
an 
<?notus-xml column=182?>unusual opportunity that I wonder whether we should be saying 21 or 25.
It might be pushing it slightly to say 25, but 21 seems so young. This
is about making evidence-based policy, so I would be interested to know
what the evidence is for the age of 21.</hs_para>

Hughes of Stretford:</Member></B> My Lords, I do not want to delay the
Committee but I want to make a few quick comments in support of this
amendment. It is very dear to my heart, as I was Minister of State for
Children when we instituted the pilots to which several noble Lords
have referred. One reason we did that was because, in the White Paper
we wrote at that time, I felt strongly that one of our guiding
principles in going forward and trying to improve the situation for
children in care—a view shared by members of the
Committee—was that we should provide them, as far as possible,
with the same opportunities that we would want for our own children. As
so many noble Lords have said, we have seen a social change over the
last 20 years in that our young adult children do not leave home at 16,
17 or 18. Even if they go to university, their bedroom is still there
and they come back. They often come back after they have done their
studies and they now do not leave home until, on average, their
mid-twenties. When the state is the parent, we have to aspire to the
same opportunity for those children for whom we are collectively
responsible. This is one of the most compelling reasons why we should
extend these pilots and make them national.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13101433000177" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000177">The benefits to the
young people in the pilots have already been well expressed and I will
not rehearse them. There is, of course, a cost. The Department for
Education has estimated, on the basis of the pilots, that the cost of
instituting Staying Put nationally would be £2.7 million. I know
that it does not work out as an average because some local authorities
have more children in care than others, but, on average, that is
£18,000 per annum, per local authority—not per child or
per placement: per local authority. So the costs, relative to the
benefits, are very small and, as we have heard, there are additional
savings to the state from some of the state-funded benefits and support
that would have been reduced in the
pilots.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000178" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000178">The
Minister in reply to the previous debate said that helping care leavers
to stay in education and training was vital. He also said that when the
legislation is being changed, we need evidence of impact. I put it to
the Minister that this particular proposal satisfies both of those
criteria. If we were in government, and if we are in government again,
this is something we would definitely be looking to see if we could
fund because the costs relative to the benefits are also small. I hope
the Minister will consider this
favourably.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000179" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000179"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Nash" PimsId="7004" UID="13101433000347" xid="2171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000347">Lord
Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the opportunity to debate the
important subject of how local authorities support care leavers. I
fully understand concerns raised by noble Lords, including the noble
Earl, Lord Listowel, the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss,
the noble Baronesses, Lady Young, Lady Massey, Lady Morgan and Lady
Howarth, the noble Lord, Lord Ponsonby, and my noble friends Lord
Storey, Lady Howe and Lady Walmsley, and many external parties 
<?notus-xml column=183?>about the ongoing support for care leavers. As the noble Lord has said,
we have had the opportunity of discussing this matter privately on a
couple of occasions recently. I look forward to further discussions
with him on this matter as he knows I also feel strongly on this
subject.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000180" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000180">We
have emphasised the importance of staying put in revised statutory
guidance, because we recognise that for many young people the ability
to stay on with their former foster carers, particularly when they are
in further and higher education, is the right decision. The Minister
for Children and Families wrote to all directors of children’s
services last October, encouraging them to prioritise their staying put
arrangements, so that all young people who wanted to could benefit from
this provision. I accept there is more to do. Naturally we are
disappointed that the 2013 statistical returns from local authorities
show only a marginal increase in young people in staying put provision.
However, we should recognise that these figures collected by local
authorities are a snapshot at 19 and they run only until March 2013, so
there is not much time to see the impact of the actions we have taken
since 2012. Moreover, they do not tell us about the number of young
people who might be benefiting from this provision from the age of 18,
and who will leave this arrangement before they turn 19. From next year
the department will be collecting data at age 18, 20 and 21, and will
be able to see from 2014 how many young people are benefiting from this
provision before and after the age of
19.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000181" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000181">Our
approach is and has been to improve practice. We are continuing to look
for ways to promote and encourage this. We have already worked with Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and
Pensions to issue practical guidance on staying put to help carers and
local authorities around tax and benefit issues. As I have already
said, the revised Ofsted inspection framework that comes into practice
in November has a specific focus on the quality of leaving care
services. A focus on the care leaver assessment will be on
accommodation, and inspectors will consider staying put opportunities.
Being able to stay in placements beyond 18 is mentioned within one of
the grade descriptors of the care leavers’ judgement. We will
monitor closely the reports on these inspections and feedback from care
leavers, and expect to see significant improvements in 2014 and 2015 in
the number of young people staying put. In addition, through our work
with the National Care Advisory Service, my department will encourage
local authorities to share effective practice where they are making
good progress in this respect. While doing everything that we can to
promote staying put, we must recognise that this sort of provision will
not be appropriate for all young people. Care leavers, like their
peers, have different needs, and attitudes regarding their transition
to adulthood. The crucial point is that young people should be offered
a range of placements that are safe and suitable, and meet their
individual needs. I want to reassure noble Lords that the Government
want to encourage all looked-after children to stay in 
<?notus-xml column=184?>care until they are 18 and beyond, where this is the right choice for
them. We want to do everything we can for all care
leavers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000182" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000182">I
recognise the strength of feeling expressed today, and wish to take the
issue away to consider further what more we can do to increase the
numbers of young people in staying-put arrangements. I understand that
noble Lords feel there is a case that all we are doing is not enough. I
have asked my officials to work further with the Fostering Network and
others on this issue. The noble Baroness, Lady Hughes, mentioned a
figure of £2.5 million, which is no longer our view of the
figure, although it is a figure that the Fostering Network has recently
come up with. We believe the figure is considerably higher, but we will
be working with the Fostering Network to see if we can pin this figure
down further. I would be pleased to discuss this issue further with the
noble Earl over the coming
weeks.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000183" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000183">I hope
that what I have said reassures noble Lords of our commitment to this
issue and I therefore urge the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, the noble

Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> I thank the Minister for his reply.
Before thanking colleagues, perhaps I may put a few questions on the
detail to the Minister. With regard to the timescale, he was good
enough in his comments just now to say that he expected a significant
increase in the next two years in the number of young people staying
put. Perhaps he would like to write to me with a clearer timescale. My
concern is that unless we move quickly on this in the next one, two,
three or four years, hundreds of young people will miss out on a
pathway which we know would do them a lot of good and mean that they
would have much better outcomes. If the Minister wishes to take a
different approach, the voluntary approach, I should be grateful if he
could make clear when he hopes to achieve the target of 25%, which I
think is the government target. It would also be helpful to know what
steps the Government will take if that target is not reached or if good
progress is not made in that direction. Those are just a couple of
questions. He may prefer to write to me rather than answer them

should have made clear a couple of things in my opening remarks. First,
11 local authorities took part in the pilots to begin with. Then two of
them merged, so it became 10. That is the reason for the disparity 
<?notus-xml column=185?>between the comments made by my noble friend Lady Young and me about the
number of local authorities in the pilot evaluation. I also omitted to
say that some of the local authorities taking part in the evaluation
were selecting young people who work in education or training, so that
does not give us as clear a picture about the successful outcome as one
might like. I think that it is still very clear, but I want your

of children will miss out on an education, a training or employment and
go down much worse pathways if we do not grab the nettle and act now. I

is much to the Government’s credit that they have signed the
European directive on human trafficking and, indeed, are in the process

with the children. They are placed in the care of a local authority,
not under care proceedings, which we discussed earlier today, but under
Section 17 of the Children Act 1989, which requires local authorities
to look after a child in their area. They are placed with the nearest
local authority by whoever has identified them as trafficked, and the

the children have a mobile phone, as they usually do, they are given a
number and are told to ring the trafficker. The trafficker waits
outside the care home, or very often the home of the short-term foster
parents who have not had time to get organised with this child who is
suddenly dumped on them: the child gets the telephone call, goes out of
the front door and is never heard of again. Those children are
trafficked or retrafficked. Something like 300-odd children have been
identified as being trafficked, and that, I suspect, is the tip of the
iceberg.</hs_para>

reasons for asking for a local authority to have parental
responsibility are twofold. One is that these foreign children do not
have anyone in this country with any responsibility for them until they
get to the local authority—perhaps with the exception of those
who are trafficking them, who may be relatives. Secondly, the local
authority does not have parental responsibility, as defined in the
Children Act, for these accommodated children; it simply has a
requirement to accommodate them. It is right to say that there is a
requirement to look after them but if they do not have parental
responsibility—and local authority social services know exactly
what parental responsibility means—that is what they receive
after they get a care order. Even an interim care order gives them a
joint parental responsibility with the family. However, for these
foreign children there is nobody with parental
responsibility.</hs_para>

may not be the best way of dealing with this; there are two views on
it. I have tabled this amendment because I am concerned that,
currently, local authorities are not treating these children with the
seriousness that they should. Local authorities 
<?notus-xml column=187?>are overworked and very often under-resourced. These children are dumped
on them at very short notice, identified as having been trafficked and
are not given the same degree of care as a child who goes through the
care process in this country. It seems that there are two ways forward
here. Either the local authority makes a care application, which costs
money—and it is getting more and more expensive for local
authorities to make care applications—or, as I suggest, there
should be an automatic parental responsibility. It would not cost a
penny but it would flag up to local authorities the actual
responsibility they have for these children who are dumped on them.
They cannot just accommodate them and not really take that extra step

will allow me. It is extraordinary that there are children in this
country, from wherever they have come, for whom the local authority
fails to take some sort of action. I do not often say this but, in my
day, children would be seen as having no parental cover whatever and
there would be no doubt that the local authority would have had a care
order. There is no doubt that that would have happened in the past. The
noble Baroness, Lady Howe,

understand why we want fewer court proceedings. Having been the chair
of CAFCASS, I absolutely understand that. They are expensive and are
often not helpful to the child’s experience, never mind that of
the local authority. Under the 1948 Act we had a way of ensuring that
children were placed under the equivalent of a care order by a process
in the local authority. In the days of Sections 1 and 2 of the Children
Act 1948, one lot of children went to court and the others went through
a process in the local authority. We should ask the officials to look
at this. Without a doubt we have a national responsibility to protect
this small cohort of children. I have come into contact with 
<?notus-xml column=189?>them because I deal with serious sexual abuse issues. The girls who are
trafficked are seriously sexually abused. It is not just prostitution;
it is abhorrent prostitution. Unless we find ways of protecting these
youngsters they will just slip away and disappear, not of their own
choice. I support the noble and learned Baroness in her attempt to find
a way that is not expensive but which secures these children’s

Hamwee:</Member></B> My Lords, I have put my name to the amendment. I
think that I could sum it up by saying that it would turn accommodation
into care, and it is care that is needed. It is not surprising that
children in this situation go missing, because the only people whom
they know are those who have trafficked them. If they are given the
means of staying in touch, as so often they seem to be, they will
respond to a contact or make contact themselves. It seems that very
often the first thing that happens is that they are given a mobile
phone and instructed: “You keep in touch with us”.
Whether this is the right way of going about it I do not know, but I
have heard those around me who have much more recent or, indeed,
current local authority experience muttering, “But the local
authority has to do this”. Well, let us find a way of making
sure that the local authority does more than what fulfils cold letters
on paper and actually produces the
service.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000213"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Storey" PimsId="5937" UID="13101433000364" xid="2146" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000364">Lord
Storey:</Member></B> My Lords, I would like to explore this in a bit
more detail. Perhaps the Minister, if he is not able to give the
information in his reply, could write to us. My experience in local
government and as a head teacher is that, of course, children are
trafficked, but some are trafficked because their parents in another
part of the world want a better life for them, so they pay someone to
put them on a plane and the poor child then arrives in the UK. As I
understand it, there are regional centres where the children are
received. There is one in Dover. Liverpool was and is another regional
centre. The children come to Liverpool and Liverpool tries as best it
can within the resources to cater for them and to look after them. I
know that for two reasons. One is that, four or five years ago, our
director of social services wrote a report saying, “Look, my
budget can’t cope with the number coming in. We want to help,
but it seems unfair financially that 
<?notus-xml column=190?>Liverpool should carry this burden”. Secondly, I also know as a
head teacher that some of these children have been put into foster
care. I gave the example at a meeting of a Mongolian street child,
whose grandparents had paid a trafficker to bring him to the UK. He
landed in London but was sent to a regional centre, which happened to
be Liverpool, where he was fostered with a wonderful family in
Halewood. He came to my school and he was well looked after. For me,
the issue is not the reluctance of local authorities to deal with this
but the sheer size of the problem and the support that they get. I hope
that that makes
sense.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000214"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Listowel" PimsId="1518" UID="13101433000365" xid="1317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000365">The
Earl of Listowel:</Member></B> I am reminded of the report by my noble
friend Lord Laming on the death of Victoria Climbié. One of the
comments made by the social workers in Haringey who were interviewed
was that they were overwhelmed at the time, particularly by
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children and young people. This can put a
heavy burden on local authorities. I have another, related experience
of visiting a children’s home some years ago. I spoke to the
manager, who was very experienced—in many ways, she was a
remarkable manager—but when it came to working with
unaccompanied asylum-seeking children, she felt that these were not
their children. She had enough to do looking after the children with
whom she had to deal, rather than having to deal with these other
children, if you like. There is a difficulty and perhaps the amendment
is a helpful way of tackling it. Some people will just say,
“Look, we have enough on our plate. We don’t want to
think about these extra children and we’ll find ways not to do
so”. I am not sure whether that is exactly the issue in hand,
but my experience is that, understandably, given the strains on social
services and the immense emotional burden that caring for children with
complex needs brings with it, some people can find ways to rationalise
not giving proper care to vulnerable children because those children
come from a very different background from
theirs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:31:49"></hs_TimeCode>.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:35:07"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000215"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Jones of Whitchurch" PimsId="5099" UID="13101433000366" xid="1945" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000366">Baroness
Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, I am extremely grateful to
the noble and learned Baroness for tabling this amendment. We all share
her abhorrence at what is currently happening out there in the way that
the care system is routinely failing trafficked children. I was
interested to hear what the noble Lord, Lord Storey, said. One aspect
of it might be that children whose parents want a better future for
them come here voluntarily. However, the people that the noble and
learned Baroness is talking about are duped into coming here on
completely false pretences. They are told they are coming for
waitressing jobs or otherwise to earn money. They certainly do not
expect to come in the mode of being owned by a gang member, which is
where they find themselves. The noble Lord is right that there is some
good local authority practice but that is where people want help and
support genuinely to make a better future here: these are not the same
people.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13101433000216" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000216">This
all goes to show that the problem for local authorities is much bigger,
in the round, than we are looking at. There are people who come in on
the noble Lord’s terms and those who come in on the noble and
learned Baroness’s terms. There are some excellent 
<?notus-xml column=191?>charities working in this sector, as well as the local authorities who
are providing a safe haven and proper care and advice for these young
people. However, they need to do more and they are very much the
exception. All too often, everyone feels powerless to prevent those
children who are rescued disappearing. It is not just that they are
being traded and sold into slavery and sexual abuse. Very often, the
children go along with the gang members because they are spooked by
some form of black magic which is endemic in their original societies
or they feel that their families will be threatened by violence back at
home if they do not go along with it. In no sense are they involved
voluntarily: this is under absolute fear, duress and panic. It is a
scandal that we are allowing this to happen on our territory and are
unable to prevent it.</hs_para>

the proposals of the noble and learned Baroness. I do not know well
enough what difference it would make but it would be fair to say that
if it did make a big difference it would have a cost implication. If it
were not going to make much difference, it would not. We have to own up
to the fact that there may be a cost implication to what is being
proposed. It is only right that, if a child is under 18, the local
authority should have the same duty of care to look after them as it
would to any other young people under its jurisdiction. It also seems
only right that, when they go missing, it takes the same level of care
as it would for any other young children under its jurisdiction,
including making sure that it escalates the details of those young
people beyond the local missing persons’ procedures.</hs_para>

is going wrong with local authorities. It is partly about resources but
they also think that it is just too complicated to deal with on their
own, particularly when they are dealing with young children and
traffickers who are constantly moving and crossing local authority
borders and other boundaries. It is all too easy for local authorities
to feel that it is, in a sense, someone else’s problem and that
the problem has moved off their estate and into the hands of someone
else. That is not justifiable and we want to work with the Government
to find some way to deal with this problem. It seems an absolute
affront to our civilisation that children can be bought and sold and
exploited in our own sight, and that we seem to be powerless to stop
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:39:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000219">The
real solution probably lies with having the political will to make this
issue a priority, which I do not think that it has been up to now. At
the same time, a lot could be done if all the agencies involved worked
more closely together to share information and act decisively. Whether
that needs to be put in legislation is another matter, but a bit more
joined-up action and joined-up government could go some way to

<?notus-xml column=192?>other noble Lords, on the welfare of children who have been trafficked
into this country. These are often extremely vulnerable children, who
may have suffered tremendously at the hands of their traffickers. As
recent work by the Refugee Council and the Children’s Society
shows, these children can fail to gain the support that local
authorities should provide. They should get the same support as other
looked-after children; the legal duties to support them are the same.
The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, pointed towards
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:41:18"></hs_TimeCode>. Local

should be held to account. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, pointed
towards that, too. But requiring that they gain shared parental
responsibility would not in itself bring the improvement provided.
There was an interesting mini-debate about cost; the noble and learned
Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, and the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth,
reassured the noble Lord, Lord Northbourne, on that, and we are
grateful for
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:42:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13101433000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-gc0002.htm#13101433000222">Assigning
parental responsibility could have unintended consequences. A
trafficked child may well have a parent somewhere who already has
parental responsibility for them. Although the local authority should
act as a parent until the family is reunited, it should not
automatically acquire parental responsibility towards that child. While
it is clear that some local authorities are not performing adequately
their statutory role to promote the interests of trafficked children,
adding a requirement on them to seek parental responsibility for these
children could create legal complexity without addressing the reasons
for these failures. Instead, we believe that we must continue to pursue
the programme of reforms to the care system that are already under way.
As we implement these programmes to provide more stable placements,
improved education and health outcomes and support towards independence
and adulthood, I assure noble Lords that we shall take account of the
particular needs of trafficked
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-14T19:43:37"></hs_TimeCode>.

reason for tabling the amendment was as a wake-up call to local

overburdened and underresourced—I said that—but this
small group of children is slipping through the net. I was delighted to
hear what the Minister had to say about missing children, because there
is a serious lack of data from local authorities on children who go
missing. They ought to be able to identify what sort of children they
are. Are they the children who keep going missing from
children’s homes? We know that there are children who go missing
three, four or five times a week. That is not the sort of child we are
talking about. The group we should worry about is the child who goes
missing and is never identified again as a child who was in a
children’s home or a foster home. Local authorities do not even
know. They have to get their act together to know that those are
trafficked

a consultation exercise seeking views on how proposals for direct entry
in the police, as set out in the Independent Review of Police Officer

be implemented. The proposals included a three year fast track to

closed on 28 March and 929 responses were received. Issues such as
equality, opportunities for existing officers, flexibility for annual

5 have been updated to reflect our expectation that Growth Deals and
the Local Growth Fund are now the route for Local Enterprise
Partnerships (LEPs) to secure funding to pursue their business support
priorities. In recognition of this, BIS will be making available an
additional £100 million for the Local Growth Fund in the period
2015 - 2017. This will top up the Local Growth Fund, already confirmed
at the Spending Round as worth at least £2 billion for the whole
of the next Parliament, with additional flexible funding to support the
priorities identified by LEPs in their Strategic Economic Plans. The
Local Growth Fund underlines the Government’s commitment to the
devolution of economic powers from central government to local areas,
putting business-led LEPs, working with their local partners, at the
heart of promoting growth. Hence Round 5 is designed for bids clearly
led by the private sector, although we hope that LEPs will still play a
role in endorsing private sector bids from their
areas.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310147000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014-wms0001.htm#1310147000051">Briefing

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Department of Health (Earl
Howe) (Con):</Member> In answering the question,
liability for clinical negligence in the National Health Service has
been taken to mean the provisions made in the NHS Litigation
Authority's (NHS LA's) annual accounts for clinical negligence claims.
Clinical negligence provisions were £16.6 billion in the 2010-11
accounts, and £22.7 billion in the 2012-13 accounts, an increase
of £6.1 billion, or
36.7%.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310148000301" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014w0001.htm#1310148000301">Of this,
approximately £1.4 billion resulted from a change in the HM
Treasury discount rate during 2012-13. The purpose of the discount rate
is to ensure that an amount of money invested today will still be worth
the same amount in future. Provisions have also increased because the
number of claims has increased, by 17% over the same
period.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310148000302" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131014w0001.htm#1310148000302">The
Government is looking at what can be done to reduce the NHS litigation
bill, including by seeking to bring down the number of mistakes through
a relentless focus on patient safety. The vast majority of the millions
of people seen by the NHS every year experience good quality, safe and
effective care. However, if things do go wrong then it is right that
patients are compensated. Following the Francis and Berwick reports,
patient safety must be the priority for everyone in the

against a set of risk management standards to more outcome focused

co-ordinate works and utility companies to co-operate with them. The
