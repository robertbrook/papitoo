Minister’s questions yesterday, because the Prime Minister
called it a con, and he is right. Labour’s energy price freeze
is a con. Let me explain to the Opposition why it is a con, because
when people see a politician promising something for nothing, they do
not believe them. The policy cannot control prices before
Labour’s price freeze and it cannot control prices after it, so
energy companies are likely to hike prices before and after. Consumers
will be worse off as a result of such a
measure.</hs_Para>

from the previous Government was not as competitive as it should have
been. Before Labour’s previous energy market reforms, there were
three generators and 14 suppliers—17 companies—but after
those reforms the number went down to six, so Labour reduced
competition. Labour is the party of the big six. This coalition
Government have acted to make sure that we have competition to take on
the big six, so the hon. Lady should speak to her Front Benchers

British Gas customers. British Gas will need to justify its decision
openly and transparently to bill-payers. British Gas was the only
energy company not to meet its targets under the previous obligation to
make its customers’ homes more energy-efficient. That left more
homes cold and its customers paying over the odds. British Gas has form
in failing to meet its targets, the last of which was set by Labour. I
hope that the right hon. Lady will join me in making sure that British
Gas is more transparent about its costs. We are pushing competition,

the way of the consumer’s ability to choose. There may well be a
few people who see an increase in tariffs in the short term because of
Ofgem’s reforms, but because of the extra competition that will
bear down on prices, the majority of people will get a better
deal.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/EA408626D5B176F925E483F831350057FF4BC6CB" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 October 2013">Thursday

Al-Madinah free school serves children and young people between the
ages of 4 and 16 in the Derby city community, and it has been open for
just a year. After a steady start by the school we became aware of
potential breaches of the conditions in its funding agreement late this
summer, and at the end of July we began a wide-ranging investigation
into the financial management and governance of the school. We
investigated whether it was delivering on its commitment to be
inclusive, and we investigated allegations about the imposition of a
dress requirement on female members of staff. Our investigations did
indeed find significant and numerous breaches of the conditions in the
school’s funding agreement, and our concerns were such that we

inspection.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000184">The
Ofsted report is published this morning. It found that the school is
dysfunctional, and inadequate across every category of inspection:
achievement of pupils; quality of teaching; behaviour and safety of
pupils; and leadership and management. We were already taking decisive
action before we received the Ofsted report. Lord Nash wrote to the
chair of the trust on 8 October, following the previous investigations,
and set out all the requirements for the trust to take swift and
decisive actions to deal with the serious concerns. We have been clear
with the trust that failure to do so promptly will result in the
school’s funding being terminated. We have also been clear that
the trust must address all the breaches identified. We will not let any
school, whether a free school, an academy, or a local authority school,
languish in failure. The Ofsted report confirms that we are taking the
right actions. We are not prepared to allow a school to fail its
parents, its children and its community. We said we would take swift
action in these cases, and that is exactly what we are
doing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000185" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000185"><B><Member ContinuationText="Tristram Hunt" PimsId="5588" UID="13101753000591" xid="1198" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000591">Tristram
Hunt:</Member></B> Today’s Ofsted report exposes the fact that
the Government’s free school programme has become a dangerous
free for all, an out-of-control, ideological experiment that has closed
a school, leaving 400 children losing an entire week of learning. It is
a devastating blow to the Education Secretary’s flagship policy,
and reveals that pupils have been failed on every possible measure.
Parents will want to know why the Education Secretary has allowed that
to
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000186">Contrary
to what the Minister said, in a pre-registration report in July 2012,
Ofsted deemed the school to be failing to meet basic child protection
standards, even before it was opened. Why did Ministers not act on 
<?notus-xml column=888?>those concerns before signing a funding agreement for the school? Why
have Ministers allowed a school to be run by large numbers of
unqualified staff? Why have Ministers sanctioned “dangerous
levels” of safety and behaviour, and why have they allowed
children with special educational needs to be left to struggle? In a
city where every child needs to be supported and educated to the
highest possible level, the Education Secretary has sacrificed learning
for ideology. It is not just Al-Madinah school that is dysfunctional;
it is the Education Secretary’s free schools
policy.</hs_Para>

schools. He

the same set of Department for Education press cuttings in which he

respond in detail to every single serious point the hon. Gentleman
made—it will not take very long—and go back over what has
happened in Al-Madinah school and the scrutiny to which it has been
subjected. The school opened in September 2012. It had a
pre-registration Ofsted report, as all such schools do—such a
report is not sensational. In the report, Ofsted set down a number of
requirements that it wanted met before the school opened. In advance of
the school opening, the trust went through the requirements with the
lead contact in the Department for Education. It produced certificates
to show that it had done the safeguarding and first aid training, and a
certificate—<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> The shadow
Secretary of State ought to listen to this. The school produced a
certificate authorised by the director of planning and transportation
at Derby city council saying that the building was fit for occupation.
After that, the Department sent an adviser to the school two months
after it opened, who saw the good progress that the school was making
at that
stage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000190" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000190">In
July 2013, we became aware of concerns about equalities and management
issues at the school and acted immediately on that. We established an
Education Funding Agency financial investigation into the school and
sent our advisers to it. We asked Ofsted to bring forward its
inspection, which has now taken place. Prior to receiving that
inspection, the Under-Secretary of State, Lord Nash, wrote to the
school setting out precisely the actions that it will take, and making
it clear that its funding will not continue unless it addresses those
things.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000191">If
the shadow Secretary of State is so supportive of free schools, why
does he not have the responsibility to put the failure of the school
into context? Seventy-five per cent. of the free schools that have
opened have been rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. That is a higher
proportion than the proportion of local authority schools. We did not
hear that from the hon.
Gentleman.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000192">On
complacency, which I believe is the allegation the hon. Gentleman
makes, may I remind him of the record of the Labour Government whom he
defends? At the 
<?notus-xml column=889?>end of their period in office, 8% of schools in this country
—more than 1,500—were rated as inadequate, many had been
so for years, with no action. By focusing on one school in which the
Government are taking action, the hon. Gentleman is failing schools in
this country, including ones that failed under the Labour Government,
when little action was
taken.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000193" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0001.htm#13101753000193">People

What is the Government’s policy? The Tories want to scrap energy
efficiency measures for the poorest in order to reduce bills, but the
Deputy Prime Minister thinks that that would put prices up. What does
the Deputy Leader think? We have heard only this morning that British

the hon. Gentleman raised the same issue last week. He will remember
that the Leader of the House promised to go and sample a crumpet if he
was in his constituency. Last night I was at a planning meeting at my
local authority to support strong local opposition to the opening of a
fast-food restaurant, so it would be hypocritical of me to offer to
come and eat a burger with the hon. Gentleman. However, he has put on

£12.7 billion to 
<?notus-xml column=906?>the NHS, in contrast with Opposition Front Benchers, who I think
described that proposal as “irresponsible”. The level of
funding going into the NHS is very significant. On A and E and NHS
waiting times, average waiting times remain low and stable. The number
of patients who have been waiting longer than 52 weeks is
352—clearly that is 352 too many—but that compares with a

I pay tribute to Lance Corporal James Brynin of 14 Signal Regiment, who
was tragically killed in action in Afghanistan on 15 October after
coming under enemy fire during an operation in Nahri Sarraj. My
thoughts are with his family and loved ones as they come to terms with
their terrible loss. Four hundred and forty-five members of the UK

forgotten.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000357" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000357">Our
objective in Afghanistan has not changed since the Prime
Minister’s statement to Parliament in July. We are protecting
the UK by ensuring that Afghanistan is not used as a base for terrorism
against our country and our allies. We are helping the Afghan
Government in three main ways: to increase the capability of
Afghanistan’s national security force; to make progress towards
a sustainable political settlement; and to build a viable state that
helps meet the needs of the Afghan people. Progress has been made on
all three fronts. This summer, through the fiercest months of the
Taliban fighting season, Afghan national security forces led the
security response to the insurgency threat for the first time. That
followed President Karzai’s milestone announcement in June that
the ANSF has assumed lead responsibility for security throughout the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000358" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000358">The
ANSF has now reached its temporary surge strength target of 352,000
army, police and air force personnel, and today leads 93% of all
operations across Afghanistan. Those numbers are having an effect on
the battlefield. Despite an increase in violence levels and
high-profile attacks in June, the ANSF responded effectively to the
majority of security incidents, and launched several proactive
operations to disrupt planned attacks in Kabul and elsewhere. That
resulted in just one high-profile attack taking place in the capital
since July, and an overall reduction in violence levels throughout July
and August. Crucially, the ANSF is succeeding in keeping the insurgency
out of the protected communities, and the majority of violence is now
taking place away from populated
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000359">There
have been several successful operations in recent months, which were
notable not only for their size but for their complexity and degree of
co-ordination. For example, the ANSF launched Operation Seamough at the
end of July—a combined clearance, security and international aid
mission to secure the main supply routes south of Kabul. That operation
involved more than 1,300 Afghan security personnel, working alongside
other arms of the Afghan Government, as well as humanitarian
organisations. In line with the clear progress of the Afghan national
security forces, the UK and our international security assistance force
partners are continuing the process of draw-down and redeployment. 
<?notus-xml column=912?>Today we have four UK bases in central Helmand as well as Camp
Bastion—down from 137 UK bases at the height of the conflict. On
9 August the military headquarters of the UK’s Task Force
Helmand moved from Lashkar Gah to Camp Bastion, symbolising the
changing UK military profile in central Helmand. We have also reduced
the total number of UK armed forces personnel in theatre from 7,900 in
May, to currently around 6,800. By the end of the year we will have
reduced that even further to 5,200 personnel, notwithstanding
occasional fluctuations due to temporary surges into
theatre.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000361" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000361">We
must not forget the challenges that still remain, and throughout all
this the insurgency has remained a determined and resilient enemy.
However, as we approach the final year of the ISAF campaign, we can be
optimistic about Afghanistan’s future. Encouragingly, recent
Afghan polls show that 90% of Afghans feel that security in their area
is fair to good, and 80% of Afghans say they feel safe travelling
outside their area during the day. Such perceptions in the minds of
ordinary Afghans will ultimately determine the country’s fate.
The ANSF is an essential component in achieving that, and in building a
secure and viable Afghan state that can provide long-term security and
governance for its
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000362" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000362">Progress
has also been made in securing a sustainable political settlement for
Afghanistan ahead of presidential and provincial elections in 2014.
Afghans want and deserve the right to decide the future of their
country, and we are committed to helping them achieve that. A
constitutional, peaceful transfer of power from President Karzai to his
successor will be a significant milestone for the Afghan people, yet we
cannot underestimate the challenge of holding those elections. We are
working hard to support the Afghan authorities to make them as
credible, inclusive and transparent as possible, and we very much
welcome the fact that two vital pieces of electoral reform were passed
by the Afghan Parliament and signed by President Karzai in late July.
That was an historic moment and the first time that Afghanistan has had
laws of that kind debated and voted on by Parliament, rather than
adopted by decree.</hs_Para>

given £12 million to support the Independent Electoral
Commission. The IEC has recruited and trained more than 5,600 officials
for voter registration, including almost 2,000 women, as well as
encouraged people to vote through public service announcements on TV
and radio. So far, it has helped to ensure that more than  2
million Afghans have registered to vote—as of
mid-October—of whom around 31% are women. Efforts to encourage
women to participate in the electoral process will increase in the
coming months. DFID’s programme to support women’s
political participation will build the political capacity of female
political candidates through training and mentoring. That is part of a
wider DFID programme to strengthen political governance in Afghanistan
and has been fast-tracked so that our support for women’s
political participation is embedded long before the elections. Ahead of
the election, the Afghan Government must continue to meet the needs of
their people. DFID is taking an active role in supporting the lives of
ordinary Afghans, be it to improve their livelihoods or exercise their
rights.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000364" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000364">Our
support for the HALO Trust in removing landmines and unexploded
ordnance from land in Herat province in western Afghanistan continues

more than 20,000 families, many of whom are internally displaced
people, have benefitted from the return of land to productive use in
the Jebrail township in Herat. Hazara refugees returning from Iran also
benefit. Between April and June this year, HALO cleared more than 1.6
million square metres of land in Herat province and disposed safely of
two anti-personnel mines, 10 anti-tank mines, 63 unexploded ordnances
and 1,609 small arms ammunitions. The UK has committed to making the

UK support for the Afghan Government’s comprehensive agriculture
and rural development facility continues to help farmers in four
provinces across Afghanistan to improve their livelihoods by increasing
the value of agricultural crops and building better links to markets
for their products. In Helmand, UK support for technical and vocational
education and training has helped more than 15,000 graduates to secure
employment, already exceeding the programme’s 2014 target. DFID
is looking at how best to strengthen the programme further to ensure
that graduates get the best out of their
training.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000366">We
believe that DFID’s support for Afghan civil society through the
Tawanmandi programme is having a lasting impact. One of
Tawanmandi’s core partners, the Community Centre for the
Disabled, has successfully worked to improve the welfare of disabled
people. As a result of its efforts, the Government of Afghanistan have
passed legislation to enshrine the rights and active participation of
disabled people in society. The second call for Tawanmandi grant
proposals has recently closed, and we look forward in the near future
to being able to extend our support to more Afghan organisations,
including those supporting women and youth
groups.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000367" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000367">We
are determined to support women in Afghanistan, who continue to face
severe challenges in their daily lives, including the regular threat of
violence. We are already providing support for girls’ education
and women’s empowerment in addition to working with the
Government of Afghanistan to ensure they uphold their responsibilities
and commitments to protect women. Earlier this year, I said I wanted to
go further and make tackling violence against women a strategic
priority for DFID’s work in Afghanistan. My officials have
consulted experts, non-governmental organisations and Afghan women to
ensure that our implementation reflects their needs. I will announce
our revised approach in due
course.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000368" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000368">In
July, DFID and Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials took part in a
senior officials meeting in Kabul, where donors reaffirmed their aid
commitments of more than $16 billion until 2015. However, the
international community also delivered a clear message that existing
levels of aid will be at risk if the Afghan Government fail to take
forward their reform commitments. As well as ensuring credible and
inclusive elections, we are particularly keen to see progress on
tackling corruption, upholding women’s rights and managing the
economy. Failure to deliver those reforms could jeopardise the
stability of Afghanistan. During the recent World Bank annual meetings
in Washington, I met Finance Minister Zakhilwal and reiterated the
importance of Afghanistan continuing to make credible progress on
agreed reforms, including the International Monetary Fund
programme.</hs_Para>

UK Government look forward to co-chairing with the Afghan Government
the 2014 ministerial meeting to assess further progress against the
Tokyo mutual accountability framework. We expect that that will take
place three to six months after the formation of the next Afghan

international partners have a unique chance to set the conditions for
political, security and economic transition. We must continue to focus

after 2014, and as he will be aware, to date, we have been very clear
that that will focus on our work with the Afghan national army officer
academy. In addition, alongside that support, we will provide security
and support for any UK personnel involved.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman rightly flagged up the massively important relationship
between Afghanistan and Pakistan, and of course he will know that the
UK has played a key role in brokering the so-called trilateral talks,
which have seen the UK bring together Afghanistan and Pakistan. At the
World Bank meetings at the weekend, I met both Ishaq Dar, the Pakistan
Finance Minister, and Minister Zakhilwal, the Afghanistan Finance
Minister, both of whom made it clear that they saw as key the need to
grow economic links, in particular, between Pakistan and Afghanistan. I
was encouraged by their enthusiasm to work together and follow up those
initial discussions between their respective Governments with meetings
over the coming months. As I told them, the UK stands ready to play its
role in helping that relationship to grow and become a positive
one.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman rightly flagged up the challenge of ensuring that we do
not lose the gains we have seen on women and girls. This is a massively
important point. I have elevated the issue of violence against women
and girls to a strategic priority for my team to ensure that it never
gets lost within the work that we do. It is worth bearing in mind the
context. For a start, life expectancy in Afghanistan is 49, while 87%
of women can expect to suffer violence during their lives. Under the
Taliban, they faced the worst prospects of any women in the world. We
are quite right, therefore, to focus on this issue, and Parliament is
right to send out a message that we believe this matters massively. I
wanted to take this opportunity to thank colleagues from across the
House for enabling us to speak with one voice on this agenda over the
past 12 months. I spend a lot of time talking with women in
Afghanistan—I had a chance to meet parliamentarians
there—and I know that it makes a difference to them. I can
assure him, therefore, that this will remain a priority, and over the
coming weeks I will set out how we will up our game.</hs_Para>

right hon. Gentleman talked about staff in Afghanistan with linguistic
skills. Obviously, the UK Government work closely, including on
development, with many locally employed staff, which helps to ensure
that we have the right skills in place. We recognise that it is an
incredibly dangerous and challenging place for anyone to work in, which
is why we have been clear that we want to be responsible and help those
people in danger after working for the UK Government. That is why we
have been clear about a repatriation package where we think those risks
are
significant.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/B0618BE92273002F5BE01925D5D51816A523B781" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 October 2013">Thursday

Tokyo mutual accountability framework and the summit that saw it
emerge, donor countries committed to giving, on average, about $4
billion of annual support up to 2017. As I pointed out to the right
hon. Member for East Renfrewshire (Mr Murphy), that is a contract
between ourselves and the Afghan Government that needs them to deliver
on the part of the framework relating to progress that only they can
make. There is, however, a commitment and will to ensure that funding
is in place for the Afghan national security force. I should also say,
briefly, that we are working to help the Afghan Government to increase
their tax base, so that they do not need to rely so much on the donor
community. In fact, tax receipts have risen from $200 million several
years ago to more than $2 billion, in part thanks to DFID’s work

job.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101753000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000398"><Member ContinuationText="Mr Bernard Jenkin" PimsId="1170" UID="13101753000738" xid="310" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101753000738"><B>Mr

other donors and women’s groups across Afghanistan to encourage
and help women to become part of the national police force. We can also
continue DFID’s work as part of the Tawanmandi programme, which
has seen legal aid centres established in several districts, as well as
mobile legal aid centres, so that the availability of justice for women
goes well beyond having women in the national police to having a
justice system 
<?notus-xml column=919?>that they can rely on. Clearly that is a huge challenge, and I do not

Army reforms depend on the successful recruitment of reserves. Let us
examine that for a moment, and let us remember that without such
recruitment up to 30,000, the Army reform plans fall apart. What do we
know about recruitment so far? We know that TA numbers have been
falling, not rising, since 2009 and are now at their lowest ebb since
2007. We know today that new reservist recruitment targets are being
missed. The front page of <I>The Daily Telegraph</I>, under the heading
“Reforms have left the Army in chaos”<I> </I>refers to
documents clearly showing that reservist recruitment targets both for
this and next year are being missed—and not just by a small
margin, but by a massive margin—thus bringing the whole plan
into doubt. Various reasons are put forward, including criticism of the
Ministry of Defence for closing down local recruitment offices, and
there is talk about privatisation and Capita, but I think that is
somewhat overplayed. What we know is that there has been a lack of
communication in the IT systems in the MOD as between Capita and Atlas.

reluctant to let key employees go. There is a host of reasons, but as I
say, the bottom line is that the key reserve recruitment
targets are being missed. Another key concern is that costs may be
rising faster than anticipated, yet the Government have not presented
to Parliament a fully costed plan, despite numerous requests for them
to do so.</hs_Para>

Review the United Kingdom’s Reserve Forces has confirmed

regular. We know that those who leave the regular forces to join the
reserves will be given a £5,000 bounty, payable over four years.
We have some questions about the reservist award, which is the
difference between reservists’ pay and what they earn in
civilian life. We are told that the potential cost has been accounted
for, but the assumptions have not been made clear. We also know that,
because employers are reluctant to let key employees go for extended

employers amounting to £500 per reservist per month. Those are
all added costs, but we still do not know what the fully costed plan

respect, that he has confused training with deployment. There is no
argument in the House about the fact that reservists will be cheaper;
the question is, how much cheaper will they be? When costs are rising,
do we enter the terrain of false economies—which brings into
doubt the whole question of value for money and whether the plan should
have been instigated in the first place? I was talking about training.
There has been a dispute about whether it costs more to train a

costs more to train a reservist.</hs_Para>

impact assessment, which attempts to take an overall view of the costs?
Again, we are dealing with assumptions and projected usage rates, and

the assessment is very dependent on projected usage rates. The way in

low rates can create false economies. The central case in the document
seems to be based on an assumption of 3,000 annual deployments. I must
ask the Minister whether that projection is realistic, given the
original rationale of the reserve reforms. We are meant to
be replacing 20,000 regular troops with 30,000 reservists. If the
central projected use is 3,000, something is not adding up on the
terrain. We need to examine the facts very carefully, because, again,
we may be creating false economies and the taxpayer may be presented

the Green Paper, which states that it costs more to train a reservist
than to train a regular. However, he has made a valid point about the
manpower gap, which I think is a central issue of concern. Will 30,000
reservists be enough, even if they can be recruited? According to
figures from the Ministry of Defence, the present TA mobilisation rate
is 40%. In other words, for every 100 TA soldiers on paper, 40 are
deemed to be deployable at any one time. That suggests that if we are
plugging a gap left by 20,000 regulars, we shall need 50,000

Friend the Member for Hertsmere (Mr Clappison) raised the
issue of the capability gap, and he was right to do so, because there
is a fear that the Government plans risk creating such a gap. The Army
reforms were put together before the strategic defence and security
review, and since then a string of events have changed the
international strategic dynamic. The nature of conflict is changing.
Previously, it was thought of very much in binary terms—there
would be one bloc against another bloc—but more fluid
geopolitical forces are now at play, both state and non-state. War is
becoming more asymmetrical, and we need well trained, agile, regular
forces at high readiness if we are to meet the challenges that lie
ahead. There is no disguising among the military their frustration
about the fact that they could not have been more supportive to the
French in Mali. The penny may have dropped on that side of the channel,
but it has not yet dropped on this

be absolutely clear about this: the Government’s plans represent
a step-change in our approach. We are proposing to deploy whole units
of reservists into the field. We have got to ask serious questions
about this. Some would say, “Well, it happens in the US with the
National Guard,” but it is, perhaps, not fully appreciated that
the US National Guard has its own bases and its own equipment and
training programmes. They take it very seriously in the US; they throw
a lot of money at it, and even then the National Guard units are not
infantry units. That is the interesting thing: the National Guard units

a general view that the National Guard is very much focused on
supporting roles, and the Americans treat their National Guard very
differently from what I think is being proposed here. For example, I do
not know of there being any details about separate training programmes,
operational programmes or equipment programmes in the
Government’s plans, which we have yet to see. All we are asking
is to see those plans, because £1.8 billion may sound like a lot
of money but it is spread over 10 years, and we must consider the scale
of what we are asking—not just raising 30,000 reservists, or, to
be more accurate, adding another 12,000 or 13,000 reservists, but
doubling the mobilisation rate. That is a very big ask

That has not been raised much in the debate thus far, but human rights
legislation is a concern in the sense that it is going to say,

expensive, battalions are being saved. Such a policy reinforces
failure. Can the Minister justify the decision for 2RRF to replace on
the list one of the more poorly recruited battalions when it was not on
the original list of five battalions to be scrapped? We know, because
we have seen it in writing from the MOD, that five battalions were
originally due to be axed as they had poor recruitment figures. One of

that periodical reorganisations are necessary and that cuts sometimes

Government say these cuts will not affect our military capability, but
they clearly will. We are losing whole battalions—20,000 troops
are to be axed. The Government know this will damage our military
capability, creating gaps that will cost us both financially and
strategically. That is why they keep insisting that their plans for
reservists will fill this gap. That may or may not be the case. I am
not a military expert and do not wish to discuss whether or not 30,000
reservists are a substitute for 20,000 regulars. I do, however, have
experience of industry and, as a result, I am highly sceptical of the
Government’s
plans.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000053">I
fear that the Government are being highly optimistic in relying on
30,000 reservists. To be in the Territorial Army is admirable and I
respect all reservists, but it is admirable because it is a serious
time commitment—and, more than that, they can sometimes put
themselves in harm’s way. In today’s economic climate, it
is not easy for people to request time off from their employer, let
alone take large amounts of time off. If companies are tightening their
belts, employees feel it is important to 
<?notus-xml column=930?>be present, hard working and seen to be valuable to
the company. Especially given today’s high living standards and
bills, no one wants to risk losing their job. Many employers will also
be very reluctant to make the extra demands of their employers. We must
remember that being a reservist does not mean taking hours off; it can
mean taking weeks off. There will be a real fear that being a reservist
can jeopardise someone’s career. That is not to say that people
will not volunteer to be reservists, but when push comes to shove
reservists will put their employment first.</hs_Para>

that there are to be incentives for employers to take on reservists,
but, again, I fear that when work is demanding and a deadline is
looming employers would rather have their employee at work and will put
pressure on reservists accordingly. Furthermore, I understand that the
Territorial Army’s current mobilisation rate stands at 40%, so
only 40 of every 100 soldiers are deemed fit for deployment. Given that
figure, we have to bear in mind that we are going to need to recruit
about 50,000 reservists, rather than 30,000. The TA has had a net loss
in officers and soldiers since 2009; TA numbers are now at their lowest
level since 2007. I also understand from recent reports that the
reserves recruitment drive, which ought now to be in full swing, is
falling well short of its targets for both this year and next. I will
leave others to discuss the strategic considerations and the cost of
the plans, which is considerable and escalating. I simply call on the
Government to delay the axing of the 20,000 regulars until it is beyond
doubt that the reserves plan is viable and cost-effective. Let us wait
to see what the reservists plans look like before making such
significant cuts.</hs_Para>

battalion with a proud history—the Warwickshire county regiment
is part of that history—particularly during the second world
war, and it has an outstanding track record of recruitment. I urge the
Government to reconsider disbanding it while keeping more poorly
recruited, and therefore more expensive,
battalions.</hs_Para>

my hon. and gallant Friend’s loyal defence of his
fine former regiment. As the 100th anniversary of the start of the
first world war is almost upon us, it is 
<?notus-xml column=931?>time to remember six Lancashire and Warwickshire

is that we have a good plan that is being unevenly implemented.
America’s land forces are almost exactly split 50:50 between
regulars and volunteer reserves. Canada has 44% regulars and Australia
has 36% regulars; in all countries there are more reserve infantry than
regulars. Uniquely, Britain has a target that is much less ambitious.
It is broadly the case that a reservist costs a fifth of the price of a
regular. All of us who are keen on defence would like more resources to
be allocated to defence. Indeed, more than 20 years ago, I
stepped down from my post in government as a Cabinet
Parliamentary Private Secretary over that issue. However, the reality
is that we have to work within these very difficult economic times, and
the alternative to 30,000 reservists is not 20,000 regulars, but
somewhere between 6,000 and 7,500, and that would be if we got rid of
all the specialist medics, cyber-people and so on whom the Regular Army
does not have.</hs_Para>

strongly support this plan; I have seen the work of American and
Australian reservists, and I am proud that 20% of the British division
that captured southern Iraq was made up of reservists. However, I am
concerned about some of the details of how the plan is being
implemented. From the beginning, Ministers and the Chief of the General
Staff have made a strong commitment to it. Ministers have secured the
support of every employers’ organisation in the country. The
CGS, starting with his own pitch to employers in his excellent article
in the <I>Financial Times</I>, immediately spotted the governance issue
by appointing, for the first time since the second world war, a TA
two-star—a major-general—to play a pivotal role in it.
The problems largely lie within the recruiting group. At a time when
the proposition has improved immeasurably as a result of changes the
Army Board is making, it is deeply depressing that this department is
failing to deliver.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101777000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000062">I have before
me the monthly recruiting statistics for one unit—I will not
disclose which, for obvious reasons. In the 12 months before the first
push on TA recruiting in autumn 2011, the unit had enlisted between
three and 12 people a month. The figures after that push are:
15 for November 2011, 21 for December 2011 and 19 for January
2012. Then, for a reason not understood by anyone, the recruiting group
introduced its new system for medicals and common selection, without
any market testing and without talking to units, and within three or
four months the figures had dropped to one or two a month. That muddle
was sorted—it had nothing to do with Capita. Second time around,
the arrangements with Capita—I do not blame Capita—were
introduced without any market testing or discussion with units. I am
sure we have all dealt with cases of soldiers who have waited six or
nine months with their documents repeatedly lost in the
system.</hs_Para>

extremely short, so I want to suggest three things that the Government
need to do turn this around. The units I talk to tell me again and
again that there is more interest in joining the reserves and that the
figures for the two groups that are not under control of the 
<?notus-xml column=932?>recruiting group—officer applicants and ex-regulars—are
both improving. So, first, we need to get more of the control over the
enlistment process back with the units
again.</hs_Para>

Baron:</Member></B> May I suggest that this is a clear example of where
the plan is driven by costs, rather than by strategic design? The cost
for Capita to take on the recruitment was derived in large part by
scaling down, if not selling up completely, local recruitment offices.
So to start opening those offices, although a sensible proposition,
would require additional cost if we are going to reverse that
recruitment loss.</hs_Para>

Brazier:</Member></B> My hon. and gallant Friend makes an interesting
point. That is not what I am arguing for, although I would strongly
argue that it is ridiculous that the offices we still retain are open 9
am to 5 pm Monday to Friday instead of, for example, 9 am to 9 pm
Tuesday to Thursday, which would allow the people there to do both jobs
rather than only regulars. I am calling for more emphasis on the units.
A temporary measure has been adopted in that area, which I suggest
should be more permanent—it need not be
expensive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000066">The
second major change we need is to have a senior reservist officer in
the recruiting group who is tasked with talking to units and who has
real power in the way in which decisions in that area are made. We have
done it at Land Command at the senior level, where two highly effective
successive deputy commanders at Land in that position have worked well,
and the improvements in the proposition have stemmed in no small part
from that. The same needs to be done in the recruiting group.</hs_Para>

change we need is on a relatively small scale, as seven or eight
changes among the 400-odd decisions that had to be made to the location
of the reserves are not right. Seven or eight really well-recruited
sub-units have been wrongly selected for disbandment, including the
best-recruited squadron in the yeomanry, which is going down to troop
level, the best-recruited battery in the TA gunners and three or four
well-recruited infantry
sub-units.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000068">I

recruitment improves, there are concerns from many quarters about how
employers will react when their staff, serving as reservists, have to
be deployed for up to 12 months at a time every five years. There is

jeopardy the last remaining 1st Battalion of full-time regular soldiers

my heart. It was my dad’s regiment; he was a regular
soldier, serving in Palestine and north Africa. He was captured in the

explain briefly why that is. The motion refers to the disbandment of
regular Army units. As we have already heard, one of the units to be
disbanded is the 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of Fusiliers. Bury
has long been a productive recruiting ground for the
Fusiliers—originally the Lancashire Fusiliers raised in 1688,
who had their barracks in the town of Bury, as I know you are well
aware, Mr Deputy Speaker. Following a previous reorganisation of the
regular Army units, back on 23 April 1968, the Lancashire Fusiliers
joined the Royal Northumbrian Fusiliers, the Royal Warwickshire
Fusiliers and the Royal Fusiliers to form part of the new Royal
Regiment of
Fusiliers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000106">The
people of Bury are extremely proud of the town’s links with the
Fusiliers. The town is home to the Fusiliers museum, which has recently
moved from the site of the old barracks to a new venue right in the
heart of the town. This was visited by the Secretary of State for
Health, my right hon. Friend the Member for South West Surrey (Mr
Hunt), when he was shadow Secretary of State for Culture, Media and
Sport. Just a few weeks ago, my right hon. Friend the current Secretary
of State for Culture, Media and Sport also visited the

this year, in the summer, the Bury parish church played host to the
funeral of Drummer Lee Rigby—a Fusilier—who was so
brutally murdered here in London. The church is the garrison church of
the Fusiliers. Each year on the Sunday nearest 25 April Bury
commemorates the terrible losses sustained by the Fusiliers at
Gallipoli in 1915. The Fusiliers were awarded six Victoria Crosses for
the bravery that they displayed at that landing, and famously they are
remembered as having won six VCs before
breakfast.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000108">We
must never lose sight of the reason why the Government have had to make
these difficult decisions. It is right that the defence budget must be
balanced; no one disputes that. It is nevertheless prudent constantly
to review the plans that the Government have put in place and monitor
them to ensure that they are on track and that they will deliver the
planned savings. My constituents are understandably angry and
disappointed that the 2nd Battalion is being disbanded at a time when
there is so much uncertainty in the world. On Tuesday this week I was
honoured to meet the hundreds of former Fusiliers and their families
who marched down Whitehall to hear the speeches in Old Palace Yard.
This was the second such march, following the one we had last year. It
is just one indication of the strength of feeling not just in Bury, but
in all the towns from which the Fusiliers recruit right across the
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000109">The

enough reservists will be recruited to fill the massive hole that will
be left by the disbandment of the 2nd Battalion. The original plan was
to keep the Regular Army battalions in place until it was clear that
the plan to replace them with reservists was viable. It surely makes
sense to be absolutely certain that the reservists recruitment plans
are on track before the regular units are disbanded. We have heard from
my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and Billericay that the plan to
recruit more reservists is behind schedule, but we should not have to
rely on leaks published in <I>The Daily Telegraph.</I> What are the
facts? Exactly how many reservists should have been recruited by now?
Exactly how many have been recruited? They are not a cheap option. We
need to know the facts. I urge the House to vote for the motion.

contribution to many recent 
<?notus-xml column=939?>operations from Afghanistan to Iraq to Libya leaves
us in no doubt of their valour or significance. However, reservists
have other priorities in their lives, and that is even more pertinent
in today’s tough and competitive world. For these reasons and
others, their numbers must be kept to a sensible and manageable
proportion of the whole. No military commander I have spoken to,
serving or retired, agrees that the increase in the proportion of
reservists to regulars is correct. Today’s conflicts require
well trained, professional, regular troops to hit the ground running,
so if we are to cut our armed services, the proportion of regulars to
reservists must be higher, not
lower.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000125">Twenty
thousand fully trained and experienced regulars are leaving the Army,
creating what I and many other campaigners and commentators would

conclusion that we should cut the armed services to the extent that we

aid, but it should be better targeted, and I think that a statutory

one is arguing here is that, given the shortfalls in recruitment and

Green Paper published in July contained some proposals that concern me.
One, in particular, is for the reconfiguration of D company of 6th
Battalion The Rifles. I believe that the proposal, as it stands, will
frustrate the delivery of the Army Reserve plan in Cornwall,
particularly the aim of maximising its local potential now and in years
to come. D company is an important part of 6 Rifles. It is currently
based and headquartered in Truro and Plymouth, which allows riflemen
from across Cornwall to play a full role in the life of the regiment.
The Green Paper proposes a 
<?notus-xml column=941?>reconfiguration that would see the majority of the
company, including its headquarters, based in Plymouth by 2016 and one
platoon housed at a new facility in
Barnstable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000139">The
move from Truro would cause real problems for serving riflemen living
in west and central Cornwall and impact on future recruitment from
those areas. Cornwall, as Members will know, is a large and rural
county, and it can take a considerable time to travel to Plymouth. A
rifleman taking the train from Falmouth in my constituency to an
evening training session in Plymouth would face a four-hour round trip.
Those travelling further west would face even longer journey times. Is
it reasonable or, with a view to future recruitment, wise to add such
an inconvenience to the many other sacrifices required of our
reservists?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/651E698470158321CB7A65FC9FDB91EA7D2DFE37" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 October 2013">Thursday

well as creating a tangible difficulty for Cornish riflemen, the
proposed move from Truro will inflict a blow to local military
identity. The link between Cornwall and The Rifles dates back to 1782,
when the 32nd Regiment of Foot, a predecessor unit, was designated as
Cornwall’s county regiment. That designation has lasted through
the centuries and the reorganisations of recent years and, until now,
has been physical as well as theoretical, with members of the regiment
serving within Cornwall. The end of 231 years of The Rifles’s
boots on Cornish soil will weaken the link between county and
regiment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000143">I
know that the Ministry of Defence recognises that such links not only
are a matter of sentiment and heritage, but have a real impact on local
recruitment. The case against reconfiguration therefore rests on the
threat to recruitment, but the argument cited in its favour is that the
move from Truro will save money. When considering this, it is important
to remember that Truro’s TA centre, which is currently home to D
company, would stay open if The Rifles move. The centre currently also
supports local Army cadets and provides a base for the Royal Army
medical field hospital and a squadron of the Royal Logistic Corp. The
Green Paper would not alter those arrangements. If the move goes ahead,
Truro TA centre will remain open as a facility but support fewer
reserve units. It is difficult to see how that could lead to
significant financial savings. Indeed, the proposed establishment of a
new platoon-sized facility at Barnstable looks likely to incur costs
that would not have to be met if Truro were retained as a Rifles
base.</hs_Para>

reconfiguration does not need to be completely abandoned in order for
its adverse impact to be mitigated. It is generally accepted that it
makes sense for the company headquarters to move to Plymouth, as the
nearest large urban area, but only while one platoon remains in Truro
to enable continued service from central and west Cornish residents. I
understand that that was the expected scenario following the talks with
local commanders in advance of the Green Paper, so the loss of all
Rifles units came as a dreadful shock. Given 
<?notus-xml column=942?>Cornwall’s population of 530,000, which is expected to grow at a
fast rate in the coming decades, it seems likely that a Truro-based
platoon would be readily able to recruit sufficient reservists to man
it. It is currently a well manned
unit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000145" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000145">In
conclusion, my concerns about the reorganisation are very local. I
support and welcome the strategy for the Army Reserve, which I think is
widely supported by reservists in my constituency, but over 100 people
have contacted me to express their consternation about the proposed
move, including many serving riflemen in my constituency. During his
time at the Ministry of Defence, my right hon. Friend the Member for
South Leicestershire (Mr Robathan) listened closely to those concerns,
met me and agreed in writing to look again at the proposed move. He had
also been planning to visit Truro to help him to understand further the
impact that the move would have. I hope that his successor as Minister
of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Rayleigh and Wickford (Mr
Francois), will be able to continue that close consideration of that
local concern. I hope that will lead to the proposed reconfiguration
being reviewed. Such a review is simply essential if Cornish residents
are to serve in The Rifles in the manner in which they have proudly
done for centuries and if Cornwall is to continue to contribute to the
British Army to the extent envisioned in the Army Reserve
plan.</hs_Para><hs_Timeline UID="13101777000665" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0002.htm#13101777000665">1.49

sympathy with what the hon. Member for Colchester (Sir Bob Russell)

judge the relative capabilities and costs of reservists as against
regular soldiers. However, there is clearly common ground emerging that
something is going wrong with the recruitment of reservists. My hon.

few words about our Navy, which is also encompassed by the defence
reforms. The previous Government’s strategic defence review in
the late 1990s 
<?notus-xml column=944?>concluded that Britain required a fleet of 32 surface ships, destroyers
and frigates, in order to fulfil its capability needs. Now we have a
fleet of 19 surface ships in the form of frigates and destroyers. I
know that these ships have greater capability than ever before, but I
would be surprised if they had acquired a capability proportionate to
the loss of numbers that has been experienced since the defence review
in the late 1990s. Even as an amateur strategist, I can understand
that, as the noble Lord West, a former Sea Lord, has helpfully pointed
out, a ship can only be in one place at one time. I doubt that there
are fewer threats in the world today than there were in the late 1990s
and that the world has become a much safer place since the turn of the
last century. While other nations are responding to the world as it is
by increasing the number and capability of their surface fleet, we are
seeing a diminution in ours.</hs_Para>

Alnwick in my constituency is keeping a good and strong TA centre of

for people from rural areas to attend training nights, we will cut off
a significant source of recruitment. There are many loyal people in

Essex boy. I ended up being interviewed for the Cheshire Regiment. It
was weird. I did not really understand what the regimental system was
until I got to the regiment in Bahrain on 25 July 1969. When I

was taught regimental history very rapidly. I was taught that the
colours were the heart of the regiment and that they were carried by
subalterns. Everybody in the Chamber will remember the story of the two
young officers who were given the colours in 1879 to cross the

did not understand how much that tradition mattered until I went to
Londonderry later that year. When I lost a third of my platoon, I saw
why regiments were so important. My men went back into the regimental
system and said, “We’ve got to do the right
thing.” Twelve years later, I saw that pride in action again
when I lost six men at Ballykelly on 6 December 1982. When I buried six
of my soldiers, four of their mothers put their arms around me and
said, “We understand how you feel.” That was amazing.
That is why the regimental system is so important to Government and
Opposition Members. The regiment is a family and it acts like that. It
gives the Army huge strength in adversity. That is why it is so

Monday, I hosted a visit to this place for 15 soldiers and
officers from my old regiment. I reminisced fondly about my time in the

different view. They were not the Cheshires that I had been in; they
were another lot. Since 1 September 2007, they had been in 1st
Battalion the Mercian Regiment and they were no longer the Cheshires.
They had a new regimental identity that had been bonded in battle on
two severe tours in Afghanistan. I realised that the way that I looked
at things was all over and that a new generation was coming. I do not

some experience of dealing with Capita from the Public Accounts

Territorial Army and reserve forces? The Army is reducing the Regular
Army by 19,500 personnel, and working to increase the Army reserve to
30,000 from a current trained strength of 19,000. That is fair enough.
It has been said in the debate that we need to recruit 20 people per
constituency, so why are we not doing so? We must get a grip on the
issue and understand from the Minister exactly what is happening on the
ground. Why are we cutting people who have done their jobs well and who

a career? Why are we cutting them and recruiting reservists when we are

colleagues, as well as other commentators, have been just as suspicious
of the MOD’s ability to recruit and train so many recruits in
such a short time span, and the more the debate continues, the more
some of us worry about that. How many regulars will sign up as
reservists? They entered as career soldiers and many may feel betrayed
at being forcibly deprived of their jobs. Will they be keen to join as
reservists? What preparations have the Government made for the loss of
those skills and experience? The redundancy notices that the soldiers
have received are real and can be held in their hands; the reservists

conclusion, I believe history has shown that a standing Army adds
tremendous value to Great Britain. During the first and second world

to add another battalion—or two or three—to an existing
regiment, than to imagine an entire reserve force almost ex nihilo.
These regiments have long and proud histories that have come under

my view, the full potential of the carriers needs to be exploited. For
example, we are not considering having unmanned aerial systems on
board, but that will become the norm in future. Drone systems like the
ScanEagle, the Fire Scout and the X47-B are already available and exist
on other carriers, yet we do not have a programme to consider them,
even though our ships will be around for the next 40 years. On
capability, it is worth noting that two thirds of airborne operations
conducted over Afghanistan by the Americans took place from aircraft
carriers based in the Indian ocean. We need to recognise that those are
versatile bits of
kit.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000245" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000245">Rotary
systems have been mentioned. The Apache played a pivotal and
interesting but new role in Libya, with the use of Hellfire missiles,
extending the range at which we can use our force capability. Hellfire
has a range of 8 km, the Storm Shadow 500 km, and Brimstone 12 km. I
stress these points because two thirds of the world population lives
within 250 miles of the coastline. That is where future conflict will
take place. If we do not want to put boots on the ground, it is
aircraft carriers that will allow us to conduct and expedite such
operations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000246" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000246">Continuing
to operate two carriers will send a powerful message to potential
adversaries, both state and non-state, but also to our allies, such as
the US, allowing us in turn to employ greater leverage on their
decision making. It 
<?notus-xml column=955?>will also save millions of pounds because we would not have to create
forward bases or undertake long-range operations. In the operations in
Libya, Tornados had to be refuelled five times—three times on
the way there and two on the way back, putting massive strain on the
airframes. Operating two carriers will give us greater flexibility
compared with running just one. With one carrier, operations are likely
to be carrier-strike only—there would be little expeditionary
capability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000247" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000247">Hon.
Members have spoken passionately about retaining the soldiers who live
in their constituencies. My question is this: what are the soldiers
expected to do? Huge work needs to be done on expeditionary capability,
upstream engagement and stabilisation. We could win the war quickly,
but lose the peace because we do not have such stabilisation. Aircraft
carriers can play an important role in that. Two aircraft carriers
could have a tailored expeditionary capability that we have never
had.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000248">Other
nations are watching us with interest. The Americans have the Wasp
class carriers, which are 44,000 tonnes, and the Nimitz class
carriers, which, because of sequestration, are likely to be removed.
They are looking at the 65,000 tonne class with interest, and also saw
what we did with the Apache. They may want to follow suit. We do not
talk this up. Building a third aircraft carrier is not even being
considered because of the embarrassment and the legacy problems

believe that the additional annualised cost of a carrier, which has
been mentioned—about £65 million a year—is a small
price to pay for the diplomatic signal and military statement of intent
it would send to potential adversaries, state and non-state alike. It
would significantly reduce the operational cost of war fighting,
conflict prevention and peacekeeping roles. It would also elevate
Britain’s ranking as Europe’s senior military power,
justifying our permanent membership of the UN Security Council. I hope

am pleased to be able to speak in the debate. I shall ask three brief
questions. The first question, to the House, is this: do we need to
restructure our armed forces? We had not had a review for many years.
Given the military deficit that the Labour Government left the current
one, if Labour were still in power—heaven forefend—it
would have had to have
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000255" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000255">The
second question is whether we need to rebalance the armed forces in
favour of the reserves. Broadly speaking, that is the right thing to
do. I disagree with my hon. Friend the Member for Basildon and
Billericay because in this post-cold war asymmetrical world he referred
to, it is not appropriate to have an overwhelming number of regular
forces. It is more appropriate to have a flexible reserve-based force.
Our allies are doing that. In 1990, our Territorial Army was more than
twice the size than the proposed Reserve Army, so I do not think that
having approximately 30,000 reservists out of a total of 120,000 in our
armed forces is inappropriate.</hs_Para>

been many reforms and there has been opposition to them. There was
opposition to “Options for Change” a generation ago, and
to the Keith Speed reforms in 1980. There was opposition to the changes
in 1959, and I am sure there was opposition to Edward Cardwell’s
reforms in 1872. The question is not so much whether reform is wrong,
but whether the Ministry of Defence has got this reform right. Broadly
speaking, I think it has. The question we are asking ourselves is can
we recruit enough people into the reserve to match the draw-down of our
regular forces at a time of falling joblessness and increased career
alternatives for young people? The answer is yes, if we get it
right.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000257" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000257"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bob Stewart" PimsId="5537" UID="13101777000789" xid="1011" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000789">Bob

Pincher:</Member></B> Gap planning is the trial and tribulation of any
organisation. Businesses all around the country have to deal with gap
planning, particularly when people who are in the reserves need to go
on deployment or training. The issue for many such firms—I used
to be involved in an organisation that had a lot of reservists going on
deployment—is not so much planning for 40 days away, because
that is something that can, to a greater or lesser extent, be planned
for; the challenge is ensuring that there is somebody to step
temporarily into the reservist’s role, that the handover is done
effectively, the person is able to discharge their other
responsibilities while stepping into that role, and, when the reservist
returns, that the handover back is smooth. Making sure that those sorts
of challenges are dealt with is one way for companies big and small to
be confident about recruiting and retaining reservists. That is
particularly important for firms whose bread and butter is deploying
their resources at their clients’ sites. They have to consider
what their clients might think of their staff leaving and coming back
for periods of time.</hs_Para>

message for the Minister, who is knowledgeable about these matters and
is committed to our armed forces, is to ensure that big and small
businesses recognise the advantages of having reservists on their
books. Most firms put great store in training and skill capability.
They need to know that the MOD, the Army, the  
<?notus-xml column=957?>Air Force and the Navy will train the reservists on
their books, giving them the skills that their firms want, need and can
use. As my hon. Friend the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew
Selous) said in a very good speech, it is incumbent on the MOD to work
with the Federation of Small Businesses, the CBI and local chambers of
commerce to ensure that businesses know the value of the training that
reservists will receive, so they are more likely to want to recruit and
retain them. If we do that, we can move further and faster towards the
objective the Minister hopes to achieve, and this change in the
deployment of our resources will be
successful.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/B1A8AD7271429506C41E0E50271FCF35C7F3CE8C" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 October 2013">Thursday

as my hon. Friend the Member for Canterbury (Mr Brazier), who arguably
knows more about the reserves than the rest of the House put together,
pointed out, it will bring us into line with our principal allies and
partners, who currently rely more heavily on reserves than we do.
Currently, reserves represent about 17% of our total armed forces, and
that is scheduled to rise to 25% under our proposals. This compares to
36% in Australia, 51% in Canada—that is the figure I
have—and 55% in the
US.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000282" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000282">Since

the way there, and we need to achieve the other third over four years.
My hon. Friend the Member for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)
summed it up brilliantly: we need, on average, an additional 20
reservists from each parliamentary constituency across the country in
order to do that. I believe we certainly can do that. As the Chief of

plan—because it is failing or because recruitment targets cannot
be met or because costs are rising and TA numbers are at a low ebb or
because of disorganisation—there comes a point when one has to
ask “Is this project creating false economies, therefore costing
the taxpayer dear?” The motion says simply that we should
“delay” the axing of the regular battalions until we know
that the reservist plan is both “viable and
cost-effective”; otherwise, because of false economies and
unrealistic expectations, the taxpayer could pay dearly. That is not

debate this important subject, and to the Backbench Business Committee
for agreeing to it. I have to declare an interest, in that I am a
vice-president of the National Deaf Children’s Society and of
Action on Hearing Loss, and I chair the all-party group on deafness. I
can also declare a personal interest, as I have a deaf daughter. She is
now grown up, but she was six when I was elected to the House, so
throughout my time here, and for some time before, issues relating to
deaf adults and deaf children have been of paramount concern to
me.</hs_Para>

today’s debate because I am concerned that support for deaf
children is being cut at a time when they need more, not less, support.
Having campaigned on these issues for such a long time, I remain
frustrated that this country does not support deaf people as well as I
believe it should and as well as some other countries do. Ten years
ago, I produced a report for the Council of Europe on sign languages. I
secured support from the Parliamentary Assembly for legal recognition
of sign languages across Europe; sadly, the Committee of Ministers
never acted on it.</hs_Para>

that we need to ensure that deaf children get the help they need,
particularly in terms of communication support. More than 50,000 people
have signed a petition calling on the Government to act on the issue
and many MPs have signed the motion and shown support for the debate.
There is considerable strength of interest in and support for the
subject. The debate is being closely watched by deaf people and their
families across the country and is being actively monitored in the
Twittersphere by those who are most directly
affected.</hs_Para>

Malcolm Bruce:</Member></B> I absolutely acknowledge that. Jack Ashley
was the honorary president of the all-party group and, having at first
been sceptical about setting up a discrete group for deaf people, he
actively supported it once it was created. That is a key part of this
debate. I accept that all kinds of children have special educational
needs and have no doubt that the Minister will allude to Government
policy on special educational needs, but I hope that he will also
accept that deaf children have specific needs that need to be
articulated expressly in policy and not just swept up in general issues
of special needs and disability.</hs_Para>

Gentleman moves away from the subject of sign language, is he aware of
the problems faced by people such as my constituent Rachel Goswell? She
has a profoundly deaf son, Jesse, and the only way of communicating
with him will be to learn sign language herself. There is no support
locally for parents to learn sign language. Does he agree that that and
the training of educationalists at a local level cannot be left to a
postcode lottery? There must be national guidelines so that everyone in
England gets the same level of support.</hs_Para>

statistics or data on deaf children, and that is a problem in itself.
As we increasingly mainstream deaf children, they become less visible
and can also be socially isolated, particularly if they are the only
deaf child in the school. There is evidence that they might be bullied,
they might suffer depression and not all of them thrive. I am not
against mainstreaming in principle, but I believe that some profoundly
and severely deaf children will make better progress in a school
resourced properly and dedicated to their needs. Schools such as
Heathlands in St Albans and Frank Barnes, which serves London, offer
impressive education for deaf children but such schools are not found

I would like to believe that Governments in the end will say,
“We need data and if the data show that we are not up to the
mark, even if we cannot solve the problem overnight, we will at least
embark on a strategy to do something about it.” So it is not a

specific responsibility.</hs_Para>

recognition that people are going to be scrutinised, that gets the

support is at the heart of what deaf children and their families need.
I know that from personal experience. I have very poor sign language. I
did go on a course but I found it very difficult. It is a language and
I had difficulty keeping up with it. I try where I can. I notice that
every time I am in the company of deaf people—which, because of
my interest, I very often am—the transformation of that
relationship by the sheer appearance of an interpreter is phenomenal.
Therefore I understand absolutely why communication support is so
valuable. As one blind person said to me, “I would prefer to be
blind than deaf because being blind cuts me off from things, but being
deaf would cut me off from people and I would find that far
worse.” That is what people need to understand—the social
isolation resulting from the lack of communication

diminished in recent years and in some ways that is a good thing. We
have rubella vaccination and other measures, but deafness will not be
eliminated. Congenital deafness or unexplained deafness in newborn

in infancy, so there will always be some deaf people in our community

interpreters and a very much stronger support network in those two
areas. That pilot was a success and the present Prime Minister has
acknowledged that fact, but the scheme has not yet been rolled out

step change in sign language that we need could be driven by technical
innovations. The Minister responsible for communications in the

BT and, this week Sky, announced that sign language-using customers
wishing to communicate with Sky or with BT can do so using a video
relay service. Most deaf people I know who talk about video relay
services say, “I don’t want a video relay service to

my mum, my boss or other people.” That system is established
right across America, and it is hugely successful. I hope that we can
find a way to achieve that, because it would make a huge contribution
to communication. It would also lead to a rapid expansion in the

attitudes towards sign language communication and spoken language
communication are quite different. The Department for Work and Pensions

recognise Cornish, Welsh and Gaelic, which receive huge resources, yet
British sign language, which is an indigenous, created
language—indeed, sign language itself was invented in
Scotland—is not supported. For some people it is their only
language. I know of no Welsh or Gaelic speakers—I do not know
that there are any Cornish speakers—who do not also speak
English, but there are sign language users who do not communicate in
English. We do not support them in the same way we support people who

that he will tell us what the Government are doing. I do not expect him
to say, “Yes, of course we will adopt all those things”,
but we do want champions in the Government who are prepared to drive
them forward and who recognise that it is simply not right to leave out
a whole section of the community who have real and identifiable needs
for which there are practical solutions, not all of which cost a huge
amount of money, but which could transform their life attainment. They
could also provide economic benefits, because the vast majority of deaf
people either cannot get a job or, when they get into the jobs market,
get one well below their skills and standards, so they are inevitably a

America to find out how to set up a school to teach deaf children in
Boston, the Donaldson’s institute said that it was not prepared
to share its teaching mechanism with him. In despair, he found that
there was a seminary in Paris 
<?notus-xml column=970?>teaching deaf children. He ended up taking a squad
of teachers from Paris to American, which is why American deaf people
use a sign language based on French sign language, rather than British
sign language. We invented sign language, but we have not always led

congratulate the right hon. Member for Gordon (Sir Malcolm Bruce) on
bringing this debate to the Chamber. I declare a personal interest,
because my three siblings—my younger brother, Brian, and my two
younger sisters, Clare and Delia—are profoundly deaf. Equality
is a word that we often bandy about in this House, but deaf people in
the United Kingdom have never had equality in education. Progress has
been made thanks to deafness campaigners such as my parents, Bridget
and Charles McCann—the self-same parents the right hon.
Gentleman mentioned who suddenly had a deaf child and did not get any
access to services to support them. However, the fight goes on. The
motion highlights the fact that we still have much work to do, with the
fear and danger that local authorities might cut back on services for
deaf children and young people. The National Deaf Children’s
Society has evidence to suggest that education services for deaf people
might be cut. We should not be talking about cuts; if we genuinely seek
to bring about equality for deaf people, services must be
increased.</hs_Para>

mention that in a party political sense. The Prime Minister agreed with
the First Minister, Alex Salmond, that Scotland would retain its budget
in 2010, so we are a year behind the curve. There is already
speculation in Scotland about local government services being cut, and
I suspect that services to deaf children and young people are in

will not be ungenerous in suggesting that we have not made some
progress in the past 40 years. Let me tell the House about my
experience with my brothers and 
<?notus-xml column=971?>sisters. I remember the grey bus arriving in front of our house in East
Kilbride. On the bus were children with every disability one could
think of—physical disabilities, physical and mental
disabilities, or deaf-blindness. The amalgamation of challenges
presented by those children with disabilities led to two things. First,
it dumbed down education. At the school my brother and sisters went to,
the education was carried out at the lowest common denominator instead
of challenging the kids to do the best they could.</hs_Para>

there was the stigma. As you can imagine, children can be cruel. As the
elder brother, I ended up with a few second prizes in the pugilism
stakes. If your brother’s and sisters’ honour is
criticised in some way, or they are taunted by other children, then you
step in and defend them. Yes, children can be cruel, but we should
remember that adults—the educationists of the

inequality of 40 years ago was palpable. Profoundly deaf children were
not allowed to sign. The right hon. Member for Gordon talked about
British sign language. We made up our own sign language in the house,
because there was no formal language to communicate in. Believe it or
not, my brother was forced to sit with his hands behind his back in the
classroom, unable to communicate, despite the fact that he was
profoundly deaf. Forty years ago, deaf children had no access to the
curriculum that I had as a hearing child. That meant that their ability
to learn was stifled. Bright young deaf children were consigned to the
dustbin on the day and hour they first entered their primary
school.</hs_Para>

that my brother and sisters have done very well in their adult lives,
mainly because of my parents’ refusal to take no for an answer.
They refused to take on board what the educationists of the time said
was good for such children. The perceived wisdom of the day was that
people listened to the educationists. Hearing parents who did not know
about deafness would take the word of the people who were professional
and allegedly knew more than they did. The less vigorous parents, who
were not prepared to campaign like my parents, took the
educationalists’ word and ultimately their children suffered and
did not get anywhere near the aspirations achieved by my brother and
sisters. However, they have fallen foul of many of the problems
mentioned by the right hon. Gentleman, including mental health issues
and the inability to get employment. I often wonder what my brother and
sisters could have achieved—even though they have achieved a

recognise that there are many shades between hearing and deafness: some
have lost a little hearing while others lose it a little later in life,
and on the other side of the spectrum are those who are profoundly
death. With the greatest respect to the tribute paid to Jack Ashley

key issue is British sign language, the officially recognised language
for the deaf. As the right hon. Gentleman has said, it is diverse and
colourful and as finessed as any other language in the world. In fact,
Members may be interested to know that every person’s sign name

surprised or even shocked to learn that teachers of the deaf are

right hon. Gentleman has said, the fact that there is such a dearth of
talent in this field means that some get jobs as teachers of the deaf
and are labelled as such even though they have skills only at BSL level
2. It should be an aspiration, and I hope the Minister will address
that issue in his response. We should raise the standards for teachers
of the deaf and ensure that the right quality of individual is teaching
our deaf children. I have thought about the best way to describe the
situation. It is like asking someone who has just failed their driving

child’s development because they advise on whether the child is
accessing the curriculum properly and adequately, on that
child’s language development and how they are hearing through
hearing aids or cochlear implants, and on whether they need a radio aid

they are assessed to be above a certain level, any one-to-one support
that the child previously received, or which they may need in future,
is withdrawn, and they begin primary school without it. What should the
nursery do? Should it support the child to develop to the maximum level
possible and risk that one-to-one support being withdrawn when they go
to primary school? Withdrawal of such support would undoubtedly 
<?notus-xml column=975?>result in the child falling back and not continuing

am a realist on the economic situation and the amount of money we have

passport to schools money for specialist education support service. It
occurs to me that this is an area where decisions should be taken in
conjunction with parents. It is not enough for a local authority to
say, “We’ve given the money to the schools and
we’re washing our hands of it.” There may be some
circumstances where schools are the right people to hold the budget,
but there may be others where the local authority, or some other
partnership, should play a key part. This is one area where we should
not be too quick to diminish the role of local education authorities,
and where the case for partnership and collaboration rather than
competition between schools is well made. Like others, I have noticed

bright, confident and articulate deaf young man, and was quickly in
charge of the whole meeting. He explained to me clearly that he would
not be where he is today without the help of the specialist support
services he had received to date. Even with deaf young people such as
Adam, we can see the risks of what happens when support does not match
their needs and is cut. Adam told me that the support he received in
maths was variable because of staff turnover, and that the extra
support had been reduced to just once a week. This meant that he was

progress. It is more often (in my experience) those pupils with a mild
to moderate hearing loss who are not entitled to additional support in
school who find it more difficult to progress and overcome the barriers
to their learning. At the present time our service is able to support
these pupils also, enabling many of them to ‘narrow the
gap’ and achieve age-related expectations. However, one of the
fears for our service in Dorset

become a ‘traded service’ this would mean that schools

Brooke:</Member></B> I accept the hon. Gentleman’s point, but I
am flagging up fears about the future, not about what is happening now.
If each school had to buy in the service, it would be more difficult to
spread it over a larger number of pupils. I think we would still have
excellent support in Dorset for those with a statement of educational
need or an education health care plan, but many of those with not such
severe conditions are not achieving their potential in speech, language
and literacy skills. It is important, therefore, not only to consider
what is happening now, but to look at what might happen in the future
and to ensure that we maintain support for hearing impaired
children.</hs_Para>

speakers, I want to emphasise the need for good, specialist
communication support workers and teachers. It has been many years, but
I remember being struck by the fact that many communication support
workers—I still call them teaching assistants—had only
level 2 qualifications in sign language. It must be difficult for
somebody with just a level 2 qualification—an important
qualification in its own right—to communicate the technical
language of science and maths. I am really concerned about
that.</hs_Para>

been an honourable one during his time in the House. Indeed, he has

understanding of what hearing loss is about. I spend most of my time in
the Chamber during Prime Minister’s questions standing near the

However, using the loop, I miss lots of the witticisms that other
colleagues contribute—I know that they are sometimes better than
some of the speeches, although fortunately not in this

with hearing loss or born deaf. Given the powerful speeches that we
have heard so far, and given the personal experience of those two
families in particular, I cannot imagine how much more difficult it is
for those children to come to terms with their predicament. I will come

hear what the Minister has to say, because we are seeking reassurances
today. The two most disturbing stats I have read in the NDCS briefing,
which have been mentioned by other hon. Members, concern exam passes
and parental communication. As colleagues have said—including my
hon. Friend the Member for East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow and
the right hon. Member for Gordon, who have personal family
experience—we are not talking about kids who have not got
ability, yet only 37% of deaf children achieve five GCSEs, which was
down last year from 40% in 2011. That is an indictment of the education
system and of all of us for allowing it to happen. The NDCS briefing

point from the NDCS briefing that I found shocking was that 81% of
parents with deaf children never learn how to communicate fully with
their child, which is mostly down to costs. The briefing says that it
costs several hundred pounds to learn to sign—I learnt to sign
the alphabet when I was young, but it is quite a long way from that to
messaging by letter—but the right hon. Member for Gordon said
that it now costs thousands of pounds. That is a real deterrent to
ordinary families.</hs_Para>

children, along with their teachers, in a variety of schools. I commend
all that they do in Tower Hamlets. It is clear from the NDCS briefing

the NDCS report asks for three things—they have already been

the development of those services, but it is important to remember that
we are talking today about a particular cohort—a cohort about

thought was particularly interesting in the helpful briefing from the
National Deaf Children’s Society was the issue of working out
the numbers of children and young people with hearing loss. The
estimate is over 45,000, but if we look at the official figures, the
position becomes very confusing, to say the least. The school census
records 16,000 children formally identified as having a hearing loss
special educational need. The way that is categorised, however, can
vary from school to school, so the figure is not reliable. There
clearly needs to be far greater co-ordination of these
numbers.</hs_Para>

NDCS suggestions are worthy of consideration by the Minister—for
example, whether schools and local authorities should be requested to
record in the school census whether the child has a disability as well
as a formally identified special educational need; and whether there is
a better way of capturing whether a child has a sensory impairment by
looking at the child’s unique health identifier or extending
that to education and social care as well. That chimes very well with
the education, health and care plan approach that is central to the
welcome Children and Families Bill, currently proceeding in the other
place. The Minister and I have enjoyed many debates in Committee on
that and other issues, including on the strength and quality of the
local offer that will form the heart of accountability for parents and
children and young people with special educational needs. Clearly, more
needs to be done properly to identify the need in the first
place.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000512">Let
us look at a positive example of a local authority that is doing much
to address some of the issues identified today. I refer to my own local
authority of Swindon, which has two special resource provisions for
primary and for secondary education. One commissioned body providing
services is based at Red Oaks primary school, while the secondary
provision is based at the Ridgeway school. I know that school very well
from my days as a governor, and from my many visits to the special
resource provision for hearing-impaired pupils. I pay warm tribute to
the staff, pupils and parents who are involved in those two facilities,
and also to the outreach work done by both facilities in the wider
educational community in the borough. The budget in Swindon for special
provision and outreach services is just over £900,000, which is
spent on interventions that allow young people with hearing loss to
integrate properly with others, and to have the opportunities that
children who have hearing take for
granted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000513" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000513">Over

secondary and Red Oaks primary schools to plan for better British sign

to ensure that they are, and are seen to be, equally valued by their

professionals from education, health and social services but members of
the voluntary sector, and it is led by parents. When organisations are
led by parents and service users, services, rather than being developed
in a way that is remote from users, are much more focused on the needs
of users and their families. Moreover, keeping provision local is good
for local authorities, for which out-of-borough provision can be
significantly more costly. That is a good local example of money being

their cohort group in school and eventually become educational
under-achievers, and all sorts of other things follow from that. Ofsted
inspections could look carefully at what is done in all schools to
identify children with hearing difficulties. I know it sounds odd that
we are even saying that, but it is actually perfectly
possible for a child in a class of 30 children to be forgotten or
ignored because they might be able to copy what others do where written
answers are involved and have some minor level of hearing that enables
them just about to cope. We need to ensure that all children are
properly tested on their hearing abilities from the very beginning, and
the Ofsted inspection could help to do that.</hs_Para>

these circumstances it is very easy to see how in some local
authorities the needs of a relatively small group of children will be
forgotten or ignored, or the money will simply be spent on something
else for which somebody is able to shout louder and push harder for the
funding. Therefore, inspection and the protection and ring-fencing of
the funds available for children with profound deafness are very
important
indeed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000527">The
last point I wish to make is that if we ignore and do not provide
sufficient support for children who suffer from this condition, their
health will suffer and they will become increasingly dependent and less
able to contribute to wider society. As a result, we all suffer,
because we will spend money on children who ought to be able to achieve
a great deal in school and on adults who ought to be able to achieve a
great deal in life, but they end up unemployed and dependent when they
could be making an enormous positive contribution to society. It is
very wasteful not to identify the needs in the first place and to use
all the available technology to improve communication and help people.
Sign language and its teaching are very important vehicles for
that.</hs_Para>

accounts, colleagues who attended were inspired by what they heard. As

require the most support, including deaf children. Correctly, local
authorities have a statutory duty to identify children’s special
educational needs and to provide the services to meet them. However,
the NDCS’s report reveals that many deaf children—perhaps
the majority of them—are not statemented. Not only is that a

Government have, of course, taken action. They ensure that local

services for deaf children as part of the high needs block. However,
that does not prevent local authorities from reducing funding overall
for those services and, as we now know from the NDCS 
<?notus-xml column=985?>report, many of them appear either to be doing that or threatening to do
it. My own county council in Lincolnshire takes a much more
satisfactory line. We are protecting and even increasing funding for

same wisdom.</hs_Para>

place in a context in which too many deaf children are already
underachieving, as the House has heard, and are simply not getting the

used for those needs.</hs_Para>

to the general problem might well be to see what more could be done on
a regional basis, particularly given the current economic climate. I
would be interested to hear the Minister’s thoughts on that.
Deafness is a low-incidence disability and the complex needs of deaf
children are not something that many local authorities, particularly
smaller authorities, appear able to address on their own. The available
research, to which the NDCS has drawn attention, is pretty damning.
Many local authorities employ two or fewer visiting teachers of the
deaf, and it is impossible to see how such small teams can provide the
specialist support needed by all the deaf children and their families
in those areas. We are, of course, as the hon. Member for Poplar and
Limehouse (Jim Fitzpatrick) mentioned, too often talking about families
who cannot or who are not in a position to fight the system. Sometimes
they come to us to do it for them, but they are often disadvantaged
families and we should be doing everything we can to help their equally
disadvantaged children.</hs_Para>

about Frank Barnes, which is one of the few schools in the country that
provides a bilingual approach to teaching where deaf children learn
sign language and English together. That is critical, because, as I
pointed out in an intervention on my right hon. Friend the Member for
Gordon, all the research in this area tells us that communication in
the early years, however it is achieved, is critical for life outcomes.
Schools such as Frank Barnes therefore have an important role to play
as centres of excellence and more should perhaps be done both to
support them and to use the resources which they offer to other schools
in their areas. Specialist schools across the country have the scope to
innovate in teaching, but that is too often not the case in mainstream
education, where there is so much focus on inclusion—inclusion
that can too often, for deaf children, become exclusionary.</hs_Para>

I think the Government could considerably improve provision by
encouraging local authorities to work together to commission services
on a regional basis and to work with centres of excellence such as
Frank Barnes. Some authorities have perhaps already recognised that,
but others have yet to do so, presumably because they lack the
necessary expertise in dealing with the education of deaf children to
realise that it is necessary. I want to hear from the Minister the
Government’s views on whether any steps can be taken to
encourage the regional commissioning of services for low-incidence
special needs, and for deafness in
particular.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000537">The
House has already heard something about the inspection regime and the
recommendations of the NDCS. Teachers of the deaf play an important
role in 
<?notus-xml column=986?>supporting deaf children and their families and I know that the

ourselves why, in 2013, a parent of a deaf child at a school such as
Frank Barnes can be confident that their child is getting a good
education because the school has been inspected, but a parent of a deaf
child in a nearby mainstream school cannot? The Government must look at
that anomaly and fix it, and I hope to hear from the Minister that the
Government are considering requiring Ofsted to inspect all educational
services for deaf
children.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000539">At
the same time, schools also need more guidance on progression
trajectories for deaf children and how they differ between
mainstream and specialist schools. In the past, special schools
for the deaf have requested comparative data reports, similar to
reports that were previously produced under the performance and
assessment—PANDA—system to support the benchmarking of
pupil attainment and other measures. There is currently no way of
comparing the performances of SEN schools, as the direct comparison of
data has apparently stopped, and that cannot help special schools to
make
progress.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000540">Ofsted
says, as I understand it, that it is unable to provide the data because
of the challenges of categorising pupils who are deaf or those with
special educational needs, but it fails to suggest how, without
reliable data, professionals can assess how well deaf children
are doing or how, for that matter, local authorities can
properly commission services.</hs_Para>

proper data on deafness, as on all special needs, local authorities
cannot plan ahead and cannot know what they have to commission for the
future. The point has, I know, been stressed by the Department for
Education in the draft special educational needs code of
practice, recently published for consultation, but more can be done.
For example, as my hon. Friend the Member for South Swindon (Mr
Buckland) said, the school census captures only about two thirds of
deaf children, as they are only identified if they have been formally
assessed as having a special educational need. I hope that the
Department will wish to look into whether that can be improved by
looking at what data are required from schools in the
census.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000542">Those
who know more about these things than I do also tell me that part of
the problem with getting accurate data is that even now there are no
agreed definitions to help identify which children are deaf. I have to
say to the Minister that that is not an acceptable state of affairs.
The Government must work, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Gordon
said, with professional bodies to agree on suitable definitions to
enable data to be collected more
effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000543" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0003.htm#13101777000543">In
the time available, let me come to specialist teaching. I have already
noted that the high needs block within the dedicated schools grant for
local authorities will include funding for specialist support services,
including peripatetic teachers of the deaf, and that is no doubt to be
welcomed. However, as my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham (Tim Loughton) noted in an intervention, around 80% of
teachers of the deaf are now over the age of 50. This is at a time when
the 
<?notus-xml column=987?>number of training departments appears to be
reducing. The Minister and the Department therefore need to think now
about succession planning for teachers of the deaf, because action must
be taken to maintain specialism funding and to give more support for,
for example, specialist masters degrees, including funding for schools
to provide cover while teachers study.</hs_Para>

saying that, although there is still much to be done, the future is
much rosier than it once looked. Lengthy battles like the one I had to
fight to keep Frank Barnes open because the previous Government had
formulated the law so that special schools closed, look as though they
are now history. Good local authorities, like mine in Lincolnshire,
understand much better the issues that surround deaf education and the
need to deploy appropriate resources.</hs_Para>

and the NDCS report reveal, however, that although things are perhaps
rosier, they are simply not perfect. So the Government need to act, and
to act now. It is worth doing so not merely because deaf children are
children just like any others—entitled to the best education and
the best start in life that we can give them—but because the
costs to other services in the long term are much reduced by good early
intervention that improves life chances. Helping deaf children to learn
and communicate makes their lives much easier; it means that they are
more likely to find employment; it means that they are less likely to
develop mental health problems due to feelings of alienation from a
society of which they are, after all, part. The case made by the NDCS
in its report, as reflected in the motion before the House, is
unanswerable. It is one that I respectfully suggest that the Minister
must listen
to.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-17?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_17_PT_1/F6AFFF8F7C4AF0CD4C14C1AB250B536B77468BF0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="17 October 2013">Thursday

<?notus-xml column=989?>because of their disability, and they must not discriminate against
them. If, after those adjustments have been made, children and young
people need special educational provision or specialist services, the
duties that schools, local authorities and others have in relation to
special educational needs come into play. The Children and Families
Bill, which includes our reforms to this area, is currently being
debated in the other place. I shall say more about those changes a
little
later.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000554" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000554">The
NDCS is concerned that, as things stand, services for deaf children
risk being undermined by cuts. We have heard some examples of that this
afternoon. I want to reassure the House that we have ensured that all
local authorities have as much funding for SEN in 2013-14 as they had
in 2012-13. The NDCS acknowledges that the Government have protected
funding for vulnerable learners. Local authorities decide what SEN
services to provide for children and young people, including services
for deaf children, and how much to spend on them, from the funding that
we
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000555" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000555">The
services that local authorities typically provide, either directly or
by commissioning other providers, include services for visual, hearing
and physical impairment; specific learning difficulties; speech,
language and communication; profound and severe learning difficulties;
and autism. Local authorities are reporting that they are spending no
less on their SEN services this year than they spent last year. Through
their local funding formula, they also include in delegated schools
budgets a clear amount of funding intended to meet the needs of pupils
with additional needs, including those with SEN or disabilities.
Special schools and other schools with special units often use their
budgets to develop particular specialist services, including those for
pupils with hearing impairments. I have seen that for myself in
Springfield special school in Crewe in my constituency. Where
necessary, schools receive extra top-up funding from their local
authority for the additional support costs of pupils with the greatest
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000556" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000556">We
are committed to ensuring that the needs of children with SEN are met.
We have been clear with local authorities—I re-emphasis the
point now—that they should prioritise vital front-line services
for vulnerable children. However, we should not forget that the current
financial climate, as Members have acknowledged today, means that
everyone in Government, both local and national, has to make tough

effectively.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000557" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000557">We

services for young people whose needs are less common, so we are
encouraging them to work together on such provision. I heard the point
my hon. and learned Friend the Member for Sleaford and North Hykeham
(Stephen Phillips) made about regional commissioning, and I will
certainly look at that as part of the work we are doing and the reforms
we are undertaking. Where services have to be changed, that should be
done with a careful assessment of the impact on families, and those

the NDCS has set out, most deaf children attend mainstream schools,
some with additional specialist units offering support on site.
Assessments on how well those schools perform will be made as part of
Ofsted’s school inspection regime. The new Ofsted inspection

know that the NDCS and Members are calling for an alternative approach
in which Ofsted would inspect the local authority services that work
with schools to support deaf pupils, and there is some initial appeal
in that, but the same argument could be made for pupils with autism,
speech and language needs or dyslexia. However, I understand that this
is part of a wider question about the inspection of the reformed SEN

from the role that Ofsted could play, I want to stress that the SEN

want to challenge councils through their involvement in determining

my Department on our SEN reforms have made it clear that they want to
see reforms which provide legal protections; establish a better system
for identifying need and commissioning services across education,
health and social care; ensure that the services provided match local
needs as accurately as possible; and ensure that families do not have
to battle to get those services. That is what our reforms are

done to ensure that deaf children and young people get the right

very important debate. I hope that one or two other Members who have an

find it beneficial. I labelled it “The Lessons of Daniel Pelka

horrid shock to MPs who have never had anything like this happen in
their constituency before but have to get to grips with it as part of
the job. As so much is taking place at the moment around the discussion
groups, this debate is a unique opportunity for us, as a small group in
the House, to see what might be done and what might be improved. One
thing is for sure: there has been report after report, study after

people say to me, “It will always happen—don’t
worry about it. It’s bound to happen and you can’t stop
it.” I find that repugnant. I cannot believe that Daniel Pelka,
whose home was visited 27 times following domestic violence incidents,
who turned up at school getting thinner and thinner, who was showing
bruises and was clearly being maltreated in every other respect, needed
to die. I cannot accept it; it seems ludicrous to me. We have to find a
much better way of dealing with the situation in an improved way, step

great expert in this area, and has done a tremendous amount and mounted
campaign after campaign on it, for suggesting that my focus in terms of
the Coventry report—she had read before I did,
typically—should be on the fact that nobody spoke to the child.
The poor child was going to school starving, being beaten up, and in
the end clubbed and killed, and nobody tried to speak to him. One of
the answers given is that he was Polish. Well, there are
Polish-speaking people we could draw on, as we saw the other night in

might have been plagiarism—I hope that is not an inappropriate
word—but that was another idea I was going to take from her. We
should have not one huge centre but various centres in which creative
means of communicating with difficult children are imaginatively
developed and explored. The day before Daniel Pelka died, a teacher was
found in another school in Coventry—there are loads of
them—to talk to him. She happened to be Polish and was able to
speak the language, but that is not good enough. It is pathetic that

is not that the agencies are not talking to each other. They probably
are not as good at communicating with each other as they should be and
improvement is necessary, but the problem is that we do not know who is
responsible. The NSPCC says that a lead is needed. It is not a
lead that is needed, but somebody who is responsible for the case and
who knows that he is responsible for it. I am sorry, I should have said
“he or she”, because the only person who had the guts to
put a foot in the door and leave it there was a female youth community
officer, who did a fantastic job and found out that the abuse was going
on.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000590" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000590">MASH

Loughton:</Member></B> I am loth to intervene again in case the hon.
Gentleman does not get on to his other points, but I must say that the
MASH is the way to go. It allows all the different agencies to
communicate with each other better because they sit next to each other
in the same room. In a relatively short period of time, all the
relevant people can come together and swap information. Importantly,
somebody then picks up the ball and acts on what has been said. That is
the responsible person to whom the hon. Gentleman rightly refers. It is
happening more effectively in MASHs than it has done before. That is
why most London authorities and most other authorities in the country
are going that way. It is the way to
go.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000592" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000592"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robinson" PimsId="405" UID="13101777000955" xid="506" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000955">Mr
Robinson:</Member></B> I am delighted to hear that and I wish the hon.
Gentleman well with it. I hope that it works. However, a MASH can work
only if at the end of all the talking—I accept that that has to
happen, because there is no other way of getting everybody to know what
they need to know—there is a clear line of responsibility.
Somebody has to write the minutes, somebody has to say what will be
done and there must be a clearly identifiable responsible person or
group of people who are charged with carrying it through. Otherwise, it
will not
happen.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000593" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000593">The
MASH is a committee and committees do not do anything. It serves the
useful purpose of bringing people together so that they can talk and
exchange the information 
<?notus-xml column=995?>that they need to know about. What is missing from the system is a clear
way of saying at the end of the meeting what the conclusions and
recommendations are. Those must be very short. A person or group of
people—a lead, or whatever you want to call them—must
then be responsible for carrying out those
recommendations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000594">That
was certainly what was missing in Coventry. There was meeting after
meeting. Everybody was grouped together and the information was being
exchanged. However, when the dreadful news broke, I asked who was
actually responsible. The reply was that we were all responsible. If we
are all responsible, no one is. We must not be afraid of allocating
responsibilities and ensuring that they are carried out. If they are
not, retraining is always a good option. People do not have to be
sacked. We are not like that on this side of the House. However, people
in the country cannot accept that the head of the department, Colin
Green, resigned a few days or weeks before the report came out and was
appointed to exactly the same position elsewhere. That was wrong. What
sort of confidence does that
provide?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000595" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000595">That
point reminds me of another Adjournment debate that I secured about a
distinguished surgeon at Walsgrave who was almost sacked because he had
reported somebody else. It turned out that the chief executive of the
hospital was not up to the job—there were a whole series of
these cases—and all six neighbouring MPs served by that hospital
called for his resignation. He was sacked—well, that was what it
was called, but within six months he was back in charge at Birmingham
Heartlands hospital. It is unbelievable what such a network of controls

do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000596" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000596">My
next point will, I am sure, again be contentious for the hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton), and others who are a bit
on the side of the establishment, because it concerns the compositions
of serious case reviews. Each area has its own chairman—that is
all it has, actually—and lay members. When it comes to the
inquiry, the chairman or chairwoman brings in a rapporteur, a writer of
the report, and both she and he know each other—I am not
suggesting that is wrong; it could sometimes be very helpful—and
have written many of these reports in the past, either together or
separately. Already in my book that does not seem quite right. It is
not independent, and the essence of the serious case review is that it
must be seen to be
independent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000597" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000597">My
last point—I have left plenty of time for the
Minister—concerns Ann Lucas, whom I begged to carry out an
independent report. “Why should I be the only one to put
Coventry through that when nobody else has ever done
it?”—she did not say that, but that was what I felt she
felt. That would have meant a completely new board, fresh blood, with
people who did not know the situation in Coventry or the chair of the
Coventry group, and who had a completely dispassionate view.</hs_Para>

think anybody would agree any longer with the police investigating the
police. Why should the civil servants who had administered the case in
question be those who were the team supporting the independent
chair—she was independent—and the so-called appointed
independent rapporteur, or reporter? He wrote the report and one could
see he is a professional. Every perfect piece of civil service-ese was
in it; it could not be faulted. However, out of that comes nothing so
far, and 
<?notus-xml column=996?>so Ann Lucas wrote to me and asked whether I would relay this message to
the House tonight. She is an outstanding council leader who has been in
the job about six months. She was distraught to find that she had

Daniel Pelka could have been saved. That is clear. We need a mechanism
so that when such a point is reached—I guess the people doing it
did not know—or anything like that, the man at the top should be
informed. We need a mechanism to intervene and bring things to a head,
and in a way it is about management. I hope those points will have

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Education (Mr Edward
Timpson):</Member></B> I congratulate the hon. Member for Coventry
North West (Mr Robinson) on securing this important, timely and serious
debate. The tragic case of Daniel Pelka is a stark reminder to us that
we can and must do more to ensure the safety and well-being of our
children. It was helpful to meet the hon. Gentleman recently to discuss
the findings of the serious case review in Coventry and its
implications. I welcome the opportunity to set out the steps that are
being taken to ensure that we fully understand what went wrong and why,
and ensure that any individual and collective failures are identified
and
addressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000603" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000603">National
accountability for child protection rests squarely with the Department
for Education, working closely with other Departments. However, all of
us have a part to play in keeping our children safe. In March 2013, we
published revised statutory guidance—“Working Together to
Safeguard Children”. I was pleased the hon. Gentleman mentioned
the scything of the original document from 700 pages to just over 70,
which was quite a feat in anybody’s language. The guidance
clearly states that anyone concerned about a child’s welfare
should bring it to the attention of the relevant
authorities.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000604" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000604">It
is also clear that the focus of our attention must be on the needs of
individual children rather than on the interests of adults. The serious
case review by the Coventry safeguarding children board showed that,
although many professionals were concerned about Daniel, they did not
speak to him or focus efficiently on either his experiences or his
needs. Our statutory guidance is clear that, if someone is concerned
about the safety of a child, they should refer them to the local
authority children’s social care and ensure that they take into
account the wishes and feelings of the child. That is abundantly clear
and should happen in every case but, 
<?notus-xml column=997?>too often, Daniel was not at the heart of the assessment process. His
needs were completely overshadowed by the perceived needs of his mother
and her
welfare.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000605" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000605">I
was pleased that the SCR was published swiftly and without
redaction—my hon. Friend the Member for East Worthing and
Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has argued for that practice for a long time.
It is important that reports are published in full so that the lessons
are transparent and can be learned. The report highlights a
number of basic practice failures, across a range of agencies, to share
information, keep accurate records, use those records appropriately,
and carry out robust assessments of Daniel’s needs adequately.
As the hon. Gentleman has said, there were numerous opportunities to
intervene and examples of concerned professionals who wanted to do the
right thing, but no decisive intervention was
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000606" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000606">The
purpose of any serious case review is not only to provide a
retrospective description of what happened in the case; nor is it
simply to apportion blame to individuals. An SCR should provide a sound
analysis of why the incident happened and identify the issues on which
agencies need to act individually and collectively to improve services
for children. The SCR in Daniel’s case begins that process, but
I believe that Coventry needs to deepen the analysis to address why
failings
occurred.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000607" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000607"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Robinson" PimsId="405" UID="13101777000957" xid="506" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000957">Mr
Robinson:</Member></B> I intervene on the Minister to pay him a
compliment. There were five or six occasions when intervention should
have happened, and he has asked in his letter why it did not. There is
not a word on that in the SCR, so I hope he gets some satisfactory
answers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000608" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000608"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Timpson" PimsId="5321" UID="13101777000958" xid="581" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000958">Mr
Timpson:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right. Without that type of
analysis, we cannot be confident that the lessons have been learned. We

judgment, and identify where there are systemic weaknesses. That is why
I have asked for that further
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000609" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000609">As
he knows, on 16 September, I wrote to Amy Weir, the independent chair
of the Coventry safeguarding children board—I should emphasise
her independence and the fact that the writer of the serious case
review is appointed independently from the local authority—to
set out my concerns about the serious case review. I was clear that,
unless we get to the bottom of why things happened, we will be unable
to put the right solutions in place. I have asked her to provide a time
scale for carrying out a deeper analysis of that appalling case; why
basic information was not recorded properly both between and within
agencies; why information needed to protect Daniel was not shared
between the relevant agencies; why four separate assessments by
children’s social care fail to identify the risk to Daniel; and
what oversight there was of those decisions. I have also requested
details of the actions that have already been taken to respond to the
report’s findings, including the support and training put in
place for professionals involved in the case and more

the work that is taking place in response to the report’s

Gentleman and other hon. Members that I will continue to pay close
attention to the evidence emerging from Coventry. The lessons
identified by the deeper analysis will be 
<?notus-xml column=998?>made publicly available, which should give to the people of Coventry the
confidence that the right actions have been taken in response to
Daniel’s death and ensure that everyone with a role in
safeguarding children has the opportunity to reflect on their own
practice.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101777000611" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/debtext/131017-0004.htm#13101777000611">We
will also consider whether the lessons from the analysis have national
implications, something touched on by the hon. Gentleman. The
Government remain focused on driving through our programme of
reform of the child protection system, building on
recommendations from a wide range of reports and inquiries, including
the Munro review, the Education Committee report and Lord
Carlile’s report into the Edlington case. I remind the hon.
Gentleman, in response to the point he made towards the end of his
contribution, that there has been a recent inquiry by the Select
Committee into child protection, which is being reopened to consider
what progress has been made, and he might want to make his views known
to it. The lessons from Daniel Pelka’s tragic death, and those
of Keanu Williams and Hamzah Khan, will add to that body of evidence.
The Government are requiring the publication of serious case reviews
for the very reason that it enables national lessons to be learned. The
National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children is helping
to collate the analysis at a single point, so that social workers and
other front-line practitioners can understand how they can
benefit from it.</hs_Para>

the needs of children and not the other way around. We have
strengthened the framework underpinning child protection by publishing
the revised “Working Together to Safeguard Children”
statutory guidance. It is clear that the needs of individual children,
whatever their age, are paramount. That puts the needs of children back
at the heart of assessment processes by removing the requirement to
have separate initial and core assessments.</hs_Para>

safeguarding hubs. I have had the opportunity to visit some myself, and
they are doing fantastic work in their co-location with different
agencies. They are sitting in the same room talking to each other,
rather than communicating via computer or at a greater distance. That

high-calibre career changers. We are introducing reforms to support
better local and national leadership, which in turn

Louise Ellman</B> (Liverpool, Riverside) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I
welcome the opportunity to serve under your chairmanship, Mr Rosindell,
and to debate the Select Committee on Transport’s second report
on the coastguard service since the 2010 election. I pay tribute to the
nation’s coastguards—both professional staff and
volunteers—who provide an essential emergency service,
protecting life and limb at sea throughout the year in all
weathers.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000010">Last
year, Her Majesty’s Coastguard dealt with  2,859
incidents—a 23% increase on the previous
year— including rescuing swimmers, divers and people
falling off cliffs, cut off by tides and endangered by boat failures.
The changes are wide-ranging and involve the maritime rescue
co-ordination centres, search and rescue and the maritime incident
response group, which deals with firefighting and chemical hazards. I
am concerned about all those aspects of the service, and I know that
there are ongoing issues, in particular about arrangements for
emergency towing vessels.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101759000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000011">Today<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:31:35"></hs_TimeCode>,
however, I will focus on changes to the maritime rescue co-ordination
centres, which handle calls for assistance and co-ordinate rescues.
Reform has been discussed for several years, and the current proposals
date back to 2010. The proposals raise major concerns, which is why the
Transport Committee has paid close attention to them. We published our
first report in 2011 and followed it up in 2012, and we are raising the
issue again here today.</hs_Para>

were 18 centres spread around the UK coastline, of which the Government
proposed to close 10. Their work was to be taken over by the two new
24-hour maritime operations centres in Aberdeen and the Solent area.
Five co-ordination centres would remain open during daylight hours
only. Under those plans, the number of coastguards would fall from 596
to 370 by 2014, a reduction of 38%.</hs_Para>

main rationale for the changes was the claim that individual
co-ordination centres were largely independent of each other and that,
as a result, the system as a whole lacked resilience. If a centre was
affected by a power cut or overwhelmed by work, we were told, other
coastguard stations could do little to help. The proposed maritime
operations centre would be able to deal with incidents all around the
country and would be able to allocate work to remaining co-ordination
centres to iron out peaks and troughs in work load.</hs_Para>

unleashed a storm of protest. There was alarm about the potential loss
of crucial local knowledge, particularly in parts of Wales and Scotland
where local landmarks can have more than one name in different
languages. Local knowledge includes awareness of place names, dialects,
tides and currents, geography and the volunteer rescuers available in
the area for which the coastguard is responsible. Claims that such
local knowledge could be replaced by technology were met with
incredulity.</hs_Para>

was alarm, too, about the concept of daylight-only coastguard stations.
Would it really be safe to hand over co-ordination of a major incident
to new staff, perhaps hundreds of miles away, because it was time to
finish work for the day and nightfall had come? Redundancy plans
unsettled staff, as did talk of redefining roles, grades and terms and
conditions. Many coastguards faced a choice between accepting a new
role at a new maritime operations centre in a different location or
leaving the service.</hs_Para>

our original 2011 inquiry, we visited coastguards in Falmouth, the
Clyde and Stornoway and spoke to coastguards from many other
co-ordination centres. We shared many of their concerns about the
original plans. In particular, we asked the Government to reconsider
introducing daylight-only co-ordination centres, because of the
difficulty of handing over rescues. We also highlighted concerns about
the loss of local knowledge and the limitations of technological
alternatives. I will return to that issue
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000017" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000017">The
Government published a revised plan in July 2011, which took account of
some of our concerns. That plan is now being implemented, but disquiet
remains. There will be one maritime operations centre in Fareham,
backed up by a co-ordination centre in Dover and eight other
co-ordination centres. Eight centres will close; Clyde, Yarmouth and
Forth have already shut down. The remaining centres will be open around
the clock. The Government have abandoned the concept of daylight-only
centres, and I welcome their change of
mind.</hs_Para>

indecisive “suck it and see, make it up as you go along”
approach to maritime coastguard stations in 2011. The same thing is
happening to the emergency towing vessels. In the report’s
conclusion, the Transport Committee asks the Government to explain how
an emergency towing vessel stationed in the Northern Isles can serve
the west coast effectively. Is that not a mirror image of what the hon.

coastguards and co-ordination centres, under the revised proposals, the
number of professional coastguards will fall to 436. The new maritime
operations centre was due to be operational by April 2014. That has now
been delayed until September 2014. Co-ordination centres at Solent,
Portland, Brixham, Liverpool, Swansea and Thames are due to close after
that.</hs_Para>

a second report on the revised proposals in December 2012, and we
continue to receive deeply disturbing information from coastguards
about staffing 
<?notus-xml column=317?>and morale in the service. It is to those issues that I  now
turn. The Committee accepted that there is a  case for a
national maritime operations centre to  manage particularly
large or difficult incidents, which could overwhelm an individual
co-ordination centre or two centres working together. However, we
remain unclear about what coastguards at the national centre would do
at times when such an emergency was not taking place. Coastguards
giving evidence to us said that they had no idea how the new maritime
operations centre and the co-ordination centres would work
together.</hs_Para>

their reply to our report, the Government spelled out in more detail
what they saw as the main responsibilities of the maritime operations
centre, particularly in co-ordinating the work of coastguards across
the country. The recent agreement on the roles and responsibilities of
coastguards under the new system might also bring greater clarity in
this area. Will the Minister explain how the new system will
work—not just during a major incident, but at quieter
times?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000023">We
heard strong criticism of the decision to close three maritime resource
co-ordination centres before the new system is in place. For example,
Shetland coastguards explained that they had to use their own time to
gain local knowledge of parts of the northern Scotland coastline for
which they would be responsible after the closure of the Forth station.
There have been continuing concerns that some co-ordination centres are
now severely overstretched.</hs_Para>

in March this year that, already, staffing at Belfast co-ordination
centre had been below the risk-assessed staffing level on 124 occasions
out of 158 shifts. At the same time, Yarmouth co-ordination centre,
which has since closed, was moved to daylight-only operations because
of staff shortages. It is testament to the professionalism of the
service that the closures have been accommodated without major

was widely believed that ministerial statements and Maritime and
Coastguard Agency documents had given a commitment that the maritime
rescue co-ordination centres would not be closed until the new system
was put in place. This was denied, but the language used by the
Minister’s predecessor in the House and some of the documents
published by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency back in 2011 were at
best
ambiguous<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:40:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000026">One
key area of the dispute is the importance of local knowledge.
Coastguards emphasise its importance in their work, and they are tested
on their local situational knowledge. Knowing that a particular rock or
headland has three names in two languages can help to ensure that
assistance reaches people in distress as quickly as possible. The
Maritime and Coastguard Agency discounted its significance, considering
that local knowledge could be stored electronically so that it could be
used by any coastguard based anywhere. Indeed, when we heard evidence
from the chief executive of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, he
seemed to disregard the importance of critical local knowledge, which
is about geography, tides and currents, language and dialect, and the
availability of additional volunteer sources for rescue in the area
concerned.</hs_Para>

remain concerned about the issue.
They<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:41:14"></hs_TimeCode> challenge
whether the knowledge built up over many years by experienced
coastguards working in their areas 
<?notus-xml column=318?>can be replaced by databases. Coastguards taking on new areas of
responsibility will still be assessed on their understanding of local
factors, although it is hard to see how this will
apply to the coastguards in the new marine
operations centre. Perhaps the Minister will explain what importance he
attaches to coastguards having local knowledge and how it will work
under the new system and be tested.</hs_Para>

We heard concerns about the level of vacancies in the service, the
proportion of coastguards on fixed-term contracts, and the loss of
experienced staff. The coastguard service’s vacancy rate doubled

allegations of stress caused by understaffing, lack of leave and
unreliable communications equipment. The high level of vacancies puts
strain on coastguards, who must work harder to fill the gaps. What
assessment has the Minister made of the high level of vacancies? Has
the level of sickness absence increased? Does the Department even

prefer to leave the service than move to Fareham to take on new roles.

excellent volunteer coastguards. I have met the Lowestoft and Southwold

the issue erupted, thanks to the Government’s proposals early on

made representations about aspects of concern in parts of the country,
ended up supporting the revised changes that the Government came up

even now, it seems that we have not been able to communicate exactly
how the coastguard service works and the fact that the people who make
the rescues locally are the volunteers—the people of the
community—who have local knowledge, as opposed to the people in
the centres, who of course use their local knowledge and other skills
to deploy the right resources accordingly. When I learned that fact, it
gave me more confidence. When I learned about the extra training that
was to be given and the extra equipment that was to be provided, that
gave me even more confidence that we were doing a lot more to support
our volunteer coastguard rescue officers on the front line. And thus it
has proved. I am confident in their abilities. I have met them at
Southwold on various occasions. I did not meet them when they had been
called into action, most notably earlier in the summer when they worked
closely with the RNLI to rescue more than 50 people off the coast at
Southwold, but they continue to have my full
support.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000041" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000041">I
want to pick up a few specific points raised by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:49:59"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Lady in
her report, and to say more about local understanding and resilience. I
understand that several people have transferred from the Yarmouth
station to the Humber station, so the Government policy of keeping one
of two pairing centres open, and encouraging and helping staff to move
if they so wish, certainly appears to have happened in our case. That
is useful because it not only keeps those people in employment, but
builds greater knowledge about the wider area that the centres
cover<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:50:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000042" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000042">To
step back and wear a non-constituency hat, there is a lot to be said
for trying to increase the resilience of our national network of
information, because it does not take much—someone being off ill
or whatever—for there suddenly to be gaps in knowledge. That is
not unique, dare I say it, to the coastguard system, but it is one
reason why many of our emergency services, such as the NHS or the
police, put as much information as possible into a common format or
database that other people can draw on. That does not mean that people
never speak to each other, but it is deliberately done to make services
more
resilient<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:51:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000043" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000043">Will
you allow me to stray slightly to illustrate the point, Mr Rosindell?
An extreme example is that the Care Quality Commission often picks up
issues about people relying on information being passed verbally in
hospitals, instead of their documenting it to provide extra safety for
the patient. That is a real parallel to the coastguard service. We
should not get too hung up about local knowledge: of course it is
important, but people do not need to know every metre or yard of the
coastline to be aware of the key problems in a given area. The areas
off Southwold and near Felixstowe ferry have particularly difficult
currents, but that kind of knowledge should be assimilated by a broader
range of people, so that we are not reliant on a relatively small group
of coastguard co-ordinating officers in our Yarmouth and Thames
centres<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:52:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000044">I

have to build up such knowledge. I am also reassured by paragraph 36 of
the Government response, which mentions exercises, full pairing days,
visits for staff, and visits and briefings as part of working with the
Royal National Lifeboat Institution. Those are important parts of
on-the-job training, and the Select Committee makes the very fair point
that people should not be expected to pick up such knowledge by
themselves or by

course, the test will come with the big incident that, thank God, has
not happened yet—we hope it never does—and I appreciate
people’s concerns about wanting resources to be deployed as
quickly as possible in such an incident. I am confident that more such
centralisation, with a wider network of centres, but without going from
the former situation to having only two centres open 24/7, will provide
the kind of resilience in which people can have trust. It will also
build knowledge to ensure that people are safe 24/7, not just when a
coastguard co-ordinating centre happens to be open. I am pleased to

that the Government had clearly failed to carry public opinion with

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T13:55:38"></hs_TimeCode> Minister
placed in the Library a table showing the number of coastguard watches
that were staffed below risk levels during the year from May 2012 to
May 2013. The table makes uncomfortable reading, particularly in
relation to Belfast. From December 2012, when the Clyde station closed,
to May 2013, Belfast was staffed below the risk assessed level 71% of
the time, which is extremely worrying. During the same period, its
partner station, Stornoway, was understaffed 17% of the time. The table
does not tell us how often Belfast and Stornoway were both understaffed
at the same time, but the figures show that that must inevitably have
happened on several occasions.</hs_Para>

worrying. From the closure of the Forth station in

does not have confidence in the new system. The seafaring community was
very nervous about the closure of the Clyde station, particularly
because of the loss of local knowledge. When figures show that Belfast,
which has become responsible for most of the Clyde area, was
understaffed 71% of the time during the six months following the
closure of the Clyde station, that clearly increases the seafaring
community’s lack of confidence. I hope that the Government will

positively, I am not aware of any incidents since the closure of the

not be one, but one will inevitably happen at some point, and that will
test the system. I hope that the co-ordination centres are all fully

programmes, and I hope that the Minister will report that they have

about the loss of local knowledge was one of the main reasons why
seafarers were not convinced about the reorganisation of the

expressed and have arranged for two emergency towing vessels to be

coast that both vessels are based in the northern isles, and that one
is no longer based in Stornoway. I note from the Government’s
response that in moderate sea conditions it will take approximately
eight to nine hours for an emergency towing vessel to arrive at a
position between North Minch and the Little Minch and, in heavier
weather when an incident is more likely to occur, it will take about 11
to 12 hours. It will take even longer for the emergency towing vessel
to get to the southern Hebrides in my constituency. I hope the
Government will have another think about basing an emergency towing
vessel in Stornoway and bear in mind the extreme environmental damage
that an oil spill would cause. They should compare the costs of a
clean-up with the costs of an emergency towing vessel based in
Stornoway. After all, prevention is better than

debate. Unfortunately, I had an unbreakable commitment, but I have read
the excellent report and congratulate the Committee on its follow-up. I
have three issues to raise. First, it remains a matter of profound
regret in my constituency that the Brixham maritime rescue
co-ordination centre will close. I pay tribute to the staff at the
centre and to the dignified way in which they are assisting in the
handover period. Listening to the accounts of staff, I hope that the
Minister will pay particular attention to ensuring that we retain their
valuable skills and support those who are able to continue within the
service so that we do not lose their local knowledge. I take the point,
however, that the efforts that are being made to transfer some of that
local knowledge into detailed databases will be helpful.</hs_Para>

much local knowledge is vested in the volunteer coastguards. Will the
Minister look at a particular area in my constituency around Hope Cove?
We have a Hope Cove rescue boat and a cliff rescue team, which is 
<?notus-xml column=324?>staffed by volunteer coastguards. Unfortunately, there has been an
attitude of extreme intransigence on the part of the Maritime and
Coastguard Agency in the matter of dual manning. I represent a rural
constituency and we are fortunate to have volunteers who are prepared
to undertake dual manning. There has never been an issue over that.
Unfortunately, volunteers are being pressured into a situation where
they have to choose between one or other of the operations, and there
simply is not the availability of staff in the area reliably to man
both as completely separate teams.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101759000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000063">Ian<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T14:05:02"></hs_TimeCode>
Pedrick, who heads up a team, is the third generation in this community
that has manned the Hope Cove lifeboat. If pressed, the entire team
would opt to stay with the Hope Cove rescue boat because there is such
a long tradition within our community and it is such a highly valued
resource. Will the Minister look at the matter and try to break the
deadlock, so that we can continue an arrangement that has served our
community well over generations.</hs_Para>

third issue is emergency towing vehicles. There are concerns in my
constituency that we may find that there are no vessels capable of
carrying out the duties of ETVs closer than Brest or Cherbourg.
Evidence for that is supplied by the MCA head of pollution control.
Both vessels are many hours away. They are under the control of the
French Government and might be available if the French are not using
them. It should be noted that the French are particularly unhappy about
the UK’s unilateral withdrawal of ETV cover as it has left their
coastline also relatively unprotected. I do not need to spell out to
the Minister the disastrous consequences if we had a spillage in the
channel, which is a busy shipping area. The impact would be felt not
only by our valued fishing industry but by our tourism industry. Will
the Minister tell us exactly what facilities would be available on a
commercial basis, and what assessment has been made of their
reliability to provide the reassurance that my constituents seek should
there be a shipping disaster in the
future?<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T14:07:04"></hs_TimeCode> Let me

hon. Friend the Member for Liverpool, Riverside (Mrs Ellman),
said—how can local knowledge be shared when so little time has
been allowed for handover between the closing of MRCCs and the
neighbouring centres? Also, how will staff in the MOC gain this
information for all of their areas? I understand that on one occasion
the Department for Transport spokesperson said that they could use
social media, but the Minister must be aware that there are very strict
conventions within the maritime service about how social media are
used, so perhaps he would like to examine that issue or comment on
it.</hs_Para>

solution<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T14:10:25"></hs_TimeCode>? I ask
the Minister, specifically, what confidence he has that Dover, as a

to the Select Committee, the Minister has produced positive scenarios
about the interaction of MOC staff and MRCC staff, but the Committee
has rightly pressed the Government on major incident scenarios. If we
look at the Government response, we see that page 7 contains a list of
actions that superficially seem impressive. I came to this brief from
looking at further education funding. In that sector too, there are
wonderful diagrams about the process of money and the process of
communication, and I am sure that if the Minister got his officials to
produce a complicated diagram of the various steps that are listed on
page 7 it would be even more impressive. But the crucial question is
how long it would take the complex chain of command detailed on page 7
to operate and respond. That will be the determination of how effective
the MOC is, and raising that issue underlines the continued concerns

turn now to the issue of staffing, because that has already been talked
about in considerable detail. The demographic profile of coastguards is
highly skewed towards older employees. The Minister’s own
figures, from the Government response to the Committee, show that, for
example, in Falmouth 14 of the 33 coastguards are over the age of 50
and in Humber 16 of the 27 coastguards are over 50. So, those valued
employees will probably be leaving the service during the next five to
10 years and taking their experience with them, at the same time as
there is major upheaval in coastguard operations. In addition, there is
currently a growing loss of valuable expertise in the service. For
example, only one of the London coastguards has more than 20 years of
experience. Therefore, the emerging picture is that no replacement
generation of coastguards is coming through 
<?notus-xml column=327?>with the extensive service that is needed both to replace those who will
soon leave and to oversee the introduction of the new system.</hs_Para>

2011, the Government proposals estimated a total reduction in staffing
numbers from 596 to 370, with coastguard numbers falling from 491 to

with the number required rising from 80 to 105. We have already heard

daylight-only centre, and we have also heard about the changes in the
closing dates for Solent, Portland and Brixham. These problems and
changes breed confusion and can also lower morale. So, can the Minister

maritime operating environment. The service was geared up for its role
of dealing with localised, and only localised, maritime search and
rescue, and to many extents it did that well. But since the last major
reconfiguration of the coastguard in the late 1970s, when it was
recognised that there was no longer a need to maintain a visual watch,
the demands on officers operating the system, as it was pre-December
2010, had grown
significantly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000121">Technology<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T14:33:31"></hs_TimeCode>
has clearly moved forward. As many hon. Members know, the introduction
of the global distress and safety system in the 1990s changed how
coastguards receive distress messages. The demise of the old coast
radio stations led to coastguards taking on the role of broadcasting
regular navigation warnings and maritime safety information.
Coastguards were given new responsibilities for broadcasting
information 
<?notus-xml column=332?>to the fishing community on submarine movements and military firing
exercises. More recently, the world has acquired the ability to track
ship movements and plot them in real time on electronic charts using
the automatic identification system. All that has added to the marine
picture available to
coastguards<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T14:34:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000122">The
importance of maritime surveillance has increased the relevance of
situational or maritime domain awareness, as it is known. That has
added to the need for differing skills and growing responsibilities, so
in 2010 we faced a significant disparity of work load among maritime
rescue co-ordination centres. At the height of a busy summer season,
some centres could find themselves dealing with multiple incidents and
having to drop coastguard duties and broadcasts to focus, rightly, on
life-or-death rescue situations.</hs_Para>

technology has now allowed some pairing of resources between
neighbouring centres to co-ordinate responses, but there is little
capacity to provide support beyond that. Prior to 2010, if both centres
in a pair found themselves busy, routine lower-priority work would be
dropped so that, quite rightly, the immediate impact on safety was
addressed. None the less, there was a significant gap in resilience.
The case for a national, joined up approach that allows work to be
better managed and distributed and exposes coastguards to the full
range of work, thereby keeping their skills relevant and finely tuned,
seemed clear in
2010<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T14:35:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000124">Let
us not be under any illusion: there was clear consensus across the
House, which was highlighted during some of the consultation exercises,
on the need to do something about coastguard pay, particularly at lower

systems with fewer coastguards in fewer locations, but, importantly, it
is helping to relocate the money to ensure that we have properly
improved pay to reflect the increased responsibilities placed on

experts with local intelligence briefed officers in the receiving

coastguards at the receiving centres took on full responsibility, while
the closing centres went into shadow running mode. That gave everyone

responsibilities, which we have recognised with a significantly
enhanced pay and grading structure. For example, the lowest entry level
for coastguard officers is now one civil service grade higher, which
means being paid 19% more than today. As I have said, there will be
some revision of working patterns in the package, but the shift systems
will match demand much better, according to the seasons and the time of
day. Coastguards in all operational centres will therefore have a
reduced number of night duties, with more full weekends off during a

leave, and we will support them if they wish to consider taking
voluntary redundancy. In the interim, the coastguard service has been

handover. I hope he will be reassured that it was not a case of one
station closing one day, and a new one opening the following morning.
Far from it, there have been traditional pairing operations and the
handovers have been based on those pairing operations. Indeed, there
was significant time in-between to ensure that all the arrangements
were in

in place arrangements that permit a vessel that is normally engaged in
commercial operations to be released from its contracted duty to
perform emergency towage in the waters off northern Scotland. That has
been available at no extra cost. The Secretary of State led those
discussions and the discussions on the future of emergency towing
vehicles in Scotland. The Scottish Government were also involved. A
solution has been found for the next two years with a vessel

would like to talk briefly about the history—a previous
Committee report is also of interest. The United Kingdom decided to
impose a moratorium on desinewed meat production in this country, which
had huge implications—not only for my constituency, but for
parts of Northern Ireland. Newby Foods was told that it could no longer
produce desinewed meat, which led to a loss of 30 jobs near
Thirsk.</hs_Para>

conducted our report and reviewed the UK Government moratorium, which
was imposed as a short-term measure at the will of the European
Commission in Brussels, the Government have clarified desinewed meat
from poultry and pork as being from non-ruminants, so that they may
continue. However, will the Minister continue to make the case to the
European Union for desinewed meat production from lamb and beef to be
allowed to continue, as well as from pork and poultry?</hs_Para>

information is relevant to the debate, because we concluded, in, I
believe, March 2012—this was based on an assertion in evidence
from a predecessor of the Minister; it was perhaps two farming

lead to mislabelling and contamination and adulteration of meat, with
cheaper cuts of meat substituted for the meat that is on the

food industry. As of last year, there were more than 490,000 food

issue the Committee identified was that the Food Standards Agency
reports to three key Departments with responsibility for aspects of
food policy. Furthermore, there has been a marked fall since 2009-12 in
the number of the local authority food samples tested. In addition,
there are 12 different national and European databases on food

me record a little of the history. In November 2012, there was a
routine meeting between the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the
UK’s FSA. At that meeting, the Irish FSA mentioned that it was
developing a new methodology for checking the composition of meat
products. The first question the Committee asked—we are asking
it again today—was why it took two months for our own FSA to
authorise and conduct any testing.</hs_Para>

found <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:17:33"></hs_TimeCode>that there
had been contamination; it was small in the UK, but it was widespread
in the EU. In the UK, horse and pig DNA were found in a variety of beef
products, including samples of Findus lasagne, which contained more
than 60% horsemeat; Aldi lasagne and spaghetti bolognese, which
contained between 30% and 100% horsemeat; and beef products certified
as halal and supplied to prisons in England and Wales, which contained
pork DNA.</hs_Para>

findings emerged
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:18:16"></hs_TimeCode>only after
extensive testing of beef products across the EU and by local
authorities and industry in the UK. The EU tests revealed that 4.66% of
products contained more than 1% horse DNA. The UK incidence of
contamination in products tested was less than 1%. Although the
contamination was small, and the principle was that this was a
labelling and a fraud issue, there could so easily have been a food
safety scare and a food safety scandal.</hs_Para>

is not the best word to use, but we have seen no sense of urgency among
those on the Government Benches, which is why we welcome my hon.

the most worrying aspect of the matter, as something following on from
the BSE crisis, is that every 10 years we have either a food scare or a
food crisis. In the early 1990s it was BSE; in 2001 it was foot and
mouth disease; and in 2012—we know that it started in
2011—it was the scandal to do with horsemeat contamination, and
pork DNA being found in halal meat. That was completely

identifying the supply chain, and traceability, and we drew some clear
conclusions from the evidence. The chief executive of the FSA told us
the contamination and adulteration could have been going on for almost

was banned—there was also a so-called ban in the EU, although we

requirement that at every stage in the supply chain operators must keep

breached; that retailers and meat processors should have been more
vigilant about the risk of deliberate adulteration; and that trust is
not a sufficient guarantee in a system where meat is traded many times

purchasing of food has gone up incrementally. Everyone is buying local,
because they know what they are buying. They know that it is beef or
whatever the label says. As I said, that is very pleasing, but we need
to restore public confidence in what is a multi-million-pound industry

sound and fury has gone out of this matter for now, but that does not
mean that it is not extraordinarily important. It is extraordinarily
important for our farming communities that their product should not be
contaminated again in the future and extraordinarily important for
consumers that they should have the ability to choose what they want to
eat, knowing that it is as described on the label. Sadly, however, the
history of food is full of examples of contamination and adulteration.
The watering down of beer is a heinous crime, but it has been
perpetrated everywhere. It is not the only one,

would like to draw a distinction between contamination and
adulteration. As far as I am concerned, contamination is when a small
quantity of extraneous material finds its ways into foodstuffs. That
usually occurs because of negligence or carelessness in the preparation
or processing of food, in relation either to buildings or to equipment.
Sometimes contamination may not be serious. It may involve inert
material. But sometimes, of course, it can be very serious indeed. One
example is the poisonous material ergot in rye bread; I can think of
other examples. It is also very serious when infective material gets
into foodstuffs. Sadly, there are outbreaks of E. coli from time to
time in this country. Of course, the Chairman of the Select Committee
mentioned the presence of pork in food that is supposed to have been
processed to an halal standard, which is grossly offensive to the
Muslim community. That is particularly serious as
well<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:38:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000203" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000203">I
define contamination as something that does not take place
deliberately, but it quickly became apparent to me during the so-called
horsemeat scandal that what was happening was not happening through
carelessness. In the main, it was a deliberate attempt to make money
out of fraud, and we should see it in that light. People from time to
time do see the opportunity to do that. If they can introduce something
into a foodstuff that does not necessarily alter its appearance, taste
or consistency, they can get away with it for a short time before more
sophisticated tests can be done on that foodstuff. The Chairman of the
Committee mentioned the changes in the way in which certain foodstuffs,
including meat, could be included in other
foodstuffs<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:39:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000204" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000204">Adulteration
also occurs when we have high commodity prices for meat or for any
foodstuff, and of course the price of meat has risen quite
considerably. If it rises quickly, there are opportunities for the less
scrupulous 
<?notus-xml column=344?>to introduce a cheaper product into what is a fairly expensive product.
My criticism of the supermarket and meat processors
still stands: rather than accepting that the price of the commodity had
gone up, they were scouring the European markets and probably the world
markets to find a cheaper product. That gave an opportunity for less
scrupulous people to get involved and make

Irranca-Davies:</Member></B> What are the hon. Gentleman’s views
on the need for deep intelligence across Departments in analysing what
is going on? There could have been a moment when the contamination
could have been picked up. It is all very well saying that in
hindsight, but it could have been detected. We had massive shipments of
horses from Ireland and Northern Ireland into Britain for transport out
of the UK, but they were not transported. They were disappearing. There
were numbers in, but no numbers out. At some point, a good intelligence
operation would have spotted that and flagged up the fact that those
horses were going

Williams:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman raises another good point. We
must use intelligence. When I was doing work on illegal imports of meat
products from Africa, it became apparent that the
people involved in that were also involved in other criminal
activities, such as drug smuggling and people smuggling. The penalties
for drug smuggling and smuggling individuals across borders were high,
but the penalties for smuggling meat were low and yet profits were
high. There was a huge incentive to get involved, because the smugglers
would not end up in prison for very long, but would probably get a
paltry little fine having made a lot of money. The hon. Gentleman gets
the point: we must put pressure on our European partners to work with
us to share intelligence, which is so important.</hs_Para>

why a single market is important for British agriculture: 90% of Welsh
lamb is consumed outside Wales and 40% of UK lamb is exported, mostly
to continental Europe. Those of us in the farming business remember
when that market could be open one

want to concentrate on the consequences and on the many lessons that we
need to learn. For many years, I have been saying that we have not had
proper labelling of the origins of processed food, especially meat
products, and the contamination has highlighted that hugely. Basically,
the product was travelling all across Europe from the Republic of
Ireland, Poland and Romania into Luxembourg and France—it was
travelling all over the place. The trail—exporting from one
country and importing to another—was almost impossible to
follow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:48:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:48:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brecon and Radnorshire (Roger Williams) highlighted, the value of
the processed meat is key. If someone bought a joint of beef and a
joint of horse—we cannot do that in this country, but in 
<?notus-xml column=346?>many European countries they can—they would immediately be able
to tell the difference. If we minced them up and put them in a burger,
however, I suspect that when we actually looked at it physically, we
would not see a great deal of difference. If horse meat is trading at a
quarter to a third of the price of beef, it  is tempting to the
unscrupulous in the food processing industry to substitute one for the
other.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101759000217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000217">Not only the
Government but the large retailers should keep a check on the
situation. If retailers are buying beef burgers for less than the cost
of the beef that should be in them, they should ask how on earth a
company can produce that product for that price. That is a lesson for
the industry and the big retailers to learn.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:50:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Brecon and Radnorshire probably shares my view that although the
big retailers are necessary, they have used their muscle over the years
to drive down prices for primary producers and farmers. They have spent
their lives doing it. This time they drove the price down too far, and
people came in who said, “Okay, these big retailers want cheap
burgers; well, we’ll mix in a bit of horse meat, and
it’ll be fine.” That is where questions need to be
asked.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000218">The
hon. Member for Thirsk and Malton made the case that the Government
need enough public analysts, but retailers also need to employ such
people or franchise out the work to somebody else. When I go into a
large supermarket, I expect to buy a product that is made of what it
says on the label. That is the retailer’s responsibility; the
Minister may well make that point later. Yes, it is the
Government’s responsibility, but it is also very much the
responsibility of the retailer.</hs_Para>

that the Chair made a bit of a face when I said that one could tell the
difference between a joint of horse meat and a joint of beef.
Ethically, we in this country do not eat horse meat, but it is eaten in
many countries across Europe, and it is legal. It is necessary to be
able to slaughter horses for meat. There are so many horses in this
country, some with huge welfare problems, that if we could not
slaughter them, the welfare problems would be even larger. I would much
rather those horses be slaughtered humanely in this country than taken
on vast journeys across the continent in poor conditions to be
slaughtered. We must remember that slaughtering and trading horse meat
are not crimes in
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:52:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Irranca-Davies:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is making a good and
cogent point. We must guard not only against inhumane transport but
against the possibility that imports of horse meat from places that
previously discarded the slaughter of horses, such as the United
States—they are now slaughtered in other countries
instead—might find their way back to us through Poland or the
Czech Republic, with added ingredients such as phenylbutazone, known as

Parish:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his intervention.
It leads me neatly on to the fact that, as I said, horse meat must be
traceable. It is not only a case of what is imported into this country.
In America, there are many racehorses and other sorts of horse that are
more likely to have been treated with all sorts of drugs throughout
their lives. We must be careful of that.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101759000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000222">We in this
country must also be careful to ensure that we know where the horses
that we slaughter have come from. At the moment, under the passport
system, many 
<?notus-xml column=347?>horses have one, two or several passports, one of which is clean and
says that the horse has not been injected with anything, and another
one of which may have been used when the horse has
been injected with various drugs throughout its life. We need a better
passport system and a central database so that we know where horses
come from, to ensure that when they are slaughtered, we know that they
are healthy. Although we may not eat the meat, it will be exported for
someone else to eat. It is
essential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000223">I
believe that some good things will come out of this situation. As other
Members have said, it would have been terrible if the contamination had
led to a public health issue, but fortunately it did not. One or two
horses slaughtered were found to have levels of phenylbutazone, but not
enough to hurt anybody eating the meat. We must learn to ensure that
horse meat is traceable in future, not because it should be mixed with
beef and sold fraudulently but because the meat should be
safe.</hs_Para>

great lesson to be learned concerns the traceability of our own meat.
People like farm-assured schemes, such as the red tractor promoted by
the National Farmers Union and many others. As soon as
horsegate—the problem with horse meat in beef burgers—
occurred, people wanted meat from this country. I do not wish to be
churlish, but Tesco did not decide to source all its meat from the
British Isles out of the goodness of its heart; it decided that that
was a good way to make consumers buy at
Tesco<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:56:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

Tesco has said that British lamb is now out of
season<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T15:56:39"></hs_TimeCode>? I find
that extraordinary, given that the UK produces lamb in season all year
round.</hs_Para>

Parish:</Member></B> The fact is that for most grass-fed lamb from
Wales, the west country and other parts of the country, the height of
the season is exactly now, from September onwards. When I used to
produce lambs, I did not feed them a lot of concentrates; I fattened
them on grass, and they came out in September, October and November.
Whoever put out that particular press release probably got it slightly
wrong.</hs_Para>

back to the fact that although Tesco wants to source British meat,
which I welcome, it does so from a commercial point of view. Therefore,
having systems in place to ensure the traceability of that meat is
important. However, there is also a knock-on effect. At a certain
conference in Manchester—I will not mention which one it
was—I was talking to the poultry industry. Again, Tesco has
decided to source all its poultry meat from the UK, which is great, but
the problem is that it is absorbing all the poultry meat that we
produce, so we need to produce more. In order to produce more poultry
meat, of course, we need more poultry units, and in order to build more
poultry units we need planning permission. All those things have a
knock-on effect.</hs_Para>

same with the pig industry. We need more pigs and pork so, again, we
need planning permission. Those Members who represent rural
constituents will find that when a piggery or a poultry house must be
built next door, individuals do not always welcome it with open arms. I
understand that the Minister is not responsible for planning, but the
Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs should make the case
if we are to have more British meat. I am a great 
<?notus-xml column=348?>supporter of it; we are only 52% self-sufficient in meat, so there is
much more that we could do. Production of poultry and pigs in
particular can be built up quickly, but again, we
must ensure that we have enough premises where they can be
produced.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101759000229" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000229">Many more
people now ensure that they buy locally produced and British food,
which is a great asset, but I also want them to be sure—again,
this is a lesson to be learned—that when they go into a big
retailer or other shop, they can pick up a product, especially a
processed product, and be absolutely certain where it has come from.
Sometimes my wife comes back with a product that she presents to me and
says, “Where does that come from?” I read the label and
it is more confusing than enlightening about where it has come from. I
urge the Minister, newly in post, to realise that labelling of country
of origin—knowing where a product is from—is
fundamentally important. If it has been imported, so be it, but say so.
If products are from all over the world, fine, but say so, so that
people have a choice. I do not like the old system that states
“product of the EU” and “processed in the
UK”, and displays a Union Jack. Everybody picks it up, convinced
that it is entirely a British product, when it is not. It is perfectly
legal to do that, and that is what
happens<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:00:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000230" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000230">With
the reports that we have had and what we have heard, we would all
accept, to a degree, that we got away with it. It was not perfect, but
we got away with it, despite the fact that it was a fraud and we were
eating horse when we should have been eating beef. However, nobody was
injured. We need to wake up to the fact that horse meat and slaughter
need to be much more traceable. When people pick up products,
particularly processed foods, they need to know exactly where they have
come from. We want to ensure that the supermarkets that genuinely want
to have British products are stocking them and that they have not come
from somewhere else in the world. We expect our Minister, newly in
post, to guarantee that all that will
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-17T16:01:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101759000231" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/halltext/131017h0001.htm#13101759000231">We
can learn positive lessons. The fact that people now want to eat more
home-produced meat is a good thing. Let us be absolutely certain in
future that that is exactly what we are eating. Although Government
have a responsibility, so do the large retailers and the processors
that manufacture and process the products. They are the ones that acted
illegally. Let us not forget that, whoever was at fault, it was
illegal. It was fraud.</hs_Para>

although I agree with the other hon. Members who have spoken, I fear
that in the end we will find one or two small processors here and there
who will be hung out to dry, and the rest of the larger processors and
others will largely be left untouched. Certainly the Irish Government
have been rather reticent about prosecuting anybody. I think that that
is the tactful way of putting it. Also—the point was made
earlier—when a member state of the European Union is having a
problem, it should be brought to the notice of our authorities and
others much more quickly so that we can take action. There was
definitely a slowness in the whole

to ensure that, within the realms of all the identifiable risks that we
can think of, we do not simply get away with it again. We need to put

scare, although there could have been. This was an issue of provenance.
We need a fleet-footed response from all the agencies and Government

It took out full-page advertisements coinciding—coincidentally,

to re-engineer its supply chains and get closer to primary producers.
It has a way to go, as has already been mentioned. I visited
Tesco’s headquarters and we went through this in detail.
Although it has a journey to make, I do not doubt its sincerity and
ambition to do so. It is consumer-focused; there is a reason why it is
doing this. Other large retailers have already developed shorter supply

environmental factors, field and other conditions affect the practical
delivery of our objectives. Experience gained on the ground has been

Barker:</Member></B> The Energy Company Obligation (ECO) sets in
legislation a carbon and notional bill savings target for March 2015.
The obligation is expected to cost participating suppliers around
£1.3 billion per annum to deliver. Our impact assessment
suggests some £540 million of this, or 42% of the total budget,
will be spent through the Affordable Warmth and Carbon Saving
Communities Obligation programmes. These elements of ECO are targeted
at low income and vulnerable households and households living in low
income areas. It is likely that some low income and vulnerable
households will also receive assistance under ECO's main carbon
obligation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101786000223" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/text/131017w0001.htm#13101786000223">It
is not possible to develop accurate estimates of the number of fuel
poor households receiving assistance under ECO overall, as specific
households in fuel poverty change year on year. However, an energy
efficiency scheme of this nature targeted at low income and vulnerable
households can be expected to make a significant contribution to fuel
poverty objectives. Delivery data shows that by the end of August,
244,882 energy efficiency and heating measures had been installed

number and type of personal data incidents reported in financial year
2012-13 are contained in the following table. These figures include
both confirmed and potential losses. Potential losses are incidents
where evidence from the investigation indicates that an accounting
error has taken place (for example, a failure to properly record a
document's destruction), rather than a genuine loss. Even where
documents are simply recorded as lost, investigations into the
incidents indicate that in the majority of cases there is no evidence
that the documents are not within Ministry of Defence

Soubry</Member></B><I> [holding answer 9 September 2013]:</I> The final
costs and savings from redundancies and early release schemes over the
period will depend on a number of factors such as the level of natural
wastage, salary, rank/grade and length of service of the personnel
selected. Our current assessment is that the major drawdown in the
numbers of service personnel and civilian staff will have been
completed by financial year 2014-15. We estimate that the costs of exit
packages in 2013-14 and 2014-15 will total some £460 million.
Exit costs beyond 2014-15 are expected to be relatively
small.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101788000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/text/131017w0002.htm#13101788000094">We
have made no estimate of the savings accruing specifically from the
redundancy and early release programmes themselves, since they are part
of broader workforce reductions. We estimate, however, that by 2021-22
we will have achieved cumulative savings of some £23 billion as
a result of reductions in service and civilian personnel and greater
efficiency in the conduct of non-front line activities.</hs_Para>

Reserve is the same as for the Regular Army. After the initial online
application, candidates complete medical screening questionnaires. If
successful they proceed to face-to-face interviews with Army Career
Centre staff. The interviews can also be undertaken by Army Reserve
Liaison Officers for Army Reserve personnel. All continuing candidates
will then be assessed, including medically, at one of the Army's four
Assessment Centres. Final pre-employment checks are then conducted
(including a basic security/criminal record check and confirmation of
medical circumstances from each candidate's GP). If these
pre-employment checks are completed successfully then the candidate can
be enlisted and booked onto the appropriate initial (Phase 1) training

PBAs for all construction procurement contracts that it enters into

full picture of the range of individuals and groups involved in the
set-up and running of a free school. The Department received 70 (22%)

earnings received in a claimant's monthly assessment period. Therefore,
where all earnings are paid annually, they will be taken into account
in that one assessment period. If the earnings are more than the
claimant's universal credit award, he or she will lose entitlement to
universal credit. The claimant can reclaim universal credit in the
following assessment period and any unspent earnings will be classed as
personal capital and may effect entitlement to universal credit. Where
no earnings are received and the claimant has work-related
requirements, he or she may be required to look for paid
employment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101793000222" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/text/131017w0002.htm#13101793000222">However,
if the claimant is analogous to a sole trader, DWP will investigate the
nature of the business and whether the claimant should be treated as

want families with children to be able to live in secure and settled
homes. That is why we have taken action to help local authorities move
families quickly into settled accommodation. From 9 November 2012,
local authorities have had a new power under the Localism Act to use
good quality private rented sector accommodation to end the main
homelessness duty. Families will no longer need to be placed in

available.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101793000474" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131017/text/131017w0003.htm#13101793000474">At
