have made significant progress on our plans to modernise the prison
estate and reduce operating costs. In September we announced a new
2,000-plus place prison, to be built on the former Firestone site in
Wrexham. We have launched a feasibility study on possible changes at
the site of the Feltham young offender institution, with a potential
enlarged new adult prison and a new youth facility on adjoining sites.
We will consult on that as progress develops. We have also announced
the closure of 1,400 uneconomic places, which will contribute to our
overall plans to reduce prison costs by more than £500 million
in this spending review

may I make a plea to him to remember local prisons? He knows that
genuine local prisons, such as Her Majesty’s prison—and
now the young offender institution—in Winchester, play a central
role in the secure estate, but they need investment too, especially in
Winchester. The recent closure of prisons in Kingston, Reading and
Dorchester is already having an impact on the secure estate in

of a new prison are difficult. Clearly there is still work to be done
at Oakwood and that is a priority for us. The hon. Gentleman will be
aware, however, that some of the criticisms of Oakwood refer to the
fact that it is a privately run prison. I have taken no decision about
the status of the prison in Wrexham, but I remind the hon. Gentleman
that it was the Labour party that took the decision to privatise

working in a team, getting up in the morning and understanding the

which my hon. Friend refers, but we believe that there are women who
need to be imprisoned, having committed offences that justify
imprisonment, and for whom, for reasons of punishment and public

recognise that they have different requirements from male prisoners and
to ensure that the female custodial estate reflects that. She is also
right that rehabilitation is crucial. I hope she can be a little more

important that we recognise, however, that it is for the judiciary and
magistrates to decide who needs to go to prison and who does not. It is
our job to provide the capacity necessary. On Downview, we calculated

outsourcing to the private sector. It has clearly changed its mind now;

With regard to rogue bailiffs, we have put in place a number of
remedies. For example, if there is a debt to a local authority, there
is recourse to the local authority’s ombudsman. Bailiffs’
certificates can be taken away and it is a criminal offence for a
bailiff to operate without a certificate. Moreover, the goods that have
been confiscated can be returned. So a number of measures are in place

proposals for tougher sentencing. I am sure the House will agree that
it is simply not acceptable that offenders who commit some truly
horrific crimes in this country are automatically released from prison
without serving the full sentence regardless of their behaviour,
attitude and engagement in their own rehabilitation. The last
Government enshrined this automatic early release in legislation. I
intend to change that. Given the financial mess left behind by the
Labour party it is not possible to end automatic early release for all
offenders straight away, but it is my intention to take the first step
in that direction. I will shortly be introducing legislation to ensure
that criminals convicted of rape or attempted rape of a child or of
terrorism offences will no longer be automatically released at the
halfway point of their prison sentence. Instead they will have to earn
their release by the Parole Board. This means that many serious
criminals will end up spending significantly longer in

less than 12 months walks on to the street with £46 in

with Iran as a key member. Later last month, I pressed the Government

these important steps eventually to be taken. In recent months the

emerging from Tehran, and as a result the UK risks being left
behind by the absence of a clear strategy towards Iran. Disagreements
not just over Iran’s nuclear ambitions but over domestic and
international actions by the Iranian regime are profound, and cannot

questions relating to Syria, I think it will be the view across the
House that free and unfettered access is of huge importance. He is
right to say that the UN appeal for funds is currently 44% funded. As
the House heard from my statement, we have done a great deal to make
sure that some of that 44% is in place, and we are making a huge
contribution ourselves. Our embassies and the Department for
International Development’s ministerial team are engaged in a
non-stop effort to build up the contributions from other countries.
There is now the commitment to a pledging conference, which we hope
will take place in Kuwait in January and which is the major
international event to work towards in gathering greater contributions

the right hon. Gentleman’s questions about the OPCW and how it
will proceed, all the known sites for the holding of chemical weapons
in Syria are within regime-held territory. We are not aware of the
opposition being in possession of chemical weapons, so of course this
work is focused, revealingly, entirely on the regime-held areas. What
is meant to happen now, according to the timetable that has been
established, is that all sites should have been inspected by the 27th
of this month; that the regime’s production and mixing and
filling equipment in relation to chemical weapons should be destroyed
in the next few weeks, by 1 November; and that the details of how to
proceed with eliminating all the material and other equipment
will be decided by 15 November, with a view to the whole programme
being completed in the first half of next year. It is an immense task,
but it is good that the OPCW has arrived in Syria and that at the
weekend the destruction began of some of the munitions involved. Of
course, we will continue to watch this closely, and that includes, as I
say, standing ready to provide further expertise as
necessary.</hs_Para>

Iran, I hope there are no differences across the House about the

other countries, but perhaps it is time for him to catch up with what
the Government have actually been doing. I assure him and the House
that there is no difference of view or approach between the United
States, the United Kingdom and, indeed, other western allies. We are in
different positions on diplomatic relations because some European
countries still have embassies in Tehran. Their embassies were not
overrun as ours was in 2011. By contrast, as is well known, the United
States has not been in that situation for a very long time—since
1979. Of course there are differences between different countries, but
all of us are trying to encourage the opening up by Iran, which the
Iranian Ministers are presenting.

Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw), as we frequently do on these
subjects—had as many discussions in the space of a few days with
the Foreign Minister of Iran. It is vital that our work to improve the
functioning of our bilateral relations takes place on a step-by-step
and reciprocal basis. Recently, even getting unhindered access for
locally engaged staff to inspect and check up on our embassy premises
has remained a very difficult matter, so the House will understand that
building up trust and co-operation will be necessary before it will be
possible to open an embassy again.
We<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T15:56:38"></hs_TimeCode> are,
therefore, doing that on a step-by-step, reciprocal basis. I do not
believe it would be responsible to approach it in a different way. It
has been welcomed so far by the Iranian Foreign Ministry, as evidenced
by today’s agreement on appointing a non-resident chargé
for both countries. That opens the way to further improvements, as I
said in my statement, including a view in the future to the full
reopening of both embassies, but that will depend on the mutual

to those in Syria, British aid reaches into all 14 governorates of
Syria. The international effort, which we support and help to finance,
is of course hindered by the fighting, and has sometimes been hindered
deliberately by the regime preventing supplies—including
much-needed medical supplies—from reaching opposition-held
areas. That is the importance of the presidential statement by the
Security Council, backed by Russia and China, on improving humanitarian
access, including cross-border supplies of aid, and meeting the request
of Baroness Amos who leads for these matters at the United Nations. We
will follow that up very much indeed, and I hope our ability to hold
discussions with Iran will lead to improvements in the situation in
Syria. That is another area where Iran will need to change its policies
on the ground, which currently include supporting a regime that is

under control in Syria today. Notwithstanding that, there are serious
concerns about crimes against humanity—some involving the use of
chemical weapons, some not—and as the evidence becomes clear as
a result of the United Nations’ work, will he ensure that such

which subject, whatever the Secretary of State is saying to the Israeli

proposing to do anything that cuts across that. The Israelis in those
discussions are discussing the creation of a Palestinian state. That is
what it is all about—a two-state solution, which means a
sovereign, viable Palestinian state and the resolution of the final
status issues, including refugees and borders. Therefore, we must keep
our eyes on that main prize and return to the many other issues if the

the Iranian nuclear programme. It continues to increase its stockpile
of near 20% enriched uranium. It has no credible civilian use for the
significant quantities of enriched material that it has. It has
continued to install more centrifuges and the director general of the
International Atomic Energy Agency has reported that it has not
provided access to the heavy water production plant at Arak, which is
also a cause for serious concern. That underlines the importance of
trying to resolve these issues peacefully, and the importance of
maintaining the pressure on Iran and the pressure of the comprehensive
sanctions introduced by the European Union, the United

with the Foreign Minister of Iran. As I said in answer to some earlier
questions, I have put the case to the Iranians that they should be
supporting the Geneva communiqué of last year that there should
be a transitional Government in Syria drawn from regime and opposition
by mutual consent. As I understand it, and as I have heard the Iranians
talk about it, that is not currently their position, but they have not
ruled out adopting that position. I will continue to encourage them to
do so so that the international consensus around last year’s
Geneva communiqué will be greatly
strengthened.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100813000312" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0001.htm#13100813000312"><Member ContinuationText="Lilian Greenwood" PimsId="5568" UID="13100813000632" xid="1117" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0001.htm#13100813000632"><B>Lilian

the talks now taking place to resolve final status issues—to 
<?notus-xml column=43?>resolve the issues of borders and security and
refugees. Their success would mean these problems could be brought to
an end. So the current position does not help Palestinian economic
development. Finding new ways to assist that development, alongside

were no preconditions—or very few—when we were talking to
Sinn Fein and the provisionals in Northern Ireland back in the 1980s.
We need to talk to our enemies in order to make peace, not to our
friends. May I also suggest that every opportunity should be taken to
explore the other conflicts in the region in which Iran has its finger,

We have not set preconditions, as he can see from the number of

we do want concrete actions to go along with words, and we do want to
proceed on an agreed reciprocal basis in improving the functioning of
bilateral relations. I hope that improved functioning can lead to

course. That is why it is so important that verification really takes
place and that the OPCW is able to report any non-compliance to the
Security Council, as provided for in the resolution, so that the
Security Council can consider what action to take. Of course, we all
have to approach this subject with a certain degree of scepticism given
the previous behaviour of the regime and its use of chemical
weapons—the chemical weapons that it denied having for such a
long time. On the positive side, however, it has signed up to the
chemical weapons convention. Russia has committed itself very strongly
to this policy and therefore has a good deal riding on its success.

Clearly, the best outcome of the peace conference planned for November
would be an early resolution of the conflict in Syria. We should not
give up all hope, but 
<?notus-xml column=44?>that is probably somewhat unrealistic and
optimistic, and so we hope that a process will start to lead to that
resolution. Given that, does the Foreign Secretary agree that it is
essential that humanitarian access is also a major focus of that
conference, so that even without a wider settlement coming into
effect speedily, the international community provides the same pressure
to ensure that the access required is given as soon as possible and is

as the start of a process, rather than a single event. It will be
difficult, of course, to make it a success, but it is certainly not
something that will be over in a few hours or a few days; it is the
start of an important process, if it can be brought together. I see no
reason why that should not address, at an early stage, humanitarian

all agree that what is needed is a workable and effective system of
press self-regulation. Equally, I believe, we must protect our free
press while striking the right balance between independence and redress
for individuals. There can be no question of undermining the
press’s ability to criticise or make judgments; that underpins
our democracy and holds us to account. However, we are talking today

progress has been made since I last updated the House, particularly by

unable to recommend that the press proposal for a royal charter be

the press, which was put before the House by the Prime Minister, with
the support of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Leader of the

matters that were still in square brackets on 18 March; that aside from
that, the 18 March charter as agreed by this House will not be changed
unless such a change has the agreement of all three party leaders; that
the Secretary of State will this Friday place before the House the
final version of the charter—that is, the 18 March charter

to have a fair hearing, that it had to have a robust level of scrutiny,

that final version of the charter will be available for all Members to

absolutely right that we must ensure that it is not a slippery slope to
state regulation. We believe strongly in self-regulation, and the
charter simply sets out the framework within which that will be judged.
It is of course incumbent on us all, as Members of Parliament, to
ensure that no changes are made that might lead to the sorts of
problems she outlines, which is why I believe the “no
change” clause is so important, because

almost inevitably mean no regulation? After three quarters of a century
of strict charter control of broadcasters in this country, including a
duty of balance, is it not true that the press has had a free for all
whereby those who are weak and powerless have no chance of 
<?notus-xml column=54?>challenging it, and that the result is that the public, in overwhelming

different industries have very effective self-regulation, so I do not
think he can simply write off self-regulation as ineffective. Evidence
suggests that he is not entirely correct about that. It is important
that the new process includes a very clear way of redress though
arbitration. This will be a real innovation. We need to make sure that
it is used correctly and in a way that we intend it to be used. That is
one of the areas that I hope we can explore further on a cross-party

have two announcements to make to the House. The first
concerns a matter of privilege.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:27:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for East Worthing and Shoreham (Tim Loughton) has written to me
concerning a police information notice, addressed to him by Sussex
police and dated 4 September 2013. Having considered the issue, I have
decided that this is a matter to which I should allow the precedence
accorded to matters of privilege. Therefore, under the rules set out in
pages 273-4 of “Erskine May”, the hon. Gentleman may
table a motion today for debate at the commencement of public business
tomorrow, Wednesday 9 October. The hon. Gentleman’s motion will
appear on tomorrow’s Order Paper, to be taken after any urgent
questions and statements.</hs_Para>

second announcement concerns the election of a First Deputy Chairman of
Ways and Means in place of the hon. Member for Ribble Valley (Mr
Evans). In accordance with Standing Order No. 2A, I am now able to
inform the House of the detailed arrangements. Nominations to fill the
vacancy must be received in writing in the Lower Table Office between
10 am and 5 pm on Tuesday next, 15 October. The rules
concerning nomination will be set out in the announcements section of
the Order Paper, and an information note for Members will be available
from the Vote Office and on the intranet.</hs_Para>

years, we have witnessed an acceleration in the number of public
services being outsourced, and today roughly £1 in every
£3 that the Government spend goes to independent or private
sector providers. Indeed, owing to the Government’s policy of
opening up public services to the private and voluntary
sectors, billions of pounds of NHS contracts are now being made
available to the private sector, following the implementation of the

Justice Select Committee that accountability would be undermined if FOI
did not apply to private providers of public services. I also
understand that in opposition the Prime Minister was convinced about
this matter, having previously promised to increase the range of
publicly funded bodies subject to scrutiny using section 5 of the
Freedom of Information Act. The coalition agreement also promised to
extend the scope of the Act to provide greater transparency, but

clinical commissioning groups and the NHS Commissioning Board are
subject to the Freedom of Information Act, but private contractors are
not. From the outset, FOI regulations give private providers an unfair
competitive advantage when bidding for contracts, due to unequal
disclosure requirements. NHS bodies are forced to disclose any poor
performance, but private providers bidding for a contract have no
similar duty to disclose. They effectively start with a blank sheet.

Gareth Thomas</B> (Harrow West) (Lab/Co-op):</Member> I rise with some
sadness to urge the House to reject the programme motion that has just
been moved by the 
<?notus-xml column=64?>Deputy Leader of the House. I do so not because
programmes are often inappropriate. When filibustering takes place, as
often happens on a Friday, usually led by Conservative Members who sit
at the very back opposite, meaningful debate often does not take place,
so one can clearly see the case for having a programme motion. It would
be fair to say that programme motions can often help to ensure that all
topics are covered when a Bill is in Committee.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:41:50"></hs_TimeCode> this case,
however, much of the Bill has not been scrutinised in the way that the
Deputy Leader of the House tried to suggest that it had been. Given how
little time is set out in the programme motion, it is unlikely that we
will be able to carry out line-by-line scrutiny.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100824000035" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0002.htm#13100824000035">Sadly<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>,
all this continues to be a bit of blot on the record of the
Leader of the House and, indeed, his Liberal Democrat colleague,
because they did not see the need for proper consultation with the
third sector before the Bill was brought in. I accept that
there was some consultation on what might be in the lobbying
provisions, but there was certainly no pre-legislative scrutiny of
either of the first two parts of the Bill. A proper amount of
parliamentary scrutiny could have begun to have put this at least
partly right. As regards part 3, the whole House is aware that the
Government do not like anyone belonging to a trade union or standing up
for themselves as work, so the lack of consultation over this part is
hardly surprising. It is nevertheless still very
disappointing.</hs_Para>

we have, then, is a Bill that is being rushed through Parliament. It
has attracted huge concern from across the third sector about the
chilling impact it will have on the perfectly legitimate campaigning
activities of charities, so detailed line-by-line consideration could
have begun to make up for that lack of consultation with charities
before the Bill was published.</hs_Para>

consideration has been further delayed today by two major statements.
Of course we would all have wanted those statements to be made, but as
a result of them, unless the programme motion is resisted, the House
will have even less time in which to consider the legitimate concerns
put to many of us about part 1, let alone parts 2 and 3. If the
Bill had been debated upstairs, it would have been far less disrupted
by urgent business in this Chamber and more comprehensive scrutiny
might—I say “might”—have been
achieved.</hs_Para>

have we had so far? We have had one day for Second Reading, just three
days for Committee and now just two for Report. Virtually every other
piece of Government legislation will get more scrutiny than this Bill.
I remember charities legislation during the last Session—a small
Treasury Bill to amend gift aid provisions, yet that Bill was in

Second Reading and Report.</hs_Para>

of the lobbying industry and its stakeholders think this Bill is little
more than the emperor’s new clothes for the industry. It amounts
thus far to a pretence of action: when so few will be covered, the
damaging lack of transparency that exists in the industry at the moment
will remain even after this Bill, as drafted, goes through. It is thus
difficult to see how we will have time over the next two days to do
justice to the concerns that have been put to hon. Members—on
the Government side as well as on our side. I therefore urge the House
to reject the motion and I encourage the Government to allocate more
time for debate.</hs_Para>

whole concept of a programme motion is that it is part of the process
of the House, and part of respecting our democracy. It is not a mere
ceremonial, or a nod in the right direction; it actually means that we
end up with better law. It means that the House goes through the
processes of Second Reading, Committee and Report before sending a Bill
to the second Chamber, but does so in a comprehensive way so that we
all end up with much better

that process is corrupted—which is what has happened in respect
of this Bill—it means that the House cannot, across the party
divides, help a Government of whatever colour to make a Bill more
effective. That is precisely what has happened in this instance, and it
has happened because, although for a long period the progress of this
policy issue was characterised by lethargy, in recent days it has been
handled with hyper-speed in the House. It is not appropriate for us to
discuss the reasons for that during a debate on a programme motion, but
we will discuss them as we proceed through the Report

took my Committee—the Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee—a long time to consider the Bill, or rather to
consider a consultative document. We did our job carefully on behalf of
the House before submitting our report to the Government, who took the
best part of a year to respond. They responded only when they were
forced to do so, because, as a result of their own timetable, they were
trying to rush the progress of the Bill,
which<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T17:47:38"></hs_TimeCode> was then
subjected to the hysterically fast progress that has meant that it has
not been considered properly by the House. Given the time that has
elapsed between the issuing of the consultative paper and now, it would
have been perfectly possible for us to engage in a proper process of
pre-legislative scrutiny involving my Select Committee, to give the
Bill a proper Committee stage, and still to have bags of time left
according to the timetable that we have now set ourselves.</hs_Para>

is why, for the first time in over 20 years in the House, I am on my

Parliament has been abused. The timetable that we are now being asked
to meet constitutes the exact opposite of the lethargy that caused the
Government to take over a year to reply to my Committee. One day before
the House rose for the summer recess in July, we were presented with
this Bill. It is not a Bill that my Committee had examined, it is not a
Bill that the House had considered, it is not a Bill that was referred
to the Electoral Commission, and it is not a Bill that was referred to
third parties such as charities—10,500 of them.

hope that all Members, on both sides of the House, feel that the
Electoral Commission is one of the most valuable and impartial parts of
our democracy. We undermine it at our peril. It sorts out the nuts and
bolts of our democracy so that we can glide across the top and have the
policy and political debates that the country expects us to have. It
does a great job. On one of the earlier occasions when we were
considering the Bill, I mentioned that it is very difficult to get the
Electoral Commission to commit one way or another on the politics of
these proposals—believe me, Mr Deputy Speaker, we have tried.
The Electoral Commission said, “We are going to stick to our
role. We are here to be impartial. We do see some things that are not
very appropriate.” However, if we read between the lines, we see
that the Electoral Commission is profoundly uneasy about the role in
which it is being cast by the Government. Part of the reason it is
uneasy is that it was not even consulted at the right time, at an early
enough moment, on measures that change its terms of reference and the
job it has to do, let alone on becoming the police of freedom of speech
and intervening in election meetings, at hustings or at some other
point. It is being put in that role without being properly
consulted.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100824000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0002.htm#13100824000050"><Member ContinuationText="Huw Irranca-Davies" PimsId="1124" UID="13100824000745" xid="662" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0002.htm#13100824000745"><B>Huw

charities and voluntary sector organisations. Many of them are big
beasts and have been around a long time. Those organisations can look
after themselves, summon a barrister, get a brief and argue their
corner—eventually, having been let in to see the Government.
Many of the big organisations came before the Select Committee, some
distinguished members of which are here. However, as my hon. Friend

given adequate time under a programme motion, so that my hon. Friend

meant to do a job for Members, so that we can discuss the issues
properly under a proper programme motion. His Select Committee has been
squeezed by the programme motion and by the Government’s haste
at the wrong end of the process, and that means that we do not consider
the Bill properly. That is why my hon. Friend the Member for Newport
West (Paul Flynn) and Members throughout the House who are members of

lengthy protests from key organisations such as the Royal British

perhaps an incoming Leader of the House might have said,
“I’m blowed if I’m going to be hung with this for

immunity of parliamentary proceedings is an important fundamental
constitutional principle. Its only limitation is a doctrine that has
been developed by the courts, known as the doctrine of necessity. That

is always a choice for Parliament whether to legislate in order to
express what we hold should be immune from the courts, but there are
significant disadvantages in legislating. First, parliamentary
privilege has to evolve as Parliament evolves and as the law evolves.

John Redwood</B> (Wokingham) (Con):</Member> It seems to me that the
kernel of the problem is that this is a Bill to regulate
lobbying. An important part of an MP’s job is to lobby for his
or her constituency and constituents, and we are paid salaries, so in
that sense we are paid lobbyists; but surely that part of our role,
like every other part of the role, must be immune from the
interventions of the court and must not be in any way modified by the
legislation before

Jenkin:</Member></B> I hear what my right hon. Friend says, but it is
not generally asserted that, for example, correspondence between him
representing his constituents and a Minister is privileged, because it
would be difficult to prove that that constituted proceedings in
Parliament. I do not think, therefore, that we can seek to extend
parliamentary privilege in the Bill. What we do as our job to represent
our constituents is clearly not intended to be included in the
regulation of lobbying. It would be intolerable if Members of
Parliament had to register as lobbyists in order to represent their
constituents, or indeed represent any other interests. I will return to

me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100824000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0002.htm#13100824000676"><Member ContinuationText="Paul Flynn" PimsId="3266" UID="13100824001335" xid="205" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0002.htm#13100824001335"><B>Paul
Flynn</B> (Newport West) (Lab):</Member> The hon. Gentleman will recall
that in the previous Parliament there was concern about the way that
certain Members were behaving, and two were summoned to the Committee.
One was receiving £75,000 to represent a company; the other was
receiving £105,000. They received those sums entirely to lobby
on behalf of a commercial organisation. One of their excuses was,
“The organisation has employees in my constituency.” But
surely it is the core job of an MP to lobby for his constituents, and
if MPs are offered money to do it, that should be seen for what it is,
which is a bung, an inducement or a bribe.</hs_Para>

be guilty of paid advocacy. For many decades, since 1945 or even
earlier, paid advocacy has been utterly abhorrent to this House. No
longer do we have MPs sitting in the railway interest, as they did
during the 19th century. The important distinction here is that we
regulate that from within this House, as proceedings of this House. We
do not need or require the courts to interfere in those matters. I do
not think we are providing any leniency to Members that the courts

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T18:54:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for North Down (Lady Hermon) has made an extremely valuable point. It
shows how narrow a view some of the people who draft this legislation
have of what Members of Parliament actually do. They think that we are
simply a post box for our constituents. They do not understand that we
are meant to exercise our judgment and represent interests from outside
our constituencies as well as views and opinions, and indeed the
national interest. They have no conception of that, which I am afraid
is reflected in the Bill’s

Flynn:</Member></B> May I raise with my hon. Friend a question that he
himself has raised? There is a difference between this House and the
other House. There was a recent investigation into the conduct of a
Member of the House of Lords who was behaving in a way that would be
condemned in this place as reprehensible, but the Lords have not come
to a final conclusion. It relates to a Lord who was campaigning and
lobbying on behalf of the Cayman Islands. The excuse given was that
there is a difference between the two Houses because Members of the
House of Lords are not paid and so are entitled to go around making
money by hiring themselves out to the highest bidder. Surely that is a
matter of public scandal that must be

I indicated, I want to ask a couple of questions about the impact of
the Government’s amendments and whether any lessons have been
learnt from the process by which the offending paragraphs ended up in
the Bill. As several Members made clear on Second Reading, and as the
standards committee spelled out, there was a series of concerns about
the inclusion of paragraphs 1 and 2 to schedule 1 and their impact on
parliamentary privilege. The Committee’s helpful report noted
the evidence that had been received by the Joint Committee on
Parliamentary Privilege in March this year. The evidence from Lord
Judge underlined the risk of including specific exemptions for MPs in
this, or indeed any, Bill. It also underlined the concern that future
legislation relating to Members without such an exemption might
inadvertently affect parliamentary privilege.</hs_Para>

provided me with back-up, information and material for distribution

also because a former member

National Autism Society would have been called into question by the
Bill is an extremely pertinent point. It is a worry that Ministers
rushed out the Bill, and it appears—this is why I have asked the
question of the Leader of the House—that not very much advice
was taken from the House authorities before the Bill was published. As
a result, considerable concerns have been raised by Members on both
sides of the House, detracting inevitably from the House’s

the Leader of the House set out with whom he, his ministerial
colleagues or others involved in drafting the Bill consulted before
inserting the offending paragraphs? I ask because it has not always
been easy to track which Minister and which Department was leading on
this Bill and it would be useful to know whether the Leader of the
House has considered whether a repeat of the error might be avoided in
the future. I emphasise gently to the Leader of the House that the
mistake might have been avoided had there been pre-legislative
scrutiny, a further period of public consultation and a proper
attempt to involve the Political and Constitutional Reform Committee in
particular.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0002.htm#1310093000023">I
turn now to a question that I raised in an intervention on the hon.
Member for Harwich and North Essex: the impact of the Bill on the other
place. As the Bill is currently drafted, a Member of
Parliament’s pay could also be construed—a point the
right hon. Member for Wokingham made—as payment for third-party
consultant lobbying. In the other place, peers are given an allowance
and are not paid a salary. There is an expectation that those in the
other place can earn a living beyond their work there. The House of
Lords code of conduct is currently being reviewed by a sub-committee of
the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege. It would be helpful to
get a specific assurance from the Leader of the House, or his colleague
the Deputy Leader, on the extent to which, if at all, the Bill as
drafted, and as it would be if the Government amendments were carried,
would affect the other place. These are clearly questions that members
in the other place will want to explore, quite rightly. But we also
have a responsibility to think through some of the issues around the
other place. It would be helpful to hear from the Leader of the House
on the extent to which he has considered this
question.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_08_PT_1/A8E3636B77456B9B7A4381AF73445DFB996927B1" __version__="1.7"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="8 October 2013">Tuesday

way at this point. He says “around the world”. It is
often thought that parliamentary privilege is unique to our rather odd
partly written constitution, where the fundamental principles are
accepted and not written down. That is not the case. Every
parliamentary democracy in the world grants its legislative authority
some kind of immunity in order to ensure that it can carry on
its function of holding the Executive to account, and legislating and
discussing with impunity. It is not unique to us; it exists in America,
Australia and elsewhere. They all wrestle with this problem of how to

also point out that a number of other countries have got themselves
into serious turmoil and trouble

inessential and incidental to the manner in which their constitution is
construed. In many countries, whether dictatorships or
quasi-democracies, the inhibitions on the freedom of their members of
parliament to speak as they must on behalf of the national interest or
on behalf of their constituents is constrained by a lot of activities
which, in effect, put them in fear. It is precisely because this House

been clearly pointed out in the debate, under the paragraph I would be
potentially restricted to lobbying the Secretary of State or a senior
civil servant only on the basis of a constituent having contacted me
about an issue. That would be nonsensical. It would mean that to be
able to do the work that I have been doing on public health for many
years in this Chamber, I would first have to get a constituent to write
to me about it. It could also affect my ability to go to a recognised
charity that is concerned about public health issues and work with it

Minister’s job to represent an industry, charity or group of
underprivileged people who are not in their constituency, in order to
shape national policy. Individual Members may wish to pursue similar

great difference between a free society and a tyranny or an
authoritarian regime is that any group, interest, person or company in

important that he makes it clear that we as MPs are not placing

to me, namely HS2 and the National Autistic Society. When people

charities and other bodies that seek our help do not misconstrue the
situation and think that we will be gagged in any way. This is called
the gagging Bill in common parlance, which is why I want to make sure
that the Leader of the House gives us a reassurance, as I am sure he
will. The one thing I know is that he has been listening very carefully

Judge was right in what he said to the Joint Committee on Parliamentary
Privilege and that is at the heart of our thinking on the matter. If we
say in some Bills that nothing in the Bill infringes the principle of
parliamentary privilege, not only would that be subject to judicial
interpretation, but courts might conclude that other statutes that do
not have such a saving provision may infringe parliamentary privilege.
They might take the lack of a saving provision as an indication that
Parliament did not expressly wish to avoid that happening. That is not
our view. Our view is that parliamentary privilege subsists, that
nothing in the Bill will infringe it and that courts should not
interpret any part of it as infringing parliamentary privilege, for the

conversation that we talked to the House authorities about
parliamentary privilege. The implication of what he says is that the
Bill was in a sense deficient because Members of Parliament were
caught, but they 
<?notus-xml column=94?>were not. In the original Bill, Members of
Parliament were exempt by virtue of the fact that they were engaged in
a public duty as office holders, not in the course of a business. To
that extent, we included provisions intended to give additional
reassurance, but that simply muddied the waters and it was simpler to
do it in the way that we, together with the Chair of the Standards and
Privileges Committee, accepted. We accepted an amendment in Committee,
and all I am doing today—I hope—is making it clear that
the combination of those amendments in Committee and the amendments now
being considered respects the views of the Standards and Privileges
Committee and protects the rights of this House in relation to
privilege. It also entirely protects the position of Members of
Parliament who are undertaking their duties, however they construe
them. On that basis, I hope Members will support Government

paragraph in schedule 1, subject to amendment 29, because were it to
remain it would have the effect of narrowing the exemption to an absurd

redundant but would be highly damaging because it would suggest that

Thomas:</Member></B> Reasonable though the Leader of the House was
about the previous set of amendments, he will have to reach
unprecedented oratorical heights for the Opposition not to press new
clause 4 to a vote. The new clause seeks to establish a code of conduct
that would help establish standards of behaviour for consultant
lobbyists. Such codes exist already in a number of other countries that
have tough lobbying regulations—Canada and Australia, for
example, both have codes of conduct to which registered lobbyists must
adhere. Indeed, this House’s Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee also recommended a statutory code of conduct.</hs_Para>

some debate in Committee about the elements of a possible code of
conduct, and that point bears dwelling on and expanding a little.
Surely, top of the list 
<?notus-xml column=96?>of standards in a code of conduct should be the requirement that
lobbyists and their clients tell the truth to those they meet. Another
element that might be worthy of inclusion in the code is that lobbyists
must be open about who their clients are. Members of the House,
Ministers and permanent secretaries are entitled to know who is
lobbying them and for what purpose. Surely there should be a
requirement that lobbyists advise their clients if they are about to
commit illegal or unethical acts.</hs_Para>

conduct would need to be properly consulted on with all relevant
stakeholders, including the Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee. I accept there are already a number of voluntary codes of
conduct in the lobbying industry, some of which are extremely
comprehensive. Sadly, however, not every lobbyist is a member of one or
other of those voluntary codes.</hs_Para>

chief executive of MHP Communications, one of the bigger lobbying
firms, noted there is a risk that simply securing a place on the

sort of endorsement, without having to operate to particular standards.
Other evidence presented to the Political and Constitutional Reform
Committee suggested there might be an economic issue for some who
decide to register and pay the registration fee, but do not want to pay
any more for the cost of being a consultant lobbyist, and therefore
would no longer be part of a voluntary code of

very much hope that the Government will, in the end, come round to the
view that in-house lobbyists need to be brought under the scope of this
legislation. A code of conduct, provided for by the principal new
clause in the group, could then cover a whole series of lobbying
activities and require all lobbyists to adhere to clearer standards of
behaviour. Many in the lobbying industry who are practitioners of
political lobbying work to high ethical standards, and they

Friend the Member for Rother Valley (Mr Barron), the Chairman of the
Standards and Privileges Committee, and I endorse his views in that the
Government have listened on the particular item he mentioned, as a
result of which we have a better Bill, although it is still far from
perfect. That just shows that where there is interaction—this
does not mean that the Government have to swallow every probing
amendment that finds itself on to the amendment paper—there is a
possibility of a little bit of give and take. From my perspective as a
parliamentarian, I understand that some of the ethics 
<?notus-xml column=102?>coming from the Front Bench have to be a little sharper and a bit more
oppositional, but I sometimes have the luxury of posing a view on
behalf of Parliament that might find favour, albeit not necessarily in
its existing form. Let that debate

Where we have had that chance, it has, by and large, been a productive
relationship. I hope that, because this House has not had as much of
that chance as we would like, colleagues in the other place will find
an open door and be allowed more give and take so that the Bill evolves
and gets better and better as it goes through the parliamentary
process. <I>[Interruption.] </I>I do not know whether the Leader of the

I say, my hon. Friend the Member for Harrow West has covered most of
the issues, but on a more specific and narrow point, I would like to
look at the issue of the information provided in the register. It was
an issue that my Select Committee took very seriously, and we took a
lot of evidence on it. Looking at the nitty-gritty of the Bill through
the first consultation we undertook, we thought that we would have a
Bill that dealt only with what we are discussing today—not with
what we will be discussing tomorrow, as that was added at a later
stage. Today, however, we are discussing lobbying, lobbyists and the
process of lobbying. We thought that we had made quite a sensible and
constructive contribution to that debate. Subsequently, we then rather
hurriedly took additional witness evidence, including from the Leader
of the House, but from people on all sides of the arguments about what
lobbying is and what form regulation should take.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100834000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100834000045">One point
that was common to all those who spoke to us was that they felt that
the big chance had been missed. They believed that the lobbying problem
had been accurately identified by the Prime Minister and perceptively
identified by the Deputy Prime Minister in the run-up to and
during the last general election. People were surprised, however, that
none of those issues that raised such public concern—and the
concern of two party leaders who became partners in the
coalition—were addressed in the Bill that was produced to deal
with lobbying. Rather, lobbyists were narrowly defined and those to be
lobbied were narrowly defined. We thus felt through that period that a
big chance had been missed to do what we all thought the lobbying Bill
was about. The detail of all that was taken seriously, as people from a
wide range of views said, “Let us try to help; let us try to
define the problem a little more accurately”—by
reflecting, for example, on what sort of information should be
provided. That is clearly at the heart of amendment
100.</hs_Para>

Hermon:</Member></B> I am grateful to the hon. Gentleman for allowing
me to intervene. I think it would be most helpful if he gave us some
examples of the range of people who wanted to know more about what the
subject matter of the lobbying was.</hs_Para>

Allen:</Member></B> I would be pleased to do so. My Select Committee,
composed of Members of all parties, pulled together the full list of
those who gave us evidence, and we published it. On the specific point
that the hon. Lady mentions, my report heard from interested people
ranging from a former chief executive of five trade associations, Mark
Boleat, the Information Commissioner’s Office and Spinwatch,
which was on one particular wing of the argument, to academics such as
Dr Hogan, Professor Murphy and Dr Chari, to Iain Anderson, the deputy
chairman of the Association of Professional and Political Consultants,
the Committee on Standards in Public Life—mentioned earlier by
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T20:19:42"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Friend the Member for Rother Valley—and the list goes on and on.
Many people and organisations in all parts of the lobbying industry
gave evidence to the Committee, and there was a surprising degree of
consensus on the issue of what might happen, particularly in relation
to information provided in the
register<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T20:20:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100834000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100834000048">This
is another missed opportunity. First the Government missed the
opportunity to tackle some of the big issues involved in what the
public regard as lobbying; now, by ramming the Bill through the House
of Commons at such a late stage like a bull charging at a gate and by
leaving any effective scrutiny to the other place, they have failed to
cash in on the good will that exists among organisations in the
lobbying business which might be expected to be at daggers
drawn<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T20:22:41"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100834000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100834000049">In
fact—partly as a result of a process of discussion and debate in
which my Committee played its part, but partly because of public
interest in the issue—people began to say things such as
“Let us try to find a sensible way forward. Let us find some
basic steps on which we can all agree.” Perhaps the issue could
be revisited in a couple of years when things had settled down, or
perhaps cases could be responded to as they arose when loopholes were
identified.</hs_Para>

one ever expects a measure to be perfect initially. I think that we
missed that chance, that possibility of consensus. We suggested that
there could be a pause, certainly in respect of clause 2, and that we,
or at any rate a Committee of the House, could—within a set time
such as six months, and not as a means of delay—bring back to
the House a fully fledged Bill that would command consensus among all
those with an interest, rather than a Bill which, sadly, commands
consensus because no one likes it.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T20:22:01"></hs_TimeCode>Bill has no

people out in the streets marching up and down saying “Thank
goodness Parliament has got it right.” I think that it reflects
badly on the reputation of this place, and we are seen to be failing
the public, when a public issue such as anxiety about lobbying can be
put to bed in a rational way but we produce a Bill that has so many
loopholes, one of which relates to the information provided in the

evidence was coming in all the time about how seriously the detail, the

the transparency of those who are being lobbied, their accountability
and how effectively they are lobbied. 
<?notus-xml column=106?>That is one detail of an important, extended set of
original legislative prerogatives that we are being asked to look at. I
briefly allude to the fact that earlier I felt that we needed not just
more time on the Floor of the House but adequate time to tease out
these issues. There are not wild differences of view but there are
understandable differences of nuance. Parliament has a role in helping
to make legislation work. If we have that starting point, people can
come together and make even a Bill that some of us largely disagree
with workable. I hope that the second Chamber can pick that up,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100837000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000007">Iain
Anderson, deputy chair of the Association of Professional Political
Consultants, supported publishing information about the purpose and
subject matter of lobbying, but suggested that that
could be done most effectively and efficiently when details of
ministerial and official meetings were published, rather than in the
register. That is a perfectly valid view. I have heard it put by
Government Front Benchers. It is perfectly justifiable. The Committee
on Standards in Public Life also argued that information on the subject
matter could be included either on the register or in the details that
were published of meetings. The difficulty with including the
information in the data about ministerial and official meetings is
that, if the definition of lobbying is expanded to encompass conduct
and contact with the rest of the senior civil service, special advisers
and others, who do not necessarily publish details of their meetings,
the coverage of such information would be patchy at best. That would
not necessarily be advantageous when we are trying to pull such a Bill
together.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100837000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Francis" PimsId="3314" UID="13100837000672" xid="215" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000672">Dr

that in our last set of debates. I am sure she will forgive me for not
knowing enough about the detail of the case; the subject appeared to be
very specific. It would have been a lie to say that this was a general
discussion about transport and haulage; that would have been to conceal
the truth. It is not for me to judge, because I do not know the case,
but that particular interaction would have been much better described
in specifics; without going into technical detail, mention could have
been made of the constituency and the people involved. That could have
been done in a few words, and the hon. Lady, one of her constituents or
someone interested in this particular case would have picked that up
from the register. She would then, rightly, have been able to ask
further questions of a Minister or a friend of a Minister. She would
have been able to say, “Hang on. What does this actually mean? I
have a constituency interest here. I have been following this. What
went on here?” From that, we can move things forward.

new clause would require the registrar, after consultation with

that the Opposition intend to create not only a register of lobbyists
but a full-blown general regulator of the industry. While the
Government are seeking to shine the light of transparency on the key
issues in lobbying and the impact on key decision makers, the
Opposition are bent on regulating the lobbying industry as a whole.

relationships; the hon. Gentleman does not tell us what those
inappropriate relationships are or explain why they are not already
prohibited by instruments such as parliamentarians’ codes of
conduct, which we discussed earlier, or laws on bribery and corruption.
How would the provisions of the code be enforced? What resources would
the registrar require to monitor and enforce compliance, particularly
if seeking to enforce compliance against imprecise, vague and
wide-ranging—understandably so, as far as the voluntary code is
concerned—principles and prescriptions? Trying to set up such a
structure of enforcement in relation to such a wide-ranging code for
such a large number of people is completely unsustainable. Who would
foot the bill? The bill for the measures in Canada is equivalent to
£3 million and this proposal would clearly cost much more. In
any case, the Canadians go about things in a different way from us. It
is not a case of adopting what they do, because they do not take our
approach. We set out, through the transparency of Ministers’ and
permanent secretaries’ diaries, to approach the issue in a

registrar, which I believe is already made clear in the wording of the
Bill. The registrar will be independent of the lobbying industry and
the Government and will have a clear remit to operate independently of
both. The Minister will be able to dismiss the registrar only when he
or she is satisfied that the registrar is unable, unwilling or unfit to
perform the functions of his or her office, and any decision by the
Minster<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T20:55:53"></hs_TimeCode> could be

amendment 85 removes the requirement that lobbyists who have no
business address must register their private residence. I can
understand the concern to protect the privacy of individuals on the
register, especially given the more onerous and invasive reporting
requirements proposed elsewhere by the Opposition, but I am not sure
that the removal of the requirement to register an address is a helpful
one. A registered address is critical if the registrar is successfully
to issue information notices, investigate compliance, and serve penalty
notices. The great majority of consultant lobbyists will have one or
more dedicated business addresses, so no issue will arise.
The handful of individual consultant lobbyists who have no separate
business address—I recognise that there is no
requirement to register for those who do not meet the threshold of
undertaking a business that is VAT-registered—can choose to
obtain such an address and use that or they can submit their
personal residential address. I therefore do not agree that this step

the Opposition’s concern about privacy, do they
really want to require, as proposed by their amendment 86,
that every organisation that lobbies must declare the names of all

which other Opposition amendments would apply, if an academic were
engaged in contact with a Minister in pursuance of a subject on which
they had undertaken research, the Opposition’s
definition—not ours—would require that to be registered,
whereas we would say that that was incidental and that the academic was
not engaged mainly in lobbying activity. The Opposition would say that
it should be included and, by extension, the names of everybody who
works for the university should be entered in the register. That is

clear that the objective of the register is the identification of the

Lobbyists should therefore be required to disclose their clients. We
are not persuaded that the burden of providing further information that
would be imposed on the industry and the regulator is justified by the
limited insight that it would provide. One can readily envisage the
administrative nightmare that would result from trying to determine the
costs of lobbying activity, especially where this had to be

the Bill establishes is not where meetings will be listed. Meetings
will be listed in the diary of the Minister or the permanent secretary.
Consequently, in so far as it is appropriate for a meeting’s
character to be disclosed, it will be disclosed in the ministerial
diaries. To try to construct in the Bill the idea that the subject of
meetings will be disclosed in the register would be to misunderstand
what the register does. The register discloses the clients of
consultant lobbyists, not the subjects on which they are
lobbying.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100837000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000060"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mark Durkan" PimsId="3056" UID="13100837000699" xid="916" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000699">Mark

convincing case for why the register should not specify the topic of
the lobbying. The idea of relying solely on ministerial diaries, with
people having to look up the register and then the diaries on the basis
that they already have a suspicion, clearly imposes more difficulty. If
this is meant to be about transparency in lobbying, why cannot there be

Gentleman was listening to my previous answer. Consultant lobbyists
disclose in the register who their clients are. The diaries of
Ministers and permanent secretaries disclose who they meet. If the
Secretary of 
<?notus-xml column=114?>State for Transport meets British Airways, it is
transparent that British Airways is representing its interests.
However, if the XYZ airline is represented by a consultant lobbyist,
the register will disclose that the airline is the client of that
lobbyist, and it will be transparent through the Minister’s
diary that he or she has met that lobbyist and, as a consequence, it
will be clear who they are meeting. The issue is not whether there is
transparency but the mechanism by which transparency is delivered. It
is delivered through the publication of Ministers’ diaries, and
the gap in transparency that we have identified, and which the Bill
remedies, is the gap in understanding, if Ministers or permanent
secretaries meet consultant lobbyists, who their clients
are.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100837000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000062"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lady Hermon" PimsId="943" UID="13100837000701" xid="272" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#13100837000701">Lady

close to the scale of dysfunctionality in the American political system

code of conduct; more sensible would have been to point to the examples

that a statutory code of conduct can be made workable and enforceable,

sure that she is glad to be out from under this garland of an

to describe the Bill—perhaps a dog’s dinner of an
albatross—there is absolute unanimity that it is a total mess.
Rarely have so many diverse groups been united in

clause 7 would ensure that some critical groups and individuals are not
caught up in the Bill. One of the reasons the Bill attracts so much
opposition is that it stands up for the powerful against the weak. A
small firm of lobbyists, perhaps specialising in green technology on
behalf of social enterprises that cannot afford to hire expensive
lobbyists, will be caught up by the Bill and forced to pay possibly
thousands to be on the register, but a 150-person-strong public affairs
team in a big six energy company will absolutely not be caught. As the
Public Relations Consultants Association has said, fewer organisations
will be required to sign this register than are currently on the
voluntary register. As a result, these consultancies, which will mainly
be small and medium-sized enterprises because larger ones tend not to
be exclusively lobbying businesses, will each be required to pay
potentially thousands a year—not my estimate—mainly to
register a list of names of staff and clients, which most of them
already do.</hs_Para>

this Bill, it is hard to distinguish between the result of poor

when lobbied, are to be subject to appropriate registration. At the
moment, the list includes a Minister of the Crown or a permanent
secretary, and my proposal is to add special advisers to that list.
They are clearly a group of people known to be part of the political
system operating out there as a bridge between Ministers, Departments
and the public. It seems to me that they are naturally perceived to be
people who can receive messages from lobbyists and pass them on to
their political bosses. It would be good politics and not a
complication to add this group of people to the list. I know that so
far this has been considered but rejected by the Government. I hope

go down in parliamentary history as partaking in one of the worst Bills
that has ever appeared before the House. Students of the future will
study this with amazement—to think that a Bill of this kind
could ever be introduced. Speaking to the amendments is rather like

for Norwich North (Miss Smith) who as the responsible
Minister was given the gloomy task of introducing this Bill to our
Select Committee in July, on the last day before we went off for the
summer recess. She had a torrid time, trying to defend the
indefensible. I said that I was sympathetic to her, given that she was
sitting there, garlanded with an albatross of nonsense. I am delighted
to know that she has given up and gone to spend more time with the
truth, having escaped from the Front Bench. I wish her well in her
future career; it could not have got worse. I am sure that when she was
assailed by this blizzard of e-mails—not from just 10 or 20
charities, but from hundreds—she realised how damaging the Bill
was. These amendments would go some way to improving it.</hs_Para>

was said earlier, we should see the wheeze. Of course no hon. Member
behaves badly; nothing done in this House or the other place would be
dishonourable. The whole purpose behind the Bill and why it was
introduced was to address hints of a scandal. It was not yet
established, but there was a fear that a scandal had taken place,
involving the country of Fiji. The matter has still not been settled,
but there was also an equally minor scandal involving a Member of the
other place with respect to the Cayman
Islands.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T21:44:02"></hs_TimeCode></hs_Para>

are in a very vulnerable position. The Member involved in the Cayman
Islands case was doing something that would be absolutely forbidden in
the House of Commons, but it was justified after the first stage of the
investigation in the other House on the grounds that Members of that
House are not paid and have to earn a few bob here and there. If they
are taking money from another country—and there are Members in
this House who are doing the same thing, acting as representatives of
countries such as Azerbaijan and various other oppressive
regimes—that is apparently okay. However, it is not okay. We

and—one of the amendments deals with this—we should also
include electronic mail. I believe that 500 e-mails were sent by one of
Murdoch’s lackeys to a Secretary of State’s special
adviser in an attempt to influence him in regard to a decision. Is it
okay for the Bill not to cover

Bill does not cover the great problems that we had with one particular
Secretary of State who achieved absolution through resignation. There
was a very worrying situation involving a lobbyist who was working for
that Secretary of State. He was not employed by that Secretary of
State, or by the Government; apparently, he was employed by certain
right-wing think-tanks in America, but he was certainly present at
private meetings, and 
<?notus-xml column=126?>was privy to all kinds of information. When the
matter came out, it should have been referred to the adviser on
ministerial interests, but it was not. The adviser resigned, and
another was appointed.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T21:44:38"></hs_TimeCode>When our
Committee held a hearing to consider whether the proposed replacement
was the right man, we decided unanimously that he was not. We voted

example of something that could happen here; indeed, something similar
is happening here.
In<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T21:44:38"></hs_TimeCode> America, a

were present at every private meeting that took place, and constantly
advised Petraeus to beef up the aggression and play down the war
movement. They were not employed by Petraeus, they were not employed by
the military and they were not employed by the American Government.
They were employed by the American arms industry. That gives us some
clue as to why we have continual pressure for perpetual war to keep the
orders going. Is that taken care of in the

have a scandal in this country, which was revealed by <I>The Sunday
Times. </I>Apparently, in the past 15 years the astronomical figure of
3,500 former civil servants have been working for the arms industry.
Many members of the civil service now retire at a very early age and
embark on a second career, using their civil service expertise and
contacts files. In one instance, a General Kiszely offered his
services. He said that when he went to the Cenotaph and was waiting for
the Queen to turn up, there was not much else to do: one would not be
thinking about the fallen. He said that it was a good marketing
opportunity, and that he could talk to people there and settle
contracts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-08T21:44:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#1310093000033">New
clause 7, in particular, is designed to deal with the fact that the
Advisory Committee on Business Appointments provides very weak rules to
limit the way in which former Ministers, civil servants, generals and
admirals can prostitute the knowledge that they gain when they are in
high office in order to make as much money as they can afterwards. The
problem is not the damage they do afterwards, because their knowledge
is a wasting asset and soon becomes out of date. The great problem is
this. When people are Ministers, top civil servants or heads of
Department, what are they doing? When they have to settle contracts
involving billions of pounds, do they say they will do so in the public
interest and in the pursuit of best value for money, or in the back of
their mind are they thinking that if they give the contract to firm A,
B or C, one of them might do a deal with them and they may get
their hacienda in Spain in retirement as a result of that decision? It
is a deeply corrupting part of our system. ACBA never succeeds in
limiting it; it has no powers. It can take any decision and give any
advice, but it cannot impose those
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0003.htm#1310093000034">In

were waiting for the Bill. We were promised it on 10 March 2010. This
was going to be the great crusading Parliament against lobbying. This
was going to be the new scandal. Nothing happened: comatose for nearly
three years. Suddenly there was a scandal on the way and the Government
decided to act. The Bill was conceived in haste. It was written in fear
and in malice. The legislative process has been conducted with
incompetence. These modest amendments will make some improvements but
it will be one of the many Bills that will go through the House. We are
very poor at legislating.</hs_Para>

at the history. During the 13 years of the Labour Government, 75 Bills
went through all their stages and were never put into practice. A
permanent secretary has that figure. We have this disease. If we see a
problem, what do we do? Dogs bark, children cry, politicians legislate.
This is a piece of utterly futile legislation. It does not deal with
the problem. It misses 97% of the problem but it takes a spiteful
side-swipe at bodies that are blameless such as charities and trade
unions. The Government are trying to save corporate lobbyists, who are
doing the greatest damage, from the bureaucracy, and they have hit out
at people who are doing no damage whatever. They are reducing
bureaucracy for one and increasing needlessly bureaucracy for the
other. This is an awful
Bill.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0004.htm#1310093000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Lansley" PimsId="1419" UID="1310093000152" xid="347" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0004.htm#1310093000152">Mr
Lansley:</Member></B> As has been demonstrated, the effect of new
clause 7 and the other amendments proposed by the hon. Member for
Newcastle upon Tyne Central (Chi Onwurah) would be to bring into the
register of lobbyists not just consultant lobbyists but all those who
are in-house lobbyists. She knows that the approach we have taken is
not to seek to create a register of everyone who engages in lobbying,
which would be a very long list, but to ensure that the details of the
meetings of the key decision makers—Ministers and
permanent secretaries—are published and by extension we
understand who is lobbying whom as far as the key decision makers are
concerned. She rather shot her own fox by talking about the big six
energy firms. The reason that earlier this week <I>The Independent</I>
was able to run the story about the number of times that Ministers have
met representatives of the big six energy firms is that we as a
Government for the first time have published details of
Ministers’ diaries. Putting the names of the big six energy
firms in a register of lobbyists adds no information: we know who they
are; we know on whose behalf they are lobbying; and we now
know—as a result of this Government, not the previous
Government—when they are meeting the key decision makers. That
is clear. In this Bill we are extending transparency and addressing the
key failing, and we are doing so not through having a large list of the
kind the Opposition amendments would
create.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000040" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0004.htm#1310093000040">New

thanking you, on behalf of my colleagues the right hon. Member for
Gordon (Sir Malcolm Bruce) and the hon. Member for Congleton (Fiona
Bruce), for granting us this debate, which seeks to place on the record
details of our recent Speaker’s delegation visit to Burma? I
want to set out the background to the visit, what we saw on the visit
and points of action to influence Government policy on Burma. I am sure
that we can, between us, cover the events of what was a remarkable
experience.</hs_Para>

you have been most gracious in inviting me to accompany you. Of course,
I also have to thank my right hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham,
Deptford (Dame Joan Ruddock), because her not being available to make
the visit enabled me to take her place. Following your invitation to
Daw Aung San Suu Kyi to speak to both Houses, you made it clear that,
on behalf of Parliament, you wanted to leave a lasting legacy of help
and support to Burma, particularly as you have had a long-standing
interest in Burma. You said that you did not just want to have a visit
and leave, but you wanted to fulfil your promise to Daw Suu to help in
a practical way. At this stage, I want to thank the embassy in Burma
and all its staff, your office and others in the House service who were
involved in setting up the visit, organising and accompanying us to the
meetings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000079" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0004.htm#1310093000079">Mr
Speaker, you said on many occasions at our meetings that we were not in
Burma to tell the Burmese how to run their country, but that we were
there to show them how we do our work here and how they can perhaps
learn from us and adapt it for their use. So what did we see? May I pay
tribute to you, again, Mr Speaker, for holding together and being the
focus of the 24 meetings we had over eight days, and
acknowledge your courageous speech at Yangon university, which may be a
topic for a Speaker’s
lecture?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000080" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0004.htm#1310093000080">We
all appeared on our trip with the book by Benedict Rogers
“Burma: a Nation at the Crossroads”, which was launched
at the Speaker’s House. We note from the book that progress has
been made. Despite the elections in 1990, the results of which have not
been recognized, Daw Suu now sits in the Burmese Parliament, along with
many other MPs and also the generals. At the Parliament in Nay Pyi Taw,
we met both Speakers of the upper and lower Houses, the President,
Minsters from the presidential office and committee chairs. The
delegation managed to raise the issue of the release of political
prisoners and I know that you, Mr Speaker, have already sent a list to
the President’s office. The President had already agreed that
the United Nations could set up an office for the human rights
commissioner, but he was no clearer about when that would take place. I
am pleased that the embassy now has a human rights

seems to me that we can have influence on two levels: the political
level and service level. Daw Suu said that she wants active
parliamentarians and to give all MPs the tools to be effective MPs. We
can help and are helping to set up a library. I explained that our

humanitarian aid is difficult, particularly in Kachin state. We also
heard that the rice federation regulates itself and is headed by
someone close to the Government. A major census was under way that
would provide useful information in 2014, such as how many girls were
getting equal education, or an education at all. An MP from Kachin
state told me that displaced people could not return to their villages

trying to help that move forward. Unfortunately, in Kachin province we
have seen the persecution of the Christian minority and other groups.

self-determination, equality across the genders, strong federal
Governments, meaningful engagement with civil society, that MPs should
be more available to meet and be accountable to their
constituents, and a Government who truly represent all the people,
including all ethnic and religious groups. All this was from
young people who have lived virtually all their lives under military

requests from the former prisoners were for the urgent review of cases
of those who are still in prison and whose only offence appears to have
been to criticise the previous regime. If Burma is to demonstrate to
the rest of the world that it is genuinely moving forward in its
respect for freedom of speech, conscience and belief, this is
essential. The former prisoners expressed concerns that the media are
not wholly independent or free. A recent press law, they told us,
limits rather than extends press freedom and was not preceded by
promised dialogue between press industry representatives before being
implemented.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310093000116" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/debtext/131008-0004.htm#1310093000116">Another
former prisoner spoke of unfair legal procedures, often
involving those accused having to go to court many times, and the
overall impression that I had was that although there is change, a
fundamental review of the legal sector, its practices and
procedures is needed. We were told, too, of the need for the
constitution to be amended so that it clearly bans the use of torture.
Other issues raised with us included the fact that although new
laws are passed, there is a lack of capacity to monitor their
implementation, so that in some areas old laws are still being used.

advice centre, which has been referred to, in the fourth largest city

impressive objectives: to establish a steering group for a legal aid
system; to provide legal advice and assistance to the poorest,
including court representation; and to raise awareness that every
citizen in the country should have legal rights under the law. Those
aspiring young professionals were smart, visionary and personable, and
at the same time they were realistic about the journey that they and
their fellow countrymen have to make towards a new Burma. Meeting them

closing, I have a few questions for the Minister. With regard to the

press for that, and what plans has DFID to increase humanitarian
assistance for those who have been internally displaced or subjected to
human rights violations? I ask him to consider the necessity of DFID
ensuring that international efforts are co-ordinated. Finally, what is
his assessment of the number of political prisoners still in jail? What
can be done to ensure that they are released by the end of the year and
that there are no more prisoners of conscience, political prisoners or

for the Burmese Government to honour their commitment to establish an
Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. I also stressed
the need for the Government to act to address the lack of citizenship
for the Rohingya community and the incitement of inter-communal
violence affecting Muslim communities in Rakhine, which I have visited,
and other parts of Burma. It should be noted that it was the first such

co-ordinated action by the UN and the Burmese Government to ensure that

Fabricant</B> (Lichfield) (Con):</Member> It is a pleasure, Mr Dobbin,
to be here under your chairmanship. My previous debate was on High
Speed 2 and ancient woodlands, and was a little controversial; I hope
that this one will be more of a love-in. Its title is “UK-US
Bilateral Relations”, but the context is: “Whither goest
the special relationship between the UK and the US?” Having said
that, I share the view held by a friend in the US Department of State,
Daniel McNicholas, that the special relationship is a given, and that
it is pointless to worry about its ebbs and flows over days and weeks.
I do not feel guilty about mentioning Daniel McNicholas, because back
in the days when I was in opposition and he served in the US embassy in
London, he and I used to meet up. A few months after I had spoken to
him about various issues concerning the Conservative party in
opposition, I got an urgent phone call from him to say that everything
I had told him had appeared in WikiLeaks. Daniel McNicholas, you have
been
named.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000007">I

recent weeks, the special relationship has been put under scrutiny
following the House of Commons vote on action in Syria. <I>The Sun</I>
ran the dramatic headline, “Death Notice: The Special
Relationship”. At the time, commentators on both sides of the
Atlantic saw the vote as a turning point, with regard to the United
Kingdom’s place in the world. Some even saw Secretary
Kerry’s remarks about France being the United States’
oldest ally—technically, it is—as a public kick in the
teeth from the Obama Administration, but it is not. Let us be clear:
the special relationship is special because of the one fact that there
is no other international relationship like it in the
world.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000010" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000010">Some
people in the UK may panic at anything that can be even remotely taken
as a slight from the Americans. A few weeks ago, it was Secretary of
State Kerry’s remarks about France. Before that, it was
President Obama’s populist remarks about BP and the spill in the
gulf of Mexico. Some years ago, it was Gordon Brown’s bungled
meeting with President Obama in a New York kitchen—let me say to
my friend, the right hon. Member for Warley (Mr Spellar), that that is
the only party political point I will make today. Before that, it was
Tony Blair’s so-called poodle-like behaviour—I did not

that relationship is worth £1.06 billion in investment

Ireland from US companies. That represents one third of all inward

largest export market for Northern Ireland manufacturing companies

Fabricant:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for his
intervention, which reinforces my point. Having worked with the BBC in
Northern Ireland many years ago, I well understand his points. At state
level, New York trades more with the United Kingdom than with any other
US state. New York and the UK are inextricably bound together. If we
believe that that is important for our economy, the Americans know how
important it is for theirs, too. Let us not forget that the United
States is the world’s largest economy, even after the economic
crisis, and that British business is its biggest investor. UK
investment in the US is 116 times greater than China’s
investment in the US, 90 times greater than India’s, and 88
times greater than Brazil’s. We are almost back to 2008 levels,
having suffered a global economic crisis, and we have overtaken Germany
to become the US’s fifth largest trading
partner.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000014">If
a special relationship were based on trade alone, the relationship
between the UK and the US would be more than special, given those
figures, but we know that the relationship enjoyed by our two countries
is about more than just trade. Something pushes that trade. The figures
I quoted should be shouted from the rooftops. We are not some minor
mid-Atlantic island, as President Putin’s spokesman said, that
the US flatters occasionally; we are its biggest investor and it is our
biggest investor. That has happened not by accident, but because we are
friends, because business and entrepreneurial endeavour thrive in our
shared culture, and because we use a shared language, have a shared
history, and use a shared common law. Those are not bygone assets of a
long-forgotten empire or age, but real assets that we share, and which
our people use to their advantage every second of every

the tiles in the US Congress needed to be replaced, it contacted
Minton. The people there said, “The order is not big enough for
us to set up a manufacturing plant for the special manufacturing needed
for the tiles”, so the Serjeants at Arms of both the House of
Representatives and the Senate in the US Congress contacted the
Serjeant at Arms in the House of Commons and Black Rod, as we
archaically call him, in the House of Lords, and said, “Can we
place a joint order for the tiles?” That was duly done. Of

in the United Kingdom, the US Marine Corps invited its counterparts to

In the end, what did President Obama do? He followed in the footsteps
of David Cameron and referred the matter to the US Congress. Despite
the US having the constitution that Britain did in the 18th
century, in which the President is Head of State, with what we would
call the royal prerogative—the right to wage war—he, too,
went to Congress seeking a vote, and he delayed it when he saw that

conclusion, at every level of co-operation, the relationship that the

trade deal as soon as possible. That would increase trade by at least a
further $100 billion, and even the US Congress has speculated on the
many benefits to the United States if the UK were to enter the North
American Free Trade Agreement—even if it meant that the UK would

longer than I have, so over my entire parliamentary career, I have
heard him make many contributions—albeit that when he served as
a Whip, he was silent for a while. He has now come back into the fold

Lewis:</Member></B> That neatly anticipates the point that I wanted to
make, because it shows up one of the slight weaknesses that tend to
crop up from time to time in the Hollywood view of the Anglo-American
relationship. Quite unnecessarily, quite gratuitously, in the course of
the film’s dialogue, there is a throwaway line, “Well,
this country turned them away, that country turned them away, and the
Brits turned them away.” At the time of 
<?notus-xml column=6?>the academy awards, I remember that they interviewed the British
diplomats who had, at huge risk to themselves, taken the six escapees
in and had transported them hazardously to the Canadian
ambassador’s residence. That enabled the whole story, which was
eventually unpacked in this hugely adventurous tale, to
transpire.</hs_Para>

why Hollywood sometimes does that sort of thing. It is not the first
time that it has done it. Something similar happened a few years ago
when there was a rather splendid film called “U-571”
about the American seizure of an Enigma machine from a U-boat in the
course of the battle of the Atlantic. It was perfectly true that that
had happened in 1944 with an American operation, but it had happened
twice previously through the good offices of the Royal Navy. I had
particular reason to know that, because my esteemed constituent
Lieutenant-Commander David Balme was awarded the Distinguished Service
Cross for descending into the depths of U-110 on the first occasion on
which such a seizure was made. When a bit of a fuss was made in the
media, the film company backed down. It took him on as an adviser and
put in a tribute at the end of the film, pointing out that there had
been two earlier
seizures.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000038">One
must not extrapolate too much from that, because of course the
Hollywood view of the Anglo-American relationship should not be relied
on any more than, shall we say, the more partisan, chattering-class,
luvvie views of politics in certain sections of British society should
be relied on. The truth is that the United States and the United
Kingdom are at their best when the chips are down. Like people in all
sorts of good, valuable and, indeed, invaluable relationships, they
bicker and disagree, but when it really matters, they are always there
for each
other.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000039"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Spellar" PimsId="781" UID="1310083000162" xid="555" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000162">Mr

intelligence relationship no doubt goes back a good deal further than
the first world war, but the period that I know something about is the
20th century, and of course in the first world war we had a classic
example of the work of the intelligence services in this country with
the discovery of something called the Zimmermann telegram. This was a
revelation of a conspiracy in which the Germans had offered, if I
remember correctly, the Mexicans some great tranche 
<?notus-xml column=7?>of US territory if they would co-operate with them in hostilities
against the United States. It was the discovery by the British
intelligence services of that correspondence that finally showed the
Americans where their interests lay and helped to precipitate their
entry into the first world war, from which time the outcome of the
conflict could no longer be in doubt, because arguably—I would
say that it is probably beyond argument—it was the entry of the
United States that forced the Germans to embark on their last-ditch
attempt in March 1918 to break the stalemate on the western
front, and that led to the sequence of events, including the battle of
Amiens later in the year, that ultimately led to the allied
victory.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000045">Similarly,
with regard to the military relationship in the second world war, it is
well known that the Americans helped us with lend-lease. The
“Destroyers for Bases” deal is also well known. These
were all methods of helping the British war effort while the United
States itself was still not a belligerent. Less well known is the
“Shoot at Sight” policy whereby the Americans undertook,
if there were any interference on the high seas by Hitler’s
U-boats, to engage them militarily if they sought to attack convoys
going from the United States to the United
Kingdom.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000046">In
other words, the Americans did, given the limitations of their
constitutional system, everything that they possibly could do to help
Britain in its hour of need until such time as the political situation
in the United States—because it was no easy decision for
them—facilitated the entry of the United States into the war;
and of course to that, the contribution of the Japanese in their
treacherous attack at Pearl Harbor was decisive. Again, once America
had entered the conflict, the outcome could not be in doubt, even
though many months—indeed, several years—of desperate
conflict had to ensue before victory was
obtained.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000047">Scrolling
forward rapidly into the post-war years, we see the occasions on which
Britain backed the American initiative—unusually, for once, with
the support of the United Nations, because the Russians at that time
were not participating in the Security Council—in the Korean
war; but there have been hiccups as well, and this is germane to the
point that my hon. Friend the Member for Lichfield made about not
reading too much into the vote on Syria and the divergence of policy
between the two countries. If people forget everything else in my
contribution, I hope that they will seek to remember this one point.
Even among the closest of allies, there may be genuine disagreements
from time to time. The Americans genuinely disagreed with British
action and French action in Suez in 1956. Harold Wilson genuinely
disagreed with the Americans, and most people think that history has
vindicated him in not joining with the Americans to participate in the
conduct of the Vietnam
war.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000048">As
my hon. Friend eloquently pointed out, there was a genuine disagreement
in this country with the proposal to take military action against the
Assad regime a few weeks ago. So far, although it is far too early to
tell, if the objective of our Government and the American Government
was, as stated, to stop chemical weapons attacks, then as things are
unfolding, we are in a better  
<?notus-xml column=8?>position at the moment to stop chemical weapons attacks than anyone
might have dreamed possible. So at the moment, it looks as though the
system has
worked.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000049">As
my hon. Friend rightly stated, it was fascinating and entirely
praiseworthy that having seen what the British Government had done in
putting the matter to Parliament, and knowing that there was just as
much disquiet in American public opinion as there was in British public
opinion, President Obama decided to do the same thing by putting the
matter to Congress. That is where it would have lain, but for
the—what shall we say?—fortunate slip of the tongue by
Secretary of State Kerry when he said, “Well, of course, if
Assad doesn’t wish to be attacked, he could always offer to give
up his chemical arsenal.” Never have words made off the cuff and
in such an offhand fashion borne such fruit. Perhaps our diplomats and

often in the

between the UK and the US at its most interesting. Ambassador Jeane
Kirkpatrick was wholly hostile to the British position over the
Falkland Islands, while Secretary of Defence Caspar Weinberger was very
sympathetic. In the end, the Weinberger view prevailed with President
Reagan. It is now widely acknowledged that the covert assistance that
the Americans supplied to the British, particularly in the field of
intelligence, was of great value to the country and to our campaign,

of the successor submarines that will carry the next generation of the

UK’s nuclear deterrent, assigned as it is to duties in NATO but

scratchy, ungrateful or divergent moments. As I have said, however,
when things really matter, we know that we can always count on each

will tell whether I am right, but I suspect that it will not be too
long before the American Administration agree that things have worked
out for the better. For many years, the Americans have done us a favour
by making it possible for us to maintain an ultimate minimum strategic
deterrent as a final insurance policy to ensure that our country can
never be blackmailed by people armed with nuclear weapons. The benefits
for both sides are beyond question. Long may the relationship flourish,
long may it continue and long may it survive attempts to undermine it

I have visited the United States several times on holiday, but this

through the whole history of the United States, we in that wee province

the history of our relationship with the United States, we can claim
many things, such as that some US musical interests largely came from
Northern Ireland. The ancestors of Elvis Presley were Ulster Scots, so
we as Ulster Scots can claim part of the musical cultural history in
the United States. The NASCAR—National Association for Stock Car
Auto Racing—car championships that we can sometimes watch on
television was started by another Ulster Scot, although it probably
began at a certain whisky-running time, which might be why the cars
were so fast. Ulster Scots therefore have that ancestry and historical

of the greatest US writers can also claim to be Ulster Scots and
therefore part of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern
Ireland, as can be shown by their ancestry and history. The Ulster
Scots—or the Scots-Irish, as they are often known in

civil war. Ulster Scots, who are very much a fighting breed,
contributed greatly to the United States through their pioneering
traits, such as exploring and setting up cities and towns across the

appetite for it, but also that the best approach was what we are now

the post-imperial League of Empire Loyalists tendency—it is now
less strong in the Conservative party, but it still exists—who
really resent the change in the balance of forces, although that change

Spellar:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Gentleman for that comment.
However, people often talk about a party taking one position or
another, but, in reality, there is always a balance of opinion within a
party. The difference is that the balance shifts. The Labour party did
not overwhelmingly go from being unilateralist to multilateralist. The
balance shifted from being 55:45 one way to 55:45 the other way, so
there were always many colleagues on both sides of the argument still
holding those views. Indeed, as we saw recently in the debate on
Trident, there was a strong level of agreement between the two serious
parties in this Parliament on the importance of maintaining a nuclear
deterrent at the minimum level necessary. Furthermore, as he rightly
stressed, there was an understanding of the importance of our
transatlantic relationship in ensuring the effectiveness and
cost-effectiveness of that
deterrent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000083"><B><Member ContinuationText="Dr Julian Lewis" PimsId="1486" UID="1310083000179" xid="358" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000179">Dr

given that even the Liberal Democrats now claim to want to have two

important that, in such difficult times, we focus on not just current
issues and interests, but values, culture and language that have bound
us over generations. Of course such a discussion will focus to some
extent on our joint military actions, especially in two world wars, and
the vital role played by our shared intelligence capabilities, which
are crucial to the security of this country, especially in a world
where all of us face threats from international and internal terrorism.
We should also focus on the way in which we have drawn on each other on
constitutional issues, our legal framework, common law and political
issues. Sometimes such issues start in one state in the United States
or in the UK and then become part of a common dialogue, driven even
more now by the advent of the internet, which allows people readily to
access such arguments. Furthermore, both of our countries have,
separately and in international forums, campaigned round the world for
freedom of the seas, free trade, free speech and free

Spellar:</Member></B> Yes. Even in today’s newspaper, we read
about Britain’s cultural export of television programmes. Some
£450 million is coming into this country, which is probably
balanced, and rightly so, by quite a lot going in the other direction,
from TV shows being taken by the United States. There is no need to
recite and revisit all the statistics that were quoted by the hon.
Member for Lichfield, as we can all see them in everyday business.
Again, such trade is not a recent phenomenon. Look at the firms that
are seen to be longstanding British companies. Vauxhall, for example,
which is actually expanding its production in Ellesmere Port and
bringing in new models, has been under the ownership of General Motors
for nearly a century now. It is a significant long-term interest, and
not just a recent
phenomenon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="1310083000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000090">Of
course that does not mean that there is always complete concurrence of
views or interests between the UK and the US. Geography determines
history and influences politics. Sometimes, though, individuals and
groups on both sides of the Atlantic seek to exaggerate such
differences, but those differences have been there all the way through
the relationship. Read the masterly work of Alan Bullock on the life of
Ernest Bevin and his period as Foreign Secretary. Huge amounts have
been done between our countries, such as the Marshall plan and the
foundation of NATO. The Marshall plan, which might have been a casual
remark by a US Secretary of State and then picked up very effectively
by the British Foreign Secretary, transformed the economic outlook for
Europe and highlighted graphically the whole difference of approach
between the United States and the Soviet Union in their views on how
Europe could develop at the end of the cold war. It was an argument
that the Anglo-American alliance clearly won. In those discussions,
there were some significant differences and real arguments. The fact
that one is a long-term ally and friend does not mean that one does not
fight one’s corner. Indeed it is a derogation of duty not to
fight for one’s own interest, but it should be done within the
right framework and context. Such a stance can be seen in a number of
international forums, such as in the permanent five of the United
Nations, where we work enormously effectively together, the G8, the G20
and NATO. We are seeing it in the discussions that are taking place
over the transatlantic trade and investment partnership and also in the
discussions on the trade in services agreement.</hs_Para>

areas in which domestic interest lobbies will want to push a particular
point of view. In some cases, they will need to be fought for strongly
and in other cases there will need to be trade-offs. None the less,
they indicate strongly the main thrust, which is to try to bring about
the reduction of trade barriers across the world, the increase in world
trade and the growth that arises from the ability of companies and
individuals to exploit their talents, innovations and improvements to
sell in a wider market. That is an enormously important role. There is
the question of whether those trade 
<?notus-xml column=15?>negotiations will, to some extent, undermine the World Trade
Organisation. There is a wider agreement that, if agreement cannot be
brought to a conclusion, as was the case after the Doha rounds, it
would be extremely welcome if there could be this development in
freeing up world trade, taking into account the interests and views of
other countries—a development in which the roles of the United
Kingdom and the United States are not only consistent but working well
together.</hs_Para>

some—the hon. Member for Lichfield veered towards this, or
tiptoed towards it—who will try to pose this issue as a
dichotomy; they will say that Britain must either be allied with the
United States or be part of the EU. In Winston Churchill’s
words, we must either look to “Europe” or to “the
open sea”. Of course, it was quite interesting that in that
quote Churchill
said:</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="1310083000140" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#1310083000140">“If

Churchill, the careful use of words: “If Britain must
choose”. However, this is not a choice that we have to make,
because it has never been the view of the US that it should just have a
bilateral relationship with Britain to the exclusion of its
relationships with Europe. Right the way through—indeed, it goes
back to the Bevan discussions—there has always been an
encouragement from the US for Britain to be involved in and to have a
beneficial effect on debates in Europe. Also, at the time of the
Marshall plan, when the future of Europe was in the balance, it was
absolutely vital that Britain was part of that European economic
revival and not standing outside Europe while the future of Europe fell
to the Soviet Union to decide.</hs_Para>

Lewis:</Member></B> The right hon. Gentleman refers to that period in
the immediate post-war years, and I do not think that the harshest
Eurosceptic would dispute the fact that Britain needed to be involved
then. However, surely that period also shows that it is possible to be
heavily involved in shaping the future of Europe without being a member
of a European Union.</hs_Para>

Spellar:</Member></B> Actually, at the time that those discussions were
taking place, there was not a European Union; there was not even a
European Coal and Steel Community. When President Obama launched the
transatlantic trade and investment partnership
talks—unfortunately, the latest discussion this week had to be
postponed because of events in Washington—he made it clear that
the likely time scale for securing a trade agreement would not be
possible with a multiplicity of individual countries. Therefore, in
bringing together the two major trading areas of the world, it is not
in the interests of the United States for one of them to be broken up
and divided.</hs_Para>

enough, that is the view not only of the United States but of Japan,
another major trading partner of ours and a massive investor in this
country. The Japanese also see our engagement in Europe as part of
their investment in the UK; they use the UK as their base within
Europe. Also, earlier I mentioned Australian business, and the Japanese
view is exactly the view of the Australian business community too.
Therefore, the attempt to create a sharp dichotomy between the two and
to make it a binary choice between them—either 
<?notus-xml column=16?>involvement with the United States or with Europe—is not only a
false choice but a choice that is not welcomed by our

I have never said, nor do I think that others think, that there is
mutual exclusivity. I was referring to the document produced by the
United States International Trade Commission, which investigated
whether it would be beneficial for the North American Free Trade
Agreement if the UK was a member. It took the view that the UK could
only be a member if we were to leave the EU. We may or may not have a
referendum on this issue in 2017; I hope that we will. But the UK is a
global trading nation, and that includes trading with Europe as well as
with the United States and Australia. The US and the EU are not
mutually exclusive. And while we are bandying around Churchill quotes,
I will just throw this one in. He said that the UK is in Europe

he has been here. As my hon. Friends the Members for Lichfield, and for
New Forest East (Dr Lewis), have pointed out, this is a
morning debate, held on the day on which the House is returning from a
lengthy recess for the party conferences, and the main Chamber does not
sit until this afternoon, hence the poor attendance at this debate. I
just say to the American ambassador, if he is attending this debate or
listening to it in any way, that that is no reflection of
parliamentarians’ interest in the US; nor is it an indication of
complacency about the relationship. It is purely a question of timing

prosperity and our defence capability. It is a relationship from which
the UK continues to benefit. We have heard historical allusions to the
pre-war, first-world-war and post-war periods—my hon. Friend the

the crisis in Syria. We are focused on getting the international
community to unite to bring all sides together to achieve the political
solution that is needed to end the conflict. We worked closely with the
United States and others to ensure the passage of the recent

boosts the economies of both the EU and the US, as our biggest trading

Brown</B> (West Ham) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to serve under
your chairmanship, Mr Dobbin, and to welcome the colleagues who are
here to support the debate. I am delighted at the opportunity to talk
about and commemorate the strike and consequent achievements of the
match women of the Bow Bryant &amp; May factory in July 1888, 125 years
ago. I grew up with their story, living, as I did, in a working-class
home within walking distance of the factory in east
London.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000005">In
my research in preparation for the debate, and in thinking about why we
should mark that defining event in the history of the women’s
and trade union movements, I was interested to note a recent
publication by Kate Adie, the former BBC chief news correspondent,
“Fighting on the Home Front”. It is a challenge to what
has been conventional and acceptable in the recording of women’s
roles in wartime, and it represents Ms Adie’s determination that
women should not be written out of the history of the first world war.
She records that the munitions industry depended on nearly 1 million
women workers, and that others toiled as welders, locomotive engine
cleaners, policewomen and taxi drivers, and in many other roles
traditionally reserved for men. Those women and the jobs they did were
visible then, but they are invisible now. Their stories have faded from
the chronicles and histories of that most terrible of wars, the
centenary of the start of which will be marked next year. My purpose in
seeking today’s debate is to help to ensure that the role of the
match women will not be similarly overlooked when we recount the
history of the fight for women’s rights, the struggle to
establish trade unions, and the story of the communities in east
London.</hs_Para>

to deal with a matter of language. Much of the telling of events at
Bryant &amp; May’s factory has referred to match
“girls” and has presented a sentimentalised vision of
young, helpless souls, dependent on the protection of others—who
are, of course, older, wiser and “better” men, as, in the
main, are the historians who tell their stories. So today let us tell
it as it was. Those workers were women with a fight on their hands to
determine their own fate. Yes, some were young; all were working-class;
many were, like my family, of Irish extraction; but they were women,
not girls, and that is how we should see them and talk about
them.</hs_Para>

want to talk about leadership. Many versions of the match
women’s story attribute leadership of the strike to Annie
Besant, whose name is inextricably linked to it. Indeed, the memorial

housing known as the Bow
quarter—confidently</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13100822000217" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000217">“commemorates

Besant was a controversial character and a writer, journalist and
social activist in a variety of causes including women’s rights
and secularism. It is true that her journalism and political activity
played a pivotal role in the tale of the match women and the events
that they precipitated. However, to present her role as one of
leadership of the strike is to fall into the trap of seeing history
solely from the perspective of the middle-class storyteller, and it
frankly does not reflect the reality of 
<?notus-xml column=23?>the events as they unfolded. The women went against the advice of Annie
Besant, who felt that they should not
strike.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000009">I
am most grateful to Louise Raw, whose outstanding work first published
in 2009 documents in fine detail the strike and the events leading up
to it. In “Striking a Light: the Bryant &amp; May Matchwomen and
their Place in History”, she meticulously describes the life and
times of the women who worked at the match factory, and the events that
led 1,400 women to walk out on strike in July 1888 and stay on strike
for more than two weeks, until their demands were met. Ms Raw shows not
only that Annie Besant was not the strike leader, but that she favoured
a boycott by match purchasers rather than direct action. It was the
women themselves who were in charge and who determined that a strike
was necessary. Ms Raw’s work demonstrates clearly that the women
were the leaders of the strike, and her research in the Bryant &amp;
May archive suggests that the names of the strike leaders were Alice
Francis, Kate Slater, Mary Driscoll, Jane Wakeling and Eliza
Martin.</hs_Para>

of the strike, Bryant &amp; May was a household name. It had become the
largest British employer of match workers. The factory was the largest
employer of female casual labour in the east end. Bryant &amp; May had
established a powerful monopoly, taking over rival factories, so that
by 1888 it could pay its workers less than it had 12 years earlier. It
claimed to be paying 10 to 12 shillings a week to
“steady” workers in 1876, but in 1888 the
strike register showed women earning just 2 shillings a week, or about
£12 in today’s
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000011" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000011">Before
considering the strike itself I will remind the House of the inhumane
and dangerous working conditions prevalent at the time, which were
experienced in extreme form by the women working for Bryant &amp; May.
The women worked with white phosphorus, which was known to be extremely
toxic and the cause of phosphorus necrosis or “phossy
jaw”. It caused the development of abscesses filled with
stinking pus in the lower jaw, gums and cheeks with affected tissue
fluorescing with a whitish-green glow. White phosphorus was banned in
Finland in 1872 and in Denmark in 1874. It was still in use in Britain

of the key but relatively small demands of the match women, which the

management’s behaviour towards the workers. Low pay, very long
hours, dangerous machinery, arbitrary fines and even physical abuse
were commonplace. Hearing the grim news of the conditions, Annie Besant
investigated and published a story about them in her weekly newspaper
<I>The Link</I>, headlined “White Slavery in London”,
prompting Bryant &amp; May to threaten her with libel. The company
instigated a witch hunt among the work force and tried to pressure
workers to reveal who had spoken to Besant. It bullied them, depriving
them of work and wages. It was the

members are women, forming a clear majority of the country’s

allegations of bullying and harassment by their employer, Carillion,
followed by allegations that non-white employees had been asked by
their white managers to hand over gifts, including jewellery, in order
to get time off work. Strike action, supported by the GMB, was
successful in exposing such practices and ensuring that Carillion, a
massive outsourcing company, took its workers’ concerns
seriously. The spirit of the match women was alive and well on the
Swindon picket lines as the workers cooked and brought food for each
other, showing mutual support and solidarity in the face of alleged
dubious employment

me, the story involves deep personal memories. My late mother was a
working-class woman from a very poor family in east London, within
walking distance of the Bryant &amp; May factory in Bow. Her education
was disrupted by the second world war, and she left school at 14. When
I was seven, she went to work stacking sugar at the Tate &amp; Lyle
sugar refinery at Silvertown. She joined the union in her first days
there as a matter of course; it was what workers did to protect
themselves and each other. There was never any doubt about it. She was
the daughter of a man who had had to stand on cobblestones begging for
work day after day, week after week and month after month. She
understood what trade unions did to protect workers.</hs_Para>

working life, my mother became a shop steward and fought hard for the
rights of her sisters and fellow workers. I am told that she is
remembered by Tate’s management for her audacity and
strength of purpose. It was she who told me of the inspiration
of the Bow match women. She used their story in her
own way to make the point that leadership in working

Sharon Hodgson</B> (Washington and Sunderland West) (Lab):</Member> I
congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) on her
excellent and moving speech. I am feeling emotional after her final
words. This is an important debate on the history of women in the trade
union movement and politics more generally. My hon. Friend’s

the match girls and women played a formative part in the development of
my political beliefs and eventual political engagement, both as a trade

<?notus-xml column=26?>unionist and later as a politician. At school, during my history
O-level, I remember learning about the terrible conditions endured by
the young women of the Bryant &amp; May match factory in Bow, some of
whom were a lot younger than I was at the time. Those conditions
involved 14-hour days and harsh fines for missed work days, and there
were the terrible health implications of working with white phosphorus,
which led to phossy jaw and blindness, as we heard from my hon.
Friend.</hs_Para>

learning about those extraordinary women and girls and relating their
struggle to my own experience as a working-class girl living and
working in north-east England, I began to understand and appreciate the
necessity for collective action and a strong trade union movement. I
felt that it was a case of “There but for the grace of God go
I”, and I appreciated what they and others had achieved for
people like me. I was poor, but I could still get a good education and
a good job with safe working conditions. My first job was in the office
at a Tyneside glass factory, so the comparison is not so
far-fetched.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend that we should recognise the significant help of Fabian
socialists such as Annie Besant. Ultimately, however, as my hon. Friend
said, that event in our labour history was one of ordinary working
class women collectively organising and acting to change their pay and
working conditions. History is written by the victors, so working class
women have been written out of it regularly, but this was a momentous
victory, although it is still not featured as a significant moment in
our industrial and political history. The match women and girls simply
do not receive the recognition that they
deserve.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000030" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000030">The
late 19th century was a period of fervent political action by workers:
there was the rebirth of the trade union movement that we know today,
following the actions of the Tolpuddle martyrs; the
beginnings of the women’s suffrage movement; and the formation
of the British Labour party. Yet the match women of the east end of
London are regularly overlooked in the history of the period, and their
significance is ignored. Trade unions were not decriminalised in
Britain until 1871, after decades of repression by the
political and industrial elites, but it was the match women and their
collective action in Bow that encouraged other workers in the east end
and the wider country to collectivise and to create trade
unions.</hs_Para>

women standing up to powerful factory owners during a period when women
were largely excluded from public life, and reigniting an appetite for
collective action and trade unionism, is such a significant and
extraordinary feat that we should certainly recognise it. Henry Snell,

organisation in any
country”.</hs_brev><hs_Para UID="13100822000032" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000032">It
certainly had a huge influence on me, and is definitely one of the
reasons why I am standing here today. As we all know, it is important
to understand and recognise our history so that it does not repeat
itself, and the story of the match girls is a part of that tradition.
It is a story that reverberates with us today, both here and
abroad.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000033" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000033">We
hear regular jokes and stories, some emanating from Government, about
health and safety regulations “gone mad”, or the need to
cut the “red tape” put in 
<?notus-xml column=27?>place to improve and protect the working conditions of British workers,
but that prompts the question: where would we be without that
much-maligned red tape, the vast majority of which has been so hard
fought for over the past 100 years? The answer can be seen in
developing countries such as Bangladesh, where, earlier this year, we
saw thousands of women and men dragged, dead and injured, from the
rubble of a collapsed factory used by well-known high street retailers.
A report commissioned by the Bangladesh Government found that there had
been more than 400 violations of work practices and safety standards.
It is not too much of a stretch to say that, were it not for the trade
union movement in this country, the health and safety of British
workers would be similarly
ignored.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000034" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000034">Factory
life in Britain during the industrial revolution was arduous and
back-breaking, but for the men and women working in the coal mines of
the north-east, the cotton mills of Yorkshire, or the matchstick
factories of Bow, trade unions and collective action gave them a voice
when previously they had been voiceless, and that voice won them better
working conditions and a fairer share of the wealth that they were
creating. Whether workers and trade unions in Britain who continue to
fight to improve and maintain those conditions in this country, or
those abroad who are struggling to improve conditions, everyone can
glean inspiration from the match women and girls, who taught us about
the positive impact that collective action, a little tenacity and a lot
of bravery can have. I for one honour their memory, and thank them for
being my inspiration. It is only right that the Government should also
recognise their contribution, and I look forward to the

1888, the match women had few rights at work and even weaker rights as
citizens—the right to vote was still 30 years away for the first
women, and parliamentary democracy as a means of improving the lot of
working people was at a far less advanced stage. As women, the match
women were frowned on for working at all, even though doing so was a
matter of survival. I understand that there was even a sense of shame
about working for Bryant &amp; May, which is ironic and poignant,
considering how proud of those workers many of us are today. The
material poverty and exploitation experienced in everyday life by the
match women was truly shocking. Bryant &amp; May in the late 19th
century was a prime example of what today would be called a flexible
labour market, taken to its ultimate extreme. Today, I am sure that
Bryant &amp; May would be issuing zero-hours contracts to the hilt, and

<?notus-xml column=29?>history, considering how badly the match women were treated in the years
leading up to the 1888 strike at the hands of a company owned and run
by prominent supporters of the Liberal party. Those Liberals imposed
low and falling pay, dangerous working conditions, covered up the
horrendous phossy jaw disease, and had a draconian system of fines.
Their bullying led to the 1888 strike, after they tried to force
workers to denounce Annie Besant’s article. Those were the
employers who docked 1 shilling from the pay of the match women to fund
the statue of Liberal Prime Minister William Gladstone that still
stands today in Bow
road.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000044" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000044">This
episode is heavy with irony. The director running Bryant &amp; May when
the statue was commissioned by Theodore Bryant was one Wilberforce
Bryant, who took over from his Quaker father. As a Hull MP, I am proud
of Hull’s William Wilberforce and his anti-slavery campaign. The
irony of this worst of employers carrying the name Wilberforce is not
lost on
me.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000045" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000045">It
is even more ironic that the poverty pay of the match women was docked
to put up a statute in tribute to William Gladstone. After all, the
Gladstones could easily have financed the statue from the
£93,526 compensation that they received for losing their 2,039
slaves when slavery was abolished. Annie Besant’s famous
“White slavery in London” article in <I>The Link</I>
reported that the match women, given half a day’s unpaid holiday
to attend the unveiling, threw blood on the statue, protesting,
“We paid for it!” If people go down Bow road this
morning, they will see that the hands of that statute are
still red—a great tradition that has been kept
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000046" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000046">These
events go some way to explaining the political climate in which the
Labour party was created a little more than a decade later, and why the
Liberal party could not and would not stand up for ordinary people,
especially women. During the suffragette campaign of 100 years ago, the
Liberal Government introduced the “cat and mouse” Act to
force-feed suffragette political prisoners, including Emily Wilding
Davison. I cannot help but notice that the Liberal Democrats still seem
to have a problem with women. There are still no women Lib Dems in the
coalition Cabinet, and there are more male Lib Dem MPs with knighthoods
and similar titles than Lib Dem women
MPs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000047" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000047">The
victory of the match women inspired the growth of trade union
recruitment among the lowest paid unskilled workers, many of them
women, who had been ignored by trade union leaders throughout the
19th century. Until then, unions were largely only
interested in organising skilled male workers, who were regarded as
more respectable. At the recent match women’s festival, I was
delighted that Frances O’Grady, the first woman general
secretary of the Trades Union Congress, spoke—someone who
represents a positive image of trade unions now, just as the match
women did in
1888.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000048">As
my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham mentioned, by inspiring the 1889
dock strike by male dock workers from the same east end households,
streets and communities, the match women changed trade union history.
Of course, this was acknowledged by dockers’ leaders at the
time, such as John Burns, but then faded from history textbooks until
Louise Raw’s recent research. This new unionism led to historic
political developments, too, as growing working class alienation from
the Liberal establishment set the scene for the creation of
the Labour party in 1900. Anyone who understands 
<?notus-xml column=30?>Labour’s origins is better equipped to answer the current slur
about our being the welfare party, because we are the party of
work.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000049" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000049">Many
men and women who have had such an influence on our history have great
monuments to them. Winston Churchill stands outside the Palace of
Westminster; Emmeline Pankhurst stands next to the House of Lords; and
William Wilberforce looks down from a column 90 feet high in Hull. The
match women are marked only by an inaccurate blue plaque outside the
Bow Quarter in Fairfield road, at the Bryant &amp; May site. Worse
still, round the corner on Bow road stands that statue to the Liberal
politician admired by their employer and paid for by docking the match
women’s pay. Perhaps the Minister for blue plaques, who is here
today, will consider what else he can do to ensure that there is an
appropriate plaque and appropriate recognition of the role played by
these
women.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000050" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000050">Anyone

Dakin</B> (Scunthorpe) (Lab):</Member> It is a pleasure to speak in
this debate. I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham (Lyn
Brown) on setting out the case for these women workers so well and for
placing it in context, then and now. My hon. Friend said that
this was a story that she grew up with. My hon. Friend the
Member for Washington and Sunderland West (Mrs Hodgson)
reminded us that she was taught this story in O-level history lessons.
I, too, first met this story doing O-level history in rural
Leicestershire. A young woman teacher taught us for just one period a
week about the social history of struggle and endeavour across the
ages, and the one bit that I really remember is the match girls’
strike. It was taught as the match girls’ strike, and there was
a romanticism to it. My hon. Friend the Member for West Ham told us the
story through the eyes of the people struggling at the time, thanks to
the excellent work of Louise Raw, in “Striking a Light”,
and
others.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000053">It
is interesting that the way we view history changes over time. None the
less, that story made an impact on me, as a 14-year-old, because it
related to my experiences of visiting my aunties and my father, working
in the densely populated boot and shoe factories in the village of
Sileby, where they all worked and strived to earn the money to bring us
all up—me and my cousins—in our family. The story of
struggle and endeavour in the 1880s struck a chord in respect of the
working conditions of the
1960s.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000054" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000054">My

that can, at its worst, be as it was at Bryant &amp; May in the 1880s.
Currently, 
<?notus-xml column=31?>there are zero hour contracts and the minimum wage,

circumstances in the garment industry in Bangladesh, which had an
immediate influence and an impact on the morale and feelings of people
locally in my constituency, which has a large Bangladeshi population.

that is deplorable. Government Members talk about trade unions as

together? There is nothing sinister or murky in such an approach. We
have had letters about pay and pensions and employment rights. There is
nothing wrong in their writing to us about things that people still
need. Pay inequality still massively exists and we still have health
and safety issues. With the advent of zero-hours
contracts—more and more are being used—workers have no

It represents millions of people: the people who wash our plates, clean
the houses and the streets, and provide the food on our tables. They
are the hard-working people who are members of trade unions and we
should be proud to represent them. They should not be portrayed
—as the Government do, aided by the right-wing media—as
bogeymen and an evil influence in this country. They are not; they are
a force for good. A democratic society needs them. The Labour party is

daughter played the character Louie in “The Matchgirls”
play that was put on by a community association. She had to have
stitched to her head a piece of cloth to give the impression of an

was doing in the Bryant &amp; May factory. I have always been struck by

what that factory was like, whether from photographs or from their
imagination from reading the stories, will know about the working
conditions of women not just in the Bryant &amp; May factories, but
throughout the Victorian era during the industrial revolution. Anyone
who reads Friedrich Engels’s work about the conditions of
workers in Manchester—it was published not when it was written
in 1844, but about 40 years later—will know about the
conditions of millions of people in this country who built our great
cities and our industrial revolution, which made us the workshop of the
world, as was demonstrated in the great exhibition of 1851. Britain
grew economically and prospered on the backs of those
giants—the men and women who built the industrial
revolution—but they did not benefit from it. Their work was
casual, erratic and not permanent. They did not have pensions or
benefit from health and safety legislation and there was no sick pay.
They were on what are now called zero-hours contracts, but in most

we are honest—this is topical—we face today a race to the
bottom. The ideology of the Government, including the Liberal Democrats
who are in up to their necks, is based on a view that we must compete
globally by reducing working conditions in this country so that we can
be more competitive with our European neighbours, and that Europe must
reduce working and living standards to be competitive with the Asian

I watched an interesting programme on television about the largest
container vessel ever built. It is so large that things must be removed
so that it is not 
<?notus-xml column=34?>too high in the water and can go under bridges. It cannot dock in many
places. It comes from China fully laden and goes back three quarters
empty because we are exporting only our waste products and some
specialised equipment, and I am talking not just about Britain. The
programme highlighted our massive trade deficit of billions of pounds
every month. We import from countries where men, women and children are
exploited. In China today and many of its cities the treatment of
workers is comparable with the treatment that men and women in this
country experienced in the 19th
century.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000076" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000076">When
we talk about health and safety, and the protection of workers, it is
important to take a global perspective. I am an internationalist and a
socialist, and I believe in internationalist and universalist values.
It is time that we left the parochial debate about the situation in
this country and raised issues relating to the rights and duties of
global companies that do not pay tax in this country and manufacture
goods in other countries. They work cleverly so that certain large
global corporations have far more power and influence than individual
states, even the most powerful states.</hs_Para>

digress, but that is why we need international co-operation and a
strong European Union that can defend the European social model, stand
up against the global multinationals, and work within the International
Labour Organisation, the World Trade Organisation and the treaties that
we signed with Korea, the United States and other parts of the world
for trade and international co-operation. That should be not a race to
the bottom, which is the agenda of the Conservatives and Liberal
Democrats, but a race to protect and raise the living standards of
people in the countries that we trade with around the world. That is an
argument not for protectionism, but for modern, effective regulation
and globalisation. In this century, we cannot live on the basis of
total deregulation and a race to the bottom. The values of the women in
Bryant &amp; May’s factory 125 years ago are exactly
the same that we should argue for today to protect the women in
factories in China and elsewhere who are working in conditions that are
comparable with what those women were working
in.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000078" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000078">We

organise enough people in this country. Millions of women work as

morning, a lady said that if there is a traffic jam she cannot do her
job when she visits the elderly people she cares for because she runs
late with resulting pressure. That applies particularly in the care
industry. We can do something about that in this country because
contractualisation, privatisation, deregulation and zero-hours
contracts are a race to the bottom. We must do better, and we must all
recognise that that will involve a change in our attitude to the lowest
paid people in our

hon. Friend the Member for West Ham began with a thorough exposition of
the history, and was absolutely right to say that this was an extremely
important episode in the history of women and the trade union movement
in this country. It is easy to think that 125 years ago is a
long time, but it is not so long ago. My father took some nice film of
me when I was a little baby with my great grandmother, who was an exact
contemporary of the women who worked in the Bryant &amp; May factory.
She was sent to school at the age of nine, and she worked in a
Nottingham lace factory. It really is not so long ago that people were
working in those horrendous conditions in this country.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Ilford South is right that the subject was
written about very clearly by Engels, and in fact, the Nottingham lace
factories are described very well in volume I of “Das
Kapital”. I was absolutely delighted when I came across that,
because I knew the truth from my family history. My tutor was also
delighted that he had set a text that resonated so strongly with his
student—the irony was that he was Andrew Glyn from the Glyn
banking family.</hs_Para>

the Government do to recognise the strike? We have heard that we could
have a revision of the blue plaque in the east end, and perhaps the
Minister will say something about that. Perhaps we could have something
in the curriculum. Another cultural artefact that many of us would like
to be covered in the curriculum and that recognises women’s
contributions to the trade union movement is the excellent film,
“Made in Dagenham”. All these feisty women come from the
east end—it is absolutely clear that the heart of radical
feminism is down in the east
end.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000085">In
the north-east, as everybody knows, we have a big Durham miners’
gala, and this year, one of the primary schools in Spennymoor made a
banner to go alongside the banners carried by the former miners. The
banner referred to all the progress in the Factory Acts and in
children’s legislation. Enabling children to understand those
important episodes in British history really makes a significant
difference. I hope that the Minister will say something about the
conversations he will have with his colleagues in the Department for
Education about the curriculum, because that would be another way in
which the Government could recognise the match workers’ strike
of 125 years ago.</hs_Para>

thing that the Minister could do in recognition is take a different
stance on the conditions of workers in the south. As several of my hon.
Friends have mentioned, 
<?notus-xml column=36?>the horrific collapse of the garment factory in
Dhaka, in Bangladesh, is not something about which we can say,
“We are not connected. We are not responsible.” We are
completely connected and bound up with what is going on in other parts
of the world. As a matter of fact, one thing that the European Union
has done is put conditions on Bangladesh that it has to meet if it is
to maintain its duty-free access to our clothing markets. One of the
conditions is that there should be better trade union recognition
rights. The International Labour Organisation is currently working on
that to raise standards in Bangladesh, so that is another thing that
the Minister could take on. He may say, “Well, that is a matter
for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills; it is not my
responsibility”, but let me bring him to his Department and to
another area where labour conditions are on the agenda.</hs_Para>

will be held in Qatar, and as the Minister knows, there is a
huge scandal about the workers who will die in the construction of the
football stadia there. It would be great if we could hear today what
his Department will do about that. What representations has it made to
FIFA on labour conditions in Qatar? This is another episode in which we
can address the issue squarely. We can ask whether it is
acceptable for the World cup to be in Qatar and, if it is to be there,
what standards have to be maintained, or we can pretend that it has
nothing to do with us. We can turn and walk away.</hs_Para>

is not only the Minister for blue plaques, but the Minister for mobile
phones. I do not know whether he has seen the documentary,
“Blood in the Mobile”, but we all have these little
mobile phones. We all tweet, text and have them in our hands all the
time, but many minerals that are used in mobile phones come from the
Democratic Republic of the Congo. The mining of those minerals is
fuelling the conflict in the Congo, and, of course, the labour
conditions are terrible. What transparency is the Minister demanding
from mobile phone companies? What will he do to raise standards in the

the people who made that documentary last week, and while I was there,
I saw the ship to which my hon. Friend the Member for Ilford South
referred. He is absolutely right: instead of addressing the issues,
Ministers are engaging in a race to the bottom. That is why the
struggles of the women whom we are talking about—for free trade
unions, for better health and safety, for better maternity rights, and
all those things—are absolutely relevant, because in this
country today, it is women’s unemployment that has gone up the
most. We now have 1 million women unemployed in this country. We have a
massive gender pay gap. In the private sector, 
<?notus-xml column=37?>the gap between men’s and women’s pay is 14%, and in the
public sector it is 25%. However, if there is one thing I would like
the Minister to do to recognise this strike—one thing that I
think would make a massive difference and bring us bang up to
date—it would be to ensure that the Government do not go ahead
with the 70% cut to funding for the Equality and Human Rights
Commission. Without the proper resources, we cannot enable women to
defend their rights at work as they should be able to.</hs_Para>

to end as I began: by thanking my hon. Friend the Member for West Ham.
This has been an excellent, quite extraordinary, debate. I am grateful
to her for bringing the issue to the attention of the House, and I am
pleased that I have personally been able to contribute. The lessons of
the strike are extremely important, and I salute the women of
Bow.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_08_PT_1/DCBCD5C8CB06183F8D005B0D6EDC54F930D3D613" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="8 October 2013">Tuesday

course, the match girls’ strike was a seminal moment
in trade union history and the history of industrial disputes. It was a
cause célèbre at the time. It was supported by
celebrities on the left. The strike fund was donated to by the Fabian
Society and by luminaries such as George Bernard Shaw, Sidney Webb and
Graham Wallas. It was also supported by the Richard Dawkins of his day,
Charles Bradlaugh, the overtly atheist Member of Parliament, who fought
so hard for his atheist beliefs—if I can put it that
way—that he was imprisoned in the cell in the Houses of
Parliament when he tried, time and again, to affirm rather than to take
the oath. Of course, he was an avowed trade unionist and an avowed
anti-socialist, but I do not think that those two beliefs are
necessarily connected. It is interesting that in the same year in which
he supported the match girls’ strike, he achieved his own

be remedied as swiftly as possible. I am very happy to contact English
Heritage if indeed it is one of its plaques. I am not sure that it is,
but I am certainly happy to discuss with English Heritage in what ways
the strike could be commemorated. Of course, English Heritage runs the

reference to the match women’s strike wrong himself by
mentioning Annie Besant as the leader of the strike. The Minister, when

Friend. He is obviously extremely busy, because he is trying to put
forward very important reforms to our education system to help, funnily
enough, the very poorest in our society, which is his passion. The fact
that too many children are written off at a very young age and told
that they cannot achieve is what he wants to change. It may not be
possible for me to have a meeting with him, but certainly I might write
to him and perhaps the official history of the match girls’
strike, written by Louise Raw, could be made available to him. He is an
assiduous reader. Even in a digital age, if someone stops my right hon.
Friend in the street—as I am sure you know, Mrs Main—they
will find at least 10 and possibly 20 books in his satchel. He is also
a keen historian, although perhaps not in the same league as his new
shadow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000106">Let
me talk more generally about some of the issues to do with heritage,
because this is a timely debate in terms of what the Government want to
do to recognise heritage. I have been given a list of some of the small
grants that have been made to relevant projects by the Heritage Lottery
Fund. Interestingly, we increased the share of the national lottery
money going to the Heritage Lottery Fund from 16% to 20%, so there is
now substantially more funding available for these schemes. Last year,
almost £10,000 was given to Maximal Learning for a seven-month
project to explore the history of the Bryant &amp; May building in Bow,
east London. That project, as I say, will explore the history of the
building. We have also got a huge sum of money—up to
£28 million—for projects to commemorate the
first world war. We have recently given some money to the Charles
Dickens museum, the author’s former Bloomsbury home, as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000107">Most
importantly of all, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for
Culture, Media and Sport announced earlier this month the creation of
an anniversaries fund. That is a fund of £10 million, to which
people who wish to commemorate a significant anniversary can apply.
That is something that is very close to my heart and that I have long
wanted to see come about. Obviously, I was thinking about some of the
big anniversaries that are coming up, such as the celebration of the
800th anniversary of Magna Carta, but there is a general point that is
relevant to this commemoration in Parliament of the match girls’
strike, which is that, as part of our society and as part of community
cohesion, it is important that 
<?notus-xml column=40?>as many people as possible know our history and know the significance of
great events. That includes Magna Carta. It includes the match

it is too late for a group to apply to the Heritage Lottery Fund for
funding to commemorate the match girls’ strike, but it may be

me move on to the subject of health and safety. There were impassioned
speeches from Opposition Members about the importance of maintaining
heath and safety legislation. Again, this subject is close to my heart.
I was struck when I went round the Olympic village before the opening
of the Olympics and was told that it was the first such stadium to be
built without a single fatality. I certainly do not and nor, I hasten
to add, do any of my fellow Ministers come from the school that sees
health and safety as a burden and that does not understand the
importance of health and safety in keeping people safe. However, it is
important that we review regulations and that we strike a balance
between the need to protect people at work and the need not to burden
business
unduly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0001.htm#13100822000110">We
have conducted some key reviews. Professor Löfstedt carried out
an independent review, and of course Lord Young of Graffham carried out
his own review. They found that there was an over-implementation of
health and safety regulation, driven by a fear of the civil
law—a fear of lawyers, who can see an opportunity presenting
itself. There was an opportunity to simplify health and safety
legislation, and by doing so we can improve health and safety. We are,
for example, introducing a register of occupational safety and health
specialists, which will mean that small employers no longer have to
waste time searching for the right person; they will be able to consult
the register to find a specialist. A teacher now has to fill out only
one form when they organise a school trip, so the process is much
easier. We hope that that will encourage more schools to take school
trips. We have also made it easier to make a personal injury claim
through a simplified three-stage process.</hs_Para>

sounds contradictory, the simplification of health and safety
legislation can improve health and safety by encouraging small
businesses to apply health and safety law. We have also made it
absolutely clear that we will not stint on health and safety

shame those who breach health and safety law, and we will make them pay
for follow-up inspections if they are found to be in breach of the
law.</hs_Para>

hon. Member for Faversham and Mid Kent (Hugh Robertson) for his
extraordinary service in that role—service that, if we include

Auckland referred to “Made in Dagenham”, a film about
equal pay by the brilliant British producer Stephen Woolley, which I
would commend to anyone. The soundtrack to the film was sung by Sandie
Shaw, who was a Dagenham Ford clerk but has moved on to greater things
and is now my constituent. <I>[</I><I>Laughter.</I><I>]</I> It does not
get any better than that. The hon. Lady mentioned that a period of more
than a century did not seem like a long time, and it is interesting to
note that 80 years after the match girls’ strike, it was still
perfectly legal to pay a woman less than a man for doing the same work.
The Equal Pay Act 1970 was introduced to tackle that discrepancy, but
such inequalities still exist. Women now make up half of the work force
in Britain, but they are under-represented in senior positions. If we
want to harness the country’s full potential, we must remedy
that imbalance and waste of talent. That is why the Government are
committed to making Britain fairer.</hs_Para>

only read about them in the newspapers, and I hesitate to stray on to
another Department’s policy area by expressing an opinion about
whether new regulations should be introduced concerning transparency
and mandatory reporting. As the hon. Lady knows, the Consumer Affairs
Minister, the hon. Member for East Dunbartonshire (Jo Swinson) is
passionately committed to tackling the problem, which is why she spoke

to see that my right hon. Friend the Minister for Schools survived

want to talk about the importance of governors and governance, and to
say that I enormously appreciate all that governors do. It is a tribute
to our national life that 200,000 people are able and willing to serve
as governors on our school and college governing bodies, and we should
all thank them enormously. I have been a governor of several schools
and colleges, so I know about the stresses and strains, the sometimes
unsocial hours and the sense of accountability and responsibility that
they normally feel: I have been there and done
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000125" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000125">I
am pleased that there is an appetite for debate about school governors
and governance. I was particularly glad that the Select Committee on
Education, under the chairmanship of my hon. Friend the Member for
Beverley and Holderness (Mr Stuart), agreed to hold an inquiry on
school governance. That inquiry exposed some interesting issues that I
want to discuss, although I will not do so in a detailed or completely
comprehensive way. The inquiry certainly raised a few interesting
issues, and the Government have responded. They were sometimes in
agreement with the Committee, and sometimes less so, but they always
considered what we said, which is a tribute to the Select Committee
process.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000126">The
context of this debate is straightforward, in that we are experiencing
and will continue to experience a changing structure of education,
because more and more academies are coming on stream and there is more
competition. Of course, the arrival of free schools will be a key
factor in accountability as regards the role of governors and school
governance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000127" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000127">Another
key issue that informs the debate is the need to focus on performance
and outcomes. Never before has the education system been in a situation
where performance and outcomes are so pivotal to the debate, which is
quite right, because it is absolutely essential to give every child a
proper chance and a fair opportunity to perform as best he or she can.
Nothing less than that will
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000128" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000128">The
changing role of local authorities is another factor, on which we will
touch throughout this debate. That factor should be recognised, because
schools often used to have the local authority to help them along or to
deal with issues, but schools are now more autonomous, and with that
autonomy comes more
responsibility.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000129" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000129">There
are also challenges, including the issue of children who are not
necessarily best dealt with or given the best chances in
their schools. That was brought out extraordinarily well by the chief
inspector of schools and colleges, Sir Michael Wilshaw, in his report,
“Unseen children”. We cannot allow that to happen. As
people interested in education, we must drive forward
the  
<?notus-xml column=44?>highest standards across our whole country, not just where something
happens to be relevant to an individual MP. We must ensure that
delivery is good all
over.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000130">That
point is reinforced by the chief inspector’s focus on leadership
and management in schools. I will not talk about individual
schools—that would be inappropriate but I will say that where we
have good leadership and management in schools, we have a good chance
of having schools that are good and have high standards of teaching and
learning. That is what we should talk about in the context of school
governors and
governance.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000131">I
pay tribute to my colleagues on the Education Committee, first for
agreeing to do a report on school governance and secondly for
contributing to that report, because we had some lively
debates—quite rightly. The report was important as another way
of keeping the question of school governance and governors
on the agenda, which we must do. As I have said,
the structure of education is evolving, and one question that we must
tease out is how we deal with accountability, in which school governors
of course have a role to
play.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000132">In
the Select Committee, we discussed in detail some issues that are
relevant to this debate—for example, the size of school
governing bodies. It is generally accepted that smaller committees
sometimes achieve more than larger ones, partly because they are more
dynamic and tend to rely more on individuals with specific gifts. We
should therefore try to streamline governing bodies into smaller ones,
so that they can be more dynamic, flexible and innovative. The
Government agree, but it is important to make it absolutely clear why
smaller governing bodies will improve performance and, to underpin
that, the Government must be strong in making sure that governing
bodies get that

Carmichael:</Member></B> I can do so, because the Education Committee
looked into that issue, and if people read the report, they will see
that answers to many of the questions I asked yield such evidence. We
need to look at that evidence when we consider questions like the one
asked by my hon. Friend, the Chairman of the Committee. That dynamic
can be seen at work not just in school governing bodies, but often on
company boards and in other
organisations. It works, and it should be
considered.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000135" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000135">The
role of business is very important. That arises in relation to the
question of why we do not have the best interface between business and
education, which is a general problem. For example, it is certainly a
worry that only 28% of A-levels are in STEM subjects—science,
technology, engineering and maths—when the business community is
seeking a bigger pool of STEM-educated children and
students.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000136" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000136">Another
issue is why more businessmen are not on school governing bodies,
increasing that interface and bringing in leadership and management
expertise. The Government have recognised that the Select Committee is
right on that count, and we must ensure that we start to break down
some of the barriers. The Government  
<?notus-xml column=45?>are right, and I hope that they will persist with the idea of creating a
legal requirement to give people time off for service on a governing
body.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000137" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000137">I
will finish by raising several points. The first is that we must
strengthen the mechanism for imposing interim executive
boards—IEBs—when schools are identified as failing. I
believe that if an Ofsted inspection finds that a school is in serious
trouble, there may well be a case for having an IEB, and the Select
Committee suggested that Ofsted should be able to use its powers to
impose one. The Government have said that there are other ways of
solving the problems. If a school is in a federation or some other
structure, they might get some assistance. None the less, we need to
send a signal that setting up an IEB might just be the right option. It
will not be right in every case or in every situation—for
example, when a primary school is allied to another school—but
it is certainly right for a secondary school that is failing in an
obvious
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000138">There
needs to be a pool of governors on those IEBs. Too many areas of the
country do not have a sufficiently large pool of good people to be on
IEBs. We need to redouble our efforts to find and properly train
people. One structure that could solve that problem is the National
College for Teaching and
Leadership.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000139"><Member ContinuationText="Jenny Chapman" PimsId="5530" UID="13100822000270" xid="1062" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000270"><B>Jenny

touch on sub-regional structures, academy chains and other such
structures that one might expect to find when schools collaborate.
Collaboration certainly does make a difference. I suggest that some
formal federal structure might be the answer in many situations. Mutual
help, by which I mean learning best practice from others, getting
support when there is a problem and being able to reach out for expert
help, is really important. I accept the point that has just been made.
I would even go further and say that the Government might want to
consider making sub-regional structures more formal where that is
appropriate. A horizontal or vertical structure, or a combination of
both, is a good way of ensuring that the best leadership is available
to schools. That applies to rural areas where there is a variety of
smaller schools, or to a secondary school with a number of feeder
schools.</hs_Para>

relates to the question of skills versus stakeholders. The Select
Committee talked about that in some detail. It was right to do so, not
least because I encouraged it to take on the issue. It has always
concerned me that if schools are boxed in with certain stakeholders on
their governing bodies, they might not be able to reach out for the
appropriate skills. I have never been completely satisfied that all
stakeholders are accountable to the body that appointed them or that
they represent, so calling them stakeholders is, in some cases, an
exaggeration. The Government need to focus on getting 
<?notus-xml column=46?>the right skills, and all barriers to that should be
removed, which means that there should be considerably less focus on
stakeholders and more focus on skills. I call on the Government to

become governors. We do not want to frighten them off, and good
training is critical. The Education Committee has made some powerful
recommendations on training, which the Government have largely
accepted. The National Governors Association has constantly talked
about the importance of training. I want also to highlight the work of
the all-party parliamentary group on education governance and
leadership, which has produced 20 questions that feature in a number of
reports, including those of the Wellcome Trust and our Select
Committee. Those 20 questions include a reminder that we should focus
on the training of governors. We must ensure that those training
packages are up to scratch and relevant to the challenges of governance

looking to work with other business organisations. We have a real
problem with careers advice and guidance in schools. We know that we
need to ensure that careers understanding is embedded across the
curriculum. What better way to do that than by having governors from
business bringing their understanding of local and national business to
the governing body? There is a real opportunity for business
organisations to stand behind those individual governors, and to
provide them with resources, tools and a template to ensure that their
school provides a curriculum and an experience that provides young
people with the skills—soft as well as academic—that they
need. There is a tremendous opportunity to strengthen our governing
bodies and better to align our education system with the world of work

me consider the core functions of governing bodies. In our view,
high-quality governance is characterised by a relentless focus on three
core strategic functions: first, setting the vision of the school;
secondly, holding the head teacher and senior managers of the school to
account for their educational performance; and thirdly,
ensuring—of course—that the school’s money is well
and properly spent.</hs_Para>

functions reflect the criteria that Ofsted inspectors use when
considering the effectiveness of governing bodies. All governing
bodies, in both maintained schools and academies, should focus on these
functions, leaving the senior leadership team responsible and
accountable for the day-to-day management of the school. They should
stay focused on these big issues and other specific statutory duties,
and avoid being distracted by the myriad other things that might
compete for their attention.</hs_Para>

that governing bodies are best placed to determine how to carry out
their strategic functions, and their approach needs to reflect their
own specific local circumstances and should be guided by Government
only when that is genuinely necessary. That is why we have already
reduced prescription and cut back on some of the unnecessary
regulations that exist. Our ambition is that all governing bodies are
made up of people who have the necessary skills and competencies to
carry out effectively the demanding strategic functions that I have
just outlined.</hs_Para>

colleague in the Department, the Under-Secretary of State with
responsibility for schools, Lord Nash, has said on previous occasions,
in our view it is right that governors should be volunteers but they
cannot afford to be amateurs in an area that is so critically
important. We need to professionalise the quality of school governance,
so that sitting on a board of governors is seen as being akin to the
strategic responsibility of sitting on the board of a company or of a
charity.</hs_Para>

governing bodies identify explicitly the skills and competencies they
need, and regularly audit the skills of their current members. They
actively seek to recruit new governors and to invest in the
professional development of their existing members, to address any gaps
that might exist. Because governing bodies are best placed to determine
the types of skills and people they need, we have given them more
flexibility to decide for themselves the number and mix of governors
that they need. Maintained school governing bodies can opt to
reconstitute under new regulations, which my hon. Friend the Member for
Stroud will know we introduced last year. Those new regulations allow
the governing bodies to be smaller and more skills-focused, which is
something I think my hon. Friend supports and which he has raised with
my colleague, Lord Nash, on previous occasions.</hs_Para>

updated our model documentation, to give academies themselves much
greater freedom in how they constitute their governing
bodies. While our priority  
<?notus-xml column=49?>is to give governing bodies the freedom to decide their size for
themselves, our view is that governing bodies should be no bigger than
they need to be to secure all of the crucial skills necessary for
effective governance. In our view, it is not helpful to have anyone on
a governing body who is in a passive or inactive role. In general, we
think that smaller governing bodies are likely to be more dynamic and
effective, as shown by the success of many of the tightly focused
interim executive boards and by the testimony of many
academy sponsors who need to reform the unwieldy governance in
the schools they inherit. However, I will also accept the
challenge put by the Chairman of the Education Committee, and the view
taken by the Committee in its report, when I acknowledge that
ultimately it is the quality of these individuals, rather than counting
heads, that is particularly important.</hs_Para>

the core functions that I have outlined, governing bodies should not
necessarily see themselves as the primary vehicle for ensuring
meaningful engagement with parents and other stakeholders. It is vital
that the governance of the school is informed by the views of parents,
and for that to be done well it requires dedicated and appropriate
arrangements. So, while there are still rules that governing bodies
need to follow on how they are constituted, the emphasis should be on
recruiting governors for the skills that they can individually
contribute. After all, all governors—no matter what constituency
they are drawn from—are there, once they are around the table,
to govern in the interests of pupils and not primarily to play a
representative role.</hs_Para>

groups of schools can be highly effective, and it can also bring many
benefits. In particular, it can help to drive up standards by enabling
governing bodies to compare and contrast across schools, thereby
creating more robust accountability. It can also enable highly skilled
governing bodies to have an impact in more schools. We in the
Department encourage governing bodies to put aside any issues of
territorialism, and to consider—where it is
appropriate—forming a single governing body across a federation
of schools. Alternatively they can, of course, consider a multi-academy
trust or an umbrella trust, which benefit from the greater freedoms of
academy status.</hs_Para>

about what happens when there are issues or problems, I need to address
the importance of governing bodies striving for continuous improvement,
and the ways that we are helping them to improve. To achieve the very
best for the children in their school, every governing body needs to
reflect regularly on its effectiveness and performance, and governing
bodies should not be shy of paying for high-quality training and
development to help improve their skills and effectiveness. There are
many options, including the expanding offer from the National College
for Teaching and Leadership. As my hon. Friend the Member for Stroud
will know, the NCTL has also developed the national leaders of
governance programme to provide free peer mentoring support for chairs.
We are looking to develop the number of NLGs, with another
150 being selected this year.</hs_Para>

the appropriate response, which will not always be the need for an

these uncertain times, when it can be difficult to find a good
employer, and a good employee pension is even more difficult to find,
many could be forgiven, as in the past, for counting on their state
pension—an agreement they believe will deliver on their regular
contributions. “Thank goodness,” they might think,
trusting that all those deductions from their pay over the years will
finally secure a reasoned and equal pension in retirement. They could
never have foreseen or taken into account the
Government’s recent pension reforms, which many believe to be
unfair. I am, of course, talking about the reforms to the state pension
age, and particularly how those reforms have disproportionately
affected women born in the early
1950s.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000174" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000174">The
Government’s intention was to introduce a single-tier state
pension from April 2017, but as the Minister will be aware, in this
year’s Budget that date was brought forward to April 2016. I
accept that that is good news for thousands of women, but it still
excludes the group on which I am focusing. I believe we all welcome the
single-tier pension, but there is one major injustice that can be
identified within that new system. Implementing the single-tier pension
on 6 April 2016 means that there is a group of women born between 6
April 1951 and 5 April 1953 who will not be eligible for the
single-tier pension, even though a man born on the same day will
qualify, because the pension age will be unequal on implementation day

Government’s changes to the state pension have consistently hit
hard-working women, and now the single-tier pension will let down
700,000 women across the UK. That is simply not good enough, and it is
unacceptable to that group of women. For the single-tier pension to be
successful and to achieve its designated goal of equality, it should
treat women and men of the same age equally. When the
Government’s White Paper was originally published, my hon.
Friend the Member for Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and Kirkintilloch East
(Gregg McClymont) was quick to spot the issue. He identified that, as a
result of the 2017 implementation date, 429,000 women will not receive

out on in these tough financial times. Those women are rightly angry at
what they see as the dual adverse impact of an increase in their
pension age and their non-eligibility for the single-tier pension. I
have met many of the affected women in my constituency, and they have
expressed their dismay and disgust at the policy. Possibly the phrase
that best describes the fate of those women is “So near, yet so
far away.” How would the Minister and his Government colleagues

they hoped and expected to receive their state pension at the age they

will be financially worse off than a man of the same age. He also
stated that 90% of those women would fare better because women live
longer. It is a weak point for the Government to claim that those women
may recoup the money they lose out on because women live longer. Life

life expectancy than in other parts of the

hazardous than the industries of the past. The electronics industries,
however, still exact a health toll on my constituents and reduce the
longevity of the women who transferred their skills from the mills,
sugar refineries and shipyards to the sunrise electronics industries of
the 1980s and 1990s. Those women might have worked alongside chemicals,

Angela was born on 26 March 1953. Her retirement plans have changed
drastically, as she will not reach pensionable age until 6 March
2016—four weeks before the introduction of the single-tier
pension. Angela will now work until she is 62 years and 11
months old, and she will receive the old pension figure of
approximately £127 a week. She will be £884 a year worse
off than a woman born just 10 days later. For her, it is truly a case

away.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000186" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000186">Let
me also highlight the case of Angela’s friend, Mrs
Maureen Hamill, who is also a constituent. Maureen is a hard-working
self-employed local business woman. She was born on 27 March 1953, and
her retirement plans, like Angela’s, have changed drastically.
Maureen is on her feet all day and works long hours. She does not have
the luxury of reducing her working hours, which means that if she is
unable to work, her business closes. Despite all that, Maureen will
also be excluded from the single-tier pension. Again, she seems to have
been born too early, to be retiring too late and to be £884 a
year worse off. We can see a pattern forming: so near, yet so far away.
I hope the Minister will agree that that does not sound like the fairer
system his Government promised.</hs_Para>

Maureen are no different from the hundreds of thousands of other women
from across the country whom I could have mentioned. As with many women
close to retirement age, every pound is important to them in these

inequality for the women I have talked about? I urge the Minister and
the Government to think about the examples of Angela and Maureen

start by addressing some of the factual errors in what the hon.
Gentleman said. I believe that he was speaking in good faith, but some
of the central arguments he advanced were factually wrong, and it is
important to get the facts on the record. He talked of the 700,000
women who were born between 6 April 1951 and 5 April 1953,
and I am pretty sure he said that the Government had put their pension
age up; in fact, he probably said it several times. However, this
Government have not put their pension age up at all—that is a
statement of fact. The Pensions Act 1995 began the process of
equalising the pension ages of men and women at 65 over the decade from
2010 to 2020. The increase in pension age beyond 60 for these women was
therefore legislated for in 1995. It was not a short-notice change,
although I accept that some women did not know about it, and not
everybody heard about it at the time. Although it was all
over the papers at the time, these women were a long way from pension
age and probably turned the page when they saw the word
“pension”, so I accept that some women did not know about
this. However, the idea that these women have had a short-notice change
to their pension is completely factually incorrect; they have not, and
their pension age was set 18 years ago. It is important to put that on
the record.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100822000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000191">The
Government have indeed changed some pension ages for women who reach
pension age after 6 April 2016, and every woman for whom we have
increased the state pension age will get the single-tier pension. There
are therefore two sets of women: those who will not get the single
tier, but whose pension age has not increased beyond that which was
legislated for 18 years ago, and those who have had a further increase,
but who will get the single tier.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100822000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000192">The hon.
Gentleman said that we should treat men and women the same, but he will
understand that men and women have different state pension ages. Under
the previous plans, that would have continued until 2020, and under our
plans, it will continue until 2018. If we treated men and women the
same in relation to single tier, it would be hard to argue that we
should not treat them the same in relation to state pension age. It
would be hard to say that men get single tier but have to wait until
they are 65, while these women do not get single tier but can get a
pension at 63 or earlier. It would be hard to say that these women
should have the good bit of the deal—the single tier—but
not the bad bit that the men have.</hs_Para>

the nub of the hon. Gentleman’s point about his constituents. I
entirely accept that many of them have worked in physically demanding
jobs and may therefore have reduced life expectancy. As a result,
however, being treated as a woman and getting a pension 
<?notus-xml column=55?>at 61 is far better than being treated as a man. If, hypothetically, I
accepted the hon. Gentleman’s argument, and we said to every one
of these 700,000 women, including his constituents, “It’s
not fair. You can have men’s rules, not women’s
rules,” we would make those women wait up to an extra four years
for their pensions. Given everything the hon. Gentleman has said about
their likely life expectancy, that would be absolutely perverse. It is
dreadful that these women have a reduced life expectancy to the extent
that they do, but given that they do, it is far better for them to have
the women’s rather than the men’s state pension regime.
The comparison with men does not, therefore, help the hon.
Gentleman’s case.</hs_Para>

Gentleman compared someone—he gave the example of
Angela—who reaches state pension age just before April 2016 with
someone who reaches it just after. He came up with a figure of
£884, and it took me a while to work out where he got it from.
He compares £127, which is the pension of someone such as
Angela, with £144, which is the single tier, and he multiplies
the difference by 52—I think that is where he gets
his number from. However, that is not the right comparison.
The reason someone such as Angela gets £127 is that, on average,
women get smaller pensions than men, and they have fewer qualifying
years and less from the state earnings-related pension scheme. Even if
we apply the single-tier rules to someone with Angela’s
contribution history, therefore, she would not get £144 on
average, because she would get about another £6 a week, not
another £17. The hon. Gentleman therefore trebles the difference
that the single-tier calculation would make. That is the second thing
to say.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13100822000195" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000195">The third
thing is that there is an issue about people qualifying just before and
just after midnight on 5 April 2016. However, in general, the 700,000
women the hon. Gentleman discusses will, on average, draw their
pension—yes, it may be £6 a week less—for anything
between two and four years longer than a man born on the same day.
Indeed, women who reach pension age after April 2016, who he feels are
treated favourably relative to the 700,000 he talks about, will have
state pension ages of 63, which will soon rise to 64, then to 65 and
then to 66 not longer after that. With their slightly younger sisters,
I take the point that there is the “minute to midnight, minute
after midnight” issue, as there inevitably is with any change,
but the next cohort of 700,000 women and the cohort after that will
overwhelmingly have to wait many years longer for their pensions. It is
therefore quite hard to argue that the 700,000 women the hon. Gentleman
is talking about are in some sense uniquely discriminated against, when
another 700,000 who are coming down the track will have to wait years
longer for their pensions, and when their older sisters had a tougher
regime previously. Let me explain what I mean by that.</hs_Para>

women the hon. Gentleman is talking about get a full basic state
pension for 30 years of contributions or credits, but a woman who
reached state pension age just before 6 April 2010 needed 39
years. Constituents who are just a couple of years older than the women
he is speaking for might well be aggrieved that their younger sisters,
who he feels have had a rough deal, get a pension after 30 years, when
they had to do 39 years. He talked about hard-working women in his 
<?notus-xml column=56?>constituency, but how does the woman who retired on 5 April
2010, after 39 years, feel about the woman who retires on 6 April 2010
and who gets a full pension after 30 years? She might well be very
aggrieved.</hs_Para>

think, broadly speaking, that reducing the number of years required was
a move in the right direction. We have balanced things up in the single
tier. The reduction from 39 years was a good thing, but that was a
cliff edge too—much more of a cliff edge than what we are doing
in 2016, because that reduction was pure windfall: from 6 April 2010,
it was 30 years, not 39, for a full pension, and there was virtually no
transition and no difference in state pension age to speak of. If we
put the pre-April 2016 women through the new system, on average they
get £6 a week more—we think the figure will be about
that. However, on average, those 700,000 women are working fewer years
than the post-2016 women, because state pension ages have been going
up. That seems broadly fair, in my
judgment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000198" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000198">The
hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon) raised the issue of
women’s longer working lives, and asked whether that was bad new
for the young unemployed. That is an argument that we hear a lot. This
country and other countries have tried pensioning off older workers. In
the 1980s we had something called the job release scheme, for example,
which tried to do that. All that it did was put lots of men in their
early 60s on pension, while it did nothing for youth unemployment. On
the whole, young unemployed people are not very good substitutes for
the recently retired. They do not slot into the vacancies. I appreciate
that it could be argued that everyone would move up, but the evidence
is that the older worker, on average, is a highly productive, valuable
member of the work force. Pensioning off older workers who still make a
contribution means that the economy as a whole suffers. The Institute
for Fiscal Studies considered schemes for getting rid of older workers
and encouraging younger workers in countries across the developed
world, and there is no evidence that the younger workers benefit from
pensioning off the older ones. If anything, the evidence is that the
economy benefits from older workers, and that young people benefit,
too.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000199" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000199"><B><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13100822000285" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000285">Jim

productivity, skills and experience of the older worker. If that worker
has not been adding anything to the firm, then fine—get rid of
them; but they are. That is the point. On average—not in every
case—older workers are, by definition, the most experienced;
they are often very productive and less likely to take time off sick
than slightly younger people. They contribute a huge amount. The
evidence from around the world—not from Government research but
from work by the Institute for Fiscal Studies and others—is that
pensioning them off does not benefit younger workers. There is not a
battle between the

productive. Clearly there comes a point when our productivity declines,
as we get much older. We should bear in mind that the 700,000 women who
are the subject of the debate are in their early 60s. I think that many
of the hon. Gentleman’s constituents would be offended at the
suggestion that they are not productive, valuable members of the work
force. We do not say that employers should be forced to go on employing
them if they want to stop working, but the evidence from the IFS has
debunked what has been called the lump of labour fallacy—the
idea that there is a lump of labour to be done, and so it is possible
to knock out an older worker and slot in a younger one. That neglects

the Minister expand on that a wee bit? Is there a demand issue as well?
I take the point made by the hon. Member for Strangford (Jim Shannon)

To make things clear, typically a woman who reaches state pension age
will draw a state pension for more than 20 years. There is a profile to
the costs, but on average the extra spending would be a couple of
hundred million per 
<?notus-xml column=58?>year; £200 million times 20 is £4 billion, so there is no
inconsistency in the numbers. One is an annual figure and one is
cumulative. I hope that that clarifies that
point.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000209" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000209">The
hon. Gentleman asked about bringing forward the single tier. Of course,
in an ideal world I would do it tomorrow. It is a good reform, and I am
grateful for the Opposition’s support for the principle, but
there are many things that need to be sorted out before we bring it in.
The biggest of those—apart from programming our computers, which
I am advised takes a while—is the impact on company pension
funds. Having a single pension means there is nothing for people to
contract out of. We have two pensions, at least, at the moment. There
is a second state pension that big firms’ employees can contract
out of. With a single pension, there is nothing to contract out of, so
we abolish contracting out.</hs_Para>

that the biggest pension funds in the land, which are currently
contracted out, will contract back into the state pension scheme, and
will face an increase in their national insurance costs—because
they will lose the rebate—and then will have the
option, under our Bill, of re-jigging their company pension scheme to
recoup the cost. So, for example, because people will now be getting
more from the state, rather than relying on the company scheme, the
company might reduce the accrual rate of its scheme, or something like
that. To do that, it will need actuarial valuations and will conduct
long consultations with its employees.</hs_Para>

advised by the Confederation of British Industry, the National
Association of Pension Funds and others that even doing it in 2016 is
tight. They argued at one point that 2017 was tight. Even if it were
reasonable to bring the change forward for the reason that the hon.
Gentleman has given, I think that 2016 is as soon as we can reasonably
do it, not least because the primary legislation, subject to the will
of Parliament, will not be through until Easter 2014. Secondary
legislation will then be needed on the abolition of contracting out. We
will have to consult on that, and it all takes time. I find it
frustrating; there is always far more of a lead time on such reforms
than one might
imagine.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100822000212" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/halltext/131008h0002.htm#13100822000212">There
is one other thing that I want to deal with. It is not a point that the
hon. Gentleman made, but it has been made about the group of women in
question. People sometimes ask why they cannot just be allowed to
choose—perhaps to retire on the current pension, reach single
tier, and then choose the better pension, if it would be better. One of
the difficulties is that single tier does not cost any more overall. It
is not a windfall. We have not found some money down the back of a
sofa, which we want to pump into some pensions but not others. It is
the same money, but it is being spent better. As a result, there are
bits of the system that are less generous, and an example that I can
give relates to widows.</hs_Para>

current system, when a woman’s husband dies the widow can claim
a state pension based on his contributions and, in many cases, get a
full basic state pension of £110 a week or so. Under single
tier, the claim will be on the basis of someone’s own
contributions, so a woman who, for example, opted into single tier
because she would get £133 and not £127, but whose
husband died the next day, would find she could not claim quite the
same combination of widow’s benefits 
<?notus-xml column=59?>that she could under the old system; or she would not be able to claim
the savings credit, whereas her sister, a few years earlier, could,
because she was under the old system. I have no idea—I could not
advise a woman on 6 April 2016—what it would be best to choose,
because I do not know when her husband will die, or whether the savings
credit will come into play, not just on the day when she claims but at
any point through her whole retirement. We just do not know. If we gave
people that choice and they made the wrong one, would we have to opt
them back in again? Would we have to advise them? It would create great
complexity.</hs_Para>

believe that the reform is a good, positive one, spending the planned
budget in a better way. The women in the age group in question have had

safeguards on responsible lending are complemented by other features of
the scheme which ensure that the taxpayer is protected. If a lender
chooses to participate in a given category of lending, they will be
required to put all eligible loans that they originate in that category

in each LTV band (80-85%, 85-90% and 90-95% LTV) split into three
categories depending on whether the lender chooses to participate for
loans for new house purchase only, or also for different types of
remortgage transaction. This approach, whereby all eligible loans must
be put into the scheme, ensures that lenders cannot only use the scheme
for their riskiest
loans.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000055" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000055">The

in the scheme in 2014 will pay when purchasing a guarantee. The fee

self-financing and adheres to European Commission guidance on state
aid. The fee therefore contains three elements: administration cost,
cost of capital and expected losses. The fee will be reset on an annual
basis to take account of any changes in the macro-economic forecast and

“Scotland analysis: Defence” paper analyses the
UK’s approach to defence and the potential consequences of
Scottish independence. From a defence perspective, the arguments for
Scotland remaining in the UK are extremely strong. As part of the UK,
Scotland benefits from a very high level of security and protection
provided through the UK’s integrated defence capabilities and
network of international defence alliances and relationships, as well
as from the opportunities for industry available through the
UK’s single, domestic defence market. An independent Scottish
state could not come close to replicating these
benefits.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000122" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000122">Scotland
benefits from the full range of UK defence capabilities and activities.
These defend UK airspace, patrol the surrounding seas and help to
protect everyone in the UK against both natural and man-made threats.

establish peace and security in countries affected by conflict or

the event of a vote for independence, an independent Scottish state
would lose the benefits of one of the largest defence budgets in the

humanitarian operations overseas. The start-up costs and complexity of

proposing an amendment to the Children and Families Bill that will make
significant changes to the legislation regarding young carers. This is
in line with the commitment made on Commons report by my colleague the
Under-Secretary of State for Education, the hon. Member for Crewe and
Nantwich (Mr Timpson) to look at how the legislation for young carers
could be improved. This amendment will be considered during the House

outcomes for carers is a priority for this Government as we said in
2010 when we published “Recognised, valued and supported: next
steps for the carers strategy”. We are clear that effective
whole family approaches to assessment are essential to improving
support for adults and young carers alike. My Department has been
working with voluntary sector partners for several years to encourage
local services to adopt “whole family” approaches to
supporting young carers and their families. In that time we have funded
and shared some excellent good practice examples and delivered numerous
workshops and seminars. While we have seen plenty of appetite for
working in this way and some changes to the way local services are
designed and delivered, change has been slow. Meanwhile, data from the
national census show us that the number of young carers is
rising.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000130">Recent
evidence from the Children’s Society’s Hidden from View
report indicates that young carers are no more likely to be in contact
with support agencies than their peers. Carers trust found that the
majority of those that are identified as young carers still do not get
an assessment of their needs or access to the support they and their
families need. The consequences can be serious and long lasting. Hidden
from View also found that young carers achieve on average nine grades
lower than their peers at GCSE which can have consequences for their
long-term economic prospects and life
choices.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000131">It
is clear therefore that we need to do more to support young carers.
With the Care Bill also under consideration by Parliament, this is an
ideal opportunity to ensure that young carers get equal consideration
and protection. That is not to say that they should be treated the same
as adult carers. We are committed to ensuring 
<?notus-xml column=12?>that young people are protected from excessive or inappropriate caring
responsibilities. The best way to achieve that is to ensure that the
person being cared for, whether that is an adult or a child, is
assessed and has all their eligible needs met first. To do this
effectively requires local services working together across the
statutory and voluntary sectors to consider the whole family’s
needs. Edward Timpson has worked and will continue to work closely with
the Minister of State, Department of Health, the Member for North
Norfolk (Norman Lamb) who is responsible for care and support to ensure
that that our respective pieces of legislation and associated guidance
work together to deliver support to the whole
family.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000132">Both
Departments have worked closely with interested parties over the
summer, including the Association of Directors of Children’s
Services, the Association of Directors of Adult Services, the National
Young Carers Coalition, the Local Government Association, practitioners
and young carers themselves. Our proposals reflect these discussions.
We have also identified key principles to consider in the drafting of
regulations and statutory guidance about a whole family approach to
assessment of adults under the Care Bill. Draft regulations and
guidance will be published for consultation in the
spring.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000133">Through
this amendment to the Children and Families Bill we believe we have
arrived at a solution that will deliver four things: it will
consolidate and simplify the legislation relating to young
carers’ assessments, making rights and duties clearer to both
young people and practitioners; the right to an assessment of needs for
support will be extended to all young carers under the age of 18
regardless of who they care for, what type of care they provide or how
often they provide it; make it clear to local authorities that they
must carry out an assessment of a young carer’s needs for
support on request or on the appearance of need, and provide the
appropriate links between children’s and adults’
legislation to enable local authorities to align the assessment of a
young carer with an assessment of an adult they care
for.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000134">This
amendment will work with provisions in the Care Bill that also support
the combining of assessments, and the forthcoming regulations on a
whole family approach to assessing and supporting adults. Together they
will provide a clear legislative framework that will support local
authorities to consider the needs of the whole family, deliver
co-ordinated packages of support and protect children and young people
from excessive or inappropriate caring
roles.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_08_PT_1/59EE3E907A0CD229C084801533A07F96ADF7CB80" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>3</System><Sitting short-date="8 October 2013">Tuesday

October 2011, the Government announced that people receiving NHS
continuing health care (NHS CHC) would have the “right to

payment, subject to the results of the PHB pilot programme. This
commitment was confirmed in November 2012, following the publication of

“right to ask” for a PHB will be enshrined in secondary
legislation and will take effect in April 2014. These amendments make
it clear that clinical commissioning groups will need to develop the
capacity and capability to deliver PHBs, as it imposes an obligation to
give serious consideration to requests for PHBs. The “right to
ask” for a PHB is not the same though as an automatic
entitlement to a PHB. There will be some people for whom a PHB is not
appropriate because, for example, their existing package of care is the
best way of managing their
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13100836000163" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/wmstext/131008m0001.htm#13100836000163">I

strengthened for those groups who gain the “right to ask”
for a PHB in April 2014, as from October 2014 this group will further
be given the “right to have” a PHB. A “right to
have” will guarantee that people in receipt of NHS CHC and those
transitioning in from social care or children’s services will
have continuity of care in the services they receive. Those already on
NHS CHC will be able to continue to access the services they are
familiar with as they will be in control of how their budget is spent
and have the confidence to exercise choice. Similarly, those who are
new to NHS CHC, those who transition in from social care budgets or
those who transition from children’s services will be able to
continue to access the services they are accustomed to without the fear
that this power to choose will be taken away from them when they move
to a new package of care. There will continue to be people for whom
PHBs are not appropriate but by giving a “right to have”
we will ensure that they will only be declined on clinical or financial
grounds which are deemed to make a PHB

crime undermines confidence in our communications technology and online

bans come into force immediately they are imposed at point of sentence
and the court informs the DVLA so that the enforcement takes place.
Since disqualification from driving is a sentence it would not be
appropriate to ban a defendant from driving before they are convicted,
however where appropriate the courts can impose a bail condition that
the individual should not drive a motor vehicle. If there is a delay in
sentencing after conviction, the court also has a power to impose 
<?notus-xml column=3?>an interim disqualification on a defendant, where it is lawful to do so.
Guidance on this was recently issued by the Crown Prosecution
Service:</hs_Para>

Villiers:</Member></B> The quarter 2 and quarter 3
quarterly data summary (QDS) returns of all 17 Departments
participating in the QDS process were delayed owing to the development
of the Cabinet Office’s Government Interrogating Spending Tool
(GIST). The GIST was developed in response to recommendations made
in Dr Martin Read’s independent report
entitled “Practical Steps to Improve Management
Information in Government”. Before the last general election, no
such comparable data was published at all that allows the public to
access a breakdown of Government expenditure through the gov.uk
website. It makes the process of accessing and analysing complex QDS
and OSCAR data easier and quicker, and for these reasons, was seen to
justify a short delay in publishing QDS
data.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="1310095000041" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0001.htm#1310095000041">Television</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="1310095000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0001.htm#1310095000250"><B><Member PimsId="5698" UID="1310095000483" xid="1008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0001.htm#1310095000483">Michael

bisexuals and transgender (LGBT) rights, are a regular feature of
bilateral discussions with the Russian authorities. The Prime Minister
raised concerns about the protection of human rights for LGBT people
with President Putin in their bilateral meeting at the G20 summit on 6
September. He made clear the strength of feeling about the Russian law
prohibiting the promotion of “non-traditional sexual
relations” to minors, which has the potential to prevent LGBT
people from fully enjoying the right to freedom of expression and
peaceful assembly. The Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth
Affairs, the right hon. Member for Richmond (Yorks) (Mr Hague),
discussed the issue again with Foreign Minister Lavrov at the UN
General Assembly in New York on 25 September. The issue of LGBT rights
was a key theme of the most recent Human Rights Dialogue with Russia in
May this year. The Foreign Secretary and I regularly raise human rights
with our counterparts and will continue to do

and vulnerable people keep warm and we have a strong package of
policies which are already delivering assistance to those in need.
These include the Energy Company Obligation and the Warm Home Discount.
ECO is expected to generate investment worth around £540 million
annually to fund efficient boilers and insulation measures to some
230,000 low income and vulnerable households, including pensioner
households, each year.: This year, around 2 million households will get
help under the Warm Home Discount—including an automatic
electricity bill discount of £135 for over 1.1 million of the

independent courts, which must follow sentencing guidelines. The
maximum penalty for driving while disqualified is six months'
imprisonment and/or a level 5 fine (£5,000). The offender's
licence must also be endorsed and either six penalty points imposed or
the offender will be disqualified for a further period. Recent and
relevant convictions are a statutory aggravating factor in sentencing
and will make the sentence more severe, within the maximum penalty
provided for. The court also has a power to deprive the offender of the
vehicle used for the purpose of committing the
offence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13100913000628" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0003.htm#13100913000628">Table

Privileges (IEP) national policy framework which come into effect from
1 November 2013, a centralised facilities list will be introduced. This
will help ensure that prisons operate to a consistent standard when

planning permission, a new prison at the former Firestone site in
Wrexham, which will offer around 2,100 places and will be fully

of the new capacity coming on stream we are now in a position to close
four prisons (HMPs Blundeston, Dorchester, Northallerton and Reading),

abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the UK National Screening Committee
(UK NSC) considered the evidence, merits and costs of introducing the
screening programme against its internationally recognised criteria to

other national screening programmes, the programme’s roll-out
was managed in phases to ensure high quality programmes could be put in
place while a validation and assurance process of appropriate treatment
services was also completed. This assurance process led to the
reorganisation of some treatment services. The phased roll-out of the
NHS AAA screening programme began in 2009 and was completed in April
2013. There was no formal pilot stage prior to the roll-out beginning
in 2009. The first early implementation phase was reviewed and lessons
learned were acted upon during the implementation of later phases. The

Due to the fact that adult social care was regulated under two separate

The numbers of new activations in 2010 and 2011 are artificially high,
due to the process of transferring registration of services previously
registered under the Care Standards Act to the Health and Social Care
Act and the delay in providers receiving the certificate of
registration under the new Act, while their locations would have
remained active throughout the transfer
process.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter Justify="left">4.

summary (QDS) returns of all 17 Departments participating in the QDS
process were delayed owing to the development of the Cabinet

was developed in response to recommendations made in Dr
Martin Read’s independent report entitled “Practical 
<?notus-xml column=116?>Steps to Improve Management Information in Government”. The GIST
is an online tool that allows the public to access a breakdown of
Government expenditure through the gov.uk website. It makes the process
of accessing and analysing complex QDS and OSCAR (online system for
central accounting and reporting) data easier and quicker, and for

for efficacy and safety based on results of clinical trials carried out
in accordance with current European Union regulations. A risk-benefit
approach is taken to ensure that all licensed medicines provide maximum
benefit to the target patient population with minimal risk to patient
safety. Some of the anti-tuberculosis drugs commonly used in the
national health service have been on the United Kingdom market for many
years and assessment of efficacy would have been carried out against
the criteria in force at the time of

with all medicines used in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) continually monitors the safety of
anti-tuberculosis drugs after they are licensed using all available
sources of information. This includes the Yellow Card Scheme for
spontaneous reporting of adverse reactions by health care professionals
and patients, reports from pharmaceutical companies—which are a
legal requirement under UK law and worldwide health authorities, data
from clinical and epidemiological studies and the published medical
literature. These data are assessed to establish whether the benefits
of licensed products continue to outweigh the risks. If necessary,
regulatory action is taken to ensure that the medicine is used in a way
which minimises risk, and maximises benefits to the patient. The
balance of benefits and risks of currently licensed anti tuberculosis
drugs continues to be
positive.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-08?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_08_PT_1/8084794C740289FEA991067BC3441D6B9ED86FBC" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="8 October 2013">Tuesday

quarter 2 and quarter 3 quarterly data summary (QDS) returns of all 17
departments participating in the QDS process were delayed owing to the
development of the Cabinet Office's Government interrogating spending
tool (GIST). The GIST was developed in response to recommendations made
in Dr. Martin Read's independent report entitled ‘Practical
Steps to Improve Management Information in Government’. Before
the last general election no such comparable data was published at all
that allows the public to access a breakdown of Government expenditure
through the Gov. UK website. It makes the process of accessing and

be open and transparent to allow a wide range of suppliers to bid for
business. In May, Lord Young recommended that all contract

a single platform. We are currently consulting on this proposal,

2011-12, the Department accepted responsibility for some new functions
outside of London, including oversight of the European Regional
Development Fund following the abolition of the regional development
agencies and residual functions following the closure of the Government
offices for the regions. As these business functions relate to work in
areas outside of London, this has therefore increased our domestic and
overseas travel spend compared to 2010-11. However, this is more than
offset by the very significant savings to taxpayers of the abolition of
these regional bodies.</hs_Para>

However, the Government is concerned about the cost and disruption that
can be caused by unauthorised traveller encampments. That is why on 9
August 2013 we sent all council leaders updated guidance, reminding
them to act swiftly and setting out the strong powers councils and
landowners have to remove illegal and unauthorised sites on both public

strengthened Temporary Stop Notices

shortfall associated with such a VAT cut should be met by increasing
Government borrowing. This would undermine the Government's fiscal

negative impact on the economy than the positive economic impact that
might otherwise be expected as a result of a VAT cut.</hs_Para>

(QDS) returns of all 17 Departments participating in the QDS process
were delayed owing to the development of the Cabinet Office's
Government Interrogating Spending Tool (GIST). The GIST was developed
in response to recommendations made in Dr. Martin Read's
independent report entitled ‘Practical Steps to Improve
Management Information in Government'. Before the last general election
no such comparable data was published at all that allows the public to
access a breakdown of government expenditure through the Gov.UK
website. It makes the process of accessing and analysing complex QDS
and OSCAR data easier and quicker, and for these reasons was seen to
justify a short delay in publishing QDS
data.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13100917000174" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0006.htm#13100917000174">Television</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13100917002219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0006.htm#13100917002219"><B><Member PimsId="5698" UID="13100917002761" xid="1008" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131008/text/131008w0006.htm#13100917002761">Michael
