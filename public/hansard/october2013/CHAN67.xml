According to freedom of information requests compiled by Labour, there
has been a 33.5% drop in the number of rape cases referred to the CPS
for prosecution since 2010. That figure was rising under the previous
Government. Given that police budgets have been cut by 20% over the
same period, does the Minister accept that the hollowing out of police
services has led to more perpetrators of rape and sexual violence
getting away with it? What is he going to do about that disgraceful
situation, which will inevitably lead to more perpetrators committing
rapes, as they feel emboldened to do so with

helps to suggest that any woman who wants to take a case will be

hearing, which are a small proportion of the overall number. It costs
much less—only £250—to lodge a case in the first

be rewarded if there are problems. It is important that we do not scare

introduced by the Opposition to regularise the relationship between

taken up by the NHS not only in England but in Wales, not least because

that the NHS in Wales will recognise that the NHS in England is making
changes in regard to listening and responding to complaints, and that
it will emulate the steps we are taking to deliver services on which
patients can rely. Cutting the budget in Wales, as Labour is doing, is

That is a positive thing to do. More food banks are being

ambitious energy and climate change policy is vital so that Britain can
meet our significant challenges. The coalition Government inherited
from the previous Administration an energy future with a huge,
multi-billion pound black hole at its heart, which was the result of
years of underinvestment, dithering and delay. So this Government are
having to take the tough decisions others ducked to make sure that
Britain’s lights do stay on. Everything we are doing has to
ensure that we drive investment into the system, not scare it off or
freeze it out. But, as I will make clear in this statement, energy
security must go hand in hand with
affordability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000346" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0002.htm#13103165000346">So
let me set out the robust plans we have to deliver affordable energy
security. To deal with the problem of tightening electricity margins up
to 2018, the Government have been working with National Grid and Ofgem
to develop existing safeguards, in order to have more electricity
available for the grid at peak times, including, if needed, through the
use of power plants currently mothballed. We are introducing to Britain
a capacity market to ensure that we attract the investment we need in
new power stations. The first capacity market auction will take place
next year—for delivery from the winter of 2018. In addition to
those measures to keep the lights on, Britain now has a long-term
strategy encapsulated in the Energy Bill. Over the summer, we published
draft strike prices for renewable electricity under contracts for
difference. Detailed proposals for the implementation of electricity
market reform were published this month.</hs_Para>

fruits of bringing this greater predictability and certainty to
investment are already showing. Latest estimates suggest that at least
£35 billion has been invested in new electricity infrastructure
since 2010, and much more is in the pipeline. In the past 12 months
alone, we have provided consent for seven major energy infrastructure
applications worth about £20 billion, with the capacity to
generate electricity for more than 6 million homes. That, of
course, included last week’s announcement that we have reached
key commercial terms with EDF for the first new nuclear power station
in a generation at Hinkley Point
C<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T11:29:58"></hs_TimeCode>. And there is
more: through the Energy Bill’s final investment decision
enabling programme, 23 applications for 26 investment contracts
are currently being evaluated by the Department of Energy and Climate
Change for a broad range of renewable technologies, including onshore
wind, offshore wind and biomass
projects.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000348" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0002.htm#13103165000348">Even
though British households pay some of the lowest prices for gas and
electricity in Europe, such facts are scant comfort to those who have
seen energy prices rise considerably over the past 10 years. The main 
<?notus-xml column=1094?>driver of these energy price rises has been rising wholesale energy

have already introduced some help that is immediate. Two million
vulnerable households will get £135 off their energy bill this
winter, thanks to the Government’s warm home discount. Around
12.5 million pensioners will get the winter fuel

while such immediate help for consumers and companies is important, we
need more permanent change if we are to keep bills down not just for 20
months, but for 20 years and beyond. The energy company obligation is
delivering such permanent change by modernising our housing stock and
making it cheaper to heat our homes. Some 230,000 low income households

backing Ofgem’s reforms to help consumers get better

Energy prices are rising three times faster under this Government than
the previous one, bills are up by £300, and the latest price
rises will add another £100 this winter. For people in fuel
poverty, the gap between their bills and what they can afford is at an
all-time high, but for the companies, the mark-up between wholesale
costs and the prices they charge grows ever wider. Fifty-seven
households have had work done under the green deal and 7,000 workers in
the insulation industry have lost their jobs. Investment in clean
energy has halved, and the Government have legislated to stop any
future Administration setting a decarbonisation target until 2016 at

more than any other country in the EU.</hs_Para>

but the drafting seems to be a bit sloppy. If the provisions are not
confined to HS2, it will make a mockery of any limits placed on the
costs that the taxpayer will have to face. The amendment attempts to
limit this money Bill, and to limit the expenditure to HS2, in line
with what  
<?notus-xml column=1117?>I believe the Government intended. If the provision
were to include Scotland, that would round up the whole
package.</hs_Para>

comment on the effects of HS2 on the areas outside the towns that will
be directly connected to the line. I am sure that colleagues in this
House and the other place will be concerned by the KPMG report that
came out as a result of a freedom of information request. It had not
been published alongside the KPMG report that came from the Government.
It showed that HS2 would have a negative economic effect on many areas
of the country, and I am particularly worried about some of those
areas. Will the Minister tell us which areas are involved? The House
needs to have that information before we start making decisions on the
largest infrastructure project since the second world war. We need to
know the pros and cons. I am firmly on the con side, and I have tabled
my amendments accordingly. I hope that the Minister will rise to the

Ellman:</Member></B> I rise to support amendment 17. I am a firm
supporter of High Speed 2. The case for it is essentially one of
capacity. It is entirely wrong to state, as some commentators have done
recently, that the argument for capacity is something new that has been
brought in only at this stage. That is simply not so. The report that
the Transport Select Committee produced two years ago made it clear
that the need for increased capacity formed the basis of the case for
HS2<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:46:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000551" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0002.htm#13103165000551">Amendment
17 deals with linking HS2 to the rest of the transport network. It
specifically mentions the need for it to link to roads and airports. It
is important that it should not be seen as a development that is
separate from the rest of the rail network or indeed from the rest of
the transport network. I therefore welcome the amendment. It is
unfortunate that, because no decision has been taken on the need for
increased airport capacity in the south-east, no firm proposals on
Heathrow have been finalised. That matter needs urgent attention.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:47:17"></hs_TimeCode>There is also an
issue about freight. In Liverpool, for example, the expansion of the
port is creating a need for more freight paths and better access for
freight. That, too, needs attention. I welcome the amendment in that it
draws attention to networks and
connectivity<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T12:47:33"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

work should be done, which included looking again at the business case.
One reason for that was the valuation put on the time people spent
travelling, when it was alleged they could not work. We thought that
that was not a correct valuation and that it should be looked at again.

capacity—which, indeed, they are rapidly doing—a grave
blow will be dealt to the economies in the northern regions, in terms

travel by rail now is the fact that no freight lines are available.

this is about the future, and about long-term thinking. I strongly
believe that while it is always essential to scrutinise spending, it is
also essential to have vision. If we do not have vision, we do not have
a future. I note that the aim of Lord Deighton’s taskforce is to
maximise the economic benefit that can result from High Speed 2, but I
am not sure whether that includes expanding connectivity and making the
maximum use of freed lines, as well as more economic development
issues. I ask the Minister to give us a response at the relevant time
as to who, if anybody, is in charge of expanding connectivity and the
opportunities offered by HS2 so the maximum economic benefit can be
realised. HS2 is needed for capacity reasons, and it produces major 
<?notus-xml column=1124?>economic development opportunities for most parts of
the country, but they must be grasped, and unless somebody is in charge

delighted to be able to add my name to amendment 17 tabled by the
Labour Front-Bench team. That demonstrates the cross-party support and
co-operation we will need to deliver this project, which is so vital to
the future of our country. Indeed, when I offered to add my name, I was
asked, “Would you like to go on first, Minister?” I said,
“No, no; I wouldn’t want people to get the wrong
idea.” Our intention has always been for this landmark project
to be part of a truly connected and integrated transport system, and
the amendment would ensure that any preparatory work needed to
integrate HS2 with the rest of our transport infrastructure can be
funded using the Bill’s expenditure powers.</hs_Para>

of making conventional rail accessible to pedestrians and cyclists is
now recognised across the country; we have seen increasingly that
railways stations have been adapted in that respect. It is right to

capacity on the west coast main line. Does she accept that the heavy
growth that took place on that line occurred immediately after the
upgrade in 2008, and that since that upgrade the rates of increase have
slowed tremendously and that, therefore, there could be additional
capacity on the existing line? Does she also accept that we can create

line the additional capacity created by the upgrade is already starting
to run out and that the line will be full. Of course we can create
additional capacity on a train by converting some carriages from first
class to standard class, but that does not create extra space on the
line for additional trains. As the Minister acknowledged, places such
as Shrewsbury and Blackpool want to have an additional direct service
but cannot because the capacity is just not available. I am sure that

The fact is that there simply is not enough capacity. I am sure that

deal with <hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:27:21"></hs_TimeCode>the
amendments relating to the links to Scotland. Labour has always
supported the principle of bringing high-speed rail to Scotland, which
is why the previous Labour Government set up HS2 Ltd to examine
possible routes to Scotland. HS2 will bring real benefits, enabling
faster journey times and adding to capacity on the main line routes to
Scotland. We 
<?notus-xml column=1129?>wanted to put those benefits in the Bill in Committee, but we were told

in one of the first Adjournment debates I ever sat in and listened
to—I confess that I have not listened to many since, except
those that I have taken part in—two of my hon. Friends made a
vigorous case that, if High Speed 1 went ahead, it would turn the
garden of England into the garbage can of England, destroy house
prices, ruin the economy of Kent and end the world as we knew it. High
Speed 1 went ahead and Kent’s economy has been regenerated and
improved. House prices have not gone through the floor; in fact, house
prices along the line of route have kept pace with those in other
areas. In some cases, they have increased beyond them because of the
houses’ proximity to good commuter links. Capacity has
increased, particularly for those commuters who are prepared to use
High Speed 1 from Canterbury, for example, to London.</hs_Para>

council, along with hon. Members of this House, led the opposition to
High Speed 1 in the late ’80s but is now a strong supporter of
the high-speed railway because of the benefits it has brought to the
community and the county. The leaders and officials of Kent
county council have offered to go and talk to the leaders of
Buckinghamshire county council, Warwickshire county council and
Staffordshire county council to explain that in their
experience the railway did not destroy their communities or

McDonnell</B> (Hayes and Harlington) (Lab):</Member> I shall try to be
brief. I have tabled amendment 23 on the link between the network and
Heathrow. Some hon. Members will understand that I have raised the
issue on behalf of my constituents, as is my right, in each debate we
have had on High Speed
2.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000682" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000682">Let
me briefly give the context. My background is in supporting rail
expansion and investment. I represent a constituency with a railway
estate and a large number of railway workers and, in addition, I chair
the RMT trade union group in Parliament. We have been strongly behind
the development of increased capacity and investment, so when the idea
of high-speed rail was first proposed it was welcomed in my
constituency for a number of reasons. One was that if we could get
railway journeys below four hours, that would take pressure off
Heathrow airport and reduce the need short-haul flights into Heathrow.
That assisted in our campaign against the expansion of
Heathrow.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000683" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000683">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:49:45"></hs_TimeCode>
the route was published, every Member south of Birmingham could assess
its impact on their constituency, except me, because the link to
Heathrow was not included. The route of the link to Old Oak Common was
published, but then we were told that there would be a direct link at
some stage, the options would be published, there would be a
consultation, a preferred option would be considered, compensation
arrangements for those affected would be discussed and then this House
would made a considered
decision.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000684" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000684">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:50:30"></hs_TimeCode>

for Ruislip, Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd) have valiantly argued the
case for their constituents and achieved some tunnelling, but a lot
more needs to be done. Other facilities that serve the whole borough
will be affected, such as the Hillingdon outdoor activities centre,
which will need to be
relocated.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000685" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000685">I

That affects all of them, because nine different options for linking to
Heathrow are being discussed, which means everyone’s home or
business is under threat.

to run a railway or consult on such a massive project. We were promised
a logical process with a tight time scale. We were told that as the
main network was decided, the routes would be published, there would be
consultation on a preferred route, and a decision would be made
relatively speedily, which would at least have given us some certainty.

hon. Friend the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) said
that we do not want to put off any decision on high-speed rail until
after the Davies commission reports. The solution, then, is simply to
ensure that the commission reports earlier. The fact that it is due to
report after the next general election is a political fudge to get
everybody off the hook. In the coming six weeks the commission will
report on a range of options, but there will be no final report until
after the general election. Why is that length of time needed? All the
experts, and indeed a number of Government Members, have been clear

could be within six months after the initial report is published this
month. The decision could then be taken before the next general
election. It is also about being more honest with the electorate on

argument is that that is sufficient capacity for the international

<?notus-xml column=1143?>the early years: three an hour may be enough. However, with that

could also be a direct link to Heathrow for the electric trains, which
would go off at Greenford and on to the Great Western main line. That
would link to 
<?notus-xml column=1146?>Heathrow at one end and to Crossrail at the other. Trains would be able
to go from Heathrow to Birmingham airport or the centre of Birmingham,
as well as from Canary Wharf to the centre of Birmingham. That would
double the capacity between London and Birmingham very easily. The line
could even go on to Stratford and there could be a
transfer—although perhaps not an easy one—to the channel
tunnel rail link and to Eurostar. That would solve the only real
capacity problem, because the others involve train frequencies. My
railway engineer and signalling friends say it is easy to run more
trains, but the problem is that franchisees of privatised railways like
crowded trains. It is more profitable to run crowded trains than
half-empty trains, so if as many people as possible are crammed on to
fewer trains, more profit is

Clearing the lines is obviously not possible all the time, but
upgrading the line so that we can have through trains is not difficult.
[<SmallCaps>Hon. Members:</SmallCaps> “It is!”] I have
specifics. We need to double the viaduct north of Welwyn, and
four-track the line between Huntingdon and Peterborough. We need
flyovers at Peterborough and Newark, and we could then have non-stop
trains straight through to Edinburgh if we wished. The train would have
to slow down at Newcastle and York, but by and large the journey could
be done in three and a half hours maximum. That is the east coast main
line.</hs_Para>

the midlands main line is going to be electrified, and we also want it
to improve. With some track remodelling at Leicester and Derby we could
make the trains run faster there. We need to straighten out the line at
Market Harborough and restore the straighter line that used to exist,
and we must take freight traffic off those three lines. That is the key
to more train paths, because if we can take all the freight off those
lines, we will not have a problem. To do that, however, we need an
alternative. We have such an alternative in GB Railfreight, which I
have been promoting for some years together with colleagues from the
railway industry. We have a detailed scheme, carefully worked out and
costed, to build a dedicated freight line from the channel tunnel to
Glasgow, linking all the main conurbations of Britain, and capable of
taking lorries on trains. We need to take freight off the
road—and off the main lines, of course, but 80% of freight
travels by lorry, not by container or other means. To get lorries on
trains is crucial to modal shift, and to do that we need a gauge
capacity that is capable of taking lorries on

Hopkins:</Member></B> I thank the hon. Lady—my close
neighbour—for her question. We took a team of 15
people, including rail constructers, and representatives from
Eurotunnel and the supermarkets, to meet Geoff Hoon when he was
Secretary of State for Transport. It was clear they were worried that
our scheme might conflict with HS2, not because it would take up the
same track, but because it might remove freight from the railway lines
and make the case for HS2 weaker. We argued that HS2 could go ahead if
it was thought essential, but that a GB freight route is much more
vital to Britain’s economy than HS2 has ever been. What is the
total cost of the scheme? A generous figure, based on outturn costs for
HS1, would, we think, be less than £6 billion—a tiny

Hopkins:</Member></B> I think I mentioned that on other lines there is
no problem with capacity, provided we are prepared to increase train
frequencies. We do not do that, however, because it is not profitable
to do so while private franchisees can make more profit by running
fewer trains with more people on them—very simple. The rest of
the railway network clearly needs heavy investment, and Network Rail is
undertaking a lot of that. This specific scheme would solve many
problems 
<?notus-xml column=1148?>and be a fraction of the cost of HS2. Indeed,
upgrading the other lines I have suggested would solve almost all the
capacity problems that we are now facing.</hs_Para>

must invest in dedicated rail-freight capacity, as I have suggested. At
the moment the continent of Europe is building large rail-freight
capacity right across the continent; indeed, trains can go from China
to Europe even now. We will miss out on that if we cannot transport
lorries on trains. We must be able to put lorry trailers on trains, or
we will not see a shift from road to rail and the rest of Europe will
leave us behind. For the sake of our economy, we must invest heavily in
dedicated rail freight that is capable of taking lorries on
trains.</hs_Para>

coalition Government Members, one key thing was to rebalance the

I am grateful for Ministers’ work in getting us this far on the

a rebalanced economy between the regions and London. I will support the

the extension of HS2 to Scotland. Unsurprisingly, I shall concentrate
my remarks on the case for the building of HS2 and the benefits it will

Edinburgh.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000819" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000819">It
is patently clear that the improvement to the railway system that HS2
will deliver will benefit Scotland. At the moment, we suffer from
capacity problems further south on the rail network. Unless something
is done to deal with them, as rail demand increases, journey times and
railway services to Scotland will be affected. We will obviously
benefit from the reduction of 45 minutes that will be brought about by
HS2, and I hope that further reductions will be achieved in the
fullness of time.</hs_Para>

will also benefit from the way in which HS2 will help to rebalance the
economy towards the north of Britain. The development of HS2 will also
lead to a reduction in the pressure for growth in domestic air travel,
which will have other advantages. Extending high-speed rail to the
points proposed by HS2 and beyond will also improve the business case
for high-speed. All the evidence suggests that the business case for
the improvements further south will be strengthened by extending HS2 to
the points currently provided for and beyond to Scotland as
well.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000821" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000821"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Bridgen" PimsId="5593" UID="13103165001502" xid="1220" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165001502">Andrew

those communities and councils that would directly benefit from the
high-speed line that are in favour. Communities further north recognise
that, although they might not get a direct benefit, it would still be 
<?notus-xml column=1152?>beneficial overall to the Scottish economy. That is the kind of
constructive approach that other communities not directly served by the
line should note and use as the basis for their approach to the
development of

of my concerns was the possible temptation to extend the line as far as
Birmingham and never any further north. I therefore welcome the
commitment in the Bill to go further north in England and the
possibility that the line will go even further than outlined in the HS2
documents. I will look for any commitment for high-speed rail to go
beyond the current terminus points for HS2. I would also ask why we
have to accept a 20-year programme for high-speed rail to go from
London to York and somewhere near Wigan when other countries seem to
manage to do it much faster than we do. I hope that that issue can be
addressed in the preparations for the scheme over the next few months

circulating over the last hour or so as the information has reached the
public domain. I presume that Baroness Kramer will not announce that
high-speed is coming to Scotland, but I am looking forward to some
positive announcements tomorrow. There is an opportunity here for the
Scottish Government—of whatever colour, as we are obviously
talking about a long-term process—to work with the UK
Government. It is recognised that it will be possible to do some work
on high-speed rail in Scotland, perhaps to link Edinburgh and Glasgow
but also to provide the basis for a route further south. Although we
cannot immediately have a high-speed route all the way from Edinburgh
and Glasgow to London, other sections of high-speed rail would
certainly benefit the Scottish economy. Just as the business case for
high-speed rail further south is strengthened by bringing into it
business from Scotland, any high-speed rail in Scotland that would
bring passengers into the GB-wide high-speed system would be beneficial
for the rest of the country.</hs_Para>

why those communities that will not be served directly by the line,
especially those that currently have a good rail service, will be
concerned that they could lose out as a result of HS2 being
constructed. The answer for those communities is to engage as actively
as they can with central Government and neighbouring local authorities
to try to ensure that they put the case to get the best benefits. It is
also important that connectivity is examined, the point of the
amendment tabled by my hon. Friends on the Opposition Front
Bench.</hs_Para>

is important for the Government, and for Front Benchers of all colours,
to use the opportunity of developing HS2 to rebuild the vision for rail
in the country as a whole. HS2 is not just a question of trains running
on the high-speed line and then going no further; they can serve other
destinations in the way they will serve Edinburgh and Glasgow. On the
continent, high-speed trains do not just run on high-speed lines; they
serve other communities too. That is something we should aim for in
Britain<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:55:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103165000831" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103165000831">The
case for high-speed developments beyond HS2 is powerful. I understand

the points made by

the contingency to have anticipated changes in design costs. Of the
£50 billion cap, £21 billion is currently unspecified.
More than £14 billion includes dealing with optimism
bias and risk inflation—the initial 10% on that £15
billion figure—and then on top of that there is a further
contingency of more than £4 billion for phase 1. Nowhere do the
figures address changes to design, yet many of hon. Members’
remarks have been based on exactly that premise. I predict there will
be public campaigns in Camden where people will say, “If we are
going to have High Speed 2, let us connect it to High Speed 1 in a far
better way.” Dare I say it, but there may be one or two

the Member for Warrington South (David
Mowat<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:01:48"></hs_TimeCode>)
highlighted the issues involved, but let us consider, for example, the
Heathrow spur, on which we have had interventions. If Howard Davies
decides to go with a hub airport at Heathrow—and one would think
it logical for HS2 to connect to it—the cost of that is not in
this budget, and neither is the cost of the connection in Camden, so
the cost of tunnelling and the additional work that is likely to flow
are not in these figures either.

Government have now indicated their intention to accept the official
Opposition’s amendment. I have been looking at some paperwork,
and I believe that the cycling lanes in Birmingham, Manchester and
Leeds will add up to another £750,000; the light rail
construction, if it goes ahead, in Liverpool and Birmingham will cost
about £1.6 billion; and if there is a walking programme for the
seven cities, that will cost about £750,000. Those projects are
all in the infrastructure pipeline, so we are looking at adding between
£3 billion and £4 billion just to provide the

Inevitably, when large sums are being spent, there will be pressure to

towards schemes linked to HS2. For example, they have referred to

local authorities have to take some responsibility as part of their
transport plans. The Greater Birmingham and Solihull local enterprise
partnership’s top priority is to make a bid to the single
regeneration pot for light rail connections to Birmingham airport and
the interchange station. When Lord Adonis was promoting high-speed
rail, and we were not sure about it in the west midlands, the deal was
basically that we would find the funds to build the station. There is a
balance between local authority spend and other pots; it should not all
come from a single

same HS1 energy costs for steel construction for this project. Land
prices seem vague. Network Rail still has a 23% efficiency gap. Is it

authorising the spending of money on the preparation work for building

21 deals with payments made through service companies. I do not know
how many people in this House pay close attention to this matter, but
there has certainly been a lot of fuss about service companies,
particularly in connection with the BBC and others. When I asked a
fairly innocuous parliamentary question, I was surprised to find out
that in the past 12 months HS2 Ltd has engaged 48 people paid through
personal service companies. Apparently, eight of those people have
either left the company or transferred to the payroll, and a further 12
will have left or transferred by 31 December. That means
that there will still be many people who are paid through personal
service companies. Apparently, 
<?notus-xml column=1162?>the Department was carrying out an assurance process at the time to
ensure that all those people were compliant with their tax and national
insurance obligations, and the good news is that the response was that
they were—none was not compliant. But on a Government project of
this sort, being paid for from the public purse, people should be paid
as civil servants and they should not be in receipt of
bonuses.</hs_Para>

working on HS2 Ltd, have been paid bonuses of more than £3
million between them. I admit that many of those bonuses will be small,
but we should still put our money where our mouth is and the practice
should cease. I also understand that HS2 Ltd, which was operating bonus
schemes, is no longer doing so for its employees. I am pleased about

Jack Straw</B> (Blackburn) (Lab):</Member> I shall speak particularly
to amendment 25, which has the support of my Front Bench and, I
am pleased to say, of the Government as well. I was a member of the
Cabinet in 2009 which first gave formal approval to HS2. That was
endorsed in the run-up to the general election by all-party agreement.
Although I have taken a close interest in the project ever
since, I have seen nothing in the intervening period to
persuade me to withdraw my support for
it.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103180000070">The
case is clear. First, thanks to a dramatic increase in the usage of the
railways in the past 15 years—I am very proud of Labour’s
record—we face a situation where, for both freight and
passengers, the existing lines cannot cope. As someone who for years
has had to endure the west coast main line, I have to say that large
sums of money were spent during that period—one of the reasons
why there was so little electrification—on patch and mend to
that line and on quadrupling the line in the Trent valley, with very
little overall benefit. If folk in the House and outside think there is
an alternative to HS2, they are right that there is, but it is
a worse alternative, with more disruption and greater
cost.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000071" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0003.htm#13103180000071">The
second reason why I strongly support HS2 is that it will help to
rebalance our economies. I have listened to some fancy arguments in the
House, but among the fanciest are those that I have heard today and
from colleagues in the Tea Room—that if we put in this
investment, it will somehow suck more economic activity into London. It
is worth turning that argument on its head or, as the Treasury likes to
say, looking at the counterfactual. If that were the case, it would be

come to the issue of the costs. No one is in favour of providing blank
cheques for schemes, but I have seen no evidence that a blank cheque is
being provided for this scheme. What we are talking about is £42
billion until 2033, which works out at just over £2 billion a
year. That is a lot of money but, in the grand scheme of
things, including infrastructure investment, it is not huge,

will force the Government to announce any overspend of the yearly
budget. It will also provide an incentive to identify areas in which
costs can be reduced, as was successfully done on the Crossrail

timetable to pass the hybrid Bill for phase 1 by the middle of 2015
makes it even more important that we introduce stringent reporting
standards. Even Ministers acknowledge that that plan is challenging,
and that is putting it mildly. It appears to be certain that 
<?notus-xml column=1171?>spending will continue under the authority of the preparation Bill
beyond the general election. If it does, there must be proper reporting
requirements in place. In fact, we submitted a similar amendment in
Committee, and I am sorry it was deemed unnecessary at the time. I am
glad the Government have been persuaded to think again and have
accepted our amendment. It will make for a tougher Bill that makes
Ministers accountable for bearing down on costs, and it will deliver
better value for public investment.</hs_Para>

“if “ to “when”. The House has already

ourselves more resilient and competitive as an economy. That will not

I have said all along, I welcome suggestions for creating more
capacity, but the so-called alternative suggestions from the critics
simply do not add up. We have looked at the case for building new

the job. Some people believe we can carry on squeezing more room out of
our current railways, patching up our problems. The work we published
this week shows that, 
<?notus-xml column=1174?>if we tried to create the capacity we needed by upgrading the three
current main north-south lines, we would face 14 years of weekend

will spend £38.3 billion in its next five-year control period,
and the Government have a £73 billion budget for wider transport
investment over the next Parliament. Despite all that, we will still
need new rail capacity. If one accepts that—and that we need
room to grow—there is no choice about how to provide it. As the
strategic case makes clear, a new high-speed north-south line is not
just the right way, it is the only
way.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000166">The
new north-south line will be the backbone of Britain. It will have 18
trains an hour, each carrying up to 1,100 passengers, transforming the
available space on inter-city lines. As long-distance services transfer
to the new line, capacity will be released on the existing network. Of
course, not every city across Britain will benefit in the same way, but
Network Rail estimates that more than 100 cities and towns could
benefit from released capacity. It would mean significantly more
commuter services, better connectivity and more routes for rail
freight, taking lorries off our most congested
roads.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000167">We

any large infrastructure scheme, we also know we will face opposition.
I respect the fact that some people are concerned about the impact on
the places they live, and I respect those with serious proposals for
improvements. Already, the environmental impact of the new line has
been vastly reduced thanks to such improvements. But I also respect

must be a national project with support across the parties, or in the

north and the midlands know that HS2 is right. To those who say that
there is no blank cheque, I say that there never has been and there
never will be. I know that hon. Members want costs controlled. Here are
the facts. The target price for the first phase is £17.16
billion. That is the price for construction agreed with HS2 Ltd. For
the whole Y-route, the agreed budget is £42.6 billion, including
a contingency of £14.4 billion, which we are determined to bear
down on. Sir David Higgins—the man who built the Olympics on

the strategic case published this week shows, our updated benefit-cost
ratio has fallen slightly from 2.5 to 2.3. We have been open about
that, but it means that the business case for the new north-south line
is still strong, with more than £2 returned for every £1
invested—about the same as Crossrail and Thameslink, and nobody
seems to doubt those projects. In fact, the ratio for HS2 could
increase to 4.5 if rail demand continues to rise until

is still important to recognise that the benefit-cost ratio cannot take

I have said to the Secretary of State and his predecessors, if I was in
favour of this hare-brained scheme, I would get rid of a lot of the
people involved, because in my constituency alone their original
estimate of the costs has proved to be £1 billion less than
their revised costs. That is £800 million extra at Euston and
£125 million for running the works across Camden town, where,
apparently, the cost went up from £170-odd million to
£300 million because they had not realised they would need to
widen the track. If that reflects the quality of thought and advice, I
say to those people who are in favour of this scheme, “Watch it,
because it’s a mess, and even the great man who, at the
Olympics, did manage to spend the contingency fund is going to have
difficulty sorting it out.”</hs_Para>

therefore have to say that I believe it will be necessary for the House
of Lords to try to look after and properly compensate the people I try
to represent. At the last general election I made two promises. I
promised I would try to stop HS2 happening and, failing
that—this was a twin-track approach, if people will excuse the
expression—I said I would try to make sure all their interests
were looked after. I have great belief in the integrity of the current
Secretary of State, and if he is going to discharge his promise to look
after people properly and treat them fairly, he will have to deal
properly with the people I have been trying to
represent.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_31_PT_1/0EA153CD7ADE895E13430412018F4287AC7428EB" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="31 October 2013">Thursday

not be going through the north-east initially. We are talking about 730
jobs, with 3,000 to 5,000 jobs in the supply chain. We also have a new
university technology college opening. Hitachi and other companies in
Newton Aycliffe are in negotiations with Sunderland university to open
the UTC. It will create a plethora of people who are interested in
engineering, electronics and all the other kinds of apprenticeships

technology to build the trains in this country. These trains would not
be imported; they could be built in this country. That would mean 3,200
permanent jobs, not necessarily at Newton Aycliffe, but around the
country, and jobs to maintain the trains as well. The capacity for the

Front Benches does not fool me much. I am pretty sure Labour will play
politics with the project right up to the wire, but if it does go

Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr Straw) attended—where the

proper analysis or costings. You pays your money and you takes your

are two points that I wish to make. First, the Government say, not
unreasonably, that to go ahead with such a big infrastructure project,
they need the support of the main Opposition party. That is perfectly
reasonable, but I have been there before, as have many Members in the
House. I remember when Michael Heseltine was making preparations for
the millennium. He went to the Labour party and said, “Look, I
can’t build a millennium dome unless you commit yourselves to
it.” We committed ourselves to it, and what happened? Well,
there was a good party for the great and the good on new year’s
eve, then attendances at the dome dwindled, we could not give it away,
and eventually we ended up with £600 million of
taxpayers’ money being totally 
<?notus-xml column=1186?>wasted because it had to be given away to AEG for
nothing. That is what happens when we go in for a vanity project
without proper
costings.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000248" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000248">Secondly,
if this is a such a great bargain for the taxpayer and for this
country, why is it not being financed by private capital or foreign
sovereign wealth funds? The Government are no great lover of public
enterprise. Indeed, they are doing their best to pass the very
successful franchise on the east coast line back into private
ownership. That is their position, fine, but why is private capital not
coming into this project? Why are foreign sovereign wealth funds not
coming in? The Government are quite happy to have a new generation of
nuclear reactors built by a state-owned Chinese company that is
answerable to the Chinese politburo, yet this project needs to be paid
for with public money. I suspect the reason is quite simple: private
capital will not touch it with a bargepole, because those involved know
that it cannot be done within the figures that have been talked about.
It will go massively over budget and they are not going to pick up the
bill.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Nottingham South (Lilian Greenwood) whether there
was a pull-out figure for this project. She declined to give me a
figure, and I understand that, but if there is no figure to all intents
and purposes we are signing a blank cheque. If we go along with the
Government and costs escalate—she made a very good point about
degrees of incompetence—what will the pull-out figure be? What
will happen if we get half the line built and all of a sudden the
figure shoots up to nearly £100 billion? What will we do then?

city of Leeds. The benefits it will bring to the north of England are
immense, but they cannot be built on the back of hard-working people
who have invested their livelihoods in their houses and so on. It is
therefore vital that, before we sign the Bill off next spring, proper
compensation is in place in the form of property bonds, and that the
suggestions on rerouting, which are not about “not in my back
yard” but propose sensible alternatives to ensure that the route
follows existing transport corridors or goes through open countryside,
are dealt with. With the best will in the world, we cannot mitigate the
effects of such a development just 30 metres from the back of

and we are at a critical part of the process. The concerns raised in
today’s debate are very important, and many of them were raised
by the Transport Committee two years ago. Some of them have been 
<?notus-xml column=1187?>addressed, but some need to be looked at further. It is now the
responsibility of the Secretary of State, working with High Speed 2, to
ensure that they are dealt with. The concerns relate to the
environment, value for money and ensuring maximum economic benefit,
including giving opportunities during construction for employment and
apprenticeships across the country. The project is essential, but it
must benefit the maximum number of people, and that is the Secretary of
State’s responsibility as we reach this very important
juncture.</hs_Para>

will make one quick point on the impact on my constituents in Rugby. We
currently benefit from a fast and frequent service on the west coast
main line, so with Virgin Trains we can be in London in 50 minutes and
with London Midland we can be there in just under an hour. That is
attractive to businesses coming to Rugby, which we can present as a
great location. My fear is that, if the Bill goes ahead and the money
is given to build High Speed 2, the legacy line will become a stopping
line, with trains stopping at every station as the operator seeks to
maximise revenues, because the city-to-city business will have been
lost—</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-31?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_31_PT_1/2005E55FC89B1D4D1165FA740966E3F06072A675" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="31 October 2013">Thursday

Cryer</B> (Leyton and Wanstead) (Lab):</Member> I applied for an
Adjournment debate on academy schools because Snaresbrook primary
school in my constituency was told some time ago that it was likely to
become an academy. It is clear that the parents, governors, teachers,
staff and surrounding community are opposed to that. The ward
councillors, all three of whom are Conservatives, are also against it.
The campaign is supported, impressively, by

are, however, issues relating to the processes that lead to
academisation—to use a fairly modern sort of phrase. Before I
raise those with the Minister, let me make it clear that I am not
making a party political argument. I was not a fan of academies when
the 
<?notus-xml column=1193?>Labour Government were in power—in fact, I was not a fan of quite
a few things they did. I have not checked this, but a while ago I was
reliably informed that I voted against my own side 84 times when we
were in government. That must be some sort of record and it goes to

agreed that two things contribute to improvements in
schools—good leadership and good teaching—but neither
necessarily arises out of academy status. I am sure there are academies
with good leadership and good teaching, but there are also state
maintained schools that have both those things. Serious concerns have
been highlighted in various media reports about the governance and
accountability in academy schools and free schools, although we are
focusing on academies.</hs_Para>

stories in the press about chains of academies that are starting to
form and which have been accused of moving investment from the schools
to other things. Their chief executives are earning very high, perhaps
inflated salaries, and large sums are spent on hospitality and junkets.
The Select Committee on Education is yet to look at the record of
academies. I am sure it will find that there are good ones, but also
that there are question marks over accountability and democratic
processes, which are not in place.</hs_Para>

by which schools become academies raises questions for the Department
for Education. There are, for instance, conflicts of interest. On
20 December last year, the BBC revealed that at least four
advisers contracted to work on the sponsored academies programme by the
Department for Education are also Ofsted inspectors, which I would say
was a conflict of interest. There are also a number who, according to
the same report, have financial interests with academies and free

offering money—in other words, inducements—to schools,

slightly less, for that purpose. They were told, “If you become

financial inducements, but a lot of pressure put on to a school to
convert to academy status. Does my hon. Friend agree that one reason
there is so much opposition to these conversions is the concern among

Cryer:</Member></B> We had a debate earlier this week about the use of
unqualified teachers. My view is that teachers should be appropriately
qualified, and there is a question about that. Parents also have
serious concerns about admissions. Once the local education authority
is taken out of admissions, who co-ordinates that? Will
there be an element of anarchy because no central body is
controlling admissions? In other words, will it be a

February, <I>The Guardian</I> reported a claim by the National
Association of Head Teachers that academy brokers—that phrase is
new to me—are given targets by the Department for Education on
the number of the schools they must convert. One question I wanted to
ask the Minister is whether those targets exists. Are academy brokers
told, “You have to convert so many schools by such a point in
future”? The same story recorded one head who claimed she had
gone to a meeting and been told she was not allowed to leave until she
had made a decision on the future of her school. Clearly, that is an
unacceptable way to treat anybody, including a head
teacher.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000676" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000676">There
are also examples of head teachers and governors having to concentrate
on demands placed on them by the Department rather than concentrating
on improving the school. I am thinking of schools that have
problems—failing schools in special measures or schools that are
given an Ofsted verdict of requiring improvement. They might find that
their time is taken up engaging with the Department in discussions on
the future status of the school rather than engaging in improving the
school.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000677" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000677">I

have a feeling that, over the next few years, we will see in the media
stories of financial mismanagement arising from a lack of
accountability, checks and balances, and democracy in the governance of
academies and free schools. A parallel can be drawn with the situation
when the Government introduced co-operation for further education
colleges in 1992. Some of the colleges were fine and worked perfectly
well but, because of the lack of accountability, a series of scandals
followed—they were documented pretty closely by a number of
publications—in which some principals, because they were given a
free hand, abused their position. They got up to all sorts of things,
financial and otherwise, that were deeply
questionable.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000679" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000679">To
conclude, I have a number of questions for the Minister. I should like
him to answer them, but if he does not have answers to hand, I should
like him to write to me with the information. Are any contractors who
are paid by the Department also Ofsted inspectors? Is anybody working
in any way for the Department who has a financial interest in academies
and/or free schools? Are academy brokers required by law to abide by
the civil service code of conduct? The answer to that last question was
given some time ago in another Adjournment debate, and it seemed to be
that they are required to abide by the code of conduct. However, in a
later Question Time, the Secretary of State equivocated and did not say
whether they must abide by the code of conduct or
not.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000680" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000680">I

declare any conflicts of interest at the outset of their engagement? In

become academies.

that some children are left to struggle in schools where a large
proportion of the pupils are unable to achieve minimum
standards year after year. We want to find lasting solutions to
underperformance so that all children have the opportunities that they

better outcomes for their pupils, sometimes by transforming under-
performing schools into sponsored academies. In several areas we can
point to dramatic improvements in schools that have been failing for
some years, but with a new sponsor they have seen significant

the hon. Gentleman will appreciate, that is a serious matter where
prompt action is required. As a result of the inspection, we asked the
governing body to consider the benefits of becoming an academy and we
proposed an academy sponsor based on a nearby outstanding school.
Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:39:22"></hs_TimeCode> policy
remains that becoming an academy with the support of a strong sponsor
is often the best way to ensure rapid and sustained improvement.
However, in this case we recognise that Snaresbrook primary school does
not have a long history of underperformance and was previously judged
good by Ofsted.</hs_Para>

also acknowledge that the school has made progress since being placed
in special measures. The local authority acted swiftly in removing the
head teacher and chair of governors, brokering a partnership
arrangement with a nearby outstanding school, and providing specialist
English and maths consultants, among other changes. We also recognise
that in this year’s national tests—not all the data are
checked and in the public domain yet—pupil performance appears
to have improved significantly at key stage 2. We understand that the
school’s results for reading, writing and maths are the best for
five years, and among the highest in Redbridge. I understand that pupil
progression has improved this year, and that the number of pupils
making at least two levels of progress at the end of key stage 2 will
be above the local authority and national average.</hs_Para>

situation, that we needed to review the decision we were making. The
changes led Ofsted to conclude at a monitoring inspection earlier this
month that the school’s improvement plan is fit for purpose.
Inspectors also commented on how leaders have made clear their
expectations and ambitions for the school regaining and sustaining its
former reputation as a high-achieving school. We will therefore
continue to monitor the school’s progress in coming out of
special measures, but, as the hon. Gentleman knows, we do not currently

raised by the hon. Gentleman, academy status has made a big improvement
in transforming underperforming schools, giving them the freedom to
innovate by creating the right conditions for success. In recent years,
the results of sponsored academies have gone up faster than those of
other state-funded schools, and have turned around some of our worst
schools. Their performance has continued to improve this year; in fact,
the longer they are open, the better on average they
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T17:39:15"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103180000699" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/debtext/131031-0004.htm#13103180000699">I
make it clear that sponsored academies remain state schools funded by
the state. All academies are run by non-profit-making charitable

though they were maintained schools.</hs_Para>

and there are a number of routes to that. For communications data, he
will be aware that no warrant is required. He will also be aware that,
with the sole exception of evidence collected by local councils under
RIPA, there is no judicial oversight of any kind at any stage. I am not
aware of exceptions to that, and that is a weakness. There is an
internal process—I do not doubt the good intentions of the
people who work on this—but there is no independent external
oversight from a judicial process, which is what many of us would like

Tom Watson</B> (West Bromwich East) (Lab):</Member> Information can be
the most powerful thing in the world. It has changed everything more
quickly and universally than ever before. The internet is all about
information. The power of the internet is the power of information.
Data can do almost anything. That is why it is so important that they
do not end up in the wrong hands, and so important that our data, which
we as individuals own, and which are our stake in the data galaxy, just
as our vote is our stake in our democracy, are not unnecessarily taken
without our
consent<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:56:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000081" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000081">I
ask colleagues to remember in the rest of this debate that an
individual’s data are just like his or her vote: almost
insignificant by itself, privately expressed; but massively powerful
when aggregated. We should no more unnecessarily tamper with our
citizens’ data than we should impede their ability to vote. The
capacity to deduce human behaviour and activity in the modern world of
big data is impacting on our daily lives, from insurance premiums and
health prevention through to online advertising and traffic management.
Corporations are crunching data to learn about the way we live our
lives<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:57:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000082" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000082">At
the heart of this cross-party debate today is GCHQ’s own big
data programme—Tempora—and its impact on our
citizens’ fundamental rights. It is a new and profoundly
challenging issue for policy makers. We have to answer questions about
the nature, scale and depth of surveillance that should be tolerated in
our democracy. My concern about this area of public policy in the UK is
that the question has not yet been put. We have avoided discussing this
matter in all but whispered tones, while the legislatures of the US,
Brazil and Europe have been rocked by the Snowden revelations. Yet in
the UK, the main parties have paid scant attention to the
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:58:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000083" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000083">The
problem is this: the GCHQ Tempora programme has been mining our
internet communications data without public knowledge on a colossal
scale. There has been little public and parliamentary debate about
whether that conforms to article 8 of the European convention on human
rights, which protects the right to private and family life and
correspondence. Nor has there been sufficient public or parliamentary

has there been sufficient public or parliamentary debate on whether
Tempora is authorised by any other pieces of legislation. In fact, we
only know of the existence of the Tempora programme because
of the actions of Edward Snowden and <I>The Guardian</I> newspaper. I
think that they have acted courageously in the public interest to
uncover and reveal a secret Government programme 
<?notus-xml column=343?>that has gained access to the private communications of millions of
individuals without their knowledge. A brave whistleblower and a
courageous newspaper have enabled us only now to start
tohave a full and proper debate about whether such
surveillance is proportionate and, indeed, legal under our existing
legislation, treaties and
agreements.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:59:58"></hs_TimeCode> That
is the secret state laid bare: the Government acting without the
knowledge or permission of their citizens, which is a flagrant breach
of individuals’ moral and, probably, legal rights, for what they
believe is the common good. Just like when they take away the votes of
the misguided, the common good is not a defence. Our basic rights as
individuals have to be
sacrosanct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T13:59:55"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000087">Let
us be clear. If the Minister is telling us that the law permits such
fundamental abuse of liberty, the law is wrong and must be changed. I
suspect that he may point to section 16 of RIPA to suggest that the
Tempora programme is legal. Interpreting that section requires the
unravelling of a triple-nested inversion of meanings across six
cross-referenced subsections linked to a dozen other cross-linked
definitions, which are all dependent on a highly ambiguous
“notwithstanding.” The section is probably the single
most confusing and complex drafting ever put on the statute book, and I
have heard that a former GCHQ director said it was drafted in that way
intentionally; it is what a computer programme would call
“spaghetti code.” There is not a snowball’s chance
on a hot day in Strasbourg that the section would pass the tests of
foreseeability and quality of law required by the European convention
on human rights. The UK already lost a critical test of the case on
those grounds in
2008<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:01:08"></hs_TimeCode>. One thing
is abundantly clear: they are not extra safeguards, as is falsely
claimed in the section heading; they are intended to allow GCHQ to
trawl inside the UK, as Lord Lucas observed in another place on 12 July
2000<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:01:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000088">This

am sure that the Prime Minister will be relieved that his phone is not
the subject of surveillance by an ally, but is the Deputy Prime

today that UK phone records are not routinely handed en masse by

internet logs are also held by Virgin, Sky, BT, TalkTalk and other
internet service providers. Will the Government reassure us that those

<I>The Washington Post </I>claimed that the NSA and GCHQ were tapping
into the fibre-optic cables used to supply the data centres of 
<?notus-xml column=344?>Google and Yahoo! To achieve that, the telecoms companies that provide
infrastructure to those organisations had to have knowledge of, and
probably collaborated with, the procedure. Was any member of the UK

make it clear, <I>The Washing</I><I>ton</I><I> Post </I>is saying that
telecoms companies have been illicitly aiding the security services to
tap into data being processed by internet companies with which they
have a commercial relationship. Those telecoms companies, which are the
backbone of this wonderful thing called the internet that has allowed
two decades of free expression and creativity to explode into the lives
of our citizens, have been operating in the shadows to allow our
security services to tap all of
it<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:03:36"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000093">The
security services have clearly made the trade-off that the intelligence
obtained is worth the invasion of privacy. They are judged on the
quality of the intelligence they obtain and little else. Of course they
are going to make that trade-off 100% of the time. I want to know
whether the telecoms companies have voluntarily entered into that
agreement, or whether they have been obliged to do so under UK or US
law<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:04:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000094" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000094">Before
I conclude, I draw the Minister’s attention to a submission to
the Select Committee on Defence—I draw hon. Members’
attention to my entry in the register—by the all-party group on
drones, which I chair. The submission examines the idea of citizenship
stripping in detail. The Bureau of Investigative Journalism has
highlighted the uneasy relationship between the deprivation of
citizenship, intelligence sharing with the US and the targeting of
former British citizens in drone strikes in
Somalia.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000095" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000095">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:04:42"></hs_TimeCode>
concern is that citizenship may remove one obstacle to information
sharing for the purposes of targeting British people. In particular,
one former UK citizen, Berjawi, was targeted immediately following a
telephone call to his wife in London, who had just given birth and was
recovering in hospital. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the family allege that
Berjawi and his wife’s mobile telephones were tapped and
location data were shared with the CIA to target
him.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000096">David<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T14:05:06"></hs_TimeCode>
Omand, the ex-head of GCHQ, in his submission to the Select Committee
on Home Affairs wrote about the likely intensification of tension
between nations that unilaterally defend their interests with military
means, including targeted killings, and those that seek collective
security under international human rights law. He mentioned the
“ethically ambiguous” position of the British public
because they had benefited from the US drone programme, even though it
would not be permitted in the UK. That cannot be right. The British
public would surely be alarmed to hear that data collected in the UK
might end up being used to implement the US targeted killing programme

the Member for West Bromwich East (Mr Watson) spoke about the latest
technology. I opposed my own Government on identity cards because I
thought they would be an intrusion into civil liberties. Such documents
should not be introduced, except perhaps in war time, because they
would not assist in the struggle against terrorism in any way. I was
pleased that they dropped the proposal, but the growth in information
technology to which reference has been made several times during the
debate and the amount of 
<?notus-xml column=350?>information that the intelligence agencies can accumulate would have
been unthinkable even 10 years ago and in some ways that dwarfs the
dangers posed by identity cards. That is why I take the view that it is
unlikely that the parliamentary oversight that we are debating today,
despite some of the changes that I am pleased about, including the
additional powers that have been given to the Committee, will be
effective, but oversight is
essential.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000139" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000139">Going

is the most blatant threat to the press in recent times. It says in
effect, “Do as I say or the Government will take the necessary
measures.” That is all the more unfortunate while we are
debating a royal charter that is being described as no threat to the
press. What the Prime Minister said on Monday is very much a threat to
the press. I tabled a question to the Prime Minister asking what
information had appeared in <I>The Guardian</I> on intelligence matters
that the Government objected to on security grounds. The answer, which
I could have given when I tabled the question, was that he had nothing

add.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000141" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000141"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Wallace" PimsId="4502" UID="13103154000344" xid="860" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000344">Mr

Winnick:</Member></B> Indeed. No newspaper should be above the law, as
I understand the position at the moment. I must be careful because
something that is taking place in the courts is sub judice, but it
demonstrates that newspapers are not above the law. When they break the
law, they can be charged like any individual. I believe in a free press
and I have mentioned the paper that is in the spotlight at the moment.
If it were <I>The Sun, </I>the<I> Daily Mail </I>or<I> The Times, </I>I
would take the same view. I do not take the view that I do because the
newspaper in question happens to be <I>The Guardian</I><I>. </I>I take
it because a newspaper has the right to publish material that it
believes is in the national interest. That is a free press, which I
happen to be in favour of. I would have hoped that the hon. Gentleman
was also in favour of that. In the argument on another subject, it has
been said that we have had a free press for more than 300 years. It has
had many setbacks during those 300 years, but I am keen that we should
continue to have a free press and not something that is more like what
happened in the past in eastern
Europe.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000143" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000143">I
have two hopes about the present situation. I hope that <I>The
Guardian</I> will not give way, and that it will demonstrate that it
will continue to publish what it believes is important. It is
interesting that the Prime Minister said in response to a Conservative
Member that the paper had agreed not to publish certain matters, so
suggestions of irresponsibility are not
relevant.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000144" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000144">I
also hope that there will be sufficient parliamentary support for what
the paper is doing. If we believe in  a free press, and no one
on the Government side or 
<?notus-xml column=351?>members of the Intelligence and Security Committee would disagree for
one moment that there needs to be a free press, I hope that we will
uphold the right of <I>The Guardian </I>to do what it is doing and
resist the Government’s pressure and blackmail. It is absolutely
essential that the information that Snowden has revealed, which is not
helping the terrorists, but which we should know about
it—really, to a large extent, it was done in our
name—should be in the public domain, and I am glad that it
is.</hs_Para>

accused of no crime. There has been no comment in any articles in
recent weeks that GCHQ or our intelligence service have behaved
illegally. That is not to say that improvements do not need to be made,
particularly in terms of metadata and how they are analysed. We should
also consider the types of people who are commissioners. Why do we not
look outwith the judiciary and start looking at, say, a retired bishop
or somebody from another walk of life? However, in terms of the subject
today—the oversight and framework of our intelligence

want to focus my attention on an important challenge to our security
services, and that is our excellent British press. Almost every
newspaper has played an important role in challenging the intelligence
services over recent months with their reporting on the Snowden leaks.
That is an important role, but the point that I want to make today is
that one newspaper, in seeking to raise important issues, and
absolutely having the right to do so, has overstepped the mark to such
a degree that the very thing that our intelligence services are trying
to protect—our national security—is threatened.

want to raise two or three issues today. On 4 October,
<I>The Guardian </I>reported on the Tor network—the black
internet—where child pornography, drug trafficking and arms
trading take place. Please look at the detail of that report. If people
look at the trial, in June, of one of the most active child
pornographers in Ireland, they will see that the NSA and the activities
of the intelligence services were key to apprehending and
hopefully—it is likely—putting him away. However, on 4
October, <I>The Guardian </I>went into a level of detail that the
previous head of GCHQ decried as being wrong, and which many people in
the police world feel will cause major issues in terms of picking up
people engaged in organised crime.</hs_Para>

the issue of the documents that <I>The Guardian </I>holds, when hon.
Members talk about prosecutions not happening and things not really
being that bad, I ask them to look at the online discussions that
<I>Guardian </I>editors have had. They have admitted to sending
internationally the most detailed documents and underlying data about
GCHQ specifically. I do not want to talk too much about David Miranda
today, but his data were on a games console. Those data, in data dumps
throughout the world, are still out there, and hackers claim that they
have access to it. <I>The Independent</I>, which also had access to
those documents, started reporting on them but then stopped because it
realised that to do so was problematic. The issue with <I>The Guardian
</I>is current; the data are out there and are a danger to our national
security.</hs_Para>

position, and I believe that there is quite a lot of tension at <I>The
Guardian </I>on the approach it has taken, it would have a discussion
with the Government, who have been very clear. Look at the witness
statements for the Miranda trial. They have been so careful about
ensuring that they do not interfere with <I>The Guardian </I>as a
newspaper and with its right to report. However, <I>The Guardian
</I>should come forward now and tell the Government what intelligence
data it has overseas and where those intelligence data are. Is there

I hope that he will forgive me for being none too specific in my
answer. Part of our responsibility, which did not just emerge after the
revelations about Prism, is to look at what the agencies do, what their
capacities are and how they use those capacities. It is a continuous
process. We have in the head of GCHQ. We take evidence. We probe what
it is doing and what it is capable of doing. Therefore, it is not that
we did not have any concerns or any interest in what GCHQ was capable
of. That is an ongoing process, but inevitably, when something new
emerges, it is appropriate that, as a Committee, we look into
it.</hs_Para>

clear that spies spy. That is no big revelation. Britain spies, as do
other countries, to protect itself and to further its interests. If we
were to discover that banks in, say, Liechtenstein were hiding British
taxpayers’ money and refusing to reveal which British citizens
were avoiding paying tax, I believe that it would be perfectly
legitimate for British intelligence services to go there and find out
who those tax avoiders were. To do so would not protect us against
terrorism, but it would protect Britain’s interests.</hs_Para>

venture to suggest that it is right for our spies to go abroad and find
out which countries are not playing by the rules—which countries
are cheating and stealing our secrets—to protect British
industry, British jobs and British national security. That is what
spies do, and we should be proud of the fact that we do it particularly
well. In fact, we do it better than most across the globe, and it gives
Britain a place at the top table. That is not to be sniffed

Already, without being a member of a security service or a Government,

when they bought their car and what their credit rating is. I can

introduced, and I did not have to sign off anything, keep a log or

legislation, but it was an attempt to put on a statutory basis what we
were doing to protect our agents, our personnel and the functions that
we carry out. Let us remember that spying is dangerous. It is about
risk. Our men and women in Cheltenham, in Vauxhall and all over the
country put their lives at risk to protect Britain, and there is a
serious downside to getting it wrong. If they get it wrong, they do not
get charged the wrong price, or something of the sort; if they get it
wrong, people die. If that happens, constituents get very upset, and
the country becomes less secure. Terrorists start to win; countries
that are not our friends or allies start to win; and British industry
starts to lose out. Spying has a strong role to play, but getting it
wrong carries great
risks.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000189" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000189">I
will not go on about <I>The Guardian</I>, but I will make one or two
points. First, the newspaper has yet to specify any crime committed by
the British Government, authorities or spies, even though that is what
its public interest defence hinges on. It has yet to produce any
evidence that British spies are breaking British laws. It is
welcome to do so at any time, and I would be delighted to discuss that
in a meeting with the editor of <I>The </I><I>Guardian</I>. Until he
publishes such evidence, however, the reports amount to saying,
“Yahoo! Look how exciting technology is. Look what we can
do.” That is not a public interest defence; that is an attempt

do we know the whole picture? I am assured that grown-up people in
<I>The Guardian </I>are sitting down in a sealed room and looking
through all the evidence. Perhaps they could have asked for help from
their former features editor, Richard Gott, who had to resign in 1994
after allegations emerged that he had taken money from the KGB. He
would have been a good man to review the
evidence.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000191" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000191">Who
should be the judge and jury in this case? I venture to suggest that a
state with some form of oversight would be a better judge and jury than
a whole load of journalists locking themselves up in a room with the
evidence. Until <I>The Guardian</I> produces evidence of a crime that
our agents are supposed to have committed, it has no public interest
defence. That is all that it has  to answer, and I will defend
its right to publish if it produces evidence of a
crime.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103154000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000192"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Winnick" PimsId="4647" UID="13103154000364" xid="643" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103154000364">Mr

I have mentioned of Binyam Mohamed, who was tortured with the knowledge
of MI5 officers? I am not aware that such information was reported to
the Intelligence and Security Committee, or that it took the initiative
in trying to find out whether other such cases occurred. To a large
extent, oversight has been defective,

which is why we introduced new legislation to give greater powers to
the Intelligence and Security Committee. It does not have to take
things at face value; it can appoint an investigator to go in and do
what it wants to do, not what it is told to do. I recognise that there
have been failures in the past, but that is why, step by step over the
past 20 years, we have seen layer on layer of new legislation and new
oversight. Yes, there were failures and no one is perfect, but our

Of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:10:00"></hs_TimeCode> course, GCHQ
is proud to insist that none of that is at all likely, because it

the equivalent of sending all the data in all the books in the British

550 British and American analysts ploughing through the

Minister can modify the report in any way he or she chooses and then
publish it without any indication of the changes, or publish it in
redacted form, or not publish it at all. That is not serious scrutiny.
It is a safe cover for the Prime Minister, to give the impression that
a difficult and sometimes, for the Government, embarrassing issue has
been properly investigated, when, in fact, MI5 or GCHQ disclose to the
Committee only what they choose, and the Prime Minister reveals what

their disclosure would genuinely put national security at
risk—in which case of course there would be no question of their
being revealed—as opposed to merely being inconvenient to the
security services or the Government, as has so often proved the case in
the past. The Information Commissioner’s decision would be

not from them but from the Snowden files, what the NSA in the US and
GCHQ in Britain were really up to, including monitoring the phones of
Angela Merkel and 35 other world leaders—one wonders how much
else—and that all assurances about privacy were not worth the
e-mails that they were written on. The Intelligence and Security
Committee never found out or told us. We were assured by its current
Chair—whom I greatly respect—that the security services
always acted strictly in accordance with the law, that all operations
were officially approved and that there was nothing to worry about. It

Malcolm Rifkind</B> (Kensington) (Con):</Member> These are serious
matters, but may I start on a slightly lighter note? It has been
reported today that Mr Snowden has obtained new employment in
Moscow—this is quite true—on a Russian website. We have
been told that which website it is could not be revealed on the grounds
of security, so there is clearly a need for a Russian whistleblower, if

the time available, I will concentrate on two matters. The first is
that the ISC is quite willing to be criticised, but I think that all
its members would prefer to be criticised by people who have taken the
trouble to find out what Parliament has approved in the past 12 months
and how the new ISC has been
constituted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:30:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000003" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000003">When
the current Committee came into existence at the beginning of this
Parliament, our first work was to review all the existing powers. We
came to the conclusion that the original 1994 Act was out of date and
needed to be replaced. We put a series of recommendations  to
the Government, who accepted 99% of them, and the Opposition were of a
similar
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:30:30"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000004" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000004">I
remind right hon. and hon. Members, or those who are apparently not
aware of them, of the fundamental changes that have been made. First,
under the new 
<?notus-xml column=367?>legislation, we now report to Parliament, not to the Prime
Minister. Secondly, as I have said, Parliament has the last word on who
the Committee members are. Thirdly, contrary to the suggestion by
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:30:54"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Oldham West and Royton (Mr Meacher) that the Prime Minister
should continue to appoint the Chairman, the Committee will in future
choose the Chairman from among its own members. That is a big
change.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000005" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000005">My
second point is that the powers have been transformed. For all the
years since the Committee came into existence, we could not require
intelligence agencies to give us information that they did not wish to
provide. We could make requests, to which they often acceded, but we
could not require them to do so. The new legislation requires them to
respond and give us the information we
seek<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:31:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000006" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000006">Until
now, the legislation did not even mention the most important part of
agencies’ activities—their operations. Any Committee
involvement in operations was incidental or at the request of the Prime
Minister, or it was done voluntarily when agencies were willing to
co-operate. Now we have not just the opportunity but the right to
demand from the agencies all information regarding nationally
significant operations, including retrospectively. They cannot refuse;
it is our
right<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000007" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000007">The
right hon. Gentleman and other critics may not be aware of this, and
perhaps there is no reason why they should be, but I must tell them
that one of the changes taking place—for example, in respect to
our current inquiry on Woolwich—is that, although as part of our
investigations the agencies normally sent us a report with such raw
material or parts of their files as they thought appropriate, we now
have the right, which we are exercising, to send our staff into GCHQ,
MI5 or MI6 to look at files that are relevant to our investigation and
they, not the agencies, decide what the Committee might want to see. To
be fair to the agencies, we are doing so with their full
co-operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:32:47"></hs_TimeCode>. It
is a cultural revolution in the agencies’ work to allow people
who are not even part of their staff or involved in government into
their building.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:33:02"></hs_TimeCode>
transformation in the Committee’s powers ought to be borne in
mind by those who say that the present Committee—not the former
one—does not have the powers to do the required

the faintest idea whether the Committee was aware of programmes of any

independent Committee having access to top secret information, whatever
that is, is that we do not announce what such information is. If he can
devise a system whereby secret information can be made available to all
law-abiding British citizens, without its being simultaneously made
available to the rest of the world, I am interested in hearing about
it, but I do not think that he is likely to meet that

right hon. and learned Friend the Member for Kensington (Sir Malcolm

right to make important points about the Committee’s increased
powers and remit. I add that the Committee now has a remit to examine
not only operational issues relating to the three intelligence agencies
but it can examine the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism within
the Home Office, the Ministry of Defence’s intelligence arm and
the Cabinet Office. Its ambit has been radically and importantly

the ability to oversee operational activities for the first time is
helping strike an important balance that we as legislators and

</B><B>Buckland</B><B>:</B></Member> My hon. Friend is right. The
challenge will get ever more complex, so the skills needed will be the
sort that we may not even have thought of yet. It is that type of
environment. In a nutshell, the status quo will never be an option when
it comes to intelligence and security, which is why I welcome warmly
the Committee’s intention to consider the operation of the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, or RIPA, as we have been
calling it all
afternoon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000032" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000032">As
I said earlier in an intervention, RIPA was a response to
what was seen as a deficiency in United Kingdom law in a number of
cases that the Strasbourg Court considered relating to the interception
of communications. RIPA was seen as an important consolidation of
powers that had already been given to the police that, as we have
heard, were extended to other agencies in a way that caused controversy
and proper concern. The Government have done much work to roll that
back, but RIPA itself is now in need of an update.</hs_Para>

of the argument that we have heard in this debate, there is agreement
that, for whatever motive, RIPA needs careful consideration. The
intention behind the Government’s proposals on data retention
and collection involved the need to update RIPA. Using that consensus
gives us the potential to ensure that the Act is as up-to-date as
possible. The challenge will be how to future-proof it. I do not have
an easy answer. As we know, in the world of information technology, to
use a well-worn phrase, change is the only constant.</hs_Para>

that we have moved from an era when privacy in our own homes and of our
personal chattels was important into an era when our personal data are
the most valuable thing that we possess. When it comes to the retention
of our personal data, the right to privacy is under challenge as never
before. Article 8 has been mentioned, quite properly, by several
Members including, among others,
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:43:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

has also been rightly pointed out that that right is qualified on
grounds not only of national security but of crime prevention, health
protection and, lastly and importantly, protection of the rights and
freedoms of others. Herein lies the passion with which
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:44:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Wyre and Preston North (Mr Wallace) addressed the House
earlier. He believes firmly and rightly that the activities of the
security services are meant to guarantee the freedoms  of all
of us. Therefore, the qualification in article 8 is emblematic of the
balance that must be struck when we come to such issues.</hs_Para>

on one aspect of the debate on which we have not touched today. It
concerns schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000, which is particularly
relevant in the David Miranda case. I will not dwell on that matter
specifically, but I will discuss the important work of David Anderson
QC, the independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, who makes
important and helpful recommendations to the Government about how we
can get the balance right on significant issues such as terrorism
prevention and investigation measures, control orders and the use of
schedule
7.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000037" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000037">I
am a member of the Joint Committee on Human Rights. We have considered
carefully the Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill, which
recommends, among other things, that schedule 7 be changed to get the
balance right. We broadly welcome the Government’s intention to
reduce the scope of that provision, but there is an important point to
note when it comes to use of the more intrusive powers in schedule 7.
Whereas reasonable suspicion must be the threshold for the police and
other authorities to stop, question and search travellers, there is
concern that the same threshold is necessary for the use of more
intrusive powers, such as detention for up to six hours, search and
seizure of personal electronic devices or the taking and retention of
DNA samples or fingerprints without
consent.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000038" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000038">Our
Committee’s view was that the threshold of reasonable suspicion
should come into play at the point when a person is formally detained,
which under the new provisions in the Bill will be one hour after
questioning. That is a small but important example of the need to
ensure that when powers are exercised, as they properly should
be—the Committee welcomed the use in principle of those
powers—we as a state use identifiable and understandable
thresholds before going down the line of intrusive use of power. We
urge the Government to consider that point carefully in their response
to the
Committee.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000039" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0001.htm#13103173000039">Much
has been made of the revelations concerning Edward Snowden.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T15:47:17"></hs_TimeCode> right hon.
Member for Knowsley (Mr Howarth) put it well. The issue of
whether <I>The Guardian </I>has broken the law is a moot point;
the Official Secrets Act 1989 requires several thresholds. It requires
the leave of the Director of Public Prosecutions or the

actions of <I>The Guardian </I>were wise. I do not think so.

nuclear proliferation, cyber-attacks, attacks on our intellectual

our laws and our ability to review the intelligence agencies are
properly supervised, we should not be naive or foolish in any way about
the threats to our nation. Above all, we must remember that the primary
duty of any Government is the protection of their citizens. Within
that, the most important new power of the ISC is its ability to hold to

perhaps regrettably—historians are grateful—revealed the
secret that, as a result of the development of the Enigma machine, we
were decrypting codes during the war that people thought were
unbreakable. The book was published. Its author was F. W. Winterbotham.
If I remember correctly, his role was to be in charge of the signals
liaison units, which comprised members of the special services who were
involved in the distribution of the Enigma decrypts and who were spread
around all parts of the military infrastructure that received that
intelligence. In other words, they were crucially aware of the need to
keep top secret material secure. As such, they had special security
arrangements to prevent anything like the Snowden case and the Bradley
Manning case from happening. There is a huge gap in the security

That information is available to the police and is used in many

we then have access to the irrelevant parts of the haystack, or legally

the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:01:32"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Cambridge. In his defence of <I>The Guardian</I> newspaper, he said
that it is precisely because <I>The Guardian</I> is not simply
publishing everything that has fallen into its hands that it is acting
responsibly. We can argue the finer points of that; he certainly has an
arguable case. Where there can be no argument, however, is in the case
of a person who steals the mass database and transmits it to other
unauthorised individuals or organisations, or indeed newspapers, when
he cannot possibly have read or in any way assessed whether the
contents of that database had been properly collected or whether an
abuse of the intelligence services’ powers had in fact taken
place. That person is not acting responsibly, so the hon. Member for
West Bromwich East (Mr Watson), whom I always admire, should be a
little more careful before ascribing the term “brave
whistleblower” to someone like
Snowden<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:03:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000072" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000072">Snowden
is no more a whistleblower than someone like Julian Assange or anyone

it is classified secret or top secret. Basically, their rationale can
only be that they do not think anything should ever be classified
secret or top secret. Once they admit that there is a purpose in
classifying some information, and that some information ought to be
kept secret, then we get into the area of who decides what should be

has spent much of the past year debating the oversight of the
intelligence services through part 1 of the Justice and Security Act
2013, which redefines the role of the Intelligence and Security
Committee. I will return to that in a moment, but I concede that the
part did not perhaps catch the public consciousness—given some
of the comments made by hon. Members today, that is true of the House,
too—in quite the same way as <I>The Guardian</I>’s
revelations<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:10:43"></hs_TimeCode>.
Even the Deputy Prime Minister, given his recent comments to the media,
appears to have missed the reforms that strengthened the Intelligence
and Security Committee. That is surprising, considering he has 19
special advisers. I would have thought that 
<?notus-xml column=378?>one of them might have picked up on the reforms. Because of all that, I
am pleased to have this opportunity to debate the
subject<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:11:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000088" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000088">The
concept that many people have of the intelligence agencies is James
Bond or, perhaps more recently, “Spooks.” The reality is
that terrorists and organised criminals have been quick to adopt new
technology, which means that the nature of our intelligence agencies
has changed over the past few years, too. Electronic surveillance is
now the key asset in the battle against terrorism. It is therefore
appropriate that today’s debate has mainly focused on electronic
surveillance. The key question seems to be whether the intelligence
services have exceeded the powers given them under the Regulation of
Investigatory Powers Act
2000.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000089" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000089">Surveillance
is covered by parts 2 and 3 of RIPA, and intrusive surveillance is
described by section 26. An example of intrusive surveillance is
placing a device in someone’s property, which requires a warrant
from the Home Secretary, the Northern Ireland Secretary or the Foreign
Secretary if conducted abroad. The relevant Secretary of State has to
be convinced that the surveillance is necessary and proportionate. That
form of surveillance is easily
understood<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:12:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000090" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000090">Part
1 of RIPA covers remote electronic surveillance, which is where things
get a bit more complicated.  Chapter 1 addresses the
interception of an individual’s communications—telephone
communications, e-mails and texts—and it is only under that
chapter that the contents of such communications may be accessed. There
are extensive safeguards on the use of chapter 1 powers. Their use must
be necessary, proportionate and in the interests of protecting national
security, detecting or preventing serious crime or safeguarding the
UK’s economic interest. A warrant must be issued by the Home
Secretary for each individual whose data are

2 of part 1 addresses the acquisition of communications data more
generally, which is more about the who, the where, the what and the
when, rather than the contents. The rules on that are not as stringent
as for chapter
1.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000092" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000092">Generally,
I believe that RIPA is poorly understood among the general public and,
I think, among Members of Parliament. Only once we understand the
framework can we look to the oversight bodies to ensure that the
intelligence services are staying within that framework. Probably the
most important level of oversight is from Ministers. They are
answerable to Parliament and the
public<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:13:40"></hs_TimeCode> for all
the actions of the intelligence
agencies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000093" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000093">Will
the Minister assure me that he has seen no evidence that the

1, chapter 1 without the necessary warrants being in

course, oversight requires much more than just a Minister. The
Intelligence and Security Committee was formed in 1994 and reformed
earlier this year by the Justice and Security Act. The Opposition
supported those reforms. Indeed, in some key areas we would have liked
to have gone further. We support the long-term aspiration that the ISC
should become a Select Committee, which we believe would allow the
public a clear understanding of how the Committee works and the
processes it operates.</hs_Para>

would also give clear protections to both the Committee and its
witnesses. We appreciate that that may be a gradual process, and we
support the changes to move the ISC towards becoming a Committee of
Parliament with open
proceedings<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:14:35"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Labour party has always said that it believes the ISC is the right body
to investigate the allegations against Tempora, and we have confidence
in its
investigation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:14:44"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000096">I
also believe that the ISC, which is composed of very senior and
experienced politicians, appreciates the need to restore public
confidence. Indeed, I believe that the agencies appreciate that, too.
During the passage of the Justice and Security Act, I was struck by
comments made in the other place by the noble Baroness
Manningham-Buller, who said that public confidence is vital for the
agencies because of the degree to which they rely on the
public’s
co-operation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-31T16:15:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103173000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/halltext/131031h0002.htm#13103173000097">We
have heard that 7 November will be a momentous day in the
Committee’s history, as it will hold its first public session
with the heads of the three agencies. Over the past three years, the
public have started to understand Parliament a little better through
things such as Rupert Murdoch’s appearance before the Select
Committee on Culture, Media and Sport. I hope the public will take a

Friend the Member for Knowsley said, it would be good to raise the

is absolutely essential, but much of it must necessarily take place
behind closed doors to ensure that secret intelligence remains secret.
That has to be a key theme in the work undertaken, because although I
recognise the desire for transparency—I have heard the points
about that very clearly—at the same time there has to be a role
for secrets in order for our agencies to conduct the work that they do.
That information should not be kept unnecessarily out of the public
domain, but secrecy is essential to safeguard sensitive methods and
sources, and to protect the lives of those who agree to work for us on
the basis of confidentiality and anonymity.</hs_Para>

is a semantic point, but there is a difference between transparency and
scrutiny, and this debate is about scrutiny. We are talking about new
technological abilities to process huge amounts of data that may not
have been empowered by very old legislation, or at least are tenuously
empowered by old legislation. What I hope he can explain today is why
Tempora, which is a whole new raft of intelligence gathering, was not

safeguarding their work. However, I can also say to him very clearly
that arrangements are in place to ensure that GCHQ neither obtains nor
discloses any material except so far as necessary in pursuit of its
statutory functions, as defined in the Intelligence Services Act 1994,

Government thank the petitioners for raising  this
important issue in the House of Commons. The Government are committed
to encouraging more responsible dog ownership and agree that dog
attacks causing death or injury are unacceptable and must be tackled.
For this reason, the Government announced a package of measures on 6
February 2013 to encourage more responsible dog
ownership.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13103163000022" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/petntext/131031p0001.htm#13103163000022">The
Anti-social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Bill 2013, currently in the
House of Lords, extends the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991 so that the offence
of having a dog dangerously out of control applies regardless of
whether it occurs on public or private property. This will provide the
police and the Crown Prosecution Service with an appropriate legal base
for taking forward prosecutions as necessary. The Bill also creates an
explicit offence where a dog is dangerously out of control in relation
to an assistance dog such as a guide dog. The Government look forward
to the successful progression of this Bill through the House of Lords
before it receives Royal
Assent.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13103163000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/petntext/131031p0001.htm#13103163000023">The
same Bill will also provide practitioners with faster and more flexible
powers that allow them to tackle all types of anti-social behaviour
within communities. For example, the Community Protection Notice is an
early intervention power that will allow officers to address
irresponsible dog ownership in any form. For example, notices served
could require an individual to remedy their behaviour by attending a
dog behaviour or training class. The exact form of a Dog Control
Notice, as proposed in the petition, is unclear. However, all of the
models that have been proposed are weaker and less flexible than the
Community Protection
Notice.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13103163000024" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/petntext/131031p0001.htm#13103163000024">The
adaptability of these powers removes the need for numerous stand-alone
notices for each separate form of anti-social behaviour and also allows
officers to develop innovative local solutions that address the cause
as well as the effect of the
behaviour.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13103163000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/petntext/131031p0001.htm#13103163000025">The
Government also propose to increase the maximum prison sentences for
allowing a dog to be dangerously out of control and causing death or
injury to a person or an assistance dog. An amendment to Dangerous Dogs
Act 1991 will be laid in Parliament to increase the maximum sentences,
to make them more comparable to related driving offences. The maximum
penalty for causing death by dangerous driving, for example, stands at
14 years.</hs_Para>

addition, the Government are drafting regulations so that microchipping
for all dogs will be compulsory from April 2016. This welfare measure
will allow for quicker reunification of lost pets with their owners and
significantly reduce the time stray dogs spend in kennels, which is
distressing for both dogs and owners and costly for local authorities
and
charities.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13103163000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/petntext/131031p0001.htm#13103163000027">Further

Parliamentary Standing Orders specify a minimum period of 56 days for

projects, with minimum periods of only 21 days under the Town and

consultations on the draft Environmental Statement and the proposed
design refinements, along with a further consultation on property
compensation. A consultation is also under way on the route for Phase 2
of the route. This is a significant level of consultation which means
that those people affected by HS2 are in a very informed position to be

operational matter for chief constables. Any use would need to comply
with existing Civil Aviation Authority regulations. Covert use by a
public authority likely to obtain private information, including by any
law enforcement agency, would be subject to authorisation under the
Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000. That Act requires that
covert investigatory techniques are used only if they are necessary and
proportionate for purposes such as preventing or detecting crime or in
the interests of national security. It makes deployment subject to

the public's confidence and trust in justice, and better reflecting the
society it serves. This Government has made a number of changes through
the Crime and Courts Act 2013 that we believe will promote judicial
diversity. We have introduced part time working in the senior courts,
including the Supreme Court, we have enabled the equal merit provision
for judicial appointments to allow protected characteristics to be
taken into account where two applicants are of equal merit, and a
statutory duty for the Lord Chancellor and Lord Chief Justice to
encourage judicial

area for promotion and is highlighted within VisitEngland's thematic
marketing campaigns. VisitEngland identified seaside tourism as an area
that needed particular attention when it created the Strategic
Framework for Tourism (2010-20) and accompanying Tourism Action Plans.
Several seaside towns have also been involved in match-funded
destination promotions using funding from the regional growth fund.
Further to this, DCLG have a “Coastal Communities Fund”,
which is designed to support the economic development of coastal
communities. In 2012-13, the Government committed £23.7 million
to support this fund, which has been increased to £27 million

promote economic growth and regeneration in coastal and seaside towns.
The Coastal Communities Fund was launched in 2012 to invest in projects
supporting growth and jobs in coastal communities so they are better
able to respond to local needs and opportunities. 26 projects approved
in its first year are expected to deliver around 5,000 jobs and support
more than 300 new business start-ups. We will be announcing a further
round of grant awards to successful projects
shortly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13103188000316" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131031/text/131031w0002.htm#13103188000316">A

underestimate, because projects coming on line in 2012-13 for FITs and
2014-15 for the RO will not receive a full year of support, as they are
only supported from the point at which they begin generating. In the

tariffs in a tariff information label, which will include any

the NHS to keep patient's confidential information safe and secure.
Individual NHS organisations are legally accountable for complying with
