concerns regarding its inability to access the funding that supports
victims in Northern Ireland. I know that is a concern for it, but it is
for the Northern Ireland Executive to decide whether they open up those

possible to make the case for the extension of the NCA’s
activities in Northern Ireland. It is also worth bearing it in mind
that there were some ways in which the legislation on the NCA would
have strengthened accountability in Northern Ireland, because it would
have extended the remit of the police ombudsman to proceeds of crime
matters, which are not currently covered by the policing and justice
settlement. In many ways, the legislation, which does not currently
have agreement in Northern Ireland, would have enabled us to strengthen
accountability on police activities in Northern Ireland.</hs_Para>

gives the Executive a choice and, unless there is consensus across the

about cost-of-living pressures. That is why the Government have taken
steps to cut income tax for more than 600,000 people in Northern
Ireland, have taken 75,000 people there out of income tax altogether,
have halved the income tax bills of those on the minimum wage and are
freezing fuel duty. Above all, our deficit reduction strategy is
keeping mortgage rates low, which is crucial for the cost of living in
Northern Ireland and
elsewhere.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/73CED55F5110B48D3BF0FA278309DBC1E0C674E6" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

hon. Gentleman’s welcome for the unemployment figures. Not
everyone in the House will have been able to study them, but it is good
news. The number in work is up 155,000, unemployment is down 18,000,
women’s unemployment is down, youth unemployment is down,
long-term unemployment is down and vacancies are up, and crucially the
fall in the claimant count is 41,000 this month alone. That is the
fastest fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefit
since February 1997. So these are welcome figures. Of course we all
want to see living standards improve, and last year disposable income
increased, but the way to deliver on living standards is to grow the
economy, keep producing the jobs and cut people’s
taxes.</hs_Para>

the only way we can do that is to continue to get the deficit down, to

legislation as 3 nautical miles from the coast of Gibraltar. I do not
wish to anger Spain by introducing this Bill. Spain is a key ally,
friend and neighbour of the UK. I therefore believe that we should be

decided to introduce the Bill after visiting Gibraltar and seeing at
first hand the frustration of its people that their waters are not
being protected. In the summer, various news reports showed scores of
people waiting at the border to enter Spain. That stemmed from an
argument that the Spanish were having with Gibraltar over their
territorial waters. In July, Gibraltar dropped 70 concrete boulders
into the waters around its coast to create an artificial reef. The
purpose of the reef was to protect marine life in the area and to
ensure that fish stocks improved. The Spanish press were strongly
against the reef and claimed that the boulders were stopping Spanish
fishermen from being able to fish, as their nets were being destroyed.
In fact, only one Spanish fisherman was affected by the
reef.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000165" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000165">Spain
has used the same kind of concrete reef in its waters as part of an EU
project to protect and improve fish stocks. It has received millions of
pounds in EU funding to produce that reef. I do not know why Spain has
turned on this kind of reef, nor why it decided to use the reef as an
excuse to hold up Gibraltan people who were passing into Spain at the
border.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000166" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000166">What
I do know is that the Gibraltan people are proud of their membership of
the EU and want to work with Spain to their mutual financial benefit.
That does not take away from the fact that they are immensely proud of
their Gibraltan heritage. During the recent tensions, Gibraltarians
have begun to treat the artificial reef as a hero and have
affectionately named it “Reefy”. It has become a symbol
of their national identity and an unofficial logo for their national
day
celebrations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000167" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000167">It
is clear that Spain is choosing to flout the historically recognised
boundaries of Gibraltan waters. It is time for Britain to stand firm
and make it clear to Spain what the legal boundaries should be. I do
not want to see a repeat of the incident in which a British jet skier
was hounded and fired at with plastic bullets by the Spanish Guardia
Civil while in Gibraltan waters.</hs_Para>

become even more relevant in the past week because a Spanish navy
patrol boat has again been found sailing 2 miles off Gibraltar without
the relevant permissions. The vessel, which was carrying out fisheries
and coastal patrol duties, was challenged by the Royal Navy as it
sailed in the waters south of the Rock of Gibraltar. The Spanish ship
lingered in Gibraltan waters for 30 minutes before moving off. I
understand that the Gibraltan Government will be launching a diplomatic
protest about that incident, which showed that the Spanish are not
letting up their campaign. We must step up a gear and legislate to
define Gibraltar’s
waters.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000169" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000169">Gibraltar
was formally ceded to the British in article 10 of the
treaty of Utrecht 1713. At the time no mention was made of its
territorial waters, and some have made much play about that. In
reality, however, the right of every country to define its territorial
waters is clearly defined in international law, and 18th-century
international treaties provided for a claim of up to 3 nautical miles.
In 1982, the UN convention on the law of the sea gave us the right to
12 nautical miles, or the middle of the sea where the two waters
overlap. That treaty was ratified by the United Kingdom and Spain.
Admittedly, the Spanish issued a statement at the time,
but—critically—they signed the convention anyway, making
the Spanish claim to Gibraltan waters baseless in international law.
The British and Gibraltarians have never chosen to take 12 nautical
miles. We have long believed that three are enough, and it would be
wrong to claim more territorial waters than are needed, especially
given the sensitivity of the issue. Nevertheless, the Bill does not
close the door for Gibraltar to claim 12 nautical miles in future
should it
wish.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000170" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000170">My
Bill aims to enshrine in law a position that has already been formally
adopted for many years and that recognises a 3 nautical mile stretch of
water as Gibraltar’s. Indeed, questions have been raised in the
past about why Gibraltar does not stake its legal claim to
12 nautical miles of territorial waters. That issue was the
subject of a Foreign Office question on 14 February 2006, when the then
hon. Member for Hereford asked why we do not claim the full 12 nautical
miles. The shadow Foreign Secretary, then a Minister in the FCO,

their territorial sea up to a maximum breadth of 12 nautical
miles. Where the coasts of two States are opposite or adjacent, the
general rule is that neither is entitled, unless they agree otherwise,

considers that a limit of three nautical miles is sufficient in the
case of Gibraltar.”—[<I>Official Report</I>,

course Gibraltar could at some point in future claim the full 12
nautical miles, but the aim of the Bill is to claim 3 miles of
territorial water in legislation, making the greatest effort to keep a
good working relationship with Spain while supporting the interests of
the Gibraltarians. Should the Bill be passed, it will complement the
work of Gibraltar’s coastguard agency, which has been protecting
3 miles of territorial waters since 2011. The dedication of that team
who, among other tasks, conduct general patrols of territorial waters
and enforce shipping laws and port rules, should be applauded. By
backing the Bill we are supporting the hard-working team who work

embrace Gibraltar as Gibraltar could be the financial powerhouse of
that region. It could be similar to what Hong Kong is to China, but
with one crucial difference—it will not be claimed back. I hope

any time in the past 20 years, according to the most recent UK skills
and employment survey. The UK Commission for Employment and Skills,
which co-funded the survey, says that what we have now is a climate of
fear. Indeed, research shows that double the number of people feel
insecure at work today compared with three years
ago.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000183"><Member ContinuationText="Mr John Redwood" PimsId="329" UID="13101671001471" xid="496" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001471"><B>Mr

point about insecurity at work. That insecurity is not just borne out
of three wasted years of a flatlining economy following the
Government’s 2010 comprehensive spending review which caused
confidence to fall and demand to nosedive; it is also because the
nature of work has changed in recent years. Half the rise in employment
since 2010 has been in temporary work, driven primarily by people doing
temporary jobs because they cannot find permanent work—more than
500,000 people fall into that category—while record numbers of
people are in part-time work who would prefer to be working full time,
meaning that there is huge
underemployment.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000192" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000192">But
perhaps the most shocking symptom of the changing nature of work is the
proliferation of the use of zero-hours contracts, under which a person
is not guaranteed any work, is usually expected to be around whenever
the employer wants them to be and is paid only for the work he or she
gets, meaning, as my hon. Friend the Member for Coventry South (Mr

poorly paid workers are less committed and less productive. It is also
bad for the public finances, because if people are not getting the
hours or earning a decent wage, that means less income tax and national
insurance going to the Exchequer and more being paid out in credits, so
everybody loses

Government and policy makers can acknowledge the problem, but the

will they just heap further insecurity on them, or will they act to do
something about the situation? What have the Government done? First, we
have their failed economic plan. Thanks to the policies they
have pursued, unemployment and underemployment remain stubbornly high,
with almost 2.5 million people still out of work, including,
tragically, almost 1 million young people. I do not think that that is
cause for celebration. It is welcome that growth has returned, but for
all the talk of rebalancing, in the fourth year of the Government, that
rebalancing looks as elusive as ever. We just have to look at the
statistics that came out this morning. In today’s employment
figures, of course it was good to see unemployment fall in parts of our

alone are now on such contracts. Consequently, I, along with my hon.

their homes at least six days a week, including evenings. Her rota
could change in a flash. If visits were cancelled at late notice, she
would often not be paid. If visits were added at the last minute, she
would have to manage her child care commitments as she best
could—a point raised by my hon. Friend the Member for Vale of

Therefore, in August, I and the shadow employment relations Minister,
my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian Murray), formally

arose from the evidence we heard and the consultations we have been

themselves vulnerable under these contracts. Given that it is important

state of affairs creates issues for many local authorities because of
the way in which social care services are commissioned. Many of them
will tell us that it is helping to drive the use of zero-hours
contracts in the care sector. They say—some would say that this
is not an excuse, but an explanation—that they are left with no
option but to commission in that way because of the huge funding cuts
they have been subjected to under this Government. I understand the

making, to my knowledge, the care sector has used zero-hours contracts
for many years, under the Labour Government and this Government, and
under local authorities of all political colours contracting services.
There are real abuses, and if we can reach consensus, without

prevent the misuse of such contracts when employees were, in practice,
regularly working a number of hours a week. We would ensure that they

future of our economy. We need to reform our economy so that it is fit
for purpose, and so that it delivers better and fairer outcomes for
people. We consistently hear from some people that the best way to do
that is further to liberalise our labour market, which is already the
third most liberal labour market in the OECD. That is why they recoil
at taking action on exploitative zero-hours contracts, but that
approach amounts to a global race to the bottom in which we seek to
compete with China, India and the other emerging economies by screwing
down the pay and terms and conditions of working people in the name of
growth.</hs_Para>

the way in which we should be competing, because it will not deliver
better outcomes for the people we represent. We will deliver better
outcomes for them, ultimately, by growing those industries that can
provide more of the better paid, secure jobs that they want. Of course
that means promoting innovation and ensuring that our people have the
skills to do those jobs. That is why I am always banging on about the
need for an industrial strategy. We must act to protect those who
continue to work in low-income, insecure jobs in the less
internationally competitive sectors. Heaping insecurity on them is not
the right thing to do.</hs_Para>

Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills (Vince
Cable):</Member></B> We very much welcome this opportunity to debate
this issue. It has had a lot of media coverage, and we have already had
several debates on it in the House. I am happy to engage with it. I
realise that the purpose of Opposition day debates is to generate
opposition, but the truth is that there is quite a lot of common ground
on this issue. None of us wants to see employers abusing their
employees.</hs_Para>

the motion seems to be to ask me to do what I am already doing. I made
it clear a month ago that we were going to have a consultation on this
matter, and I can tell the hon. Member for Streatham (Mr Umunna) that
we are aiming to clear the process through government by mid-November
in order to launch the consultation formally. There is no disagreement
about that.</hs_Para>

elements in the motion that I could pick holes in and disagree with.
There is a call for evidence, but also, slightly oddly, a series of
concrete action points that have been put forward regardless
of any evidence that might emerge. That seems to be making slightly odd
use of evidence-based decision making. That is a quibble, but I do not
have an enormous problem with the basic thrust of the motion. I guess
the hon. Gentleman has to criticise the Government, however, as this is
an Opposition day debate, and I will take head-on the three specific
points that he has
made.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000250" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000250">First,
he talked about our failure to act, but the problem has been around for
many years, as my right hon. Friend the Member for Bermondsey and Old
Southwark (Simon Hughes) has pointed out. The trade unions repeatedly
told the last Labour Government that there was a problem in this area.
The 1998 White Paper drew attention to it and suggested possible
courses of action, but no action was ever taken. I know that several of
my Labour predecessors looked into the matter, because concern had been
expressed, and while acknowledging that there was abuse in some areas,
they broadly took the view that the benefits outweighed the
costs.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101671000251" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000251">The second
criticism was that I did not mobilise a small army of civil servants to
look at the problem earlier this summer, but what would be the point of
mobilising the civil service to reinvent the wheel? A lot of sensible
research has already been done. We have talked to 10 trade unions, all
of which have done quite a lot of in-house work. We have also talked to
several think-tanks, including the Resolution Foundation and the Work
Foundation, both of which have done good work in this area. We did not
need to reinvent anything; the evidence and the anecdotes are there and
we are drawing on them. That is the direction in which we are
proceeding.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman criticised the statistics. The problem is that we have
one basic official set of statistics from the Office for National
Statistics, suggesting that there are about 200,000 zero-hours
contracts. That statistic is drawn from the labour force survey, and
the hon. Gentleman was right to say that this is quite a narrow
definition. The Chartered Institute of Personnel Development came out
with a figure of 1 million, using a different measure—in other
words, what employers judge the number of zero-hours contracts to
be—while the union Unite has come up with a figure of 5 million.
Different people are obviously measuring this in different ways. What I
have done is write to the head of the Office for National Statistics,
asking him to take this problem on board. We have a very serious
problem of definition and numbers, so I have asked the head to pull
together the relevant people so that, from now on, we can have a proper
database on the basis of which to make rational
decisions.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000253" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000253"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Lucas" PimsId="1569" UID="13101671001516" xid="370" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001516">Ian

have acted by removing the rights of employees to enforce their
employment rights by doubling the qualification for unfair dismissal

McGovern:</Member></B> Let me take the right hon. Gentleman back to the
statistics for one minute, if the House will forgive me, because they
really matter. The statistics provide the only way of finding out what
is going on in our economy from the Government’s point of view.
The care Minister told me that 300,000 people working in the care
sector were on zero-hours contracts, so that is what the Government
say; yet the Office for National Statistics—and therefore the
Government again—have reported that there are 250,000 such
workers in that sector. That discrepancy cannot stand. In a recent
parliamentary answer in October, one of the Secretary of State’s
Ministers said that his review did not seek to collect any statistics,
but the Department is now reporting an inconsistency in them. Does not

that?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000256" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000256"><B><Member ContinuationText="Vince Cable" PimsId="2413" UID="13101671001519" xid="88" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001519">Vince

Tom Watson</B> (West Bromwich East) (Lab):</Member> Does the Secretary
of State agree that the problem is exacerbated when zero-hours
contracts are taken in combination with the decreasing value of the
minimum wage? That has created conditions under which, either
consciously or inadvertently, rather large companies have developed
business models that rely on top-up benefits to subsidise 
<?notus-xml column=755?>a work force whose take-home pay is not large enough to cover their
monthly bills. That means we end up with a multinational company such
as McDonald’s, with up to 83,000 staff on zero-hours contracts,
being subsidised by the taxpayer to the tune of about £200
million a year. We need to find a way of dealing with these contracts
in order to deal with the taxpayer interest in the
situation.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000258" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000258"><B><Member ContinuationText="Vince Cable" PimsId="2413" UID="13101671001521" xid="88" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001521">Vince

what he says. I think he is merely saying what is obvious, although it
may need restating—that we are dealing in the wake of the
financial crisis with very weak labour markets, and not just in the UK.
This has had impacts on wages and on the nature of contracts. The
question for the Government and legislators is whether the problems
around zero-hours contracts are the symptom or the cause. The hon.
Gentleman is right that the problem interacts quite powerfully with the
minimum wage issue. I have made it clear that I want the Low Pay
Commission to look at the minimum wage in a more positive way, but it
is, of course, an independent commission and it is not my job to tell
or prescribe to it how the minimum wage could evolve. I want to respect

considering the advantages and disadvantages of zero-hours contracts,
let me make a basic point that will probably explain why my Labour
predecessors did not deal with the problem: it is intrinsically tricky.
There is an issue about what zero-hours contracts actually are; they
are not clearly defined. As the right hon. Member for Wokingham (Mr
Redwood) said a few moments ago, we do not have a definition of
exploitation, and we do not even have a definition of what a zero-hours
contract is. There are a whole lot of contractual arrangements, which
have two basic conditions attached to them. One is that there is no
guarantee of work and no requirement under British employment law for
an employer to provide a minimum number of hours. Equally, however, an
individual is not required to accept an offer of work. Those are the
two defining characteristics of a zero-hours contract.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101671000264" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000264">A wide
spectrum of practices has come out of that. At one end of the scale, we
have casualisation of different forms—we have heard about the
history of the docks and other similar traditions, many of which were
highly undesirable. Equally, at the other end of the scale, however,
there are large numbers of traditional systems of freelance-type
employment—in the creative industries and education, for
example. When I started thinking about this subject, I realised that my
late wife spent much of her working career on a zero-hours contract
working for a further education college. She taught music to sixth
formers, depending on how many turned up for their classes. It was
effectively a zero-hours contract. Many people in FE and adult
education worked on the same basis, and this is established practice in
many other industries. In these cases, it has not been viewed as a
problem before.</hs_Para>

point to stress that the definition of a zero-hours contract is not
precise. Hundreds of thousands of people—and if we believe the
shadow Secretary of State, millions—are on these contracts,
which vary enormously. Some people carry the rights attached to being a
worker—<I>[Interruption.] </I>Well, Unite think it is
5 million people. Some people in these contracts have basic
employee statutory rights attached to them as well. They are enormously
varied.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000266" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000266"><B><Member ContinuationText="Guy Opperman" PimsId="5666" UID="13101671001526" xid="1230" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001526">Guy

The consultation will be launched in the middle of November, and such

determine how quickly the Government can respond, and that in turn will
dictate how quickly we can introduce legislation, if that is what is

enumerate some of the positive and negative aspects of zero-hours
contracts that our review has revealed so far. There are some groups of
people for whom such contracts provide a useful and appropriate kind of
employment, regardless of sector. For many people, for example, who are
at or beyond retirement 
<?notus-xml column=758?>age and want to keep in touch with the labour force but do not want
permanent employment or even an agreed part-time employment contract,
such contracts are quite an attractive proposition. There are other
people, in industries that are subject to quite a lot of volatility,
who want to remain connected with the labour force but do not want to
be in a position where they have taken on permanent employment and are
then made redundant. The car industry provides a good example. One
reason the car industry is successful is that our labour market has a
mix of people, some of whom are on zero-hours contracts. When I went to
the United States to negotiate with people in General Motors, who were
deciding whether to come to Britain or Germany, one factor that weighed
heavily in favour of the UK was our flexible approach to employment,
including zero-hours contracts, along with the fact that the unions,
mostly Unite, had been constructive in putting those arrangements in
place.</hs_Para>

be able to say no when work is offered, without facing disciplinary
procedures, and to be on a contract that explicitly acknowledges that
work can be declined.</hs_Para>

mentioned by the shadow Secretary of State: exclusivity arrangements,
where people are bound into a contract with one employer and are not
offered any hours, but cannot take employment from someone else. At
first sight, that is a very unsatisfactory arrangement. We discovered
that that kind of arrangement operated, for example, with the staff at
Buckingham palace. When we pursued it, we discovered that one reason is
security vetting, as the arrangement prevents people from being able to
pop in and out of different firms. I do not know whether that is the
justification in the case of Buckingham palace; there is some
complexity to the argument. In general terms, however, I would accept
that exclusivity is a very, very undesirable
practice.</hs_Para>

is a serious issue. The second point, which I think one or two Labour
Members have been trying to make, is that there are cases where the
simple lack of predictability is damaging for families trying to manage
their personal finances responsibly, especially those who are employed
on a regular basis for a long period of time and are then, in the
jargon, zeroed down. A problem would flow from that. Then there are
people who are on zero-hours contracts for many years and for whom it
becomes a way of life. There may be good sectoral reasons for it, but
in some cases it is a way of keeping them out of regular employment
with the various obligations that are attached to it. In our gathering
of evidence, we have encountered two specific instances. There are
people who sign up to a zero-hours contract in good faith, because it
gives them and the employer flexibility, but they then take advantage
of their right to reject work and are discarded because they are
allegedly inflexible, defeating the whole purpose of the contract in
the first place. We found that other people were 
<?notus-xml column=760?>indeed pressurised into taking zero-hours contracts against their better
judgment and against their preference. All those things happen, and
they must be weighed against the undoubted advantages that some
individuals and some industries gain from having the option to make
such
arrangements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000291" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000291"><Member ContinuationText="Jim Shannon" PimsId="650" UID="13101671001546" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001546"><B>Jim
Shannon</B>:</Member> At a time of economic squeeze, when those who
tender or apply for contracts find that their prices must be lower,
they are forced to apply the minimum wage and to restrict working
hours, and that has an impact on those who are on zero-hours contracts.
Does the Secretary of State feel that the Government have a duty to
ensure that the tender process gives workers rights, whether it takes
place at Government level, at council level or at regional
level?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000292" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000292"><B><Member ContinuationText="Vince Cable" PimsId="2413" UID="13101671001547" xid="88" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001547">Vince
Cable:</Member></B> The hon. Gentleman is right to view the matter in
that broader context. Several Members, including the hon. Member for
Streatham, have already given the example of domiciliary visits in the
care sector. I have encountered cases in my constituency involving
people whose working conditions are very poor, who are on zero-hours
contracts, whose pay is very low, and for whom there is no chance of no
progression. When we dig into such cases, as I did on one occasion, we
may discover that the companies concerned are not profit-making
companies but charities, and that the real cause of the problem is the
very poor price at which they took the contract. The origin of the
problem therefore lies in local government. The zero-hours contracts
and, indeed, the minimum wage issues are symptoms rather than
causes.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000293" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000293">Let
me list some of the matters that we will be considering in the
consultation, and explain how we will approach them. It is important
for us not to close down options. First, there is the issue of
exclusivity. We could do nothing, and rely on existing law; we could
ban it; or we could provide effective information and guidance
requiring employers to justify it. A number of legal interventions are
possible.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000294" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000294">Secondly,

probably most important—there is the issue of transparency. We
can argue in favour of fairness, and we can also argue that, for the
economic purposes of a flexible labour market, if rational people know
what they are doing, that is a considerable improvement. The problem
that we have discovered, and to which many Members have already
referred, is that when people accept a job offer they are often not
clear about the obligations and limitations that
are involved. Should we introduce a code of conduct
requiring proper transparency and information? Should it be voluntary,
should it be a Leveson-style code with statutory
underpinning, or should it be controlled by a stronger sanction-based
body? We have a range of options, and we will view them with an open
mind and act
accordingly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000296" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671000296"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Donohoe" PimsId="2998" UID="13101671001548" xid="174" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0001.htm#13101671001548">Mr

should also like the consultation to consider a public-interest issue.
The example of track maintenance was given earlier, and it is a matter
that I have raised on previous occasions. Network Rail, for instance,
has contracted out a large amount of work to sub-contractors, who have
then sub-contracted it themselves. Some track maintenance workers are
now employed by as many as eight or a dozen employers, and are all on
zero-hours contracts. That has undermined the safety regime that we
introduced following the disasters at Southall, Paddington and
elsewhere.</hs_Para>

is clear that the increasing number of zero-hours contracts is one of
the last taboos of employment policy. The firms involved have no need
to use those contracts: they know exactly how many employees they need
each week. Moreover, zero-hours contracts are immoral, they exploit
hard-working people, and they enable the powerful to dominate the
powerless. In Halifax, unemployment levels are very high, job security
is low, and youth unemployment has almost doubled in the last three
years. That appears to me to be a licence for some employers to
introduce zero-hours
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000308" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000308">What
most people want—like the rest of us—is stability,
security and reassurance in employment. What zero-hours contracts
provide is exactly the opposite. Some say, “Is such a contract
not better than no job at all?”, but that misses the point. Many
advances in employment practices would never have been made in the last
100 years if the “status quo” option had always been
taken. Only recently, the very same argument was used to warn of the
dangers of the minimum
wage.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000309" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000309">This
is obviously not a stable time to be in employment, especially in
northern towns. They have borne the brunt of the Government’s
cuts, which have affected both public and private sector jobs. There
are many well-run companies and decent employers in both those sectors
in the town that I represent. They include J&amp;C Joel and Harveys.
They care about their employees, they know what it is like to manage a
budget and they want to keep the town on an even keel. So when I talk
about zero-hours contracts, I should add that not all companies in my
constituency are practising this policy, but sadly it is an increasing
trend, and, quite simply, they are an unethical and unwanted means of
employing people. They are an employers’ charter to make
shortcuts, reduce wage bills and avoid employment rights
obligations.</hs_Para>

are various contract laws that prevent an outright ban, but as the
shadow Secretary of State said, they should be outlawed. Things can and
should be done to water down the opportunity for them to be used. We
need to look at guaranteeing hours and extending statutory employee
rights to all workers, whatever contracts they are on. All workers
should have trade union rights and family-friendly rights. Equality in
employment should not be decided by a worker’s

Government are actually on the wrong side for hard-working people. I
know of a company in Halifax. A very hard-working young man came to my
last surgery. He had been made redundant and had his benefits cut. He
was living off family. He wanted to work and was given a zero-hours
contract and told to turn up every morning at 6 am. The company has a
board and if a person’s name is not on it, they are sent home
and told to come back the day after—after they have spent money
on travel. This young man so much wanted a job that he said,
“Please don’t send me home. I’ve travelled all
this way and spent money getting here. Can I sweep up today?
I’ll do anything.” He was told, “No, your
name’s not on that board. Come again tomorrow.” It is not
rocket science to find a way to let people know the day
before—or the week before, in my opinion—whether there is
work for them. That is a long-established company. It has not been
around for just two minutes and is on a budget. It knows exactly how
many employees it wants but it keeps people dangling. These are
Dickensian practices that would be out of place in Victorian England,

nature of contracts. I should make a declaration: as a former
barrister, I was unquestionably on a zero-hours contract in that I was
an employee whose employer was not obliged to give me work, and I had
to accept that. It is certainly the case that in rural Northumberland
there is an acceptance that these types of contracts help to plug a
gap. I am not going to attack local authorities, whether Liberal,
Conservative or Labour, which have utilised them in the past and
continue to do so. I suggest it is a question not of this House being
for or against zero-hours contracts, but of this House being against
inequitable and exploitative zero-hours

final point is that we need to widen the terms of the debate on
zero-hours contracts to consider the minimum wage and the living wage.
I welcome the work of the Archbishop of York. I should declare that I
serve in the High Pay Centre with such notable right-wingers as the
hon. Member for Brighton, Pavilion (Caroline Lucas), who leads the
Green party in this House, and the TUC general secretary, Frances
O’Grady. We have been looking at not only high pay, but low pay;
we have been trying to address the problems that definitely do exist
and making the case that the living wage and the minimum wage need to
be addressed and embraced as we go forward. I agree with the earlier
point that it is bizarre that we have a subsidy system whereby tax
credits, in effect, subsidise the employment of low-paid workers. That
needs to be addressed.</hs_Para>

point must surely be this: the living wage has been proven not only to
save the taxpayer money in the longer term, but to improve productivity
and to benefit the business. One need only look at the US retail giant
Costco to see that. It has broken the mould, paying its staff $11.50 an
hour compared with the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Its chief

million or more people subject nowadays to the sometimes pernicious
insecurity of zero-hours contracts, it is timely that we return to this
subject now that the House has returned. For me and for many people,
not least those in the trade unions, it comes with a weary, sad sense
of déjà vu. It was back in 1995, nearly 20 years ago now,
when I worked at <I>The Independent</I>, that I remember first pursuing
the issue of the abuse of zero-hours contracts, as they have come to be
known. Those with long memories like mine will recall that the
controversy was sparked by the case of Michael, a 17-year-old student
in Glasgow who was asked to clock off and on up to four times a day at
Burger King, and was sent home unpaid when there were not enough
customers around. Burger King was then owned by Grand Metropolitan,
part of the old-school “beerage”, and the irony was not
lost at the time that its charitable arm, the Grand Met Trust, was in
line to run a big, privatised careers service—of all
things—in London.</hs_Para>

eventually paid more than £100,000 in compensation to nearly
1,000 employees who had been either sent home or made to stand around,
unpaid, until business picked up. Craig Bushey, Burger King’s
then managing director in western Europe, said all the way back in 1995
that</hs_Para>

by no means all, or the biggest or most successful, high-street names
use these contracts. Tesco, Sainsbury’s and Morrisons, for
example, see no need to use them; my hon. Friend the shadow Business
Secretary also mentioned Asda. Responsible employers, they recognise a
trade union, the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers. They
negotiate with that union flexible contracts that provide workers with
guaranteed hours, and other rights that most of us take for granted in
a civilised society, but that also mean the work force can respond to
fluctuations in consumer demand, as affect other industries.</hs_Para>

King’s Mr Bushey were still around, one might expect him and his
counterparts to ask, “Why does my business need these contracts
when these other great high-street names and other businesses do
not?” One would certainly expect him, if only for damage
limitation purposes, given the controversy now, to look at all his
outlets to investigate what was happening in practice, and to see
whether poorly paid, unrepresented workers were being abused these days
in other ways. One would certainly expect him, having done so, to have
no fear of engaging full on with the full-blown consultation and formal
call for evidence over the use of these contracts which Labour’s

measure that we discussed to promote fairness in the workplace. I will
say a little more about that in a moment. Following the debate in

my right hon. Friend the Leader of the Opposition’s commitment

remind my hon. Friend the shadow Business Secretary that fair treatment
of agency workers was there in black and white in our 2005 manifesto.
It was long before his time but he gets the point that I am coming on

put that pledge into effect through a private Member’s Bill, the
Temporary and Agency Workers (Equal Treatment) Bill. The Government,
though—and it was before my hon. Friend’s time—far
from welcoming that with open arms fought us, bayonets fixed, in the
trenches. It took our late colleague, the former Member for Crewe and
Nantwich, Gwyneth Dunwoody, at her magisterial best to press a closure
motion in the Chamber against Government filibustering even to give
that Bill an
airing.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000347" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000347">The
Bill was followed by another private Member’s Bill in 2008,
sponsored by my hon. Friend the Member for Ellesmere Port and Neston
(Andrew Miller) and again contested. Eventually the Prime
Minister—our Prime Minister—relented, the agency workers
directive was implemented but the compromise, with a 12-week qualifying
period open to all sorts of abuse, was not a happy one. I am not
recounting this for old time’s sake or gratuitously to open old
wounds. That measure was 
<?notus-xml column=768?>aimed at tackling the unfairness and insecurity, the fear of
substitution by cheaper agency workers, people on cheaper contracts
which, for example, lay at the root of many people’s support for
parties such as the British National party and their fears about
immigration. Business opposed that measure, as it opposed the
minimum wage.</hs_Para>

what I would call economic growth on the cheap, but nothing does come

National party and in many areas the UK Independence party. I am glad

I want to say something about values. Although the economics are
extremely important, so are the values. Some of the worst effects of
zero-hours contracts are felt not where people have a high level of
skills, but where people have little other option. In the care sector,
for example, workers often have a low level of skills and are often
women, possibly later in their career, who already have little power in
the workplace. When zero-hours contracts are used in place of proper
management, they are left in a terribly vulnerable position. It leaves
them, in effect, begging for work. To me the indignity of begging is
not tolerable. It is not tolerable for people to beg on the street and
it is not tolerable for people to beg for work. That is what is wrong
with zero-hours contracts. They risk far too much power being put on
one side of the table in discussion of the contract of employment. This
is an economic issue, of course, but it is a question of how we want to
live together and relate to each other in
society.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000359" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000359">We
are storing up some serious economic problems with zero-hours
contracts. In the short term they involve a cost because
people’s income is likely to be reduced as a result of their
underemployment. If they are wasting time constantly trying to get more
hours, as we heard in our survey, people have no time left to find
another job, which might be a better job and might improve their
prospects, which would, in turn, improve their and their
family’s capacity to spend money and keep our economy going.
Also, the insecurity that they are suffering means that in the short

we heard examples of people who were constantly told that they were
going to get more hours than they did. That short-term impact of
feeling that they would have money coming in and then finding that they

it does not affect the whole economy equally or in the same way. The
parts of the country with a lower skills base are much more likely to
suffer from this, so zero-hours contracts feed into the imbalanced
economy that we already

from one of the people in our report speaking about their inability to
invest in themselves, for example by going back to school, college or
university and making a long-term choice to improve their prospects,
which they felt unable to do because they did not know what was going
on at work. Similarly, 
<?notus-xml column=770?>people were unable to get a mortgage or decide to make a long-term
investment in their housing, which will have a knock-on impact. A

am aware that in the case of students, who have been mentioned as an
example, zero-hours contracts are a fair arrangement. There is no power
imbalance and that is fine. I am also aware that for some people on
zero-hours contracts there is an investment in their skills. But do the
Government think it is more or less likely that employers in this
country would invest in the skills of people who had permanent, stable
contracts or those whom they had put on zero-hours contracts? I think
that the skills base in particular parts of the country will inevitably
diminish as a result of this so-called flexibility in the labour
market.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/3F6A980A69CAE052021A0DFF0CEC3A080D79044F" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

contracts clearly do not affect every part of the country in the same
way. The Merseyside city region has developed well over recent
years—against expectations, I think—and we did much
better through the recession than anyone thought we would. I am
extremely proud that the Liverpool city region is doing well—no
one will catch me running it down. However, the biggest barrier to
Merseyside’s development is our people’s level of skills.
We cannot afford to have employers who are not committed to investing
in our people, not just because it is bad for our people today and they
do not get the opportunity to improve themselves, but because it stores
up problems. If the Government are not prepared to take this matter
seriously because of concerns about the amount of money people will
have in their pockets, I hope that they will take seriously the
long-term impact such contracts have on the prospects for a balanced
economy. I wanted to ask the Secretary of State to include the impact
on skills in his review and consultation. He is no longer here, but I
am sure that the Minister will pass on the
request.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000365" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000365">What
is the solution? I am sure that it will come as no great shock to the
House to learn that I am extremely supportive of the Labour policies
outlined in the motion. I am incredibly pleased that the leader of my
party has chosen to take such a stand on this issue. It is not fair to
say that the previous Labour Government did not act to protect
vulnerable people in the work force. One of our greatest achievements
was the national minimum wage. The regulations that implement it
contain all kinds of requirements to ensure that people earn a decent
amount of money. That is at the heart of this debate. I think that we
ought to be extremely proud of that institution that protects people in
our
country.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000366" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000366">However,
it is right that we should go further, and it is absolutely right that
we should crack down on exclusivity and look at the people who work
regular hours but whose employers are not prepared to commit and
give them a proper contract. In the short term, the report
that colleagues and I produced suggests a code of practice, and that
has been the first stage in our discussions with employers and others.
I think that we can get on with that. If there are employers who want
to discuss that with us, as there are in Merseyside, we should do
so.</hs_Para>

briefly to pay tribute to Unison for its work as a trade union and for
its ethical care charter. It is a shame that the right hon. Member for
Bermondsey and Old Southwark (Simon Hughes) did not congratulate
Southwark council—I speak with a slight interest, as I am a
former deputy leader of the Southwark Labour 
<?notus-xml column=771?>group—on adopting the stance that Unison did a good job in
articulating what is needed in the care sector. We know that in that
sector zero-hours contracts are wrapped up in a whole other agenda
about ensuring that people have proper dignity and respect. I hope that
Ministers will focus their review on what is going on in the care
sector. There might be whole swathes of the economy where there are
fewer problems, but there most certainly are problems in the care
sector, and I hope that Ministers will pay attention to
that.</hs_Para>

the motion that I agree with relates to exclusivity in zero-hours
contracts. A good friend of mine who works as a security operator at
Burnley college approached me a few weeks ago and said that he thought
that his zero-hours contract was very good because it suited his
lifestyle and the way he wanted to work. His objection was that it was
exclusive. He would have liked to have been able to have zero-hours
contracts with numerous employers, because that would suit him down to
the ground. He could work to suit his lifestyle and that of his family,
because he found it difficult to work for just one company that
occasionally did not give him any work for five or six days, and that
could be taken away, so it would benefit him greatly if he could have
various zero-hours contracts with different
companies.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000382" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000382">Zero-hours
contracts have been used for years. My wife worked as a personnel
officer for a number of Boots stores 20 years ago, and zero-hours
contracts worked perfectly. People were called in as they were needed
and they were happy with what they got. It still works like that. One
of the benefits is for young people who are out of work. My new
researcher in Burnley was working in a bar on a zero-hours contract
because she could not get a proper job before she came to work for me.
Having come straight from university, she found that getting into the
habit of going to work under a zero-hours contract was absolutely
brilliant, because it got her into the ethos of going to work. She
found that a really good start to her working life. It is really good.
Stacks of zero-hours contracts are given out in the pub and
entertainment trade, and most of the people who work in those
industries are very pleased about it.</hs_Para>

benefits of zero-hours contracts, as I have said, is that they get
people used to getting up for work. Three years ago, Burnley
was one of the top 10 unemployment blackspots in the
country. Unemployment was dreadful. Since then we have dropped to 159th
place on the list and unemployment has dropped from over 8% to 5.7%. I
keep hearing that the north of England’s unemployment is
climbing and that things are really bad. Burnley, which was an
unemployment blackspot, is now a very prosperous town. A lot of people
who were working on zero-hours contracts have now transferred into
full-time employment and are enjoying the jobs and roles that they are
carrying out.</hs_Para>

what many of us have been fortunate to have during our working lives,
whereby people can 
<?notus-xml column=774?>take on loans and mortgages, know that there are prospects of
advancement in their work, and know that their employer is investing in
them and is therefore prepared to enhance their skills to make them
even more employable in future. All that is lost to people on
zero-hours contracts.</hs_Para>

the need for flexibility in the labour market, but I am increasingly
concerned that zero-hours contracts are being used as a tool by
managers who are too lazy to look ahead. Sometimes it is not the case
that they do not know what is ahead. For example, last Monday, I was
with a constituent who told me about her care workers who are on these
kinds of contracts. They are called into work in the morning until
lunchtime, called in again in the afternoon until teatime, and then
called in again in the evening. The employer’s contract is with
a health board. I do not believe that he does not know for how many
hours he is contracted to undertake work for that health board.
Therefore, I do not understand why he cannot properly utilise his work
force and take the opportunity to give those individuals more security
of employment.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101671000394" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000394">Some Members
have drawn a distinction between zero-hours contracts that are normal
and those that are exploitative. I do not believe that there is such a
distinction, because potentially every such contract is exploitative.
When an employer is really squeezed, he or she has the flexibility to
say to someone, “There’s no work for you today. I took
you on on certain conditions and you accepted that you were on a
zero-hours contract. I could probably offer you 12 hours a week, but
I’m sorry that’s not available any longer”. Then
people can sit for days or weeks with no work. They may have taken on
the contract only because the employer said, “Normally this will
be what’s available to you” even though it was a
zero-hours contract. Those contracts do become exploitative. When the
Secretary of State is looking at the way forward, if there cannot be a
total ban—for which, in certain circumstances, a good argument
could well be made—we should at least start to look at how it
can become the exception rather than, as I suspect, increasingly the
norm.</hs_Para>

aspects have been well highlighted in this debate. First, these
contracts should not be exclusive because this should not be a one-way
relationship. It has been said that it suits both partners, but very
often it does not. I think of what has been said by people on
zero-hours contracts who have come to see me. The contract is operated
by the employer and the employee is afraid to say, “I’m
not coming in tomorrow because it doesn’t suit me”
because they probably accepted the contract in the first place only
because they were desperate for work. At least, as suggested by the
Opposition, there should be no exclusivity. That would be one way in
which an employee could say, “I’ve got other options open
to
me.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000396" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000396">Secondly,
where zero-hours contracts operate in the public sector—many are
found in charities and employers who work on public sector
contracts—there should be much more rigour about the conditions
attached to those who are employed in firms that win public procurement
contracts. That would squeeze out an awful lot of these
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000397" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000397">Thirdly,
if it is shown that an employee has had regular work over a period of
time even though they are on a zero-hours contract, the
employer cannot really argue, “I need that flexibility”,
because the  
<?notus-xml column=775?>employee has had regular hours already. That should be
another area where we can start to squeeze out
these
contracts.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000398" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000398">Zero-hours
contracts are not only bad for employees but bad for the economy. If
employers themselves thought about it, they should realise that there
is no better way to have a work force that is loyal to them than by
treating them right. These contracts, especially when they are used in
an exploitative way, do not treat employees right and therefore have an
impact on the quality of the work force. In the longer run, as the hon.
Member for Wirral South (Alison McGovern) said, what employer is going
to invest in their work force if they treat them as people who can be
taken on and disposed of when they feel like
it?</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/2DE8CD92C9DBFBECA8FFA5BACCADA7E18BA4D605" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

final reason for supporting what the Government are doing is that it is
working. The Government’s labour market reforms have had a
stunning impact on our rate of job creation. There are 872,000 more
jobs in the economy than there were at the time of the last election.
<I>[</I><I>Interruption.</I><I>]</I> Opposition Members are shaking
their heads. They do not like it, but it is true. Some 1.4
million private sector jobs have been created since the last

one job that has been lost. This country is creating jobs at twice the

adult men and women with families to support who are trapped on
zero-hours contracts. Does it surprise the Minister that this week, the
British Red Cross launched its first ever emergency appeal to feed

people who are on zero-hours contracts, not just from week to week, but
from day to day, about whether they will be able to feed their

school and about whether they will be able to arrange child care. That
anxiety is corrosive and devastating. Alongside it, there is an
indignity and humiliation that runs through people’s lives when
they do not know whether they will be able to provide for their
families, whether children or elderly relatives, or even themselves.

I welcome the Secretary of State’s tone and his promise to do
something about the problem, too often in the years before I came to

will make a few brief points in the short time that I have remaining.
First, there has been a lot of debate about whether zero-hours
contracts should be banned outright and whether that is practical. It
has been said that in some circumstances, zero-hours contracts are good
for people. I do not really understand the argument 
<?notus-xml column=780?>about students. I do not understand why anybody would want a job in
which they were guaranteed absolutely no work. I have never met anybody
who wants that. I listened to the Minister carefully, but I still do
not understand that point. There is clearly a difference between people
who are trapped on zero-hours contracts and are desperate for more work
but cannot get it, and people who value a bit of flexibility. The
problem is that zero-hours contracts used to be a stepping-stone into
better-paid, more secure work. It is becoming increasingly clear that
they are no longer a
stepping-stone.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000433" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000433">I
was proud to stand alongside the Hovis workers in my constituency when
they went on strike because 28 workers who had had full-time
contracts were replaced by people on zero-hours contracts. They stood
alongside one another and said that they would not accept two people
doing the same job at different rates of pay and with different levels
of security. That sort of two-tier work force is the thin end of the
wedge and is bad for everyone. I was proud that Premier Foods accepted
that argument, stepped in and reversed the situation. Premier Foods has
gone from being a buzzword for bad employment to being a buzzword for
how to take action to become a good employer. I am proud that that
happened in my
constituency.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000434" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000434"><B><Member ContinuationText="Ian Lavery" PimsId="5675" UID="13101671001601" xid="1227" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671001601">Ian

Hovis strike was not just about zero-hours contracts. As my hon.
Friends have made clear, there is a growing casualisation of the work
force in this country that is corrosive and is deeply worrying to all
of us. As the shadow Secretary of State said, we have one of the most
deregulated labour markets in Europe. Many more people are now in
temporary work and low-paid jobs. Clamping down on zero-hours contracts
and their exploitation is just one part of what we must do. I hope that
the Minister understands
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000437" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000437">This
problem affects young people disproportionately. We know from history
that when young people are trapped in situations in which they cannot
advance themselves or their families, it causes hopelessness, despair
and anger, and the associated problems that go with those feelings. We
owe young people better than that. I would like to hear what the
Minister proposes to do urgently for those young
people.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000438" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000438">What
we are saying is not anti-business. We have heard much about the
employers who are using the flexibility that zero-hours contracts
provide to exploit the work force, but there are many employers who are
not doing that. The shadow Secretary of State gave the example of Asda,
which is taking a stand against such treatment of the work force. It is
essential that the UK leads the way in showing that things can be
levelled up, not levelled down, for the benefit of everybody.
Otherwise, employers such as Asda who are making decent choices, doing
the right thing and investing in their communities will be at a
disadvantage and we will be tilting the playing
field.</hs_Para>

many hon. Members have said, this problem affects entire sectors. We

people—mainly women—who work in that sector. It affects
their children, their parents and their whole family. It also affects
us, because if we value that profession so little that we allow this
practice to be used across the country, we allow people to be given no
money for travel time between appointments and we allow packed rotas

the Secretary of State spoke a lot about getting redress and taking on
employers, and about a code of conduct. In truth, however, it is
incredibly difficult for someone who is being threatened with no more
work to take action. Have we learned nothing from the blacklisting
scandals that my hon. Friend the Member for Edinburgh South (Ian
Murray) has done so much to uncover and condemn? When Ministers say
that we want to give people the ability to take action on that issue,
why are they restricting access to legal advice and hiking up
employment tribunal fees?</hs_Para>

that the Government are frightened of challenge, and they are standing
together with their friends in the business community to stop people
who have everything to lose from being able to take action. Whatever
the Government do, the Minister must understand that rights are no good

ensure they can be

danger of violently agreeing with one another—I do not think
there is any Government Member who does not agree that we should be
stamping out abuses, and as we heard, the Government are beginning a
consultation to look into that issue. However, as we heard from my hon.
Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman), it is the
responsibility of the Government to turn things
around—particularly given the mess we inherited in
2010—and to create growth and jobs. As we heard from my right
hon. Friend the Prime Minister during Prime Minister’s
questions, we have created more than 1.5 million new private sector
jobs, including 1 million net new jobs. Last week the IMF turned around
its criticism of the UK from a month earlier, and said that compared
with the rest of the world, the UK is doing pretty well. Growth is

As we heard

for example, as do young students or young mothers who have child care
and do not necessarily have natural fixed hours. Zero-hours contracts
can suit a number of people in our economy. I listened carefully to
what Opposition Members said, and it is important to have robust
employment protections. As we heard from the Secretary of State, and as
we will no doubt soon hear from the Minister, the Government are
beginning a consultation to look into the practices raised by Labour

Tower Hamlets, Ealing, Merton, Hounslow and Newham. Those councils do

past week alone, British manufacturers have said that they have seen
the strongest growth on record, breaking the figure for every quarter

doubled the qualification period for people going to employment

aerospace sectors to introduce flexibility, so that there is a balanced

are, and have been for many years, on zero-hours contracts and have

“It is right that action is taken where things have gone
wrong.” It takes a special cheek for the Opposition to come to
the House and say, “We didn’t do anything about it for 13
years, but, right now, we expect immediate action.” That is not
the right way to do things. They are politicising what is an important

should be allowed to seek work elsewhere. That would be a fair and just

considerable concern. It is right that we work to rebalance the

Gilmore</B> (Edinburgh East) (Lab):</Member> I visited a constituent

was in arrears and was worried about what was happening. However, the
reason for her problem—the kind of work she did—quickly
emerged. She was a care worker on a zero-hours contracts, but did not
get flexibility. She had to wait for a text message—this is a
new form of having to go down to the docks and standing in a
queue—to see if she was going to have work. In that week, she
had been given two evenings of work at very short notice—this
creates substantial problems for people’s ability to
plan.</hs_Para>

address the underlying issues. Why is this happening in
care, which is such an important area of work? There is
knock-on effect to the quality of care. If people do not
know until the last minute whether they are going to be working, the
recipient of care has no idea who will be visiting them. That is
important to the quality of care and to the security of those receiving
care. Those who suffer from Alzheimer’s find it particularly
disturbing and distressing for carers to be changed all the time. The
issue is broader than the employment conditions of my constituents; it
is about quality of care.</hs_Para>

happening? It did not used to happen. It did not happen in my city when
most home care was carried out by those directly employed by the
council. A lot of home care was put out to tender in my city under the
council run by the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National party.
It decided to save money and boasted to the local newspapers about how
it had saved the council tax payer £2 million, but at what cost
and whose cost? Companies put in cheap bids to show how we could all
save money and they now have to make up that money by how they employ
their employees.</hs_Para>

an accident, nor is it abuse by bad employers; it is a structural
issue. I am concentrating on care, but I am sure there are other areas
where this is happening. If we want this to change, we have to be much
more honest about the cost of care and how we are going to pay for it.
It is not enough to provide care on a shoestring. I emphasise that I am
talking about Scotland. People sometimes think we have cracked the care
problem because we have free personal care, but councils such as mine
have only been able to manage that process—they were given no
extra money to help them do it—by contracting out. The
contractors have set up these kinds of employment arrangements to make
it work. It is not good for the people who need care, it is not good
for employees and it is not good for the rest of
us.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000477" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000477">The
situation is getting worse. It is easy to say that there were always
some of these kinds of contracts, but a large department store in my
city was employing one of my constituents on a part-time basis for many
years. It was part time and that suited her. What did not suit her,
however, was being told, “Sorry, we cannot offer you this kind
of contract anymore; we can only offer you a zero-hours contract where
you may have to work in the evening, at weekends or on Sundays.”
That was not going to help her with her child care. When she 
<?notus-xml column=787?>argued the point and said, “I can’t do this,” the
response was, “Well, go and find another job. There are plenty
of people who
can.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000478" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000478">This
is a changing employment pattern that has been getting worse, and I do
not think it is altogether accidental. It fits the narrative of the
Government’s welfare reform programme. During the passage of the
Welfare Reform Bill, there was much waxing lyrical from the Government
Benches about the joys of mini-jobs—small jobs that people would
be able to do because of the structure of the new benefit. That fits
very well with zero-hours contracts, because the state will be
subsidising employers by making it easier for them to give people
mini-jobs with zero-hours contracts and they will hopefully be able to
survive because their income will be topped
up.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000479" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000479">In
the debate there has been an illusion about the choices that people are
able to make. Self-employed contractors have the freedom to choose to
work when they want to, usually on a pretty good hourly rate. There is
a huge difference between choosing to work in that way and it being the
only choice an employee has. Having control over working hours and a
working pattern is very different from being forced to work. There is
no choice if it is the only work on offer and it is the employer, not
the individual, who decides when to work—that is a major
difference. It can be very nice for individuals to be flexible if they
have a choice about their working arrangements. That is not what so
many of my constituents now face.</hs_Para>

Zero-hours contracts are an outrageous abuse for tens of thousands,

this afternoon about fantastic employment figures, so many private
sector jobs being created and the demise of the public sector, which is
apparently great news. That has not happened where I live. What we have

working is an employers’ utopia: back to the bad old days of
queuing up at the factory gates, the shipyard or the pit and asking to

out whether they will have employment. That is a little different from

the morning wanting the best for their families—don’t we
all want the best for our families, to put food on the table and to
give our kids the up-to-date clothing, like everyone else in the school
yard? Let us put ourselves in the position of somebody on a zero-hours
contract. Perhaps both parents are on such contracts. How on earth can
they plan a month ahead, two months ahead, a year ahead? Forget that if
they were in full employment with a proper contract, they would have
employment protection—forget that just for a moment and look at
the social side; they are running out of money on a weekly or monthly
basis because they do not have the hours; they are getting into debt,
borrowing money from friends or Wonga or taking out a payday loan,
because that is the only way they can make ends meet.</hs_Para>

is happening with people on zero-hours contracts. They are looking for
alternative sources of income, for extra employment, but many firms
that employ people on zero-hours contracts state that the person must
be available 24/7, so they cannot get alternative employment; they are
stuck with it, even if it means an hour a week. If someone cannot make
ends meet, wants to work, is not unemployed, being on a zero-hours
contract, and is trying to do the best they can for their family,
surely that is a cause of much anxiety. Imagine being in that
situation. It causes health problems and then more problems along the
line. Some on zero-hours contracts have no access to other forms of
finance, not having contingency funds like other, more wealthy people
further up the social ladder, so they find it very difficult. And
because they have no guarantee of employment, they find it difficult to
access legalised credit. This causes all sorts of social
mayhem.</hs_Para>

zero-hours contracts suit some people on the basis that they will get
employment for a week a month, but that is the few; the vast majority
of people in the workplace on zero-hours contracts suffer greatly
socially. These are people at the very bottom of the ladder and
extremely desperate for employment. At times in my constituency, 28
people have been applying for each job. Those people would be delighted
to have a zero-hours contract, if they thought they would get some
employment, but zero-hours contracts take them off the unemployment
register and basically massage the employment figures. There is an
argument for outlawing, outright, zero-hours contracts. Government
Members have said that there are some abuses, but I say we should get

afternoon’s debate has added yet another dimension to the cost
of living crisis that is engulfing the UK. It is not just the weekly
shop, the energy bill or travel costs, but the hidden contributor of
job insecurity. It is worth reminding ourselves that the UK had the
third most flexible employment regime in the OECD even before this
Government came to power and that there is a direct correlation between
job insecurity, consumer confidence and economic growth. In fact, the
Lib Dem Member for North Norfolk (Norman Lamb), the former
employment relations Minister, said that any changes to the employment
regime that undermined consumer confidence and created job insecurity
would be “crazy”. He later got the employment relations
ministerial brief and proceeded to do exactly what he said he would not
do.</hs_Para>

have discussed the plethora of other changes that have been made to the
employment regime. It is worth reflecting on those changes, because
they feed into the insecurity at work, which many hon. Members have
mentioned, that is a symptom of zero-hours contracts. We have
had—this is not an exclusive list, but gives an indication of
why people feel more insecure at work—the qualification period
increased to two years, collective redundancy cut to 45 days, fees for
employment tribunals, the consequences of which were mentioned by my
hon. Friend the Member for Wrexham (Ian Lucas), compensated no-fault
dismissal by the back door and settlement agreements. We have also had
shares for rights, compensation and employment tribunals slashed, lay
people taken off employment tribunals and employment appeal tribunals,
TUPE regulations diluted—that is perhaps partly why the problem
of zero-hours contracts has increased—the Agricultural Wages
Board abolished, national minimum wage enforcement slashed, the very
existence of the Gangmasters Licensing Authority questioned, and health
and safety taken back to before the Boer war. That is a cocktail of job
insecurity, which is highlighted by the fact that we are having this
debate on zero-hours contracts.</hs_Para>

Members have talked about whether we should have done more in
government. Many hon. Members have made that criticism, but it is a
false 
<?notus-xml column=790?>criticism, because they are missing the explosion of zero-hours
contracts in recent years and the underemployment that we are seeing
across everyone’s constituency.</hs_Para>

contracts are not a new phenomenon—we have mentioned that
already. They work for some employees—let us put that on the
record; of course they do—but let us be clear, and say time and
again, that the exploitative nature of such contracts has to be dealt
with. That is what we need to do in the House today—and, indeed,
in anything the Government bring forward. It is also not hard to see
why zero-hours contracts are attractive to employers. They allow for
maximum flexibility. However, in many cases, we are seeing the transfer
of business risk—this is an important point—in a
difficult economy from the employer to the employee. We should not hide
behind the word “flexibility” so that it can mean
exploitation.</hs_Para>

at why the Government are so interested in zero-hours contracts and
flexibility. Could it be because they have a flexible Cabinet? They
have a part-time Chancellor. Indeed, I might even contest that the
Business Secretary himself is on a zero-hours contract with the Liberal
Democrats so that he can work full time for the Tories to deliver all
these attacks on workers’ rights. Whether he likes it or not,
that seems to be the case he is putting through. I wonder whether this
issue also epitomises the kind of economy that this Government are
looking to achieve—a low-wage, low-skilled, low-productivity
work force that has insecure employment, to provide maximum flexibility
and start a hire-and-fire culture. The Minister might come to the
Dispatch Box and dispel that rumour, but it was only 24 hours ago that
he suggested that small business should be exempt from any employment
law whatever. If that is not creating a hire-and-fire culture, I do not
know what is.</hs_Para>

reflect on the Government’s response to this issue. Although I
appreciate the tone of the Secretary of State’s earlier
comments—many have mentioned that—the record is: three
BIS officials working part time on this issue, “speaking
informally” to stakeholders, with a consultation promised some
time in November. The Business Secretary said he hoped it would start
some time in November, and I hope that he will bring forward strong
proposals.</hs_Para>

have spoken about issues in their constituencies and about what
zero-hours contracts mean to their constituents. My hon. Friend the
Member for Halifax (Mrs Riordan) made a powerful contribution. She made
the critical point that most employers in Halifax look after their
staff. I think that the vast majority of employers leave home every day
to go to work with the intention of looking after their staff so 
<?notus-xml column=791?>that they can have a productive work force. I was struck by my hon.

disappointed that the hon. Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) is no

people on zero-hours contracts with his zero-hours contract as a

Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Paul Farrelly) has always
been a strong proponent of the arguments that we are putting forward
today. He rightly concluded that zero-hours contracts needed to be
used, but he also argued powerfully that, if major private sector
employers such as Tesco, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s do not need
to use them, others such as Wetherspoon’s and Burger King should
not need to either. This is all about fairness in the

self-employment with zero-hours contracts. It is particularly unfair
for a Government Member to stand up and compare people on zero-hours

of staff had the hours that they were contracted to do. That was a
major part of running my own business, and if I was able to do it, I do
not see why other organisations should not be able to do it too.
Zero-hours contracts are bad for business. I spent a lot of time
ensuring that people were paid properly, and were doing their
contracted hours so that they could pay their rent or their mortgage,
but premises not far from me that had 15 people on zero-hours contracts
were taking on only eight or nine of them to work on any particular

Foundation also found that people on zero-hours contracts earned on
average £6 an hour less, so the problem is not only lacking
hours of work, but what happens when the hours are offered. Case law
about the mutuality of obligation needs to be investigated further.
When zero-hours contracts are exploited, there is no mutuality of
obligation when people go for work and when they have been given work.
We need that issue to be dealt with clearly.</hs_Para>

to what the Leader of the Opposition announced last month, which covers
some of the issues raised about banning exploitative use rather than
zero-hours contracts themselves. My right hon. Friend rightly spoke
about banning employers from insisting that those on 
<?notus-xml column=794?>zero-hours contracts are available, even when there is no guarantee of
any work; stopping these contracts that require workers to work
exclusively for one firm, which the Secretary of State mentioned;
ending the misuse of zero-hours contracts where employees are in
practice working regular hours over a sustained period; and putting in
place a code of practice that will allow people to use these contracts
properly.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671000523" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0002.htm#13101671000523">The
cost-of-living crisis engulfing this country is made worse by
insecurity in the job market. That crisis can be tackled only by
ensuring that people are secure in their employment and are paid a
proper wage for a proper day’s work. I hope that Members will
support our
motion.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/1D10FACDE17FFF0DD598CF5549781E27E9B060F5" __version__="1.5"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

Minister of State, Department for Business, Innovation and Skills
(Michael Fallon):</Member></B><B> </B>May I thank the many Members who
have spoken in this debate, which has been good natured? There have
been a number of passionate speeches. Those who have contributed fall
into two groups. There are clearly those who want to squeeze out
flexible-hour contracts altogether: the hon. Members for Halifax (Mrs
Riordan), for East Antrim (Sammy Wilson), for Sunderland Central (Julie
Elliott), for Wigan (Lisa Nandy) and for Wansbeck (Ian Lavery). There
are others who have taken a more nuanced approach. It was my hon.
Friend the Member for Hexham (Guy Opperman) who said that we needed to
be neither for nor against flexible-hour contracts, but that we needed
to deal with the exploitation. The hon. Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme
(Paul Farrelly) welcomed the consultation that we are planning, but
asked, quite fairly, whether it would encompass the wider issues of
shorter hours and agency working. I pay tribute to the hon. Member for
Wirral South (Alison McGovern) for the work that she has done on this
matter, and she said that she was willing to engage with the
Government’s consultation. She has accepted that the sample that
she has produced so far is relatively limited, but we are very happy to
look at her work, and I welcome her offer to engage with the Government
on it.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Burnley (Gordon Birtwistle) made some strong

that that will be central to our consultation. He also made the point

Friend the Member for Mid Norfolk (George Freeman) spoke of the
importance of retaining flexibility in the modern business environment
and adduced powerful support for flexible-hour contracts from a range
of business and personnel organisations. My hon. Friend the Member for
Braintree (Mr Newmark) was the only Member who spoke in the debate to
point to the latest employment and unemployment figures, and I am
rather surprised that no Opposition Member today was able to recognise
the continuing increase in the number of people working, whether in the
north-east or the south-east. It is a shame that more Members did not
give due credit to the increase in
employment.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for Dover (Charlie Elphicke) drew attention to the
issue of eligibility for mortgages and rental tenancies for those who
are on such contracts. It is important that we look at that aspect. The
hon. Member for Edinburgh East (Sheila Gilmore) raised the issue of the
application of flexible-hour contracts in the care industry, and spoke
about the number of such services that have been contracted out.
However, a great number of councils up and down the country, and not
just subcontracted firms, are using flexible-hour contracts: Doncaster,
Southwark and Liverpool, for example. The issue is not simply one for
privatised contracted labour.</hs_Para>

have been expressed about the way in which these contracts work, which
is why the Government have listened and decided to act. As my right

concern—issues such as transparency in contracts and the
availability of information, advice and guidance to ensure that
individuals are aware of their rights and companies are aware of their
obligations to provide, for instance, holiday pay, sick pay, redundancy
pay and travelling time payments. As I said to my hon. Friend the

House recognises that high streets and town and city centres are vital
to local economies; acknowledges that many small businesses and
retailers are struggling under the pressure of business rates rises;
notes that since 2010 shop vacancy rates have remained at over 14 per
cent but that there has been a 20 per cent increase in numbers of
payday loan shops and a three per cent increase in numbers of betting
shops in the last year; is concerned that recent changes to permitted
development rights and use classes are likely to lead to an
over-concentration of betting shops and payday loan companies in many
areas, against the wishes of local people and businesses; and calls on
the Government to give local communities a greater say over the shape
of their own high streets and town and city centres, including control
over use classes, to help encourage the more widespread use of
neighbourhood planning and greater cooperation between local
communities and businesses and to cut and then freeze business rates
from 2015 to help small businesses on UK high streets and town and city

significant squeeze on household and personal incomes, resulting in
muted spending and an increase in retail failures. The high street has
not only been hit by falling living standards but has had to contend
with the rise in internet shopping. Yes, shopping habits are changing,
but the high streets and town centres are still very important to the

been busy giving away the powers that do exist to provide for that. In
May, the Government legislated to allow changes to use classes so that

that councils were not using parking charges to their “full

million parking fines a year were issued in England. What was the

Member for City of Durham rightly said, the internet is not just a
creative technology; it is changing retail dramatically. The fall of
some retailers—household names that we all knew well, such as
Blockbuster and the old HMV—was down to weaknesses in their
business models and an inability to keep up with the pace of change.
They struggled to adapt to modern behaviour and could not compete with
the rise of the new online retailers, which now make up almost 15% of
the market—a figure that experts say will rise exponentially.
High streets have changed and must continue to do so. The best
retailers and the best high streets and town centres are already
looking at how they can and should adapt to become places where people
live, shop, use services and spend their leisure time, but there are no
quick and easy solutions. As hon. Members will know, that will take

about 20 years of decline. If that is true, we should

Government are committed to helping communities to adapt. We believe
that plans and ideas for town centres must come from local areas
themselves. It is for councils, businesses and communities to decide
what their high streets and town centres will look like. Government
cannot and should not look to bail out or prop up ailing high street
businesses with taxpayers’ money, nor should we just introduce
new taxes—as has been suggested by the Opposition—to
create a level playing field of misery. Higher taxes destroy jobs and
undermine enterprise. Government must support local people, building

that issue around the country over the past few years. We took action
following her review, providing communities with the means to establish

approaches. We have put in place 27 Portas pilots and more that 350

share learning and spread best practice. Business in the Community has

change in their towns, and a lot has been achieved by the pilots and
town teams. For example, Market Rasen has built a market from scratch,
which earlier this year won a prestigious award for being
Britain’s best small speciality market. Dartford has introduced
Sunday trading with free parking and subsidised advertising. Stockton
has launched a discounted business rates scheme for businesses that
take over a vacant shop in the town centre. That is something that
councils now have the power to do, thanks to this Government. Ipswich
has a brave, large-scale master plan to reorient its high street so
that it runs from east to west instead of from north to south. It is
making the most of its assets to transform its existing town centre and
its waterfront. A variety of mixed and leisure uses have been approved,

opportunities. Those are just a handful of examples; there are many

received by developers. A recent survey of just 15% of councils by

prior approval applications for change of use from offices to
residential in the first two to three months. That includes a number of
applications to create over 100 new dwellings. The Labour party opposes
those reforms, yet also opposes brownfield
regeneration—providing badly needed new homes at no cost to the
taxpayer. If the Labour party does not want more homes in our towns and
cities, where should people go for them? These practical changes are
already helping to boost the economy, but there is more we can
do.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671001234" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101671001234">The

relaxations of change of use. We want to unlock the potential of
underused and unused retail premises while providing much needed homes

increase footfall and boost local shops and businesses. We also want to
allow retail premises to change to banks and building societies,
delivering more branches on the high street and encouraging more choice

circumstances, it is right for people to receive compensation in

every part of the country, and especially where the riots caused
damage, that we get high streets working, bringing back vitality and
business. It is also why we postponed the revaluation until 2017,
helping to avoid sharp changes and unexpected hikes in rates bills over
the next five years. The biggest beneficiaries from a 2015 revaluation
would not have been small shops, including in the north of England, but
prime office space in London. City banks would have seen plummeting
bills, while everyone else would have faced soaring bills to pay for
it. We have cut taxes for small firms and small shops, and we are
encouraging innovation. Pop-up shops are a great way for start-up
businesses to enter the high street. We have provided support through
practical advice on how to set up pop-up shops. My Department even has
its own pop-up shop, which I commend to hon. Members wondering what
Christmas presents to buy this year.</hs_Para>

More than 700 places ran 3,500 markets in England, and many people took

been announced for 2014, so “Love your local market” is
well on its way to becoming an annual event. Markets have an important

steps to tackle the draconian parking charges and enforcement that we
inherited. We have removed previous requirements in planning guidance

use. Our guidance now encourages authorities to set competitive 
<?notus-xml column=818?>charges, and to ensure that parking in town centres is convenient, safe,

point that the hon. Gentleman was making, which was that the value of
retail sites has moved yet we still think our town centres are the
thumping heart of retail. If we continue to think that, we will drive
retailers out of town centres completely. So we need to be very aware
of business rates on non-domestic properties in high streets, which are
still too high. They are also based on pre-credit-crunch valuations, so

business rate relief is still made a mystery to many local businesses
in our town centres. We have not given it the push it needs and
deserves, and many of the opportunities remain unclaimed by small
businesses. I urge the Government, and us all, to do more to bring
small business rate relief to the attention of many small businesses
which have struggled through the recession and now see light at the end
of the tunnel but need all the help they can get. Similarly, small
businesses are less equipped to deal with red tape and with the lease
negotiations than large retailers and their resources.</hs_Para>

still include upward-only rent reviews and we have to do something
about that. We have talked about it in this place for a very long time

said that out-of-town development has been immensely harmful, not least
in the imbalance of valuation of rate, I shall come on to the damage
done by local government. Councils have been the major enemy of our
town centres for 30 years. That applies to Labour councils, Liberal
councils and Conservative councils. Let me explain why. They have
allowed the gradual decline through ring roads, isolating town centres
and making it difficult for people to get there. I have already made
the point about out-of-town developments. Parking charges have been
seen as revenue income, although parking areas were built as a service
to shoppers. At last our councils are beginning to appreciate that.
Building parking areas on the other side of the ring road so that
shoppers have to push their trolley across the ring road does not make
a great deal of sense from a planning
perspective.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671001283" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101671001283">Poor
planning—piecemeal planning—has denuded our town centres
dramatically. One of the problems is that a new planning officer will
come along with his own little pet scheme, which he will implement
without any reference to the heritage of the town or the style of the
building. Planning officers are supposed to be the protectors of our
heritage, our good open spaces and our buildings, yet they too have
been a disaster for 30 years in many of our town centres. I
know people who have gone down to their town centre, managed to get
across the ring road, seen the new developments and felt that it was
not their town at all. The new development gave no understanding of the
heritage of the
town.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101671001284" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101671001284">We
need local government to recognise that it has a responsibility to
ensure that our town centres are more user-friendly, to ensure that
people can get in and out of them easily, to ensure that parking
charges are low so that people can come in to shop, and to ensure that
we bring people back into our town centres. Too many local government
offices have been shoved outside with that new retail development.
There is much more that we can do. If anybody wants to read the report,
I would be
delighted.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/950854CD3FD80EB53109CF03DC01A37E404265A1" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

gaining responsibility for the Government’s high street policy.
I take the opportunity to declare an interest. Later this year, before

by talking about Rochdale’s high street. It is suffering just as
much as many others across the United Kingdom. It has an average number
of empty shops, but it lacks diversity. We have too many charity shops,
too many “cash a cheque” shops and far too many payday
loan companies. Our problems are similar to those in other towns, of
course, because the overall problem is the economy. The Government have
presided over a faltering and, at best, flatlining economy. That is
what is causing the failure on our high streets.</hs_Para>

make an important point: the growth in underemployment and the increase
in temporary, part-time jobs, zero-hours contracts and low-paid work
all feed through to the high street. The nature of that work is the
cause of the growth in the number of pawnbrokers and payday loan
companies on the high street, and not just in Rochdale, but in towns
and cities across the United Kingdom.</hs_Para>

Friend the Member for City of Durham (Roberta Blackman-Woods) referred
to the Local Data Company’s research, rightly published today,
which shows that although chain stores and multiples are in decline,
the number of independent retailers is increasing. That
shows—again, this is a reflection of the economy—that the
people who have been made redundant over the past couple of years have
used their redundancy money to be entrepreneurial and to set up shops.
I do not decry that point, because it is an effect of what has been
going on in the economy, but it has caused churn and flux on our high
streets.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000013" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000013">Another
important point about the economy is the living standards crisis that
the Government have caused. They cannot take £1,500 a year off
the average working family and expect that not to have an impact on the
high street. The consequence is a major drop in consumer confidence,
and it has certainly changed shopping habits. That, too, is having a
direct impact.</hs_Para>

it is not all the Government’s fault—internet shopping
has had an impact, of course—but I believe that they have a
laissez-faire attitude towards our high streets and that is causing
many of the problems. We have seen their Portas review. The problem is
that it has not had much of an impact. They ignored Mary
Portas’s comments on business rates, which I think was a
mistake. The Portas pilots and the review have now become mired in
problems and scandals about how much she was paid by Channel 4 and
whether Channel 4 and the programme producers had any involvement in
liaising with the Department about where the pilots should be. What I
think the Government have learned from that episode is that reality TV
is no way to develop Government
policy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000015" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000015">The
Government would do better by listening to Bill Grimsey’s
alternative high street review. He talks about the need for stronger
local leadership, better local analysis of what is going on in local
areas and better use of 
<?notus-xml column=824?>technology on the high street. Most importantly, he calls for a radical
overhaul of business rates. To illustrate that point, we learned
yesterday that inflation now means that business rates will increase in
April by 3.2%. According to my analysis, that will add an extra
£200 million to the bills of hard-pressed
retailers—not all business; just retailers. The truth is that we
pay the highest property taxes in the European Union. By 2015 the

about the threat of the internet, the perennial problem of parking,
out-of-town shopping, pop-up shops, council policy and the like, but
again and again we get back to business rates, which make it hard for

problems of revaluation and appeals against current valuations, which
take an inordinate amount of time. When I raised revaluation during
Business, Innovation and Skills questions not long ago, I think in the
previous Session, the Minister, the right hon. Member for Sevenoaks

very specific. If we give a discount or make any kind of reduction to
high street retail rates, will that include the whole retail sector and

the hon. Member for Northampton South (Mr Binley) said, very
little money is being made on the high street at present, and the
amount of money that was made in the past will never be made again. The
big chains recognise that and are altering their retail model. They
have reduced their high street presence and will not come back in the

address it

some way or another, we must look to the Government to come up with a
solution. That will involve the Department for Communities and Local
Government, which, judging from its comments so far, is relatively
sympathetic; the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which
is broadly sympathetic, unless it is lobbied hard by the big traders;
and, specifically, the Treasury, which can be fairly unbending on this
subject. The Minister needs to set up a cross-departmental meeting that
involves the retail sectors, joins up the initiatives—not the
silly ones, such as those centred on parking on double yellow
lines—and takes action on rates. If the Minister does that, I
think he will become the hero of the high street. The high street can
get more savvy with the web, diversify more, hold more events and
extend or vary its hours, but with the albatross of business rates
around its neck it simply cannot
thrive.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/520E217E215B77B8C6C3CBCE49CC4DDE79D955CA" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

centres and our high streets matter: they give us our sense of place,
they tell us who we are and they tell us a bit about the history of our
communities. People care passionately for them for those reasons. My
constituency has lots of little shopping areas and four main shopping
town centres. Crownpoint in Denton is the largest shopping centre,
followed by Houldsworth square in Reddish, King street in Dukinfield
and Haughton Green village. They all face different challenges and have

planning changes, which have been touched on by the hon. Member for
Northampton South (Mr Binley), the trend for out-of-town shopping had a
catastrophic effect on two of the town centres, namely Denton and King
street. It started in the 1980s with the planning free-for-all that led
to a large rise in the number of out-of-town shopping centres. The
construction of an out-of-town Sainsbury’s in Denton led to a
dramatic decrease in town centre trade at Crownpoint, and the
construction of a Morrisons in Dukinfield and an Asda in
Ashton-under-Lyne—on either side of King street—led to a
dramatic decline in trade on the traditional shopping street in
Dukinfield.</hs_Para>

I agree with the hon. Member for Northampton South about the impact of

constituency. Labour-controlled Tameside metropolitan borough council
has established town teams in its five main town centres of
Ashton-under-Lyne, Denton, Droylsden, Hyde and Stalybridge. Those are
not Portas pilots, but were established on the initiative of the
council. They are all different in their make-up and have different

suppose that I should declare an interest as a proud member of the
Denton town team. We have developed a vision for Denton that is unique
to Denton. We have organised some town team events. We had a party in
Victoria park over the summer to celebrate the centenary of that fine
piece of civic open space, we are holding an Oktoberfest this month and
we have started to organise the Christmas lights and events for the

importantly, the town team has led an initiative to create a new pop-up
shop in Denton town centre. We had a “Dragons’
Den”-style competition to design and build a new modular shop.
Bill Jennings, the chair of the Denton town team, has worked with the
council and the local college on that competition. The winning entry
has been built and the planning permission has been granted for a piece
of wasteland opposite what used to be Denton’s market square.
The new pop-up shop will be a confectioners where one can buy
traditional sweets out of a jar, such as a quarter—I still use
old money—of midget gems. Those are the initiatives being led by
Denton town team.</hs_Para>

not only about occupancy rates, however, and my hon. Friend the Member
for City of Durham is right about the over-concentration of uses, as
that changes the vibrancy and vitality of our shopping streets. In
Denton, the problem is less one of payday lenders and bookmakers than
of takeaways. Takeaways are great, and in the evening the main street
is thriving and vibrant. During the day, however, the shutters are
down, which gives an impression that Denton in the day time is closed
for business. We must consider how to deal with that.</hs_Para>

minute I want to talk about the Stockport part of my constituency.
Stockport is a Portas pilot town, but the part I
represent—Reddish—is concerned that it might be
overlooked because of the concentration on Stockport town centre. In
partnership with businesses in Reddish, town councillors have
established the Reddish business forum. That is a different approach
from the one taken by the Tameside part of my constituency, but it is
having a big impact. Businesses are driving changes to the high street
around Houldsworth square in Reddish so that they do not get left
behind. They have organised a fantastic arts
festival—ReddFest—which has been running for three years,
and they have held markets and community events on Houldsworth square.
It is working; that is best practice—local government working
with business for local communities. Those local communities have the
answers and we must trust them to deliver. That is why I commend the
contribution made by those on the Labour Front Bench. This is about
empowering our local communities to do the right thing for our town
centres.</hs_Para>

my remarks on the threat to town centres from out-of-town retail and
internet shopping, both of which did not start only three years ago.
Given the threat from out-of-town retail, it is right to have a 
<?notus-xml column=829?>“town centre first” policy, and last year when considering
the national planning policy framework, the Communities and Local
Government Committee was insistent that such a policy should be
included. It is important to ensure that if development can take place
in a town centre, it should do so over development on other sites. I am
often asked why I am so supportive of a “town centre
first” policy, but anyone who has visited the United States,
where there are few planning controls, will see holed-out town and city
centres, with doughnutted different shopping developments round the
outside.</hs_Para>

constituency of Rugby is faced with an interesting dilemma, namely the
proposed redevelopment of an existing out-of-town centre, with a firm
commitment for a department store to be located out of town. In Rugby
we have aspired to a department store for more than 30 or 40
years—I well remember a vacant site in the town centre awaiting
such a development, but it did not come. We now have the opportunity to
take that development out of town, or not at all, and I regret that we
will be doing the right thing in taking it out of town. I will speak
later about the importance of accepting new housing and how that can
support retail. The proposal from my local authority to accept new
housing means that we will have sufficient customers both for the
enhancement of existing out-of-town retail, and to support our existing
town centre.</hs_Para>

been made to internet shopping. That is increasingly becoming the norm
and town centres must adapt. Broadly, I believe that if 12% or 15% of
retail purchases are conducted over the internet, town centres must
reduce the size of the shopping available by a similar amount. The
alternative is to grow a population. If we grow our population, we can
defend the size of our existing town centre. A progressive Conservative
council in Rugby is building 1,300 new homes at the gateway site.
Further developments will result in 6,200 new homes. Communities cannot
legitimately speak of their disappointment with high street decline if
they are unwilling to accept the need for additional new housing in
their
areas.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000053" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000053">On

Blenkinsop</B> (Middlesbrough South and East Cleveland) (Lab):</Member>
My constituency has a string of individual settlements with local high
streets or estate precinct shopping provision. The high streets in
Middlesbrough and East Cleveland face two challenges—one
long-standing challenge and another relatively recent
one.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000061">The
long-standing challenge is out-of-town shopping, which began in my area
under the previous Conservative Government, when the Teesside
Development Corporation built Teesside shopping park. We acknowledge
that that was a good thing for the local area and that it
provided lots of employment, but in the short to medium
term, there was no plan for high streets in Middlesbrough, East
Cleveland and Stockton to deal with the effects of out-of-town
shopping, an American
phenomenon.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000062" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000062">The
second challenge is the growth of web-based retailing, with goods
delivery to the door. Neither threat can be engineered out of
existence. They are a fact of life enshrined in past planning decisions
and the advance of new technology. Therefore, if our local high streets
in Guisborough, Loftus, Skelton and Brotton are to survive as proper
retail outlets, and not just as monolithic parades of hot food
takeaways, betting shops and charity outlets, imaginative thinking is
required. We need both to be flexible with our built high street
environment and to have the support mechanisms to ensure that high
streets are allowed to remain
competitive.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000063" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000063">One
concern is the erosion, as a result of cuts to local council funding
and changes to the regeneration framework imposed in the name of blind
ideology, of the support that local authorities and regeneration
agencies could provide. One example of that erosion can be seen in the
main shopping area in my constituency, Guisborough, where support from
the local authority, Redcar and Cleveland borough council, in the shape
of help from borough-wide high street managers, is no more. An
ambitious programme underpinned by the then regional development
agency, the market towns initiative, has disappeared along with the
RDA.</hs_Para>

hampered by a lack of support from the finance and insurance industries
regarding the conversion of upper floors of older retail premises,
where traditionally a 1900s shopkeeper and his family lived. New
housing is hampered by soaring insurance premiums, as insurers declare
that such occupation provides a security risk to

threat comes from the approach of the Department for Communities and
Local Government, which sees any form of development and occupancy,
however much it would harm the ambience, style, attractiveness and
vitality of the high street and the traditional retailers, as necessary
to provide fig leaf support for the proposition that the
Government’s economic policies are bearing fruit—even if
that fruit is a poisoned apple for neighbouring businesses. Successive
changes to use class orders and permitted development rights are
eroding the powers needed by local authorities and local communities to
shape their high streets and town centres to reflect local needs,
demands and aspirations. The changes to once unquestioned and accepted
planning rules are making it possible for payday lenders, betting shops
and fast food takeaways to open without getting the kind of planning
permission which, complete with provisions, enabled a balanced stance
to change and development in a retail
setting.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000066" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000066">Imposing
a laissez-faire approach that deregulates change of use so that no such
permissions are required merely leads to bad neighbour problems for
everyone and encourages fly-by-night forms of unsustainable development
that cash in on passing social trends, with no thought to encouraging
organic change for the better in the host setting. One such example is
the spread of pawnbrokers and cheque-cashing outlets as a result of
widespread poverty and the need to realise assets simply to get some
cash to feed a family. Such changes are often cumulative—one
outlet selling cheap booze or hot food takeaways is often followed by a
competitor. The same is true of the finance industry, which has
followed a pattern of migration from a specific A2 business enclave to
a former Al shop front entry high street presence, thus suffocating the
chance of niche retailers opening in their
stead.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000067" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000067">Use
class orders have been vital to protecting public health. It is the
application of such orders by local councils, including those in my
constituency, that has barred hot food takeaways from opening near
school gates. Without such controls, that could again become a problem
and have a long-term detrimental impact on children’s health. As
I know from my constituency postbag, such matters are high on the
agenda of concern for my constituents. It is far better to keep some
forms of control regarding the use and make-up of our high streets,
while at the same time tackling the real problems facing small
retailers: constant increases in business rates, lack of any real
tangible support from bankers and insurers, and constant rent increases
that are often determined by remote financial institutions such as big
pension funds, which seek to maximise income at the expense of quality
of
life.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000068" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000068">Labour’s
pledge to cut and then freeze business rates will help 1.5 million
small businesses, many of which are in retail premises. That will give
local shops a real boost, unlike the pursuit of the chimera of a

Government Front Benchers.</hs_Para>

Marcus Jones</B> (Nuneaton) (Con):</Member> I welcome today’s
debate. High streets and town centres are vital to every constituency.
Many that were once vibrant face immense challenges from the pressures
of structural change, such as the year-on-year double-digit growth in
online retail and the continued growth of out-of-town retail. I had
hoped that the motion would contain helpful measures, but it seems to
be concerned with political ideology set on dictating to individuals
what they might want, rather than providing the answers to the problems
that our high streets and town centres
face.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000070" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000070">I
commend the Government for removing permitted development rights, which
are referred to in the motion, from our town centres. One of the
biggest issues we have is an oversupply of retail and office space,
particularly in secondary areas—a problem that a lot of people
do not like to admit. There is a lack of footfall in these areas and a
lack of maximisation of available time. For example, there is often not
a very good early evening economy. It is an excellent idea, therefore,
to allow landlords to turn commercial property into residential
property. We need far more people to live in most town centres to
create that footfall and that early-evening economy.</hs_Para>

limiting certain use classes, there is a real risk of unintended
consequences. Across the country, many of our struggling town centres
have more of the use classes that the hon. Member for City of Durham
(Roberta Blackman-Woods) mentioned, so what she advocates could
destabilise town centres. Of the use classes the Opposition have a
problem with, one is payday lending. I must admit that I am not overly
keen on payday lending; it has its place, but the regulation needs to
be looked at. The Government are doing that, however, and that is a far
better way of dealing with payday lending than saying, “You
can’t be in a particular town centre because of planning
regulations.” I mentioned the structural change in retailing,
but there has been a structural change in bookmaking too; bookmakers
have shifted from the periphery and secondary areas to primary areas,
because as town centres have become more difficult to fill, landlords
have reduced rents, bringing bookmakers on to the high street. We need
to consider both industries carefully, because we do not want to end up
with more empty shops, fewer jobs and less VAT, national insurance and
corporation tax being paid.</hs_Para>

Jones:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a good point. It is for
individuals to choose whether to use bookmakers, but there is obviously
a market for them and they create jobs on the high street. At the end
of the day, would we rather have somewhere empty and possibly boarded
up, or a bookmaker? I know which I would choose. I would choose to have
the property occupied. The Opposition Front-Bench team grimace, but
from how they have been talking about our high streets and town
centres, one would think there was 100% occupancy and that these
businesses were forcing out other businesses. If the hon. Member for
City of Durham came out to high streets and town centres across the
country, she would know that high streets are struggling and that there
are a lot of empty units. Those businesses are not forcing people out,
as she insinuates.</hs_Para>

speaking to local businesses that business rates are a challenge.
Although many of the secondary areas in my constituency town centre
benefit from the small business rate relief—I am glad the
Government have extended that until 2014, a policy that Labour opposed,
and that some of those small businesses will receive £2,000
towards their national insurance bill, which will be very
welcome—there is a challenge for small businesses in primary
areas of town centres, where they do not benefit from the rate relief.
We need to look at that carefully to see what we can do to help those
small businesses. This is a complex area, but I am greatly concerned by
Labour’s policy and how it would pay for it. It advocates
scrapping the Government’s pro-business, pro-jobs reduction in
corporation tax, which would be a retrograde step. It wants to send the
message to businesses that we are closed for business and inward
investment and to halt the progress that the Government are making. We
have already created 1.4 million new jobs.</hs_Para>

liked to raise several other issues today, but in general, the motion

me concern about the direction of Labour policy in wanting to control
individuals. I will certainly be opposing the motion

talk about the retailers in the three town centres in my constituency,
in Formby, Crosby and Maghull. Like others, we have enthusiastic and
energetic local retailers who are committed to their local communities
and work incredibly hard. Many of them do an excellent job and run
superb businesses, but they are desperate for improvements to be made

talked a lot today about those challenges and some of the difficulties.
The three high streets that I represent face similar challenges, albeit
with slightly different issues. The town of Maghull has a small
supermarket with a parade of shops—people have to cross the road
to get to the main part of the town centre—and has the second
part of the Portas funding, backed up by funding from the local
council. Crosby also has funding from round two of the Portas pilot,
which is backed by the local council as well. In Maghull the town
council has got involved—it has tried to use pop-up
shops—but recognises that this is only a short-term
fix.</hs_Para>

to the Minister—or I would have, but he is no longer in the
Chamber—that car parking is not the issue in the town centres
that I represent. People are 
<?notus-xml column=834?>going to out-of-town shopping centres for a number of reasons, not least
the convenience of being able to buy everything under one roof, so
whether we have car parking charges or not is somewhat irrelevant. I

car parks to charge for parking, but not for councils to do the
same.</hs_Para>

similar issue to Maghull with empty units. Other Members have mentioned
the number of charity shops, which is a particular issue in Formby,
which has something like 14 charity shops. Some of them sell the same,
new goods as other traders, but they do not compete on a level playing
field, because the cost base for charity shops is that much lower, as
they pay only 20% of business rates and are staffed by volunteers. I do
not wish to criticise charities and their need to raise funds, but that

need to trust local communities to come up with answers, because they
all have different opportunities. I have mentioned the opportunity to
link the beach and the visitor economy to support the high streets in
Formby and Crosby, but equally—this has come out a number of
times—local people do not want more legal loan sharks, bookies
or fast-food takeaways taking over at every available opportunity. They
want to see high-quality retailers encouraged into high streets and to
support good local traders, not necessarily payday loan companies,
bookmakers or fast-food takeaways when there are too many of
them.</hs_Para>

good businesses, as I have said. Each of the three areas is underpinned
by a medium-sized supermarket. However, even having a supermarket in
the town centre is no guarantee of support for other traders, because
people tend to do all their shopping under the one roof, so whether it

streets to see a different picture emerging. People can afford the
rents and rates there, and businesses are doing much better because
their cost base is so much lower. He is absolutely right to suggest
that we cannot afford to wait for that revaluation to take place.
People are already on their knees and hanging on by their fingernails,

rates are certainly the No. 1 issue when I talk to retailers and small
businesses, and when I talk to representatives of the Federation of
Small Businesses, as I do from time to time. Businesses need help,
whether through business rates, through proper banking support
involving going back to the old-fashioned bank manager acting as an
adviser, through having a mentor to encourage and support them, or
through the local council and others in the community helping them to
make the most of the opportunities. That is how we will revitalise our
town centres. More payday loan companies, bookmakers and fast-food
takeaways are not the

we have to make shopping in the town centre an experience. In the old

Collins:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes a very good point, which
feeds into the debate on business rates, on which I shall touch.
Calling for a big cut in business rates is bold, is supported by the
business community and amounts to a very big tax cut. Like all tax
cuts, it has to be provided for. What we have seen so far from the
Government are cuts in taxes for small and large businesses. We have
seen targeted relief through enterprise zones and regional growth
funds, which help businesses on the high street as well as those in
other locations. We have seen more work done, too, on business
improvement districts. That support has been targeted in the areas
where it can really
help.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000096" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000096">What
we have seen from the Opposition side is a “rob Peter to pay
Paul” exercise between the business communities—taking
from some businesses and giving it to other businesses in a short-term
and small way, which I do not believe will make any difference at all.
It is by working together through business improvement districts and
through supporting all businesses with tax cuts that we will see the
changes that we need. Ultimately, good local plans will be the answer,
as the towns come together to say, “This is the sort of
experience we want to
create.”</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000097" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000097">Members
have been absolutely right to highlight the issue of parking.
Guidelines from the last Government undoubtedly encouraged local
authorities to reduce the 
<?notus-xml column=837?>number of cars in towns by encouraging people not to drive into the town
centre, by increasing parking charges and by making it difficult for
people to come into the towns to park. That has to be reversed. If we
want to meet the challenge posed by out-of-town shopping centres or
internet shopping, we must make it as easy as possible for people to
come into the town centre and choose to do their shopping physically
there, while providing them with a memorable, enjoyable and unique
experience. All our efforts should be focused on reducing unnecessary
charges and burdens. Many of us have fought campaigns in our own
constituencies to keep free on-street parking in town centres, to
encourage discretionary shopping and to bring people
in.</hs_Para>

teams and the business improvement districts have done particularly
good work here, for example by encouraging the roll-out of wi-fi in
town centres. We need to make our town centres places where people want
to live, work and spend their time. We need to encourage more people to
live in town centres through change of use so that people, as I say,
live, work and enjoy their leisure time in the town centre. That is

ability of the person to pay the money back. Nationally, there are 20%
more payday loan shops than a year ago. One key reason they have been
able to become so prevalent so quickly is that they have been able to
take over premises formerly designated for banks and building
societies. Being on the high street gives legitimacy to such companies,
yet the damage they can do is well documented. They appear to be a

in conjunction with the community, we would be better able to encourage
more responsible lenders, such as credit unions, to gain a foothold in
this market. Without the controls we propose, I fear that yet more of

Will Labour Members recognise that the liberalisation of licensing

recommendations on stores and the selection of stores quite confusing.
It was not clear whether they wanted people to choose which stores were
in the town centre, or whether they wanted to tell people what stores
should be in town centres. Perhaps I can help them by saying that those
who want to give people more choice should liberalise and allow people
to make their own decisions, but if they want to decide which stores
are right for people, that is socialism. The socialist selection of
stores that we have heard from Opposition Members is a flawed policy,

let me suggest that the example of the
“gamesmakers”—the volunteers who, during the
Olympics, came together to create a delightful experience for people
who wanted to attend the games—could be extended to our towns.
Perhaps we could create “townsmakers”. As we all know,
McDonald’s is a purveyor of excellent service in its
restaurants, and it also provided assistance during the London
Olympics. I had a very interesting conversation with the franchise
holder of McDonald’s in my home town. Perhaps the Minister could
have a conversation either with Mr Ishmael Anilmis, the franchise
holder of McDonald’s in Bedford—who is in himself an
excellent story of progress and entrepreneurship—or with
McDonald’s nationally about how the company can take what it has

35 years growing on the high street. My parents were shopkeepers, and I
am proud to be the daughter of shopkeepers. I have seen a great deal of
change on the high street, and I found Labour Members’
contributions to the debate somewhat disappointing. My hon. Friend the
Minister rightly said that we should take no lectures from the Labour
party when it comes to the future of the high street. I remember that
not so long ago, under the last Government, my parents’ shop was
closed because of Labour’s post office closure programme. That
brought devastation to many communities, including those on the high
street.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000118">As
was mentioned by the hon. Member for Rochdale (Simon Danczuk), there
has been a great deal of debate in the House about business rate
revaluation. He referred to the Bill Grimsey report. Bill Grimsey came
to Witham over the summer to work with my town team, to observe the
initiatives, and to discuss how we could enhance our high street and
town centre. Some very positive contributions had been made, but
business rates were still the No. 1 issue that was being raised by my
local shopkeepers. That is hardly surprising, because they pose a big
challenge.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0003.htm#13101682000119">While
the Minister has been very clear about where the Government stand on
rate revaluation, I ask him at least to consider at some
stage—if not now, hopefully immediately after 2015—taking
a fresh look at the issue. I should like him to think about what we can
do, and when we can introduce reform. In particular, I urge him to do
something that the Government have been doing very successfully thus
far, and continue to devolve more power down to local authorities and
communities. I ask him to encourage the provision of more support for
the survival and growth of local town centres and high streets through
some of the initiatives which we have already heard about. My hon.
Friend the Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Damian Collins) mentioned
not just town teams but business improvement districts. Those are
community-led initiatives. We need less state intervention, and more
community support and community innovation at the grass roots. That is
what will transform our town centres and high streets.</hs_Para>

doubt that we have done a great deal so far in terms of discounts on
rates. The Government’s sentiments are clear: they feel that
town centres need innovation and entrepreneurialism. We are doing good
things in cutting red tape and lowering taxes, which did not happen
under the last Government. Businesses in my community and in my
constituency know that it would never happen under a Labour Government,
because it was their socialist policies that did so much damage in the
last Administration. Moreover, it was a former Labour authority in my
constituency that did a great deal of damage to my local high street.
We are changing that now, which is a very positive
development.</hs_Para>

that has been touched on is the role of neighbourhood plans, which have
been reintroduced to return development powers to local communities.
Witham in particular is doing a great deal. The hon. Member for West
Ham (Lyn Brown) shakes her head. She is welcome to come to Witham and
see some of the good things that we are doing there. Neighbourhood
plans have been transformational in my community, and part of the
reason for that is development. There has been growth, which is
something that we should praise and encourage. There are more new
homes, and the new

I urge the Minister to come to Witham when he is en route to his
constituency, and to meet our town team and look at some of the
innovative ideas—the edginess—that we have, because this
is about the empowerment of local communities. I commend his
Department—in particular him and the Secretary of

high streets and town centres are struggling. We all know our shopping
habits are changing, but there are other critical factors affecting our
town centres. Living standards have been falling in 39 out of the
40 months that this Prime Minister has been in office, and
that is having a huge effect on high-street spend. Currently, one in
seven shops are empty—a threefold increase since 2008—and
many others are being turned into yet more payday lenders, betting
shops and takeaways. My hon. Friend the Member for Stockton North (Alex
Cunningham) highlighted the changing character of his high street and
he also outlined the good practice of his local council, and it was
good to hear that, as it was to hear the comments of the hon. Member

earlier, but, as has been said, his loss in the Deputy Speaker election
is our gain in today’s debate. Rather cheekily, however, I would
prefer to invite him to come to Corby and see what a great Labour local
authority has done. I understand the comments he has made about
out-of-town retail, and many other Members echoed them, but we have
protected Corby town centre and we have seen the fruits, as there are
now 8 million shoppers coming each year—and I hope that will be

over the past two years they have established the Portas pilots, the

failed to deliver the real change we need in the health and well-being
of our high streets and town centres. Well-intentioned though I am sure
some of the initiatives are, the truth is that the Government’s

listening to the Under-Secretary I share that feeling. Rather than
address the concerns raised by Mary Portas, the Government have now
introduced policies that look set to worsen the situation. Such
policies include the changes to the planning rules announced in May and
August, which strip communities of a say over their high streets. The
important difference that the changes will make is that they will allow
payday lenders and betting shops, which have always been able to open
up in banks and building societies, to take over other shops as well.
The Government are also allowing offices, shops and services such as
banks and building societies to be turned into flats and houses without
any proper strategy. That is the opposite of what our high streets need

(Mr Jones) in January 2012. On that occasion 50 Back
Benchers spoke in the debate so we know that there is huge interest in
the issue across the House. However, given that this was an
Opposition-day motion, there are rather more Labour Members in the
Chamber as we are coming up to the vote than there have been throughout
the entire debate. Considering that it was their own motion, it is
disappointing that more Labour MPs chose not to take
part.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000146" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682000146">It
is a particular pleasure on my first outing at the Dispatch Box to be
speaking about high streets. If I may be parochial for a moment, my
constituency, Bristol West, has the greatest high street in England
running right through the middle of it—the Gloucester road, the
longest stretch of independent businesses in the country. At the west
of my constituency there is Clifton village, full of independent shops
and boutiques, and in the east of my constituency is Stapleton road.
Rather as the right hon. Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Dame Joan
Ruddock) said of her constituency, Stapleton road in my constituency is
in one of the 10% most deprived census enumeration districts in
England, but it is a thriving high street and I pay tribute to all my
constituents there, particularly the new arrivals from Somalia in
recent years, who have opened small businesses in that
street.</hs_Para>

in that high street the problems of betting shops that the right hon.
Lady mentioned. She was the first of many speakers who mentioned that
problem, to which the Opposition motion refers. The general point that
was made was that nothing can be done about it. To all those who made
that point, I say there is something that can be done. There is
something in existing planning legislation that they could use; it is
called an article 4 directive. I suggest that all the hon. Members who
said they feel that their local area is not doing enough to stem the
tide, as they see it, of betting shops moving into their high streets
should speak to their local councillors and local council officers and
ask why an article 4 directive has not been issued. Many of the other
considerations relating to betting shops fall under the licensing
regime, not the planning system, which is primarily to do with the
rationing of
space.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000148" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682000148"><B><Member ContinuationText="Bill Esterson" PimsId="5716" UID="13101682001324" xid="1148" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001324">Bill

We have delayed the revaluation until 2015. Also, as was announced in
the Budget this year, we are giving every business in the country a
£2,000 national insurance credit. That will be of
huge value to many small businesses throughout the country, some of
which will no longer be paying employers national insurance at all, and
many of them will be retailers. That £2,000 may compensate
significantly for the high cost of business rates, which we certainly
acknowledge is a problem. Many small businesses say that uniform
business rate is a problem for
them.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000150" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682000150"><B><Member ContinuationText="Simon Hughes" PimsId="1067" UID="13101682001326" xid="296" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001326">Simon

the point about business rates, councils already have discretion to
give a reduction, and the Government fund that on a 50:50 basis. Many
hon. Members talked about the effect of business rates on their
communities and about the revaluation. The hon. Member for Northampton
South (Mr Binley)—I commiserate with him on today’s
result—made some points about valuation. Actually, out-of-town
businesses are valued on the same basis as town and city centre
businesses, and it is on the rental valuation. Although the valuation
is based on 2008, in 2010 this Government reduced the percentage
applied to the valuation, so the truth is that since 1990
there has been no real-terms rise in business
rates.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682000153" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682000153"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Binley" PimsId="4747" UID="13101682001328" xid="872" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001328">Mr

certainly agree with many of the good points he made. We want diversity
on the high street. None of us wants to see clone towns with chain
stores and too many charity shops, bars, estate agents and so on.
However, he rather shot himself in the foot when he said that the big
problem is the flatlining economy. We have heard a lot from Opposition
Front Benchers about the flatlining economy, but it turns out not to be
true, because there was no double-dip recession and the economy is
growing. We know that there is much more to do, but the country is
certainly on track and the economy is returning to health.</hs_Para>

Grimsey review, which was intended as an alternative to the Portas

he made many interesting points. One that particularly chimed with me
was the suggestion that the high street should do much more to make
technology available, particularly wi-fi. I am now quite militant about
asking high street businesses whether wi-fi is available. He makes a
very good point.</hs_Para>

My hon. Friend the Member for Rugby mentioned that it was also
important to have people living in town centres. During the debate it
seemed that many Members thought that people living in town and city
centres was something of a problem. As someone who not only is an MP
for a city centre, but was the councillor for Bristol city centre 20
years ago, I think that it is marvellous that more people want to live
in town and city centres. We are reversing the urban flight to the
suburbs that took place over a long period. Town and city centre
vitality depends on a cross-section of the population living in those
communities, spending money in the shops, working in the shops and
perhaps being able to walk to work. I find it quite puzzling that many
hon. Members seemed to think that it was a problem that the changes we
are making will enable more people to live in town and city
centres.</hs_Para>

David Heath</B> (Somerton and Frome) (LD):</Member> I am grateful, Mr
Deputy Speaker, for this opportunity to do something that, as a former
Minister, I have been unable to do for the past three and a half years,
which is to raise an issue in the House, on behalf of my constituents,
in an area that was not my responsibility as a Minister.</hs_Para>

considerable groundswell of opinion in my constituency about the
closure of a railway bridge in Ansford, very close to Castle Cary
railway station, closing the A371, which runs through my constituency.
The reasons for the disquiet are the length of the operation that
Network Rail is effecting, the consequences for the local economy, the
inconvenience to local people and the fact that those could have been
mitigated with a bit more care on the part of the railway company.
Having said that, I think we all understand the reasons for the bridge
closure. It is an essential maintenance requirement; it is not in
anyone’s interest that we have bridges over railways that fall
apart and cause trouble. We all realise that occasionally significant
works have to be done.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101682001217" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001217">The closure
of the A371 was originally mooted as a 24-week closure beginning in
September 2012. I intervened, mainly because I felt that the notice
given to local businesses and people was entirely inadequate, that no
consultation had taken place—to anybody’s
knowledge—and that it was simply inappropriate, in effect, to
close down the town of Castle Cary over the Christmas period, with all
the consequences that that would have had. To give credit to Network
Rail, however, after those complaints, it recognised that there was a
problem. It attended a meeting held in the area and listened to local
people’s concerns, and it went away, determined to postpone the
work and undertook to see how the works could be done in the shortest
time and with the least effect on the local area. It then came back
with a project to start in July this year, which it did, and to end, we
hope, in mid-November—a 19-week period.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101682001218" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001218">Let me be
clear, however: 19 weeks is a very long time for a major road to be
closed. It would cause enough disruption in a metropolitan area, but of
course there would be alternatives. In rural Somerset, there are no
easy alternatives, and the diversions are considerable. For light cars,
it is 17 miles; for heavy goods vehicles, it is 32 miles, which
represents a significant extra cost for companies whose main business
is either freight or the delivery of products elsewhere in the country.
South Somerset district council has estimated the consequences for the
eight largest companies in the immediate vicinity of the road closure.
Its reasonable estimate is that the additional cost for those companies
alone is in excess of £1 million and that it will cost smaller
businesses at least another £1 million. All that is without
reference to the inconvenience and disruption to individuals. It might
mean an extra 12 miles on the way to school or to work in the morning
or added inconvenience for those rushing to catch a train at Castle
Cary, one of the few viable train stations in my constituency providing
a service to London. It is now difficult to get to it from one
direction at least, which causes great difficulty.</hs_Para>

talking about a council—or, I would like to think, a
Department—every effort would be made, as far as possible, to
fit things in with local needs. Public accountability suggests that the
organisation involved would be desperately trying to reduce the
economic and social effects to a minimum, but Network Rail is of course
not publicly accountable in that way, other than through the Department
for Transport. Indeed, I am afraid to say that there appears to be no
evidence that it believes it has any wider responsibility, other than
to minimise its costs and do whatever is most convenient to itself.
That is why local people are so upset.</hs_Para>

see the Minister here this evening, but I know that he cannot provide
me with an enormous amount of comfort, nor do I expect him to—I
know that because at the start of this work I was in correspondence
with the then rail Minister. I know, too, that the Secretary of State
for Transport has had discussions on this very subject with Mr Richard
Fry of Frampton’s—a constituent of my hon. Friend the
Member for Wells (Tessa Munt) and a representative of a freight company
that is one of those most affected—yet all to no avail. In fact,
if the Minister has been given the same brief as his
predecessors—who is to know whether his civil servants have
rewritten it?—he might employ the following sentences:
“Network Rail is a private sector company limited by guarantee.
The scope and duration of its engineering works are operational matters
for the company in which Ministers have no powers to intervene.”
If he finds that in his notes, I hope he will omit it and take it as
read, because I know that that is the case. However, it in no way
alters my contention that proper pressure should be applied on public
bodies such as Network Rail.</hs_Para>

securing this debate is to say that that answer and its consequences
are simply not good enough, and things could be arranged better. Let me
cover some of the things that might have been considered. One of the
clear views expressed by my constituents is that, given such an
enormously disruptive road closure, then ’twere best it were
done as quickly as possible—that the minimum amount of time
should be taken. That would involve working rather more than the
minimum periods available, in order to get the job done. We discussed
with Network Rail the possibility of night working—indeed,
conditions could not have been better for evening or night work over
the last few months—but that has not been forthcoming. We could
have had weekend working, but no work has been done at weekends. We
could also have had arrangements to provide for temporary daytime
access or, if that were not possible, night-time access when no work
was being done, but that was inconvenient and was not done
either.</hs_Para>

with every major civil construction project people will say,
“Nobody ever seems to be working on it.” Sometimes work
is done that people are not aware of and sometimes a refractory period
is necessary while concrete sets, for example. I understand that, but I
assure the Minister that no one in the local area discerns any sense of
urgency with this work. There is no sense that people are trying to get
it done in the minimum amount of time. Indeed, they are simply dawdling
their way through the project, with all the effects that
that has.</hs_Para>

Munt</B> (Wells) (LD):</Member> I agree with my hon. Friend
wholeheartedly. I have written to the Minister about this matter,
because a huge number of my constituents 
<?notus-xml column=859?>have been inconvenienced. I have also written to the company concerned,
but at no point has it agreed to do anything like consider double
working, triple-shift working or anything else that might avail the
local community or Frampton’s, which my hon. Friend has already
mentioned, and the other transport companies. Does he agree that that
is the least that the company could have
considered?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682001224" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001224"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Heath" PimsId="911" UID="13101682002364" xid="265" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682002364">Mr
Heath:</Member></B> I absolutely agree with my hon. Friend. I know that
her constituents are feeling exactly the same pressures as mine are.
This is not just a problem of unwillingness to think about the
situation. It seems impossible for anyone—the Minister or anyone
else—to apply pressure on Network Rail to make it acknowledge
its responsibility to the local community. Closing a road has
consequences, and it must be done for the minimum amount of
time.</hs_Para>

could also have looked at alternative ways of undertaking the project.
Such alternatives were offered, but they were rejected. It was
suggested, for example, that temporary alternative bridge work might be
put in place, but Network Rail was not prepared to consider that on the
ground of cost. Instead of repairing the bridge, it might have
considered replacing it with a prefabricated alternative, which would
have avoided the long delays altogether. Again, that was not
considered. I understand that the Army offered to build a Bailey bridge
as a temporary replacement. It offered to do it for free, as it would
have found it a useful exercise; Network Rail would not have had to pay
for anything except the pier supports. Again, the offer was
rejected.</hs_Para>

other things that Network Rail could have done to make life easier for
local people. I mentioned that people are having difficulty getting to
the railway station from Castle Cary, two miles away, simply
because the link between the two is closed. However, they
could have reached it if car parking had been provided on the right
side of the closure, because people could have decamped by footpath
from there to the station. That car parking was offered. Indeed, I
understand that Michael Eavis, who runs the Glastonbury festival,
offered to provide free use of the metal surfacing that he uses in his
festival car park, to create hard standing in a field on the right side
of the road closure, which would have helped local people. Again, that
offer was not entertained by Network Rail. Apparently it is not even
interested in getting people to use the railway if it is going to cost
money.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101682001227" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001227">Even
the things that Network Rail did undertake to do have not been done
satisfactorily. It said that it would provide full signage to show that
the affected businesses were open, but the signage was still not in
place long after the closure had been effected, and the businesses lost
money. The signage that was eventually put up misled people. The
situation on the ground is quite complicated, and I do not expect the
Minister to understand it, as he is not a Somerset man. However, there
is a road called the B3153, which goes from Castle Cary across a
railway bridge that everyone assumes is closed, even though it is not,
to places in the constituency of my hon. Friend the Member for Wells.
The signs simply say that the railway bridge is closed, and everyone
assumes that they refer to that railway bridge. Businesses have lost
revenue as a result. The advertisements that were supposed to be in all
the local newspapers and on 
<?notus-xml column=860?>local radio never quite transpired in the way that was suggested.
Whenever anyone mentions compensation, people get very tight-lipped
indeed. There is no suggestion that anyone will be compensated for
these problems.</hs_Para>

said, the consequence of all this is that the estimated cost to the
major employers in the area is about £1 million. In our terms,
these are big local employers. They supply dairy products, veterinary
supplies and pet foods. The cost to the largest one alone will be
£350,000, because of extra fuel burn, the need for dual-crewing
in order to meet the working time directive, and extra wages costs.
These costs all add up. There will also be extra costs for the council
as a result of damage to the highway network because, sadly, heavy
goods vehicles are using inappropriate roads.</hs_Para>

believe that any of this was necessary. Network Rail could have done a
better job for local people. I say that because an example from
elsewhere has been brought to my attention. Work was recently done by
Network Rail in Lewisham. I have no doubt that it involved important
track work, and it cost £9.5 million. That includes
£2.5 million to ensure the safety and protection of a wildlife
area. I think it is good—no one should get me wrong on
this—that money is being spent to protect such an area, but I
would have liked that money to be invested not just because of the
Network Rail’s fear that wildlife protection groups would be on
its back; I would have liked it to consider Somerset people as
well—people who are losing their jobs and their livelihoods in
local businesses as a result of what Network Rail proposed. I think
£2.5 million would have paid for all that shopping list of
mitigating factors.</hs_Para>

an object lesson in how not to take into account the needs of the local
economy and the interests of local residents. I ask the Minister to
consider this issue. If it were not a road that was closed, but a
railway line, do we honestly believe that Network Rail would not have
worked absolutely round the clock to get the line opened
again—because its revenue would be affected? Do we not believe
that Network Rail would have used every possible measure to maintain
some traffic along the line, whether it be in one direction or the
other, in a way that has not happened in the case of this road? In
those circumstances, it would not have been 19 weeks; it would
certainly not have been a five-day-a-week, 9-to-5
job.</hs_Para>

has done itself no favours whatever in community relations. I have to
say that this is not the fault of the local community relations
managers, who have been doing their level best to be as helpful as they
can be within the constraints set by head office. The overall policy of
Network Rail here, however, shows absolutely no regard for local
interests. That is what concerns me—the attitude displayed by
Network Rail. If anyone wants an indication of that, let me say that I
wrote to the chief executive on 5 September, asking about the progress
made on the scheme, asking when it could be expected to finish and
asking when we could expect to see some of the accelerated work that
had been promised. I received an acknowledgement on 11
September; I am still waiting for a substantive reply. I think that
tells us everything you need to know, Mr Deputy Speaker. I
hope that the Minister will be able to tell me that Network Rail is not
completely oblivious—or will be made not to be completely
oblivious—of the interests of the local communities that, as a
public company, it is supposed to
serve.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/B1AEE825BECADA05FA197F6571C79C6C0B9B20AE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport (Stephen
Hammond):</Member></B> I congratulate my hon. Friend the Member for
Somerton and Frome (Mr Heath)on securing tonight’s Adjournment
debate. The closure of the A371 is clearly a subject of great
importance to him—and to his hon. Friend the Member for Wells
(Tessa Munt)—and he spoke eloquently about it. I noted in his
opening remarks that he thought Network Rail had been rather slow in
its response, so I hope to be a bit faster this evening. I noted, too,
that he was not sure whether I could say much from the Dispatch Box
tonight to indicate that actions were on the way. I have, however,
picked up some things from his speech on which I hope to able to give
him some reassurance.</hs_Para>

Friend referred to his main concerns on behalf of his constituents and
to those of the leader of South Somerset district council seen in an
exchange of correspondence earlier this year with the then rail
Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Lewes (Norman Baker). As I
think my hon. Friend the Member for Somerton and Frome knows, that
Minister and my officials have already raised concerns with Network
Rail, particularly about the possibilities of single-lane operation or
putting a temporary bridge in place. I hope to address a couple of
those points tonight, and I shall certainly take note of my hon.
Friend’s last remark—that he has failed to receive a
reply from the chief executive of Network Rail since 5 September. By
any standard, that is not acceptable behaviour, and I shall certainly
ensure that my officials speak to Network Rail tomorrow morning to get
that response for him.</hs_Para>

my hon. Friend set out the issues. As he rightly says, I am not a
Somerset man, so my understanding of them is clearly not as great as
his. None the less, we all accept that the road is an important one for
the local community. The location between Castle Cary station and the
B3153 has an impact, as it falls under the responsibility of Somerset
county council as the highways authority. Following routine inspections
by Network Rail, there was widespread agreement that major repair and
strengthening to the bridge was necessary; otherwise, the modern
traffic loads that use the route would be unable to do so, and there
would be no certainty of the continuing safety on the
railway.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101682001235" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/debtext/131016-0004.htm#13101682001235">It is
disappointing, however, that the repair and strengthening work for the
overbridge, as my hon. Friend said, started on 8 July and is expected
to run until the end of November. That is partly to do with the extra
works that Network Rail is putting in place. I am not sure that the
full benefit of those extra works has necessarily been explained,
perhaps because they will benefit the company in the constituency of my
hon. Friend the Member for Wells. It is normal practice for Network
Rail to prepare bridges of local authority roads to the statutory
requirement to be able to carry 24 tonnes. That is covered
by a national programme of assessment known as Bridgeguard 3. To
implement that, there is a national cost sharing agreement with local
authorities. There is no obligation on Network Rail to bring the
strength of its bridges carrying roads up to the standard to carry
modern freight. It is generally accepted that the load-bearing capacity
to accommodate modern highway standards is 40 tonnes. Certainly, one
reason for the delay and elongated works, which I accept has caused the
suffering experienced by my hon. 
<?notus-xml column=862?>Friend’s constituents, is the increase in the strength of the
bridge to 40 tonnes, which will allow greater facilitation of the local
economy. That is taking longer than
expected.</hs_Para>

Friend also asked why it was not possible to consider doing the
construction work in two halves. Had that been possible, it would have
been done, but had that happened, the scaffolding required to access
the outside of the bridge girders would have had to be mounted on the
bridge deck, which would have made it impossible for the railway
service underneath to continue. That is why the work could not be
undertaken in two halves.</hs_Para>

Hammond:</Member></B> I am coming to the construction of a temporary
bailey bridge. I know my hon. Friend listened carefully to my remarks
about strengthening the bridge to the level of 40 tonnes, and that is
one reason for the delay. None the less, I am not trying to excuse the
fact that the work will take 19 weeks. I understand the impact on local
constituents, and my hon. Friends can be assured that this will be one
of the issues that I will raise when I next meet Network Rail in my new

Consideration was given to whether a temporary bailey bridge could be

Morris</B> (Halesowen and Rowley Regis) (Con):</Member> It is a
pleasure to open this very important debate under your chairmanship,
Sir Edward. First of all, I want to talk about why this debate is
important. Mental illness is one of the biggest health challenges that
we face over the next 20 or 30 years. The NHS spends approximately
£14 billion on support for people with mental health conditions,
which amounts to about 13% of total health spending. However, mental
ill health accounts for about 28% of morbidity and 23% of all GP
appointments, and recent estimates show that the overall economic cost
of mental illness in Britain is about £105 billion a
year.</hs_Para>

are the raw statistics, but behind them is a story of broken lives,
isolation and mental suffering. Every week in my constituency, I see
people suffering from a range of difficult mental health conditions as
a result of personal circumstances, family breakdown and all kinds of
different issues. I am sure that other hon. Members here today have had
similar experiences in their constituencies. As a compassionate
society, we have a duty to address the growing crisis of mental health
in Britain, not only by seeking to control its symptoms, but by
tackling its underlying causes.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000009" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000009">Our<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>
approach to mental health has been dominated for too long by what I
characterise as a medicalised model. A psychiatric approach has been
dominant. I am not arguing that psychiatry does not have a role to play
in mental health, but it has been a dominant model for the way in which
we approach mental health care in Britain, and the national health
service is very focused on drug-based solutions to mental health
problems. The number of prescriptions for drugs to try to solve mental
health problems has gone up exponentially over the past decade, and as
a result, I believe that our approach to mental health in the national
health service is very much focused on control, rather than on tackling
the profound underlying causes of the growth of mental health problems
in Britain.</hs_Para>

is why I want to discuss talking therapies today. It seems to me that
talking therapies are a human and compassionate response to mental
suffering, as our constituents, our fellow citizens, and we all come to
terms with the pressures of modern life, the increase  in
family breakdown, and the sheer stresses of dealing with information
overload and the complexity of living in the modern world. This issue
is not confined to any one part of the population; it crosses the whole
age range, from children and young people through to  older
people.</hs_Para>

want to talk today about improving access to psychological therapies.
That is a big area on which I have been focused on in my role as
chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on mental health. The
improving access to psychological therapies programme was established
under the previous Government in 2006, following work by Lord Layard,
who looked at the economic benefits of a widespread programme of access
to psychological therapies across the country. IAPT was initially
launched with small pilot areas and then was formally launched in 2008.
I do not think anyone here would deny that the IAPT service has made
progress. We have seen 1 million people entering treatment and 680,000
people completing treatment, and we have seen recovery rates of about
45%, with 65% significantly improved. The IAPT programme has led to
45,000 coming off sick pay and benefits, and we have seen
4,000 new practitioners trained in the national health
service<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:39:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000014" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000014"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>The
programme was started by the previous Government, and in February 2011,
the current Government published their “No health without mental
health” strategy, which committed them to investing more than
£400 million over four years into the IAPT programme. At the
same time as the publication of that strategy, the Department of Health
also published its “Talking therapies: A four-year plan of
action”, which had the objective that by March 2015, 15% of the
adult population would have access to evidence-based psychological
therapies that are capable of delivering rates of recovery of 50% or
more. Therefore,
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>some progress
has been made, but I want to raise serious questions today about how we
should take the IAPT programme forward, about the scale of our
ambition, and about the extent to which real choice is embedded in the
system. I believe that those questions need to be addressed
urgently.</hs_Para>

Department of Health is clear, therefore, about the challenges faced by
the further roll-out of the IAPT programme. In order to meet the
challenges that come out of the Department’s assessment, we need
radical thinking. We need to build on the strength of the existing IAPT
programme, but we also need to address some of its fundamental
weaknesses, which I believe are holding the programme back.</hs_Para>

central issue that we need to have an honest debate about is the fact
that the IAPT programme is still dominated by the use of one
therapy—cognitive behavioural therapy, or CBT. The National
Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines that were drawn up
in 2005 made the recommendation that CBT should be the default
treatment option for the NHS, because it had the most
random-controlled-trial supporting evidence for its effectiveness. In
2010, the guidelines were modified slightly to allow five other
therapies into the NICE recommended mix. The reality, however, is that
IAPT is still dominated by CBT. Again, I am not arguing that, in many
circumstances, for patients with particular forms of anxiety and
depression, CBT is not an appropriate form of treatment. However, it is
a short-term, highly manualised approach to mental health
treatment.</hs_ParaIndent>

consequences of our approach to research into the efficacy of
particular forms of mental health treatment, and of NICE’s
approach to the formulation of its guidelines, is that long-term
therapies such as psychotherapy and psychoanalysis, to name just two,
which require long-term commitment from the patient and from the
analyst, have effectively been locked out of IAPT. In Britain,
we have a mature and highly professionalised cohort of therapists in
psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. They have, over the past five years,
found themselves unable to provide the sort of capacity that we need in
IAPT. One of the consequences of that, and of the dominance of CBT,
with a focus on training up therapists to concentrate on CBT, is that
we have a monolithic
model.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000023" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000023">Within
IAPT, we have access, but no effective choice for the
patient—choice that is focused on the individual needs of the
patients and on an assessment of the patient’s particular
requirements. We have a professional cohort of highly trained
therapists in long-term therapies who are unable to assist the NHS in
extending capacity for the provision of psychological therapies and who
are unable to become part of the conversation to address the programme
challenges identified by the Department of Health’s assessment
of the three-year IAPT programme in 2012.</hs_Para>

recognise those weaknesses in the existing IAPT programme, because
there are still 50% of people who have been through the programme who
have not responded well to CBT. Some 85% of people who are currently
suffering from severe mental anguish cannot gain access to any
appropriate psychological therapy on the NHS. We urgently need a review
of the existing NICE guidelines, and I know that Professor David
Haslam, the chair of NICE, has recognised the issue and has agreed to
initiate a
review.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000025">We
also need to look again at how we formulate evidence on the efficacy of
mental health treatment. For certain long-term therapies, it might not
be appropriate for research to be totally focused on randomised control
trials, which are also costly to undertake. We therefore need to look
at new types of evidence base. We also need to think about developing a
new commissioning model for psychological services to create real
choice. I will come on to talk about how that might work.</hs_Para>

<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:44:28"></hs_TimeCode>The hon. Member
for Upper Bann (David Simpson) talked about children and young people.
He is right to be concerned about them; it is a major issue that we
face in Britain today. Some 850,000 children between the ages of five
and 16 are known to have mental health problems. There is a
children and young people’s IAPT, which provides a broad range
of interventions —parenting therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy
and family
therapy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000027">I
think we all know and agree that early intervention for children and
young people is crucial to prevent problems from becoming more serious.
Lots of evidence shows that early intervention at the onset of
psychosis in children and young people and suitable psychological
therapy treatment can prevent that from blowing up into something much
more serious later on. Perhaps we can learn some lessons from the
children and young people’s IAPT for adult services, while
recognising that the children and young people’s IAPT needs to
be developed further.</hs_Para>

not exclude or not think about the needs of people aged over 65. As we
all know, we have an ageing population, meaning that mental health in
older people is an increasing problem. The Department’s
“Talking Therapies” action plan committed the Department
to address the underrepresentation of older people using IAPT. A
quarter of people over the age of 65 have symptoms of depression that
require intervention, but only one in six will consult their general
practitioner. Therefore, IAPT needs to be tailored to meet the needs of
older people. Those needs are not just one, single need; the needs of a

technologies, computerised CBT for depression and anxiety is the only
NICE-approved psychological therapy, which, on the basis of the

Shannon:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for raising that matter.
That is exactly the problem; if I wanted to sum it up in one phrase,
that is the phrase I would use. There was a taboo around mental ill
health in the past, but hopefully we can discuss it now. I hate the
word “mental”, because it almost puts the thought in
one’s mind of someone to be kept at bay. We must be able to find
another word in the English language that is more sympathetic. I am not
sure what it would be, but we should give the matter
consideration.</hs_Para>

psychological therapies in the NHS 2013 event marked the halfway point
of the coalition Government’s mental health strategy.
Psychological therapies generally fall into three categories:
behavioural therapies, which focus on cognitions and behaviours;
psychoanalytical and psychodynamic therapies, which focus on the
unconscious relationship patterns that evolved from childhood, which
are important; and humanistic therapies, which focus on
self-development in the here and now. We need to focus on those three
categories.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000048" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000048">I<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:57:14"></hs_TimeCode>
presume that most Members catch up on the news on BBC or Sky before
they come here. A story today covered the role of carers and what they
do for elderly people, but it also mentioned their role for those with
mental health issues and focused in particular on the time that carers
have to deliver care to people in those two categories. It underlined
where we are in the debate about those who suffer from psychological
imbalance and emotional issues.</hs_Para>

Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme was built on
evidence, produced in 2004 by the then National Institute for Health
and Clinical Excellence, on treating people with depression and anxiety
disorders. It was created to offer patients a realistic and routine
first-line treatment, combined, where appropriate, with medication,
which traditionally had been the only treatment available.</hs_Para>

changed. The Minister, whom I respect greatly, will outline the issues
when he responds. The IAPT programme was dedicated to spending more
than £700 million on psychological therapies between 2008 and
2014. It was first targeted at people of working age, 
<?notus-xml column=248?>but in 2010 was opened to adults of all ages. There has been
success—it would be wrong to say that there  has
not.</hs_Para>

three years, 900,000 people were treated for depression and anxiety;
450,000 patients are in recovery, with another 200,000 moving towards
recovery; 25,000 fewer people with mental health problems are on
benefits; and the average waiting time has reduced from 18 months to a
few weeks. In terms of what has been done so far, that is good news,
but it is fair to say that there is a lot more to do. There has been a
significant increase in the number of people with such issues, and all
statistics indicate that that number will continue to grow.</hs_Para>

have spoken about the things that lead to the position we are in today
and why society and Government must respond. Reasons for therapy can be
to do with home life and bereavement. On many occasions in my
constituency office, we deal with bereavement and how it affects not
only the partner, but the young people in the house.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T09:59:46"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member

regularly see it in my office—the frailty of life, the
suddenness of death and how that affects people.</hs_Para>

when young people who cannot get the jobs they need or the discipline
that a job brings, and trouble in the workplace are other reasons for
therapy. Another reason is childhood trauma, as we can see from the
sexual abuse cases of the past few years. Many people were not aware of
such trauma, but it existed. Social deprivation is another one, and all
those issues contribute to where we

hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris) mentioned

education is one of the areas in which Government can play a role, as

many other factors, one comes to mind, to do with young carers who look
after their mum, dad, brothers or sisters. In my constituency, there
are about 230 young carers, which is a massive number. They are making
a contribution to society, but they are also the main carers for their
adults or siblings. Again, that is a real
issue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:02:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000057" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000057">In
Northern Ireland, unemployment, too, causes problems because, among the
regions of the United Kingdom, it has the highest percentage of
working-age population not in paid employment—the figure is 30%
higher than the UK average, which is 19% of individuals receiving a
form of out-of-work benefit. The highest rates are recorded in
Londonderry with 29%, Strabane with 29% and Belfast with 26%. Some 9%
of the working-age population receive disability living allowance,
including  
<?notus-xml column=249?>the 3% who receive DLA for mental health
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:02:41"></hs_TimeCode>. That
proportion has risen by 25% since 1998, and is more than the UK
average, while 70% of those registered with a disability are not in

am I the only elected representative to have had an increase in
referrals for those who have served in the forces suffering from
post-traumatic stress disorder? I know the answer: no, I am not. In all
my years as an elected representative, I cannot recall having so many
referrals of soldiers, male and female, for emotional, mental-health
trauma suffered as a result of their

Prince’s Trust, which many of us have knowledge of and great
faith in, has found that one in four young people at work are down or
depressed “always” or “often”—for
people of that age to be downhearted or depressed is incredible.
Unfortunately, that leads to an increase in the suicide rate among
young people. In parts of our Province, suicide is at frightening
levels. A few years ago in my constituency, there was a spate of
suicides by young people, which was saddening for the people of our
area, because we knew most of them—young people who did not feel
that there was much for them in the future. We must address that
issue.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000060" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000060">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:04:11"></hs_TimeCode>
figure for young people who are down or depressed always or often, but
are unemployed, is 50%. That is a massive figure. Clearly, a large
section of people are at risk and, in my opinion, early intervention
can and will make a difference. However, to establish it, there must be
funding. My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:04:30"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Friend the Member for Upper Bann (David Simpson) referred to those in
education diagnosing cases early, and that is one thing we can do. Our
own Health Minister in the Northern Ireland Assembly, Edwin Poots, has
taken steps to address the issue, but a UK-wide strategy would be
useful and must be considered. I am keen to hear what the Minister will
say.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000061" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000061">Improving
access to psychological therapies in all areas such as health and
employment for individuals, families and carers in Northern Ireland
could relieve anxiety, depression and distress. The long-term benefits
would be more than worth any initial cost. The funding has to be in

done.</hs_Para>

improving mental and social well-being can help prevent antisocial
behaviour and family breakdown for children and young

me tell the story of Polly and Mark—to protect their anonymity,
those are not their real names—who experienced considerable
challenges in having two children, with several miscarriages and a
stillbirth. Polly became very low and left her successful career.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:17:01"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Feltham and Heston (Seema Malhotra) has already pointed out the
cost to the economy when people have mental health issues.
Polly’s husband, Mark, had a very difficult childhood, and he
was badly affected by his parents’ violent and stormy
relationship.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000085" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000085">When<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:18:10"></hs_TimeCode>
Polly and Mark’s youngest child was two, Polly confessed that
she had had an affair seven years earlier, which left her feeling guilt
and shame long after it ended. On learning that, Mark was utterly
devastated by the revelation and fell into a deep depression, with
unmanageable rages during which he threatened to kill the other man.
Polly developed severe headaches, so she went to her GP and was sent
for tests. On finding nothing wrong, the GP recommended that Polly have
individual counselling focusing on the stillbirth four years
previously. After being unable to work and having three weeks of
sleepless nights, Mark also visited his GP. Mark was referred to a
psychiatrist, who diagnosed him as suffering from acute depression and
prescribed him
antidepressants.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000086" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000086">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:18:10"></hs_TimeCode>
couple were acutely conscious that their relationship was about to
break down. Not having been offered any form of couple therapy by IAPT,
they approached a voluntary sector service, and for six months, they
went to weekly couple therapy. At the same time, they were offered
cognitive behavioural therapy through IAPT. They believed that the
problem was their relationship, but health professionals clearly
thought that the depression needed treatment. In couple therapy, Polly
was able to share her anxieties about her parents’ divorce and
about how she did not want her children to suffer as she had. 
<?notus-xml column=253?>As the couple therapy progressed, Mark and Polly became more open with
each other and began to understand how their relationship problems were
a product of both recent and past
difficulties<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:19:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000087" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000087">An
important point is that that couple therapy—it was not provided
through IAPT; Mark and Polly had to go to the voluntary sector for it,
because IAPT had offered them CBT that they did not need—was
voluntary help that lasted for six months. My concern is that IAPT
provision, whether of CBT or other measures, is often given for only a
short period, which is not always appropriate or likely to be
successful in such cases.</hs_Para>

studies show why what I have said is important and matters. Evidence

health of the unemployed person and is especially associated with more
frequent development of psychosomatic symptoms, stress and

consider such issues further? She is absolutely right that these issues
are intergenerational. If she was following the example of Mark and
Polly, she would have learned that it was their own parents’
stormy relationships that had affected them. Of course their children
were suffering deeply from the problems that they were having in their
own relationship or marriage. Such issues are deeply related, and she
is completely right to say that the children suffer hugely when there
are relationship problems between the parents. It is vital that we get
this matter right for the children, and I would welcome her support on
a cross-party basis on these important issues; they are just too

visiting his elderly parents in Manchester. He said that between them
as a couple they could function. Between the two of them, they had one
pair of eyes, ears and legs that worked. They were both sick in
different ways. They could cope and look after each other, but what
would have happened if they had split in younger years? They might have
been like Polly and Mark and had difficulties and not been able to
receive the type of help that I have outlined. Let us say that they did
sadly split up, like so many couples do today. They would be in two
different flats in different parts of Manchester needing far more help
from their GP and far more adult care, and that would fall on the
clinicians for whom the Minister is responsible and on adult social
services. Yes, it would have an impact on their families, and we would
all be paying more through our taxes and there would greater burdens on
business as well from having to look after that couple in two different
settings. The importance of strong couple relationships in older age,

<hs_Para UID="13101663000100" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000100"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:29:19"></hs_TimeCode>This
has been a thoughtful and important debate on a subject that is not
talked about nearly enough. Every day in Britain, people of all ages
and backgrounds, and from all communities, have their lives blighted by
the spectre of mental illness. Theirs are some of the great untold
stories of our society. As many hon. Members have already said, the
issue of mental health has been swept under the carpet for too long.
One in six people are afflicted by mental illness, but all too often
they are scared into silence. That is why this discussion is so
important.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000101" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000101"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:30:02"></hs_TimeCode>I
also congratulate
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:29:58"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Halesowen and Rowley Regis (James Morris) on securing this debate
and on the campaigning that he has done on this issue. In addition, I
thank him for giving me the opportunity to talk about mental health in
my first debate as Labour’s newly appointed shadow
Minister<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:30:13"></hs_TimeCode> with
responsibility for public health.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000102" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000102"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:30:22"></hs_TimeCode>This
debate is even more timely because of the news that we have heard on
the BBC this morning, to which a number of hon. Members have already
referred. Dr Baggaley, the director of medicine at South London and
Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, has said that our mental health services
are in “crisis”, following the news—after the BBC
made freedom of information requests—that in a little more than
two years we have seen the loss of 1,700 mental health beds. I note
that the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:30:52"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister of State, Department of Health, who is the Minister with
responsibility for care, said this morning that the situation is
“unacceptable” and that the provision must improve. I
hope that the Minister who is here in Westminster Hall today will refer
to that when he responds to the debate.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000103" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000103"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>We
have heard a number of valuable contributions this morning. In
responding to the excellent points that have been made, I will cover
three broad themes: first, I will reiterate the importance of early
intervention; secondly, I will talk about the improving access to
psychological therapies programme, including some specific issues about
how IAPT needs to work better; and thirdly, I will talk about what we
need to do beyond
IAPT<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:31:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000104">Let
me begin with early intervention. As hon. Members have already said,
the long-term consequences are clear if we do not tackle mental illness
early; indeed, we can already see those consequences right across our
society 
<?notus-xml column=256?>today. We can see them in the workplace, where mental illness is the
largest single cause of long-term sick leave; we can see them in our
criminal justice system, where 70% of those in our prisons have a
mental illness; and we can see them in our economy, where mental ill
health costs Britain’s businesses £26 billion every year,
or  £71 million every
day<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:32:01"></hs_TimeCode>. Also, in
our health service, according to the London School of Economics the
physical health care necessitated by mental illness costs the NHS an
extra £10 billion each year. All of those points show why the
case for action could not be any clearer.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000105" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000105"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:32:25"></hs_TimeCode>I
am sure that, like myself, many hon. Members will have had experience
of constituents coming to them for assistance; indeed, several hon.
Members have referred to those experiences in their contributions to
the debate. Constituents come to us in deep distress and dire
circumstances. However, many of those situations could have been
avoided if those people had received specialist treatment for mental
illnesses at a much earlier
stage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:32:49"></hs_TimeCode>. I echo
the hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis, who said that it is
absolutely crucial that we look at this issue of early
intervention.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000106" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000106">That was why
in 2007 the last Labour Government launched the IAPT programme, which
helped to make respected and evidence-based therapies available to more
people than ever before. As we heard in the hon. Gentleman’s
opening speech, thousands of people have been helped on that programme
so far. Since then, the current Government have continued the programme
and extended it to cover more people, which is a welcome
step<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:33:25"></hs_TimeCode>. However,
as this debate has made clear, IAPT is still a developing scheme, with
areas that are in need of much improvement. So, my second theme is to
focus on those areas that require attention, and I would be grateful if
the Minister could address them in his closing remarks.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000107" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000107">There<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:33:37"></hs_TimeCode>
are three areas in particular that require attention. The first is
funding. Spending on IAPT has increased from zero in 2008-09, when the
programme was first launched, to £214 million in 2011-12. The
Department of Health has also allocated £54 million to improve
access to therapies for children and young people, which is a good
step. However, it must be noted that Ministers always pledged that IAPT
funding would be additional funding and would not replace existing
psychotherapy services. Despite those assurances, non-IAPT therapy
services have been cut by more than 5%. Funding has fallen from
£185 million in 2009-09 to £172 million in 2011-12. What
makes that even more worrying is that overall mental health spending
has been cut in real terms for the second year in a row.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000108" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000108">That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:34:42"></hs_TimeCode>
real-terms cut has particular resonance when it comes to the second
area that requires attention, which is waiting times; again, waiting
times have already been mentioned by hon. Members during this debate.
NICE’s aim is that patients receive access to evidence-based
therapies within 28 days of referral. It is regrettable that this
debate falls the day before the latest programme statistics are
published. According to the latest figures, however, which are for
2012-13, more people are having to wait longer to start receiving
treatment for anxiety or depression.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000109" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000109"><B><Member ContinuationText="Seema Malhotra" PimsId="5992" UID="13101663000232" xid="1237" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000232">Seema
Malhotra:</Member></B> My hon. Friend makes very important points about
waiting times and how they have continued, and also about the cuts to
services. Given that the 
<?notus-xml column=257?>number of university students seeking counselling has risen by a third
in the last four years, does she agree that it is important to
recognise the impact that the drop in funding could be having on
vulnerable students, sometimes forcing them to leave university, which
can affect the rest of their life? With the number of students in that
situation increasing and without data for average waiting times, we
must recognise the importance of early intervention and very fast
response.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000110" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000110"><B><Member ContinuationText="Luciana Berger" PimsId="5574" UID="13101663000233" xid="1124" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000233">Luciana
Berger:</Member></B> I thank my hon. Friend for that intervention, and
she raises an important issue. There are lots of different groups of
people who do not have access to these sorts of services or who have to
wait a disproportionate amount of time to access them. We have already
heard hon. Members talking about older people who might not be able to
access the IAPT programme, and my hon. Friend refers to university
students, who do not necessarily fall into the category of children and
young people, but who, as young adults, are struggling with leaving
home and with financial pressures.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000111" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000111"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:36:36"></hs_TimeCode>I
have not seen any direct research about what effect the current cost of
living crisis is having on our population—I hope that there will
be some research into that issue—but my experience from my case
load as a constituency MP indicates that we have a problem in our
society regarding the pressures of life. More people are having to
access these services and therefore the services should be available,
which makes the issues of waiting times even more relevant.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000112" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000112"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:36:53"></hs_TimeCode>More
than 115,000 people had to wait more than 28 days from referral
until their first treatment or therapy session, which was a 19%
increase from the previous year.
The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:37:08"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous) made the point that this
issue is not only about the statistics but the people behind the
statistics, who have to go through the trauma of waiting for treatment
and suffering the uncertainty of not knowing when it will
come<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:37:23"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:37:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000113" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000113">On
Monday, someone contacted me to say that they had been waiting for a
year and a half for cognitive behavioural therapy in the Wirral, on
Merseyside, and just this morning on BBC Breakfast there was a woman
who was interviewed who had had to wait 17 months for talking therapies
treatment. Eventually, she had to be sectioned as her condition
deteriorated while she waited for treatment. These cases are not
unusual— there are too many cases like them—and it pains
me to learn of
them<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:37:43"></hs_TimeCode>. According
to a report produced by the We Need to Talk coalition of mental health
charities and royal colleges, one in five people have been waiting for
more than a year to receive treatment. However, the same report found
that people who receive treatment within three months are almost five
times more likely to be helped back into work by therapy than others
who have to wait for one or two
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:38:20"></hs_TimeCode>. As
another person wrote to me this week, even a six-week wait can seem a
whole lot longer if someone is clinically
depressed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>. Just
as we focus on waiting times for cancer treatment and other examples of
physical care, we must do the same for mental health
therapies.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000114"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:38:36"></hs_TimeCode>I
will repeat the commitment, which my right hon. Friend the Leader of
the Opposition made a year ago, that the next Labour Government will
rewrite the NHS constitution; that we will strengthen the rights that
it 
<?notus-xml column=258?>grants to patients; that we will create a genuine parity between mental
and physical health care; and that we will set down a new right of
access to the therapies that we have been talking about
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:39:02"></hs_TimeCode>this
morning<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:39:03"></hs_TimeCode>. That
will mean that mental health patients will be entitled not only to
drugs and other medical treatments but to psychological therapies, and
they will have the same guarantees on waiting times, professional
advice and patient experience.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13101663000115" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000115"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:39:14"></hs_TimeCode>However,
in addition to how long it takes to receive treatment, we need to
examine the range of therapies that are available in the first place,
which brings me to my third broad theme; again, it is a theme that has
been already been referred to by other hon. Members, but it is
important to reinforce it and to ask the Minister to respond to it.
Different people are affected by different mental health conditions for
all sorts of different reasons. That is why we need diverse mental
health provision, with a range of therapies, to cater for people with
different needs, preferences and
personalities<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:39:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
As the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:39:42"></hs_TimeCode> hon.
Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis said, only five types of therapy
are currently available via IAPT. Moreover, 90% of IAPT funding has
gone towards cognitive behaviour therapies, with limited support for
other modes of
therapy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>. The
United Kingdom Council for Psychotherapy has described this
as<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:40:01"></hs_TimeCode>

need to look at going beyond basic therapies that help people go about
their day-to-day lives more
adequately<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:40:18"></hs_TimeCode>.
There needs to be appropriate room for more intense and longer term
psychological treatments, so that the underlying causes do not go
unaddressed.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000117" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000117">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:40:29"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for South West Bedfordshire mentioned the need for couples
therapies. The hon. Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis also talked
about older peoples’ problems with accessing
treatment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:40:50"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000118" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000118">There
is a patient choice issue, too. According to a survey of 500 service
users by Mind, only 8% of people had a full choice about which therapy
they received and just 13% had a choice about where they received
therapy. The 8% who had full choice of therapies—a very small
number—were, on average, three times happier with their
treatment and five times more likely to say that therapy had helped
them back into
work<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:41:23"></hs_TimeCode>. As the
programme develops, we need to do all we can to ensure that it caters
to people’s individual
needs.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000119" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000119">What
needs to be done beyond IAPT? As welcome as IAPT is, we have to
remember that the programme currently only aspires to be available to
15% of the population. The programme’s three-year report,
published last November, shows that it is currently delivering 45%
recovery rates and aims to reach 50% by March 2015. The big question
this raises is, what about the other 50% to 55%—the 50% who
continue to suffer from conditions, having gone through the IAPT
process, but are not eligible for more intensive psychotherapy services
under the stepped care model?
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:42:09"></hs_TimeCode> question,
and this debate, requires an answer that goes far beyond the IAPT
programme. It requires ending the artificial dividing lines in our NHS
and pursuing a whole person, fully integrated approach to mental,
physical, social and care issues, as Labour has indicated, and it
demands a complete revaluation of how we, as a country, think about and
approach mental health. That is what Labour’s 
<?notus-xml column=259?>mental health taskforce is looking at, under the expert leadership of
Stephen O’Brien, the chair of Barts Health NHS
Trust.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000120" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000120">General<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:42:51"></hs_TimeCode>
mental health support should not start in hospital or the treatment
room. It needs to start in our workplaces, our schools and our
communities, even across our kitchen tables and in the conversations we
have with one another. There is no reason why we should not be able to
talk about mental health and psychological therapies in the same way we
do about access to sexual health services, vaccinations or cancer
treatment, but we have a long way to
go<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:43:17"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000121" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000121">I

Returning to my opening comments on today’s news about the
crisis in mental health provision and the reduction in the number of
beds, the point of our debate is access to services that would prevent
people from going into those beds in the first place. However, we hear
today that bed capacity is at 100%. I hope that the Minister will
mention those issues as well, because they are
interlinked.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/00DAEDE987A4245D5C109530A5B16833FB3C35A0" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

we are operating. We recognise, as a Government—I think that all
hon. Members in this debate have recognised—that for far too
long we focused on crisis management in health care generally,
particularly in mental health, rather than on upstream interventions,
which is where IAPT plays such an important role to keep people well in
their own homes and communities, instead of picking up the pieces when
they become so unwell at the other end. There is a good economic
argument for that, but it also provides much better care for the
patients and the people we all care about as Members of Parliament, and
whom I care about as a
doctor<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:45:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000124" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000124">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:45:53"></hs_TimeCode>

for our armed forces veterans. There are now 10 dedicated teams in
England, focusing on supporting our veterans who have post-traumatic
stress disorder and other mental health problems, post-discharge. A lot
of work is going 
<?notus-xml column=260?>on—much more collaborative work—between the NHS and the
armed forces, to ensure that general practitioners and health care
professionals in England are much more aware of armed forces personnel

more holistic approach is
taken<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:46:48"></hs_TimeCode>, that
people do not present too late in crisis and that GPs can be much more
proactive in offering reassurance and support to veterans who may be

hon. Friends the Members for South West Bedfordshire (Andrew Selous)
and for Eastleigh (Mike Thornton) made important contributions about
the holistic approach to health care in general, about how mental
health needs to be considered holistically and about the benefits to
wider society of upstream interventions. Getting health care right can
also provide additional benefits for the economy; for example, by
supporting families to stay together and bring up their children. All
these things are beneficial and at the heart of my work on early

Ministers work collaboratively on many issues. However, on veterans, we
have to recognise that, although we have UK-wide armed forces, health
is a devolved responsibility. We need to share different initiatives
better between the devolved Administrations. Some remote areas of
Wales, in particular, could learn from best practice in the NHS about
how we are using, to good effect, specialist mental health teams for
veterans. I should be happy to share that and meet my counterpart in

the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis. He addressed a number of
issues that are central to the provision of good mental health care,
and he threw down some challenges on how we could potentially make
things better. In particular, he praised the scale of the
Government’s ambition to have genuine parity between physical
and mental health, which has to be right; it is at the centre of

hon. Member for Liverpool, Wavertree that, with the addition of IAPT,
there has been a substantial increase in the NHS’s total
investment in psychological therapies. As she will be aware, however,
it is down to local commissioners to prioritise their 
<?notus-xml column=261?>resources to meet local need, based on the local population that they
serve. In the past, the challenge has been that good commissioning has
too often been seen purely through the framework of physical health.
Through the NHS Commissioning Board’s mandate, we are now
ensuring that there is parity between mental and physical health. That
journey is already well under way to ensure that good commissioning is
no longer just about commissioning for acute services, such as stroke
and heart attack, but about looking at the whole patient and
considering the importance of upstream interventions, which are central
to IAPT’s role in looking after
patients<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:51:26"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000130" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000130">My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:51:29"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Friend the Member for Halesowen and Rowley Regis also talked about
the need to consider CBT and its evidence base. As he knows, it is not
the role of Ministers to question the integrity of NICE, but NICE keeps
its criteria under review, and there is a very strong evidence base to
support CBT. The evidence base for IAPT is continually being developed
and adapted, and a number of pilots are already in place to consider
the potential to extend the scope of therapies, including to older
people. I hope that that is reassuring. NICE will be listening to this
debate, and it continues to evaluate the evidence. With mental health,
there has always been controversy on how evidence is collated, because
mental health is different from physical health, and NICE will keep
that under review when it adapts and introduces future
guidelines<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:52:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000131" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000131">The
debate has been called because all hon. Members in the room believe
that, for too long, there has been too much focus on crisis management
and acute response when patients with mental health conditions become
very unwell. We would all like to see much more focus on upstream
intervention, which is what IAPT is all about. We need to move the
focus away from SSRIs—selective serotonin reuptake
inhibitors—and drug-based therapy towards upstream, proactive
intervention for what is sometimes a very vulnerable patient
group<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:53:18"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000132">The
benefits of early intervention have been outlined by many hon. Members.
There are clear health benefits, but there are also economic benefits,
benefits to the family and benefits from getting people back to work,
education and training, and from supporting people to have more
productive and happier lives. That is why we will continue to ensure
parity of esteem in commissioning for physical and mental health, and
it is why we will continue to support upstream interventions in the
early years—I will address early-years IAPT later. We will also
ensure that we continually drive good commissioning to encompass mental
health as well as physical health. That holistic approach to health
care, by prioritising mental health, is good for people’s health
care, good for families and good for the economy. That is why we will
ensure that it remains a
priority<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:54:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000133">As
hon. Members will be aware, the mandate set by the Government for NHS
England last year establishes a holistic approach as a priority for the
whole NHS for the first time. Improving access to psychological
therapies is fundamental to the success of improving mental health. The
mandate makes it clear that everyone who needs them should have timely
access to evidence-based services. That is particularly important for
mental health. By the end of March 2015, IAPT services will be
available to at least 15% of those who could benefit—an
estimated 900,000 people a year. We are also increasing the
availability of services to cover children and young 
<?notus-xml column=262?>people with long-term physical health problems and those with severe
mental illness to ensure that everyone can access therapies. There is
an emphasis on those who are out of work, the black and minority ethnic

entering and completing treatment. Recovery rates have consistently
been in excess of 45%, and they are much greater in many areas. The

hon. Friend is right that, through not only IAPT but other programmes
that consider health care more holistically—particularly the
family nurse programme, which is aimed at vulnerable teenage
mums—upstream intervention supporting those vulnerable groups
helps to keep couples together and helps reduce rates of domestic
violence. The programmes also support a stronger bond between mum and
baby, so the child does better at school and mum and dad are supported
to get back into education, training and work. So it is a win-win
situation for the economy, and it helps vulnerable younger parents to
have a better start in their own lives and provides a better start in
life for their children. That is not exclusive to family nurses; we are
also considering how the approach may be developed with IAPT, so that
we can have a more joined-up approach both to children’s health
generally and to
families<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:57:31"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000138" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000138">Earlier
this year, I launched a system-wide pledge across education, local

to give each and every child the best start in life. Part of the pledge
is to do exactly what my hon. Friend outlines, which is to
focus on getting early and upstream interventions right to support
children in having the best start in life. We are also seeing the
benefits of supporting families and reducing rates of domestic
violence. I hope that is reassuring, and we will continue to develop

our children’s IAPT programme is no less ambitious in its aim to
transform services. In 2011, we announced funding for children and
young people’s IAPT of £8 million a year for four years,
and in 2012, we agreed significant additional investment of up to
£22 million over the next three years, which is a total of 
<?notus-xml column=263?>£54 million up to 2015. That additional funding will be used to
extend the range of evidence-based therapies to include systematic
family therapies and interpersonal psychotherapy, to extend the range,
reach and number of collaborators within the project and to develop
interactive e-learning programmes to extend the skills and knowledge of
professionals such as teachers, social workers and counsellors. Again,
there is a multi-agency approach to improving the support and care
available to children, because this is not just about the NHS, but
about local authorities and education working together to get it right
for young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T10:59:06"></hs_TimeCode>. Behind
those facts and figures are the people whose lives and services have

conclude, it might be worth outlining a recent conversation that I had
with a GP. When talking about IAPTs in West Sussex, he said, “I
hear from GP colleagues that this is the single most positive change to
their medical practice in the last 20 years, and I echo this. Our local
service reaches out to the community, and it is always looking at ways
to improve. It is continually developing new evidence-based
interventions for people with anxiety and depression, delivered
one-on-one and in groups in a flexible way that means patients have
real choice. They have filled a huge gap in need and are a force for
good.” That is absolutely right, and it is why we will continue
to develop parity between mental and physical health and continue to
expand the IAPT
programme.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/6D9FC1344DB1D3A16E10D9EA2D476FFFBF305ED2" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>4</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

through some of the key stages of the proposal. When we looked at the
consultation, we were disappointed that the Highways Agency refused to
hold a consultation meeting in Suffolk. All the meetings were held in
Cambridgeshire, even though there is reference after reference in the
consultation document about, in effect, forcing HGVs on to the trunked
road by making sure that that was the easiest route to use and making
other routes quite difficult to use so that businesses would end up
using the tolled roads. The Highways Agency made a bad mistake there,
which I hope it does not repeat.</hs_Para>

in the consultation removes the existing A14, including demolishing the
A14 bridge, therefore reducing road capacity. I would like the Minister

the Under-Secretary of State for Transport, my hon. Friend the Member

it feels as if capacity is being reduced.</hs_Para>

the issues for Suffolk Coastal and the port of Felixstowe. One issue
for local haulage businesses relates to DP World, just up the road at
Tilbury. Improvements are being planned to junction 30 of the M25,
which is close to that port. It is planned that those improvements will
be paid for entirely by the taxpayer. Although I am convinced that the
magnificent port of Felixstowe will continue to invest and to compete
with DP World, imposing tolling charges on one of its key routes adds
additional costs for customers and hauliers. There is a real risk,
which does not seem to have been taken into account, that container
lorries will simply divert to the Al and the M25 at the expense of
Felixstowe. That is certainly bad news for the port of Felixstowe and
supporting businesses, but it is also bad news for UK

has been suggested that a tolling element is required to help pay for
all these infrastructure changes, but there has been no indication of

considerably more traffic using that route. We will end up in a
situation in which people in St Neots are going nuts about
how much traffic is going through their town. The situation could be

wider impact does not seem to have been assessed. In fact, there
appears to be an assumption in the Government, which I think is wrong,
that demand for using the A14 is completely inelastic to the toll. In
fact, as the Department will know, there are basically two types of
hauliers: first, those that definitely need to arrive on time; and
secondly, those for whom cash flow is key. Adding to the cost of coming
in and out of Suffolk and other parts of East Anglia creates a risk to
our economy. This is an issue not just for Felixstowe, but for other

3, with a BCR of 3.49 and 2.98 million vehicle hours saved.
In both cases the eastbound saving is 19 minutes and the westbound
saving is 14. The document gave, as a reason for introducing local
access roads, allowing tolling to be put in more easily; so it seems
that the scheme has been designed to make tolling easier, although
introducing those local roads would increase complexity and cost at the
Girton junction. The combination of the two options is coming out at
£1.5 billion, but that sum is also due to enhancements to the

effectiveness of the United Kingdom’s strategic road network is
vital to long-term economic growth, providing the means to move people
and freight between our centres of industry and population. In June,
the Government announced plans to increase the capital provision for
critical transport infrastructure through an unprecedented programme of
road investments worth  
<?notus-xml column=269?>more than £30 billion. Last year we announced proposals to
upgrade one of the most congested sections of trunk
road in England: the A14 between Huntingdon and Cambridge—a
section that I know well. That 25-mile length of road carries up to
85,000 vehicles a day, which is significantly more than it was ever
designed to accommodate, and is the reason why it has become such a
frequent source of delay and frustration for motorists. Heavy goods
vehicles make up an unusually high proportion of the traffic on the
road, contributing to difficult and stressful driving conditions for
other motorists and reducing average speeds still further. However, for
commercial road users, congestion presents a cost to business
efficiency, making journey times slow and unpredictable and increasing
fuel consumption as vehicles are often forced to
queue<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T11:17:41"></hs_TimeCode>. I used to

A14 between Huntingdon and Cambridge is part of a strategic road
corridor, which links the midlands to the east coast ports. In
addition, it accommodates long-distance movements between the north of
England and the south-east via the M11 motorway, as well as a growing
volume of local and commuter traffic in what has become one of
Britain’s most successful economic hot spots. That mix of local
and long-distance traffic is expected to get significantly worse as the
economy continues to recover, and one of the aims of the A14 scheme is
therefore to separate those making local trips from those passing
through the
region<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T11:18:25"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000176" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000176">I
shall comment now on a couple of questions, so that I do not run out of
time. My hon. Friend asked whether EU funding had been secured, and the
answer is that it is too early in the development of the
project to be able to say yes or no. As to traffic being forced
on to other roads, it is interesting to note that the alternative route
via the A428 and the A1 is 30 miles, as against 18 miles on
the A14. That would be an additional 14 miles, and anyone
driving a truck doing eight or nine miles to the gallon
would—never mind the lost time—easily be able to work out
that with the level of tolls we propose it would be a no-brainer to
stay on the toll road and not increase pressure on other local
infrastructure. Added to that, a shortage of residential property in
Cambridge is fuelling house price inflation in the region, but new
housing developments cannot proceed without better infrastructure. The
A14 scheme provides the key to unlock a number of major housing

construction and maintenance of the United Kingdom’s trunk roads

estuarial bridge and tunnel crossings, including the Mersey tunnels,
the River Severn crossings and the Dartford crossing, are tolled, but
the M6 toll, which opened in December 2003 to bypass a heavily
trafficked section of the M6 through Birmingham, is currently the only
principal road in Britain to be tolled. Proposals to toll part of the

Government have previously stated that, although they have no intention

significant transformation of the existing route the option to
introduce tolls on new sections of road is seen as a means of making
the capital investment more affordable. Such a situation exists on the
A14 between Cambridge and Huntingdon. The proposed scheme, at
£1.5 billion, constitutes more than a 10th of the Highways
Agency’s entire capital budget to the end of the decade and the
transport and economic benefits of the improvement to the east of

The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T11:21:52"></hs_TimeCode> local
authorities and the local enterprise partnership in the Cambridgeshire
area are highly supportive of the scheme and have also been asked to
make a contribution to its development. As a result, some £100
million has been pledged by those bodies to offset some of the costs to
Government of the

therefore makes the A14 scheme more affordable. An important principle
underpinning the tolling strategy for the A14 is that tolls, while
making a meaningful contribution towards the cost of the scheme, should
not deter motorists from using the new road, particularly when making
long-distance trips through the region. Tariffs will therefore be kept
as low as possible, with light vehicles being expected to pay around
£1 or £1.50 at current-day prices and heavy
vehicles paying around double that cost. It is anticipated that tolls
will be charged seven days a week, but that overnight trips will be
free. That may encourage some commercial operators to use the road at
night when it is expected to be less
busy.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000182" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000182">A
second principle that remains fundamental to the development of
this scheme has been to channel the right traffic on to the right
roads, separating long-distance through-traffic from local traffic. The
proposed scheme makes provision for local and commuter traffic to
use a new side-road network between Cambridge and Huntingdon,
which is toll-free and which eliminates much of the conflict between
local and strategic
users.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000183" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000183">Most<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T11:23:17"></hs_TimeCode>
toll roads in Britain and throughout Europe require road users to stop
at toll plazas to pay, but if we are to eliminate congestion on this
section of road, the  
<?notus-xml column=271?>introduction of physical barriers is not the solution. The Highways
Agency is therefore proposing a free-flow tolling system, in which
vehicles are identified using cameras or tag devices and payments are
made electronically or by smartphone without delaying road users. I
should point out that we do not expect drivers to use their smartphones
while driving. The system works in a similar way to the London
congestion charge, using technology that is now well proven and
collection systems that have proved to be effective in
practice<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-16T11:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101663000184" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0001.htm#13101663000184">The
tolling proposals for the A14 Cambridge-to-Huntingdon scheme were set
out in a public consultation exercise that ended last weekend, together
with the Highways Agency’s proposed scheme alignment. More than
5,000 people attended a series of exhibitions staged in towns and
villages along the route and nearly 1,000 people provided
their views by completing the Highways Agency’s online
questionnaire. Discussions took place between the Highways Agency and
the various local authorities in the surrounding area and the
consultation received a high level of publicity in the press and
broadcast media in Cambridge, Huntingdon and throughout the east of
England. That was the first in a series of consultation exercises that
will take place before a development consent order application is
submitted by the Highways Agency in the autumn of 2014. Although it is
a little early to comment on the results of the recently closed first

someone in authority to be, in essence, troublemakers; it is a little

Sam Wanamaker worked extremely hard and was absolutely fundamental in

us put that into perspective. It has been known for four years that
more than 3,200 workers, in the period from 1993 to 2009, were
blacklisted by up to 44 construction companies. Many of the
companies were household names, such as Balfour Beatty, McAlpine,
Carillion and Costain, and people were consequently kept out of work,
not only for years, but in some cases for decades. Across the nation,
we have come to a view that phone hacking is a very serious intrusion
into privacy and a massive breach of human rights. However, I put it to
the Chamber—I am sure that there would be widespread agreement
across the country—that it does not compare with being deprived
of a job for years, or even decades on end.</hs_Para>

the Member for Glasgow South West (Mr Davidson) chairs, that some
information revealed on files on blacklisted workers, again, could only
have come from the police or security service sources—those were
the words used by the officer from the ICO. The firm belief of the
IPCC, based on discussions with the Metropolitan Police—an
irrefutable source, I think—is that all special branches were
engaged in these illegal and highly damaging activities. If that is
proven—I come back to the need for a public inquiry—it
will expose a monumental scandal. To be fair, it is disputed at

by UCATT and the other trade unions. Unfortunately, it was not in the

way that they knew would be intensely destructive to the livelihood of
thousands of people, and that, in itself, is a matter for which they

has been said is disputed by a senior investigating officer recently
appointed to Operation Herne, which is the inquiry being undertaken

seen “no conclusive evidence” that Scotland Yard
exchanged information with the blacklisting companies. That needs to be
investigated further. However, it is difficult to deny, and in my view,
not only is that a rather unconvincing 
<?notus-xml column=280?>denial, but it contradicts the fact that the Blacklist Support Group has
now had it confirmed that a secret meeting took place in November 2008
between the Consulting Association, which ran the blacklist, and
officers from the police national extremism tactical co-ordination

have one more point to make. Significantly, this new and damning
information comes from a freedom of information request to the
Information Commissioner’s Office, which replied that it was
holding notes about that meeting. That rather invites the question why
it has been sitting on this information for four years and only had it
revealed when it was extracted from the ICO by the freedom of
information procedure. It also raises the further question, which has
already come up in this debate, why the ICO has so far declined to
inform all 3,213 workers that they were subject to the blacklist. Who
took the decision that they would only respond to requests to the ICO?
That is a very important question. This is not a matter for the ICO; it
is a political question. Who is told about this massive breach of their
rights is a question for Ministers.</hs_Para>

the Member for Hampstead and Kilburn (Glenda Jackson) on securing this
important debate. Frankly, it is shocking that we are having a debate
in 2013 condemning the continuing practice of blacklisting. It is
simply a disgrace that blacklisting is still going on in 21st century
Britain. We might have been aware, perhaps, from rumour or
experience in our own employment, that blacklisting existed. We might
have had evidence: managers leaving notes about employees for other
managers, and even human resources services that operated a two-file
system—one accessible and the other for their eyes
only—so it is not surprising to learn that blacklisting is
practised by some large, well-known companies.</hs_Para>

blacklisting to have been made public is one that we can all recall,
from the United States. I am of course speaking of the McCarthy era,
which we have already heard mentioned—one of the most
destructive, harmful and insidious episodes in that country’s
history. Talented people fled the United States during the McCarthy
witch hunts, to places such as Britain, where they must have thought
that blacklisting did not exist, or at least not at the level that they

I can reflect on my own experience of blacklisting. As a young man, I
never realised what it was. I did not really get involved in trade
unions, either, but my family was involved. It was only because of that
that I was blacklisted for three years—unemployed with a young
family. It was very difficult to get benefits; it was difficult to
exist.</hs_Para>

interview as a porter at Erskine hospital—in Erskine, which is
in my constituency. The matron told me, “No problem, Jim.
You’ve got the job, but we’ll send you official notice in
the post in the next couple of days.” I did get something in the
next couple of days, telling me, “Unfortunately, Mr Sheridan,
you have been unsuccessful on this occasion.” I still did not
know that I was on the blacklist, but some time later I met the matron
and she told me that I had got the job, but that a name check had been
done with the Economic League, and it showed that my family were
involved in trade union activities, which meant I could not have it.
That is the kind of thing that we are talking about
today.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101673000104" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0002.htm#13101673000104">That
experience is what brought me into politics—to change that kind
of thing. That is why we need people from a working-class background in

means to be told, “You are inadequate; you are a
danger; you are a threat from within”. It was Mrs Thatcher who
used to call us the enemy within. Those things brought me into

other passion is for health and safety in the workplace. I chair the
all-party group on occupational safety and health and I come into
contact with many members of the public. The issues include such things
as asbestos-related mesothelioma. I recall, in the shipyards in
Glasgow, seeing the white flakes of asbestos dust falling through the

the flakes floating through, and said to the gaffer, or supervisor,
“That’s asbestos, and we’re swallowing it.”
“Don’t be silly, son,” he told me. “Nothing
wrong with it. It won’t do you any harm. Just go home. A pint of
Guinness will wash it all away.” That was the kind of ignorance
and arrogance that was around in those days. If anyone dared ever
question the employer about safety statistics or safety measures, they
were dealt with. The only way they could deal with me—they could
not sack me, because my father was a yard convener—was by
discriminating against me by not offering me overtime or jobs that were

want an apology from the firms involved. Thirdly, we want compensation.
Fourthly, we want to know all the firms involved, not just a few. I
welcome the apology from some of the firms involved, but we must
recognise: first, that that does not include all the firms who
participated in blacklisting; secondly, that the negotiations and
settlement will be exceedingly complex; and, thirdly, that a solution
cannot be imposed unilaterally by the companies, but must be the
subject of negotiation with the unions involved and those representing
people who have been blacklisted. There must a negotiated settlement,
rather than imposition.</hs_Para>

forwards, we now recognise that there must be legal changes. It has
been conceded that there was blacklisting on Crossrail, and yet the law
on blacklisting was not broken. That leaves us in the position where
something clearly must be done. I hope the Minister accepts that and
takes the matter forward. We must find a way to ensure that when a new
construction site is established and a work force taken on, there is a
review after the event to identify whether there is evidence of
blacklisting. We need wider acceptance that companies that have not
apologised or compensated can be and should be kept off public and
private sector contract shortlists. There must be a code of conduct for
firms when dealing with employees in these matters.</hs_Para>

final point looks further forwards to the question of an inquiry. I
hope that the actions that we in the Scottish Affairs Committee
identified and I have commented on today do not have to wait until a
full public inquiry. The nature of public inquiries is that
they look backwards and take years. Many of the people involved are now
elderly and, in my view, require compensation. Those who are not
elderly require assistance in getting back into the industry, so that
they can have adequate compensation and employment for the working time
they have left. We need further inquiries into the role of 
<?notus-xml column=289?>the police and state security services. The

blacklisting is not one of them. It shames the country and undermines
the reputation of the industry. Today demonstrates that the House is
fully united in its complete condemnation of such a practice, which, as

McCarthyite witch hunts than a modern and progressive construction

degree to which the practice permeated through the construction

Information Commissioner, 44 construction companies were members of the
Consulting 
<?notus-xml column=290?>Association in 2009 and half of the 20 largest
construction companies and all their subsidiaries in this country were
involved. For £2.20—not 30 pieces of silver, but
£2.20—a construction worker’s livelihood and
chance of securing employment could be dashed by the company if they
were on the blacklist. Many construction companies are trying to claim
ignorance of the practice, but given the amounts of money
involved—in a three-year period alone, companies paid the

effective levers that the Government could pull to help eliminate
blacklisting is the effective use of public procurement. The Government
could exclude firms that use blacklisting from tendering for contracts.
They could request information about the practice and find real
evidence through the tendering process of how a particular company has
used blacklisting. That could include seeking evidence that the
practice has ended and that the workers affected have secured
appropriate compensation and are back in the employment market. The
Government could alter standard terms and conditions in contracts to
make it explicit that any such contract would be immediately ended,
without compensation to the firm, if it was found that blacklisting was
used by the company and its subsidiaries.</hs_Para>

eliminating blacklisting through procurement. What is Whitehall doing

Government’s position is the same: this practice is not
acceptable in any way. No responsible company should be involved in
blacklisting, whether that is providing information for a blacklist,
using a blacklist, consulting a blacklist or using information from a
previous blacklist that was in operation before the regulations were
introduced in 2010. That is not the behaviour of any responsible or
law-abiding company or any moral individual. People should be appointed
to roles based on their merits and whether they can do the job. If they
are independent-minded and involved enough to be able to flag up
issues, such as health and safety problems in the workplace, or if they
want to give more to their workplace through involvement in trade union
activities, that is to be commended. Any employer worth its salt will
recognise the positive nature of having an engaged and involved work
force that are actively interested in ensuring that their workplace is
safe and effective for everyone. The experiences that we have heard
about have been not only abhorrent, but hugely counter-productive, as
many hon. Members have mentioned, on issues such as workplace safety
records. We want to encourage an atmosphere where people can raise
issues if there are problems without fearing that that will impact on
their future
employability.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101673000133" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0002.htm#13101673000133">As
hon. Members know, there are significant powers in place to deal with
blacklisting, but I entirely understand the frustration. I think it was
the hon. Member for Nottingham North who mentioned the case of the
Consulting Association and Ian Kerr, the £5,000 fine and the
lack of ability to take any kind of serious action against the
individuals responsible, because the framework was not in place at that
time. That situation rightly needed addressing. The previous Government
addressed that issue with the consultation on and implementation of the
Employment Relations Act 1999 (Blacklists) Regulations 2010, which mean
that someone is looking at a £500,000 fine instead of a
£5,000 fine. That might not be the unlimited amount that some
hon. Members have called for, but no one can deny that it is a serious
amount. There is data protection, but there is also the ability to
award maximum compensation of some £65,000—the minimum is
£5,000—through the employment tribunals system. We are in
a better position on the legal
framework.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101673000134" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0002.htm#13101673000134"><B><Member ContinuationText="Mr Davidson" PimsId="2856" UID="13101673000355" xid="157" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/halltext/131016h0002.htm#13101673000355">Mr

ICO has undertaken a project with Equifax to check whether address
information in the files is up to date. As a result, it has written to
103 individuals, of whom 27 have contacted the ICO to make a subject
access request. The ICO has also worked with the Department for Work
and Pensions to determine whether up-to-date addresses can be
identified from a national insurance number when that is included in
the information held. The ICO hopes shortly to write to individuals for

is very scant, with sometimes only a first name and surname. If the

contact the person, without address details and other information. The
range of actions that the ICO is taking to piece information

north Wales.</hs_Para>

TUC reckons that Wales has the lowest levels of disposable income in
the UK and has experienced the highest falls in living standards in the
UK. There has been a drop in living standards for 38 of the 39 months
that this Tory-Lib Dem coalition has been in power. In constituencies
in north Wales, the impact has been severe. Between 2007 and 2012, in
Flintshire the average pay packet for a 40-hour week dropped by nearly
£3,000 and in my own county of Denbighshire it dropped by more
than £2,000.</hs_Para>

outward sign of the drop in living standards is, of course, the food
banks—the food banks that many Conservative Ministers and MPs
refuse to go to when they are repeatedly asked to do so in the main
Chamber. I have been to food banks in my constituency and I praise the
work of people who volunteer at them; they do a sterling job. I have
visited the Wellspring centre in my constituency and shared soup with
the people that it provided food for. The citizens advice bureau in
Denbigh set up a food bank; in fact, it is an award-winning food bank
and I congratulate the CAB in Denbigh for it.</hs_Para>

Conservatives say, “Oh, food banks increased by tenfold under
Labour.” They did, from 3,000 to about 34,000. Under the
Conservatives, however, they have increased from about 40,000 to nearly
400,000—another tenfold increase. The food banks under Labour
were peripheral; as I say, there were 34,000 of them, at most. Under
the Conservatives, food banks are central. Since 2011, the Government
have given instructions to jobcentres to refer people who have no money
to food banks. Food banks are part of official Government
policy—dare I say official Government philosophy? It is charity
versus the state; charity taking the place of the state. It is the big
society, or, as I call it, the “beg society”, where soup
kitchens are here in the 21st century, having last been seen in the
1930s. As I say, I have shared soup with the people using
them.</hs_Para>

particular interest to people in my constituency and the other
constituencies in north Wales is the issue of public sector workers,
who are another group vilified by the Conservatives. There are huge
numbers of public sector workers in certain constituencies in north
Wales. The number of people who reside in my constituency, the Vale of
Clwyd, and work in the public sector is 
<?notus-xml column=298?>10,200—35% of the work force.

decline in real wages between 2007 and 2012 in Denbighshire and
Flintshire. We can go through the figures later if he wants more
detail, but the vast majority of the decline in real wages happened in
the last three years of the previous Labour Government, when, as a
result of the economic trauma that they visited upon this
country, there was an enormous destruction of wealth and real wages
fell. We are now seeing a recovery in wages, including in Wales, but

financial circumstances. That is why we are putting cash back into

allowance. We are lifting 130,000 of the lowest-paid workers in Wales
out of income tax altogether by increasing that allowance to
£10,000. Some 324,000 taxpayers in north Wales will benefit from

has benefited the lowest-paid workers. This year, we are able 
<?notus-xml column=303?>not only to implement all the Low Pay
Commission’s recommendations but to go further: the commission
recommended freezing the apprentice rate, but we are not freezing it;
we are increasing it, and we can do so because we have taken difficult
decisions to restore discipline and order to our national finances and
to put our house in order, which has given us the capacity and the
resources to do things such as increase minimum

thing that we are committed to freezing, however, is fuel duty, and we

their fuel tank. I remind Opposition Members that, had Labour been
elected in 2010 and implemented its detailed financial plans in full,
as it had intended, the price of petrol would be 13p a litre higher
than today. That is an example of the Government putting cash back into
the pockets of hard-working people and hard-working families. Again, we
can do that only because we were able, willing and had the strength of
purpose to take difficult decisions at the start of this Parliament to

incorrect to say that Conservatives have refused to visit them. I
regularly visit my local food bank. In fact, I was a trustee of the

they do well and what they do not do so well. From speaking to

Jobcentre Plus has been referring people to food banks since 2011, but
what happened before 2011 under the previous Labour Government? They
banned jobcentres from advertising the availability of food banks. They
tried to cover up the fact that food banks were increasing in number on
their watch. They did not want to acknowledge that food banks existed
and were growing. We are not taking that approach. We see food banks as

make a speech during a half-hour debate, they should seek the
permission of the Member who secured the debate and the Minister.
Members can, however, make interventions as long as the initiator or
the Minister is willing to give way. I urge hon. Members to keep that
in mind. Members are also supposed to write in before speaking in such
debates,

believe that 5 June was the start of the process of bringing both sides
together, to which I hope today’s debate also contributes. It is
pretty easy for all of us to understand

of it as being cruel. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural
Affairs and farmers have the best interests of the countryside and the
agricultural community at heart and want to help in the best way
possible and protect badgers at the same time, but they believe,
rightly or wrongly, that the spread of bovine TB will be significantly
reduced if we cull 70% of badgers in the cull zones. That said, the
last major cull from 1997 to 2007 was not deemed to have dealt with

a vaccination programme cost-effectively. Furthermore, if the
lion’s share of research and development, and of delivery of the
programme, is undertaken by groups such as the Royal Society for the

there was an increase in TB in a ring immediately around the trial
areas as a result of perturbation, but the incidence then dropped.
Overall, there was a reduction. I point the hon. Lady to evidence in
other countries, such as the Republic of Ireland, which has had a cull

studies have demonstrated that vaccinating badgers with BCG can reduce
the risk of infection and transmission of the disease. A four-year
safety field study of wild badgers showed a statistically significant
indirect protective effect in unvaccinated cubs born into vaccinated
social groups, but vaccinating a large enough proportion of badgers to
reduce transmission of disease and bring about a reduction of TB in
cattle would take time to achieve and be costly to deliver, at between
£2,000 and £4,000 per sq km per
year.</hs_Para>

it is inevitable that not all badgers in an area will be trapped and
vaccinated. There is no evidence that vaccination protects
already-infected badgers, and there is a risk that badgers from
neighbouring unvaccinated areas may act as a constant source of
infection. Nevertheless, computer modelling indicates that sustained
badger vaccination campaigns could be beneficial in lowering TB
incidence in cattle, but quantifying that contribution is likely to
need a large-scale field trial, and it would take some years to collect
the

are things that we would need to resolve when it comes to the

those buildings will be entitled to compensation according to the terms
of the Compensation Code. The Government is currently consulting on

Morgan:</Member></B> HM Revenue and Customs' (HMRC) strategy to tackle
tobacco smuggling includes a wide range of complementary measures. In
Northern Ireland, HMRC treats tobacco fraud as one of its top
priorities and conducts proactive criminal investigations into
organised criminal groups involved in tobacco smuggling. Working
collaboratively with a range of partner agencies in both Northern
Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, HMRC gathers and responds to
intelligence concerning tobacco smuggling in order to seize illicit
tobacco and, where appropriate, arrest those involved. HMRC uses a
range of criminal and civil powers to deny and recover the proceeds of
crime, and seize vehicles used in the smuggling of
tobacco.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-16?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_16_PT_1/F7D648696C566E7B7F4352AA2533B49C4BB3D4C3" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>0</House><System>1</System><Sitting short-date="16 October 2013">Wednesday

Swinson:</Member></B> The Government has made a number of changes
recently to the employment tribunal system to address weak or vexatious
claims and their effect on all businesses, including smaller companies.
Following Lord Justice Underhill's review of the employment tribunal
rules of procedure, judges now have enhanced powers to apply deposit
orders on weak elements of claims. An initial sift process, conducted
by judges, has also been introduced to help identify and manage weak
claims earlier in proceedings. In addition, claimants now have to pay a
fee to bring an employment tribunal case. Fees will help claimants
consider whether alternative forms of dispute resolution, such as the
free conciliation service provided by ACAS, would be more appropriate
for resolving their workplace disputes. From next year, claimants will
be required to contact ACAS in the first instance and consider early
conciliation before being able to proceed to an employment
tribunal.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101685000445" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0001.htm#13101685000445">The
changes to the employment tribunal process were implemented on 29 July
this year. Early conciliation will be introduced on 6 April 2014.
Government will assess the effect of these changes on the intentions of
all parties, including small businesses, before considering any further
action.</hs_Para>

domain name registration process in the .uk space, UK internet users
are able to choose from over 20 alternative Top Level Domain names

currently exist. DECC is responsible for the National Concessionary
Fuel Scheme (NCFS) for the former employees of the British Coal
Corporation (BCC) at the time of privatisation. This Scheme is
completely separate from the arrangements operated by private coal
mining companies that inherited obligations at privatisation or set up
their own arrangements. DECC has no legal obligations in relation to
these company specific
arrangements.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101685000937" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0002.htm#13101685000937">DECC's
obligations under the NCFS are governed by collective agreements
established between BCC and the mining unions in the 1980s. Following
the privatisation of BCC in 1994, Government assumed liability for the
provision of concessionary fuel (or cash in lieu) to former employees
of BCC (and their widows) who met the necessary criteria under these
arrangements. DECC currently services over 69,000 beneficiaries. It is
envisaged 
<?notus-xml column=754?>that the arrangements will last until 2050, with an estimated remaining

to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal and this includes the
manner in which an animal may be put down. The recommended way of
euthanising a dog is for a veterinary surgeon to administer an overdose
of barbiturates. Other methods of euthanasia must be available in cases
where emergency action is needed. If used correctly, captive bolt guns
may avoid unnecessary suffering but they are not a recommended method
of euthanising dogs. Anyone using an alternative method that causes the
animal unnecessary suffering runs the risk of prosecution under the

consistent with this, the National Conservation Bill (NCB) is due to
establish a legal framework for environmental impact assessments,
ensuring they are integrated into the national decision making
processes. We have offered Territory leaders advice and support on
environmental governance issues. I will be visiting Cayman Islands in
early November, as well as having bilateral talks with the Cayman
Islands' Premier at the 2013 JMC in late November. Environmental issues
will likely be discussed at both of these
events.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13101685000097" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0002.htm#13101685000097">China</hs_8Question><Question><hs_Para UID="13101685000998" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0002.htm#13101685000998"><B><Member PimsId="650" UID="13101685002277" xid="1218" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0002.htm#13101685002277">Jim

medical authorities on trends in incidence of bowel cancer in the
United Kingdom. We know that bowel cancer incidence rates have
increased overall in the UK since the 1970s, especially in men.
Although rates fell at the end of the 1990s, they rose in the 2000s
following the introduction of bowel cancer screening, which resulted in
the identification of more bowel cancers.</hs_Para>

this work is led by NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT) in conjunction
with a number of partners in the private, public and third sectors. For
example, people may sign up to the ODR when they register with a new
general practitioner, when applying for a new passport, when applying
for a European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) and when applying for a
Boots advantage card. We have established

to the differences between the way offences committed on bail and the

are known issues with PNC data on offences committed while on bail. In
particular the recording of information on whether or not the offence
was committed while the offender was on bail is known to be incomplete.
This is because the police have available to them a number of ways of
recording the bail status of an offender of which the ‘offence
committed on bail’ field on the PNC is one. For operational
purposes police forces make differing use of these various sources and
as a result figures derived purely from the PNC do not provide a
complete picture of these offences, and therefore changes over time.
These data may not represent real changes in offending while on
bail.</hs_Para>

response to the ‘Transforming Legal Aid: delivering a more
credible and efficient system’ consultation, and,
simultaneously, published proposals for further consultation on a
modified model of procurement for criminal legal aid and two options
for revising the criminal advocacy fee scheme. This response,
‘Transforming Legal Aid; Next Steps’, and the seven

we have decided to proceed with the proposed reforms to civil fees,
this is in the context of the outcome of the 2013 civil legal aid
tender process for contracts, which reflected the scope reforms
introduced by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act
2012 (LASPO). Overall, this tender was significantly oversubscribed
which indicates that there currently remains a strong appetite among
providers to do legal aid work. This does not tell us whether there
will be a sufficient number of providers in the market in the
long-term, and the actual current viability of any contracted firm or
how this might be impacted by the fee changes. However, it does suggest
that there is currently competition for work and therefore scope for at
least some providers to withdraw from the market while still
maintaining a sustainable market
supply.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101685001545" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0003.htm#13101685001545">We

most generous legal aid systems in the world, costing around

Penning:</Member></B> In May 2013 the Upper Tribunal handed down an
interim judgment in a judicial review which challenged the process of
when and whether the Department obtains further medical evidence for
ESA claimants with a mental health condition going through the WCA
process. The Upper Tribunal clarified that the Department has not been
found to be in breach of its duty to make reasonable adjustments under
the Equality Act 2010, but directed the further steps that should be
taken in the proceedings in order to decide the question of whether
there are reasonable steps that could be taken in order to avoid the

exist.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13101685001784" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131016/text/131016w0003.htm#13101685001784">The
