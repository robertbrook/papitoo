Wallace of Saltaire (LD):</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, the
Government’s overarching principle in procuring public services
in the private sector is to secure the best quality and value for money
for the taxpayer over the life of the contract. On coming to power in
2010, the Government found that public sector procurement was
fragmented, bureaucratic, protracted and expensive, both for bidders
and for procurers. The procurement reforms we have introduced since
2010 have made the way we do business more competitive, more
transparent, better value and far simpler than
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000007"><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T14:50:54"></hs_TimeCode><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Haskel" PimsId="875" UID="1310284000241" xid="1257" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000241">Lord

the past for our problems in the present does not actually get us very
far? Does he also agree with virtually everybody else that we are being
ripped off by these companies, not only on energy prices but also in
the Work Programme and in health assessments and rail fares? We learnt
from the <I>Financial Times</I> only this morning that the Government
are concerned that we are being ripped off by the water companies. What
steps are the Government taking to rebuild public trust, and hold down

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I hope you will accept that
there is, to some extent, a difference between the relationship that
the Government have with water companies and energy suppliers, which
have regulators, and the direct contracts that the Government have with
particular suppliers such as Serco and G4S. The concerns that we have
at present over Serco and G4S are widely known. The Government are
conducting a review of contracts with Serco and G4S across the
board<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T14:52:16"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000009"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Naseby" PimsId="2071" UID="1310284000243" xid="1356" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000243">Lord
Naseby (Con):</Member></B> Does my noble friend recall that, prior to
1979, hundreds of local authorities had direct labour departments
building council homes and carrying out maintenance at a massive loss
of billions of pounds to the local ratepayers and the taxpayer in
general? In 1979, very early on, those councils were prevented from
doing that and the private sector construction industry was brought in
to build those flats. Is that not a better way forward, and has that
not been proven over the

Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I think we have discovered
yet again that there is no perfect way of providing goods and services
and that each model has its own advantages and disadvantages. The
Government are currently doing their best to encourage the development
of mutuals. Some weeks ago I went round the mutual housing association
operating in Bradford, and it was doing a superb job, in particular in
training apprentices. But of course there are good examples and bad
examples in almost every

Greengross (CB):</Member></B> In the light of the recent criticisms of
past exercises in public procurement, can the Minister give the House
an absolute assurance that the Government will in future ensure that in
every such procurement the reasons and objectives are clearly laid out
so that delivery can be monitored and success assessed; that a
realistic and workable alternative is available so that the Government
do not in the last hours find themselves negotiating over a barrel;
and, lastly, that the Government are clear about which risks they will
keep and, when they want to allocate those risks to the operator, how
that will be
achieved?<hs_TimeCode time="2000-01-01T00:00:00"></hs_TimeCode></hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000014" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000014"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" PimsId="4501" UID="1310284000248" xid="1482" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000248">Lord
Wallace of Saltaire:</Member></B> My Lords, I wish that every potential
risk was clear before one ever signed a contract, as that is part of
the problem. The Government are aware that part of the problem with
public procurement is that it has proved easier to contract with very
large-scale providers which then very often subcontract to other
suppliers. We are moving towards 
<?notus-xml column=1325?>the target of 25% of contracts going to small and medium-sized suppliers
so that there are direct relations with those who are actually on the
ground providing the service in the regions and the localities. That is
one of the things that we hope will improve the

Sugar (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, does the Minister agree that the
original concept of hiring commercial enterprise to conduct the
business of the Government was meant to gain better efficiency and
value for money? Does he agree that this has failed in the sense that
most of these private contractors actually spend most of their time
enhancing their profit margins instead of looking after the service
that they are supposed to be providing? Serco, as he has already

noble Lord will have seen that a number of senior executives have
resigned in recent weeks. We welcome that and see it as a positive
first step in the process of corporate renewal. Across the board,
however, I am not sure that I would wish to blacken every company

there are millions of privately employed workers delivering public

We expect schools to teach children not to tolerate violence. Schools
may include this topic in personal, social, health and economic
education as a non-statutory subject. Maintained secondary schools are
already legally required to provide sex and relationship education, and
we would expect all academies also to do so. The SRE guidance, which
schools must have regard to, states that teachers should support
children to avoid all forms of abuse, bullying and
violence<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T14:58:54"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T14:58:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000025" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000025"><B><Member ContinuationText="Baroness Prosser" PimsId="251" UID="1310284000259" xid="1701" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000259">Baroness

get information and messages to them. The This is Abuse campaign run by
the Home Office is already doing good work in this regard. Later this
year, Ministers from the Department for Education, the Home Office and
the Department for International Development are to meet
representatives from head teachers’ and teachers’ unions

by either side in Abyei, but we believe that the Ngok community is
organising a popular consultation of the community. However, this has
not been endorsed by the Government of South Sudan. We understand the

rather like inviting any violent dictator to think about his behaviour

anything else happening in Sudan, that Omar al-Bashir is wanted for war
crimes? This Government—indeed, it was the noble Baroness on

on benefits, does my noble friend agree that getting it right is more

you are introducing a large cultural change like this, it is important
to do it in a careful and controlled way, and to make sure that it is
safe and secure. That is how we have been introducing our series of
changes, such as child maintenance, PIP and benefit cap. I am not in a

John Major also said that this was going to fail, that all these
reforms were going to fail, unless Iain Duncan Smith was a genius, and
he saw no proof of that. Does the Minister have any proof? Unless he
does, is it not about time that for the sake of our disabled people the

universal credit is not the right transformation. Although it voted
against various aspects, it is actually saying that it is the right way
to go. The issue is how to introduce it. We are introducing it safely
and securely, and we are doing that exactly for the kind of people to
whom the noble Lord was referring. We are making sure that we do not
produce shocks by introducing a new system on one day in the way, for

makes enormous sense to get people into the digital environment, not

noble Lords have longer memories than I, but I can recall no other Bill

later.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000070" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000070">The
price rises that are causing so much concern today are, in part,
attributable to the increase in the world price of gas. Whether we like
it or not, we can expect the 20-year ragged upward trend of fossil fuel
prices to continue, driven by steadily increasing world demand and
partly because reserves and oil are becoming more expensive to extract.
Temporary market gluts apart, we have to expect carbon-based energy
systems to become progressively more expensive relative to the other
items on which we spend our money.</hs_para>

today’s low price of natural gas in the United States, we might
ask whether we should not completely rethink our energy strategy in the
light of possible US shale gas resource. Shale gas appears to be
abundant and carries only half the environmental penalty of coal. I
answer in the following way. It is widely recognised within the
industry that the current low price of shale gas in the US results from
overproduction and cannot be sustained. For the large US shale gas
resource to become an economically exploitable reserve, the price will
need to be around three times what it is today. The fact is that
extracting gas from shale requires more energy and is more expensive
than producing gas by conventional means. Either most of the gas in US
shale will not be produced or its price will be much higher than
today.</hs_para>

considerations apply to the UK as well, except that the operational
conditions here are likely to be tougher than in the US. If the UK
shale gas resource is exploited, its main consequence would be
a greater degree of resource independence rather
than lower prices. That said, in almost any realistic
scenario, gas has an important role to play in the UK energy supply for
some decades to come, particularly if cost-effective carbon capture and
storage technology is developed. The bottom line is that shale gas does
not provide a “get out of jail free” energy card for
the UK and does not provide a reason for a major rethink of
energy policy or for changing the thrust of the Bill.</hs_para>

original thinking behind the Bill is correct; namely, that it is
prudent to spend more in the short term to build a strategic
infrastructure that will substantially decarbonise our economy and
reduce our exposure to rises in the cost of fossil fuels, which are
likely to remain a continuing political concern. For reasons so well
known that I will not rehearse them here, we need this Bill urgently so
that the first steps in building the new infrastructure can be taken
soon and 
<?notus-xml column=1335?>in the right
direction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:26:43"></hs_TimeCode>. The
two defining characteristics of energy infrastructure are the long
timescales and the high costs. With sufficient forethought and
consistency of policy, both can be reduced. That is what the amendment
seeks to achieve. As the Bill stands, important decisions on timing are
deferred until at least after the next election, and who knows what
other distracting pressures on government time there will be then. This
is our opportunity and we should seize
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000074">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:27:17"></hs_TimeCode>
amendment would require the Government to settle next year the outlines
of a measured approach to a longer-term UK energy strategy, taking into
account the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. Once the bare
bones of the strategy and above all its timescale are clear, industry
can begin to plan. It is not just major companies that are involved. It
is sometimes forgotten that the nominal times taken to extend the grid
or build a new power station depend on essential components being
available when they are needed. This means having a robust and
specialised supply chain, which itself can take a number of years to
establish. Without such a supply chain, major components that are
urgently needed will probably have to be imported at high cost and with
no benefit to the UK economy. More clarity now will help UK jobs and
the manufacturing industries.</hs_para>

infrastructure investment also needs funds. Investors have the choice
of where to put their funds and they will not put their money into a
decarbonised energy infrastructure unless they see the Government
committed not just by good intentions, but by the wording of the Bill.
Investment is about risk; and the lower the perceived risk, the better
terms we may expect to obtain. Here I must take the Government to task.
At a time when investment in energy utilities in Europe has rarely
looked less attractive, the Government appear to have gone out of their
way to weaken confidence further. Ministers in departments closely
involved with this Bill have on at least five occasions made statements
that appear to undermine its main
decarbonisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:29:26"></hs_TimeCode>
rationale<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:29:28"></hs_TimeCode>. To
make matters worse, the Government now seem to have adopted the
language of their critics by describing as “green taxes”
those elements of consumer charges that are specifically designated to
reduce costs by improving energy efficiency and developing better
long-term
infrastructure<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:30:04"></hs_TimeCode><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:29:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

for the Government to recover the situation is to accept the amendment
today as a reaffirmation of their commitment. The amendment will not
guarantee that investment is forthcoming, but it will certainly help.
Today, I have said a little about the environmental objectives of the
Bill. These are undoubtedly important but, for reasons that I have
given, the arguments for decarbonising—energy
security and minimising energy costs—all point in
the same direction. Others have asked about possible damage
to our economy if we are the only country embarking on a
decarbonisation strategy now. We are not alone. Around 50 other
countries have either enacted or are working on improved energy
efficiency and decarbonisation legislation. The Government are making
special provisions for those industries which might be particularly
disadvantaged by new
legislation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

getting on with the job and setting milestones for ordered progress to
a new energy structure. They are specifically about setting a
power-decarbonisation milestone for 2030. The milestone should be set,
if for no other reason than because, the sooner it is set, the less
expensive it will be to achieve the energy security and decarbonisation
that we seek. Accepting the amendments is the “no
regrets” course. Should some miraculous, game-changing new
technology appear, or some other unforeseen circumstance arise, the
Bill provides Ministers with ways of dealing with the unexpected. There
is simply no reason not to get on with the job that has to be done and
every reason for doing it now. The amended Bill would be good for jobs,
for UK industry, for investors and for the environment. I beg to

is no point in having this Bill if not for decarbonisation. As we know,
this Bill started back in 2010 with a White Paper and has been through
many other processes. It is all around one of the
four pillars of government at that time—which are still there
and which include carbon capture and storage—trying to
decarbonise, in this case, fossil fuels, as the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, will know better than anybody. The second pillar of this
energy strategy was emission performance standards, which
are in the Bill. The third pillar was the carbon price floor,
which has already been delivered. In terms of
green taxes, we are already taxing output of carbon emission from
fossil fuels. That is practical decarbonisation. In addition, the
Government have introduced energy reduction through the Green Deal and
the energy 
<?notus-xml column=1337?>company obligation. As well as all these practical actions, do we need
another target? That is what I really want to look
at.</hs_para>

Government, there are differences not just between parties but between
departments. We have differences between the Treasury and DECC on
occasions, and perhaps BIS as well. There are also different directions
in which the two coalition parties look. Nevertheless, what the
coalition came together for was to provide a specific programme in
terms of government for the five years of this Parliament. A key part
of that concerned the economy and debt reduction. Another, which both
parties shared, was being a green Government with respect to the
environment, part of which is decarbonising. The agreement, willingly
entered into by both parties, called for a levy control framework that
allows contracts for difference and decarbonisation investment to work,
with some £7.6 billion by 2021. We have an agreement that the
energy company obligation, which is really important in terms of
households’ energy efficiency, stays at its present level until
the end of this Parliament. We have electricity demand reduction in the
Bill. We have an agreement at EU level that a 50% reduction of carbon
emissions by 2030 should be negotiated with our European partners. We
already have the carbon tax floor and we have emission performance
standards legislated for, we hope, when this Bill finally gets

important to make sure that through this Bill we deliver real,
practical, £100 billion-worth of investment decarbonisation, or
do we go for just another target? I look back at targets, whether they
were for fuel poverty being eradicated by 2010, which failed quite
considerably, or whether carbon emissions for 2010 were met—they
were not in terms of the original obligations. Do they make a
difference for business? Yes, I think that they do—the noble

not use the word “planning”, but
“foresight”. We have to recognise that the
investment requirements of our energy economy are not just
only long term. I remember talking here about setting down roads. We
know that we have a 2050 target, but frankly, at the moment, after 2020
there is no road map and no signposts or proper targets. We must

energy Bill ought to be an energy Bill concerned with how to provide
the people of this country—particularly the poorest—and
the businesses and industry of this country, with the cheapest possible
supply of reliable energy. Energy needs to be supplied cheaply,
efficiently and reliably. This Bill, not being an energy Bill, is about
how to supply energy expensively, inefficiently and unreliably. This

One needs to put the thing into perspective. The article states that,

Britain never adequately reckoned with the cost of its carbon

Krebs (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, cites
as his authority the <I>Financial Times</I>. I want to address the
question of energy prices by turning to the authority of the statutory
committee set up by this Parliament, the Committee on Climate Change. I
declare an interest as a member of that committee. Through rigorous
detailed economic analysis it has uncovered the facts. Between 2004 and
2012 the average household energy bill for a dual-fuel household that
uses electricity and gas increased by £520, from £610 to
£1,130. How much of that was caused by green, low-carbon
measures? The answer is that £30, or 6%, of the energy price
increases over that period was due to investment in low-carbon energy
generation. Another £45 was due to investment in energy
efficiency to help with the affordability of energy for vulnerable
consumers, and the rest was largely due to increases in the price of
gas<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:01:10"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

2013-14, the climate change committee has calculated that the increases
due to the renewables obligation, the feed-in tariff, the energy
company obligation and the carbon-price underpin between them amount to
1% of household energy bills. Let us look forward to 2020.
The climate change committee estimates that household energy bills will
be 10% higher due to low-carbon investment but—and this is an
important but—that 10%, which is small in relation to the
overall increase, could easily be offset by investment in energy
efficiency such as the installation of new boilers and energy-efficient
lighting, appliances, heating and insulation in homes.

free-market ideology that accompanied the privatisation of
Britain’s energy industry in the latter years of the Thatcher

warming and the effects of carbon emissions associated with fossil
fuels, which have been well understood. However,
notwithstanding its pieties in that respect, the Bill does very little
to promote the cause of climate protection. It poses some ineffective
and non-binding constraints on the rates of emission and, in truth,
will not help in reaching the targets set out in the Climate Change

Bill is attempting to appease a powerful faction within the
Conservative Party that is strongly opposed to any measures that might
be taken to staunch the emissions of greenhouse gases. There is solid
and highly disturbing scientific evidence that should alert every one
of us to the perils that we face through global warming. However, many
in the Conservative Party believe that they are as entitled to their
own contrary opinions on such matters as any of the scientists are to
theirs. The climate change deniers have a powerful ally in the
Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne. He envisages a dash for
gas based on fuel that might be conjured up by fracturing the ground on
which we stand. This vision has strongly influenced the Bill. Such a
dash for gas would utterly negate the purposes of the Climate Change
Act 2008, which proposed that the emissions of greenhouse gases in 2050
should be 80% lower than those in 1990.</hs_para>

powers to ensure that native suppliers would be fully exploited and
that our nuclear industry would stand a good chance of revival.
Instead, foreign suppliers will predominate and Britain’s
taxpayers will have the burden of supporting a much troubled French
nationalised industry.</hs_para>

Jenkin of Roding (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, has posed a fairly simple question to the House. There is
widespread agreement that we are aiming for a very substantial
reduction—80%—in carbon emissions by 2050. There is also
wide agreement, embodied in the Bill, that we should have a
considerable measure of decarbonisation by 2030. For the most part,
there is no dispute about that. When I have discussed this with some of
the companies outside, they all accept that that is what we are heading
towards. The question is whether we set the figure for 2030 now or wait
until 2016, as the noble Lord, Lord Teverson, suggested at the end of
his speech, a bit to my surprise. The argument for 2016 is really quite
strong. Under the Climate Change Act, this is all administered by the
climate change committee, of which my noble friend Lord Deben is the
chairman, and which is engaged in setting a series of five-year
ceilings as the measure of decarbonisation, leading to an 80% cut by
2050<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:10:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000113" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000113">The
fifth carbon budget comes up in 2016. It seems to be of the highest
importance that the figure agreed for 2030 should be consistent with
what the climate change committee comes to in 2016. I think that the
effect of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, would be to
set now what the figure would be—which would seem to make that
extremely difficult if not very doubtful. The noble Lord, Lord
O’Neill of Clackmannan, said, “Let it be done by
regulations and then you can change it”. I am not sure that is
not exactly where we are anyway. The climate change committee will be
setting a fifth carbon budget in 2016, which will of course be part of
the then Government’s policy. The question is whether we do it
now or wait until

<?notus-xml column=1345?>in passing, one thing that disturbs me. I read the short report from the
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The report of the
Nongovernmental International Panel on Climate Change also came into my
possession, which takes the view that the intergovernmental panel is
completely wrong. What disturbs me about these two bodies, and I will
leave it there, is that they do not argue with each other—they
abuse each other. One side calls the other climate change deniers and
that side calls the others back a bunch of government stooges. I find
that a very tiresome argument. If one is going to have an argument
about something, one should have a proper one, not one that just
descends into
abuse<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:13:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000115">One
of the most interesting meetings that I attended was the one chaired by
my noble friend Lord Deben and also, I think, by the noble Baroness,
Lady Worthington. One of the points that my noble friend made was that
the climate change committee has always been determinedly
technology-neutral. It does not seek to identify how a particular
target should be reached. It accepts the international figures and then
sets a British target for that. I have found that the people I talk to
are worried that this is all very well for this country but that Europe
has gone and set a technology target, with a figure for 2020—I
cannot remember the exact figure—that has to be covered by
renewables. The companies who are having to invest and develop their
investment programmes say, “Which are we to believe? Are we free
to work towards the 2030 target or do we have to pay attention to
this?”. The one thing I agreed with my noble friend Lord Lawson
about was when he quoted from that extremely interesting <I>Financial
Tim</I><I>es</I> article and said that if one thinks there is something
wrong—as I think there is with this technology target—the
right answer is to renegotiate. One of the questions that I therefore
ask my noble friend is: what are the chances of our going to the
European Union and saying, “Look, this 2020 target for
renewables is really quite inconsistent with the much broader target,
which will lead on to our 2050 target”? It seems to
me that it is an aberration, and that is unfortunate. We should
renegotiate that
directive.</hs_para><hs_time UID="1310284000223" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000223">4.15

He said that industry is clamouring to know now what the 2030 target
should be, and we had a bit of that with some of the earlier speakers
this afternoon. Indeed, he feels that there is a massive loss of

all the details are there now and they are becoming clearer. With each
new publication there is a new element of certainty, and the industry

May of Oxford (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I am a member of the
Committee on Climate Change and was a member of the committee of both
Houses that helped draft the legislation. I want to inject a fact or
two into the discussion. The first thing the Committee on Climate
Change did was to ask, “How much carbon, looking to 2050, do we
think the world can have put into the atmosphere without exceeding a
dangerous level of climate change?”. On that basis, we then
divided that total by an estimate of the population of Britain in 2050.
I would be the first to admit that that second figure is a little
uncertain but that was the basis of the ambition that we set and of the
overall target that was given for our goal for the end of 2050. We then
put the committee together and asked, “Feasibly, how do we think
we can get there?”. It was decided—I think
sensibly—that the first thing to do was to decarbonise power.
Once you do that, you can begin to do other, more difficult things.
When looking at decadal timescales, you can look at the possibility of
having surface transport primarily done by electricity and that will be
okay if we decarbonise the power supply.</hs_para>

goals. One of them was to come as close as we can by 2030 to
decarbonising the energy source through renewables and other things. It
was seen that the trajectory to that from 2010, which was when we were
talking, was still going to involve coal and gas—gas more
efficiently than coal. One thing that the noble Lord, Lord Lawson, and
I agree 
<?notus-xml column=1347?>on is that, given that we have to make that trajectory to 2030 and we
will still have to use carbon-producing products to generate the
energy, shale gas might be the best intermediate way to get
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000122" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000122">To
get there, we also need industry to see that we are committed to
getting there, to get it in turn preparing and talking of massive
investment, but on the premise that there will be support and
continuing commitment to those goals. This is primary legislation and
the goals that have been accepted by the Government are legally
binding, and I am in the habit of asking, on the Committee on Climate
Change and elsewhere, “What does legally binding mean?”.
I have not yet had a satisfactory answer. In so far as that phrase
means something to some people, we have a legally binding interim
target of decarbonising electricity by 2030.</hs_para>

stage of the Bill the Committee on Climate Change recommended that it
include not a vague statement of aspiration but the explicit wording
essentially equivalent to that of the amendment moved by the noble

committed to it but it would make common sense to vote for that
amendment, as it is consistent with the history and where the facts
lie. There are no two ways about

Ridley (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I declare my interests in various
forms of energy as listed in the register. I cannot declare the
probably seven-figure annual sum that I do not receive because I do not
allow wind turbines on my land in a very windy part of Northumberland.
I say that not to elicit the House’s sympathy, obviously, but to
emphasise the point that the Government would be right to resist this
amendment because it would hit the poorer even harder and reward the
rich even more, by encouraging enormously expensive renewable energy,
particularly the wind industry, particularly offshore wind.
Effectively, this amendment would lock in now the wrong technologies,
the ones that we know are inefficient in producing decarbonisation and
which are immensely
expensive.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000125" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000125">We
have heard a lot already today about the interests and needs of
producers of energy. As I said in Committee, it is much more important
that we think about the needs and interests of consumers of energy. We

who plan them; we build them for the people who use the electricity
that comes from them, and thereby provide jobs with that
electricity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000126">We
know three things now that we did not know at the start of the summer
when the Bill first arrived in this House. The first is that the public
are right royally fed up with rising energy bills and are not going to
take kindly to further increases, which is what we are talking about.
Secondly, wind in particular—as with a lot of
renewables—needs even bigger subsidies than we have been led to
expect. We were told that the strike price for offshore wind would come
down from around £150 per megawatt-hour to about £100.
That target has now been abandoned; it is coming down to £135.

May of Oxford:</Member></B> My Lords, what the noble Viscount, Lord
Ridley, has just said was factually incorrect. Climate change
temperature has fluctuations. The noble Viscount does not understand
the statistics properly; it is basically the same problem he had with
his thesis. It fluctuates; it goes up; it flattens a bit. But the

Ridley:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall repeat the statement. Later in
my remarks I shall come back and justify it. Climate change is
happening more slowly than expected. Far from locking in highly
expensive energy, as we are doing, we should be reconsidering the huge
cost that we are afflicting the most vulnerable with to comfort the
most comfortable. Offshore wind costs about four times as much as gas:
£270 per megawatt-hour is the total cost, including connections
and system costs, for offshore wind compared with about £66 for
gas. We are asking hard-working families to pay over the odds for their
electricity in order to provide subsidies to generate power and in
order to provide subsidies not to generate power. Last year, £30
million was paid to wind companies not to produce power at a time when
it was not
needed<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:27:29"></hs_TimeCode>.
Furthermore, we are asking them to pay over the odds to pay for the
short-term operating reserve, which is the balancing mechanism by which
we make up for the fact that wind is unpredictable. That consists
largely of fleets of diesel generators, which are being increased in
number by the national grid towards 8 gigawatts, combined with
open-cycle gas turbines—both of which are higher carbon than
combined-cycle and extremely
expensive<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:28:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000130" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000130">Moreover,
we are asking hard-working families to pay over the odds to upgrade the
grid and the network costs involved in that, specifically for wind. We
are asking them to pay for a carbon floor price, the specific purpose
of which is to make fossil fuels look less cheap compared with
renewables. Finally, we are asking them to pay over the odds to
compensate energy-intensive industries for these costs that we are
putting on to them. All of these things end up on people’s bills
at the end of the day and they are not paid through general taxation,
where the richest could pay more of them: they are paid through
people’s electricity
bills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:28:53"></hs_TimeCode>. Green

£13 billion, if you include system costs and VAT, will be spent
every year, compared with about £2.9 billion today, on the

have we achieved with the £2.9 billion we are spending this year
on subsidies to renewable energy? We produced about 1% of our total
energy from wind and solar this year. If you take total
energy—including transport, fuel and everything else—wind
provides only about 1% of the energy we use in this country. After
accounting for the back-up—wind needs about 80% back-up to make
sure that energy is available when it is not blowing—we have cut
our carbon emissions through the use of wind and solar by probably less
than 0.5%. That is surely a very small return on our

we are really doing is driving carbon emissions abroad, as has already

said that carbon production in Britain fell by 15% while consumption
rose by 20% between 1990 and 2005. We are consuming the carbon, it is
just that somebody else is producing it. As Professor Helm also said,
if we follow the Leader of the Opposition’s proposal and
decarbonise altogether by 2030, “we may actually make global
emissions higher than they would otherwise have been” because of
this effect. Unilateral decarbonisation is like building a flood bank

Those who have come to that conclusion are obviously reading a

the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says in its latest report
about the future, you find more uncertainty than six years ago. Let me
give 
<?notus-xml column=1350?>nine separate examples of ways in which the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change has retreated to a slightly less alarming and less
certain position than six years ago. First, it acknowledges the pause
or standstill in temperature for the first time, which has taken place
for either 15 or 17 years depending on whether you look at surface or
satellite
temperatures.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000140">Secondly,
it acknowledges for the first time since its report in 1990 that the
medieval warm period was at least as warm as today on a global level
and therefore that today’s temperatures are not unprecedented in
the last thousand years. Thirdly, it acknowledges for the first time
that Antarctic sea ice is slowly expanding not retreating, which was
not predicted by its models. Fourthly, it acknowledges that 111 of its
114 models overstated warming in the last 15 years.</hs_para>

that the range of equilibrium climate sensitivity is lower than it was
six years ago. It says that it cannot now give a central estimate,
whereas six years ago it gave a best estimate. Why can it not do that?
The average of 16 separate estimates of that quantity made by empirical
studies since 2011 is 60% cooler than the ECS that was assumed in the
IPCC models. The noble Lord, Lord May, says that it is important to
make a calculation of how much carbon we must produce by the middle of
the century, but that depends upon your estimate of equilibrium climate
sensitivity. If it turns out that it is as low as the range is now
suggesting, and as the latest studies suggest, that changes the
calculation
entirely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000142" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000142">The
sixth thing that the IPCC acknowledges is that transient climate
response is lower. That is the more immediate policy-relevant number
because it tells you how much warming actually happens by a particular
point in the future rather than what takes a lot longer later.
Seventhly, it acknowledges that sea-level rise, which is definitely
happening, is lower than some authorities, such as Professor Rahmstorf,
have tried to persuade us that it is. Eighthly, it says, using the
words “very unlikely”, which it specifically defines in
statistical terms, that a collapse of the Gulf Stream is
very unlikely, that a collapse of the west Antarctic
or Greenland ice sheet is very unlikely and that an
explosion of methane from clathrates on the ocean floor is very
unlikely.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000143" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000143">Ninthly,
it says that it has low confidence in a number of tipping points that
were previously thought to be possible concerns: the collapse of
tropical forests, of boreal forests and of the monsoon, an explosion of
greenhouse gases from the Arctic permafrost and an increase in
megadroughts. It says that it has low confidence in these things. These
are major retreats. We know that the harm being done by climate change
will arrive considerably later in this century. There is the harm being
done now by decarbonisation policies: biofuels driving people into
poverty, and wind costs driving up people’s energy bills and
causing them trouble in heating their homes.</hs_para>

an excuse to rethink this target, but the shale gas break-even price
has come down dramatically in the United States as a result of
increased experience of how to develop shale gas. Fields that were once
thought to be break even at $6, $8 or $9 are now breaking even at $3,
$4 or $5. Then if you add gas liquids—some fields have gas
liquids and they are much higher value—and so on, it is very
possible that we will see shale gas have the same effect on prices in
this country as we saw in the United States.</hs_para>

seeing increasingly erratic and extreme patterns of weather here in the

That was followed by 11 serious flooding events during the summer and
autumn. In March, the River South Tyne was flowing at 28% of its
average flow for that time of year; by June, two months later, it was
running at 408% of its average flow for that time of year. I cannot say
that the erratic weather patterns that we are now increasingly seeing
in the UK are directly attributable to climate change, but I can say
that this is precisely the sort of effect that climate science tells us
we are going to see an awful lot more of over coming decades unless we

looks as if we are heading for at least a 2 degree rise in global
temperatures, and probably more, and the consequences of that for
flooding, water supplies, agriculture, movement of population and human
health are incalculable. Therefore, it is important for all of us to do
what we can to take carbon out of our activities. Decarbonising energy
production over the next 20 years is not just a “nice

Deben (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, we should start by recognising that
the latest report of the IPCC is very clear. It is the product of the
world’s most distinguished scientists and is looked at by the
Governments of the world. The report is clearer than it has ever been
that climate change is happening and that it is largely being caused by
humankind. That is the summation. We could go through it and pick out
the bits we want in order to make our particular point, saying that the
position is worse or better than it seems. The truth is that the likely
increase in temperature will be within a range of between 1.5 and 4
degrees centigrade, which 
<?notus-xml column=1353?>is almost precisely the figure that the very first IPCC report put
forward. There is a continuity, and that continuity now seems to be
more certain.</hs_para>

carbon equivalents. In addition to that, there are the concerns related
to other climate-changing effects—not least the fact that we now
know that clouds
amplify<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:47:40"></hs_TimeCode> rather
than diminish the effects of climate change, unhappily for those who
used to put forward the argument that they were the future. We also
know there is a severe likelihood of melting permafrost having a
serious effect, in addition to methane. All these are in addition. We
do not know by how much, but we do know that they are adding to rather
than subtracting from, climate change.</hs_para>

accept is that most of those skilled in this matter are warning us that
climate change is a real danger. That puts those who disagree into
difficulty because what they are asking us to do is to bet on them
against those skilled in climatology and the like. They are asking that
we should accept their interpretation against that of the IPCC. They
may be right—I am not for one moment suggesting that they might
not be—but it would be the foolish father of a family, a foolish
government or a foolish company that bet the future not on the majority
view of scientists, but on the relatively small minority of those who
disagree. Therefore I am not surprised that more and more governments
around the world are taking this view, as the GLOBE report—I
declare an interest as its president—by the London School of
Economics shows. They recognise that it is not possible to ignore
climate change and still maintain their duty of care.</hs_para>

welcome the Government’s Energy Bill. As the Committee on
Climate Change will serve any Government to do their job properly, and
in speaking as its chairman I speak independently, I remind the House
that the Government have already committed £7.6 billion in order
to achieve what we need to achieve by 2020. In many ways, what the
Government have done has been remarkable. The question is therefore
whether the Committee on Climate Change is right in suggesting that a
carbon intensity target for 2030 is a sensible way forward. I put it to
the House that it is, for several clear
reasons<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:50:56"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that, having spent that £7.6 billion, if there is a
cliff at the end of 2020 so that people do not realise how we intend to
deal with things later, we will not get the investment we need and, in
particular, we will not get the supply chain investment that is crucial
for securing the jobs which should come from a green economy. This is
not a climate-change reason at all; it is a business reason. As
somebody who comes from the business world, it seems clear to me. The
letter in today’s <I>Financial Times</I>, if that is a popular
read at the moment, shows a large number of business people who are
making that point. It is certainly true that most of those who are
concerned with the industries we are talking about see it

so important is that statements made by prominent people unfortunately
appear to have caused some to fear that we will not keep to our direct
trajectory. I am not one of those; I am absolutely sure that we will.
My noble friend Lady Verma, her 
<?notus-xml column=1354?>team and the entire Government have made it clear that we have a
statutory requirement to deliver by 2050 an 80% reduction in emissions,
and that we will do that. I am therefore in no way concerned about
this, but a lot of businesses are. I had a phone call over the weekend
from a distinguished individual to ask whether I was sure that we are
still going to do these things. If he as a man of considerable ability
and an investor thought that, I can understand perfectly well why so
many others do. So the second reason is to ensure that

we need a non-prescriptive mechanism. I served my noble friend Lord
Jenkin for a long time as his parliamentary private secretary; I
acknowledge and admire him enormously. He is right to put his finger on
whether we need this in these circumstances, first, because of the
concern about the European Union renewables target. I admit that when
this Government came to power I tried to get them to go back on the
decision of the previous Government to sign up to a renewables target,
because I thought that it covered far too great an area. That was a
mistake. It was a misunderstanding of the difference between energy and
electricity and should not have been agreed to. However, we have it,
and all the pressures will be to have a bigger renewables target. If I
may for one moment lapse into party politics, I do not think that that
is a very Conservative way forward. I do not think that you should
choose winners in that way. It is one thing that worries me a bit about
nuclear energy, because you have to if you are going to have it at all.
That is why I am in favour of this non-prescriptive target. It merely
gives the level of decarbonisation that we will need in 2030 in order
to reach the 2050 target. Of course,
t<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:54:56"></hs_TimeCode>hose who do not
believe in any of this will be opposed to it, and therefore it would be
wrong of me to detail each of the differences that I have with those
who have spoken. In case anyone should need to know them, I will make
sure that the reasons why the interpretations of the documents are not
right are available to the whole House, and why the noble Lord, Lord
May, is
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:55:28"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000164" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000164">The
fourth reason why it is important to have this target is that it is the
only thing that is consonant and consistent with what the Government
are seeking to get in Europe. In other words, if we have this target,
it is possible for the Government to say, “We prefer this target
over a target for renewables”. Surely that is better for
Britain, better for science, better for the future, and better for
price. Furthermore, at the moment we are negotiating for a level of
ambition in Europe that can be met only if we have such a target, so
this fits in with the Government’s
demands<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:56:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310284000165" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#1310284000165">I
have two further things to say. First, the Government have, as you
would expect, put forward arguments against this amendment. I hope my

stand up. It is that, somehow or other, we cannot make this decision
until we know what is happening in the European Union. The Committee on
Climate Change took this argument very seriously. It spent a great deal
of time looking at it and concluded that, whatever possible likely
scenario happens in the European Union— 
<?notus-xml column=1355?>unless it goes backwards—this particular proposal fits.
Therefore, I do not think that we need to be concerned about
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:57:09"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

point. If climate change is dangerous, and all the evidence shows that
it is, what is the insurance worth? Everybody in this House has fire
insurance costing around £140 or £150 a year. We all know
that it is 99% likely that our house will not burn down, but for the
1%, we pay the premium because it is too frightening not to. We have
something here that is 95% likely, and the cost we are charging this
year is £60. By 2020, it will be £100. If we have the
carbon intensity target, to that £100 will be added £20 a
year. This is based on the most detailed and precise research. Frankly,
the figures that have been quoted elsewhere are not true. They come
from bodies like the TaxPayers’ Alliance, who want to have a big
figure in order to frighten people. I do not think that that is
helpful. You have sensible people on both sides—sensible people
who think this is not the right way forward and sensible people who
think it is the right way forward. However, let us not try to frighten
anyone with figures that are not

we want the jobs here, we need this amendment. If we want to reassure
the country and the world that we are serious and that they can place
their confidence and their business here, we need this target. If we
want to keep ourselves in line in order that we do not end up with an
impossible task later on, we need this target. Above all, what is the
downside? Actually, the Government know that they have to reach this
target. All they are doing is putting into legislation now—and
getting so much for it—what they know they have to do. Surely
the House should support the amendment on an all-party basis and make
sure that this good Bill becomes a better
one.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_28_PT_1/3428C0FA2A34185A62D963E030E34BEA64919733" __version__="1.8"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 October 2013">Monday,

Earl of Caithness (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I take a very different
view from my noble friend Lord Deben. I thought that his last comments
were quite inaccurate. He said that we will get jobs here because of
the amendment but the wind farms that proliferate in Scotland do not
bring any jobs here, as they are all made overseas. I have
talked to the companies that say that they need this
amendment in order to invest here. They are all worried about
investment, but not because they are worried about whether
this amendment will go through; they are worried about whether Britain
will remain part of the EU or not. That is where they will invest. They
are not worried about whether they will invest in a tiny little island
on the north-west coast of Europe; they will invest in Europe, and if
we are not part of Europe we can have as many amendments as
your Lordships like, but the investment will not come
here<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:00:34"></hs_TimeCode>. I think

was also confusing—as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Finsbury,
was confusing—to talk about climate change as though it was
something new. My ancestors sailed to Newfoundland and the new world
long before Columbus got there. They had settlements in Greenland.
Between that time and now the Tiber has frozen over, 
<?notus-xml column=1356?>and if the historians are correct, the Nile has frozen over. Climate
change has happened. If one wants to talk generally about climate
change, yes, we all agree that it is happening, has happened and will
happen in the future. The specific argument is about what percentage of
that climate change is related to the carbon emissions of the past 200
years or so, which is a different and much more specific

I address Amendment 1, I will chide the noble Lord, Lord

unfair to the House to put down a starred amendment on the first day of

amendment to be treated. None of us is discussing it; none of us has
been able to look at it and give it the attention it is due.

quite unnecessary to have a starred amendment for the first day of

turn specifically to the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh. I agree with him that shale gas is not a panacea, for two
reasons. As I said in Committee and in earlier debates on energy in
this House, the cost of extraction of shale gas will be considerably
more than most people realise. In this country it will be very hard to
be allowed to extract gas. There are all those who say, “We
mustn’t burn coal and gas—but you can’t do
anything that will make it better. If shale gas makes it better
we’re going to block the roads and stop the development and
research”. That will make it increasingly hard to try to develop
shale gas to its potential—to what it could do, regardless of

noble Viscount, Lord Hanworth, criticised the Government for putting
nuclear energy into the hands of two foreign companies. Who is to blame

all around the country, very low carbon—or, rather, with no
carbon emissions at all—and this amendment would not be
necessary. We have thrown away the lead we had in nuclear energy, which
was a huge mistake. Even in 2003 the Labour White Paper, quite rightly
condemned as a disaster by the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, last Thursday,
ruled out any option of nuclear. We have shot ourselves in the foot on

consequences if we go ahead by ourselves? Again, I disagree with my
noble friend Lord Deben on this. It will affect Europe because there
will be continued carbon leakage. There is no doubt, regarding
investment, that if people and companies look at this country and see
that the rules are tighter here than in the rest of Europe, they will

Donoughue (Lab):</Member></B> I have never spoken against a Labour
amendment in my 28 years in this House, but I propose to do so today
because I am troubled by this misguided amendment. I should make it
clear I am not a climate-change denier—an offensive word, from
which I have suffered. I am a questioner. I accept that the globe is
warming mildly, 0.8% of 1 degree in 131 years, although the surface
stopped warming 17 years
ago<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:08:54"></hs_TimeCode>. I accept
that the warming is almost certainly linked to carbon emissions and
human activity, and I support curbing those emissions in a measured
way. The questions that concern me are how much warming will happen,
how damaging it will be, how we react in our policies, and how
sensitive the climate is to carbon emissions. I note that this century
carbon emissions have rocketed, but there has been no further warming
of the surface of the globe.</hs_para>

weather, I say to my noble friend Lord Smith, for whom I have the
greatest respect and affection, that I believe the IPCC said it could
find no evidence that extreme weather was occurring globally. I am
troubled from a Labour position—not a denier
position—that reactive policy-making, as is the case with this
amendment, is not justified by the evidence, and I am troubled by the
consequences of that for ordinary people. These policies hurt the poor,
given rocketing energy prices, although there seems to be argument
about how much the relevant figure will be. The noble Lord, Lord
Turner, tried to set it very low. Last week I received an answer from
the Department of Energy and Climate Change that put a figure of
9<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:10:31"></hs_TimeCode>% on
green taxes. However, they will increase significantly by 2020. The
increases may not look much to noble Lords but will be painful for
ordinary people. Such 
<?notus-xml column=1358?>increases will hurt jobs as high energy costs make industry
uncompetitive. Indeed, Grangemouth stated that one of its reasons for
being unviable was the high cost of energy. Not much notice has been
taken of the fact that its rescue plan contained a proposal to build a
terminal to import shale gas from the United States. It is sad that it
has to import it from the United States. The greens, of course, oppose
shale

oppose the amendment because it entrenches the rapid switch to
inefficient and grossly expensive renewable energy sources.
I understand that those of a strong green faith—and we are
frequently dealing with faith—support this amendment. As has
been made clear, their main priority is the rapid decarbonisation of
our planet regardless of the costs. However, as a Labour person, I
believe that other priorities should be balanced with that—not
against it—such as protecting jobs and protecting the public
from fuel poverty. Under recent green energy policies, but not wholly
because of them, fuel poverty threatens to rise, affecting more than
6 million people. The figure will rise further if these
renewables policies are imposed to the extent

listened to the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, and read the briefing from my
Front Bench. I question at least three of its main arguments. The first
is that gas prices will remain very high and so renewables will not
seem expensive by comparison. However, we simply do not know what
energy prices will be. I do not share the certainty of the noble Lord,
Lord Oxburgh, in that regard. In 1974, I was in No. 10 when we were hit
by a 400% increase in energy prices which no one had forecast. In the
1980s, in the City I managed top energy analysts and they did not know
what would happen with energy prices, and, of course, firms such as
Shell and Centrica spend billions of pounds hedging because they do not
know<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:14:02"></hs_TimeCode>

mistake to do as is proposed in this amendment and further lock in the
commitment to the massive use of renewables at high prices with no
escape if, for instance, gas prices halve. I do not know what will
happen. I do not think that those who have put their name to this
amendment know either although they claim to. It is possible that shale
development could reduce gas prices, as it has in the United
States.<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:19:15"></hs_TimeCode> I am not
convinced by the opening dismissal of that on the basis that shale

assertion I question is that renewable prices will fall in the medium
term because greater efficiency will cut energy use. That may be but,
again, we do not know. I hope so, but it is
speculation. The Green Deal to increase efficiency of use, which
I support broadly—though not in all of its
implementation—is a testing point. However, according to the
department, only 54 households have signed up so far: not much
increased efficiency of use there. We need more flexibility in our
approach and, although I have rarely supported the proposals of a

assertion is that we must commit to huge renewable investments now,
with tight targets and huge subsidies. It has been quoted that business
is very keen to have this. Of course they are keen: I have
floods of leaflets through my door asking me to invest in these green
projects. As they say, this is a bonanza; we are guaranteed an annuity
of a huge real return. However, who pays for these huge subsidies? I
can tell you, and you know. If we stick to the current regressive
consumer subsidies through energy bills, it is
customers—especially the poor—who pay. Or, if we switch
to taxation and debt to pay them, it is the taxpayer and a higher
deficit pay. Neither of those courses is particularly attractive to me,

extreme green climate policies, the price paid, either way, comes soon,
higher and painfully while the alleged benefits, some of which may

that the Labour Party is now focusing successfully on cutting the cost
of living and even imposing an energy price freeze. The amendment will,

why I, as a Labour person, should support the amendment: it hits jobs
and is likely to increase fuel poverty. Politically, I am aware that

is not global warming we ought to fear but global freezing. I am old
enough to remember a lot of climate changes in my life and there seems
to be some sort of circle. They come around now and again. However,
suppose the people in the 1970s who said we are going to have a new ice
age are right. Then we would be wrong in trying to reduce. If the
warmists and the people who believe in carbon dioxide causing global
warming are right, we would need extra carbon dioxide to deal with the
ice age rather than less. This is becoming quite an issue. I read in

second thing I wanted to say is that it is entirely appropriate to have
this debate here. I ask noble Lords to set their minds back 200 years,
although that may not be possible. It was a whole series of British
innovations, by people who thought originally and did not accept the
limitations under which they worked at the time, which set off the
Industrial Revolution, which of course is largely responsible for
creating the world as we know it today. It is appropriate that we have
this sort of wide-ranging discussion because you could, in one sense,
say that our predecessors brought about the conditions which we now
have to take steps to
correct<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:31:00"></hs_TimeCode>. It is a

want to come back to the opening remarks of the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, where he implied that shale gas was not perhaps that
significant an issue. For me, disregarding the fact that the
amendment is only making two years’ difference in the way we
take our decisions, this is the reason why it should not in fact be
passed, The thing about shale gas is that it is very much an unknown
quantity: it could be a game-changer but it might not be. I do not
think we should hasten towards long-term decisions, which will set the
investment climate, unless we are fairly sure of the ground on which we
stand. Shale gas is not a British or a United States issue but a global
one. We know that there are large deposits in the Mediterranean and I
understand that there are large deposits in many parts of China. There
are presumably large deposits elsewhere in the world, so this is an
issue that we have to take care
of<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:32:08"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000012">So
far as I am concerned, shale has the potential—I would put it no
higher than that—to be a real interim technology that can change
the nature of the game. Some of the environmental lobbies do not like
it, as it is a fossil fuel. When I was first here, a Member of this
House at the time said to me that we should remember that all our
energy sources are nuclear. We can have our nuclear power station here
or we can have it 98 million miles away, but we should
remember, when we discuss fossil fuels, that they are nothing more than
geologically stored solar energy. Those who deride these technologies
need to put their thinking caps
on<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:33:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

shale gas is that it would enable a revolution in electricity
generation, because of not one but two factors. In conjunction with
carbon capture and storage, it should be possible to reduce carbon
emissions from electricity generation to almost, if not completely,
zero. However, much more important than that, the technology is very
clean. One of the things that appals me about our electricity
generating industry is that, historically, because it has been a pretty
dirty technology, it has had to be sited very far from large
communities and conurbations. With clean technology, we could site
power generation on the urban fringe, which could bring
about a revolution in power generation, because we could use the waste
heat productively in the community to heat homes. That is a major
consideration as far as I am concerned. It is all very well having a
nuclear power station out in the Severn estuary but it means that the
energy efficiency of that power station is somewhere between only
40% and 50%, rather like an internal combustion
engine. If we want to get efficient generation, we have to find a way
of using that waste heat. That is, in a sense, a red herring in terms
of the debate, but it is the reason why I do not think that these
amendments should pass. I think we need more time to find out what we
are really dealing

Worthington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, it is a great pleasure to
speak at the end of this debate—a wide-ranging debate, something
on which other noble Lords have commented. I am delighted to add my
name to the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, this afternoon.
I will not get drawn into the debate that we have had about the climate
science, because other noble Lords have done that far better than I
could: the noble Lords, Lord Smith of Finsbury, Lord May, Lord Krebs
and Lord Deben, have all, very clearly and lucidly, explained the dire
situation and the threats that we face with climate change. I am also
not going to comment on individual technologies, as it is very clear to
me that the debate we should be having today is about the principle of
decarbonisation, not about individual technologies. Nothing in any of
these amendments dictates that we use renewables, do not use shale gas
or use nuclear. They are entirely technologically neutral, which is one
of their great assets and benefits. It is fair to say that on this
issue we, as a party, and the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, are very close
to DECC Ministers. We are not here to debate whether or not we should
set a decarbonisation target but simply to debate when that target
should be set. The Bill has been amended during its passage to state
that a target will be set in 2016. The lead amendment is really about
timing, and I have a few words to say about why it is right to set that
target
now<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:36:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000015">The
main reason is that, without this amendment and without bringing
forward the setting of this target, the Bill largely lacks purpose. It
is an enabling Bill which includes many measures that enable the
Secretary of State to do things at his or her own discretion, but does
not require anybody to actually do anything very specific. Therefore,
despite the fact that we have been deliberating the Bill for many
months—indeed, years now—investors are not celebrating
the fact that it is nearly complete and are not yet clear about what
the Bill actually delivers. There is still insufficient clarity 
<?notus-xml column=1363?>of purpose, too much doubt about the Government’s commitment to
cleaning up and modernising our electricity sector, and too much
control now being given to the Government, who, unfortunately, are
equivocating about the need for low-carbon investment. The Bill does
not enable enough competition to ensure a broader range of projects and
investors are delivered by it. The Bill is an enabling Bill and lacks a
clear purpose. The amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, is
intended to address that
failing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:37:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000016" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000016">I
have no doubt that the Minister will say that it is not targets, in and
of themselves, that will drive investment. The noble Lord, Lord
Teverson, has already indicated that that is what he believes. That
would be true if we could point to detailed elements of the Bill that
gave certainty. The mechanisms that the noble Lord, Lord Teverson,
alluded to, which I have no doubt the Minister will also allude to,
including the contracts for difference, the strike prices and the
capacity mechanism, are not being celebrated by industry; in fact,
quite the opposite. We are hearing very strongly that, for example, the
strike prices being offered for offshore wind do precisely the opposite
of enabling investment and actually deter it. The same is true of the
capacity mechanism, which we were told would bring forward investment
in gas power generation. Again, this part of the Bill is not being
celebrated. It is being lamented because it does not appear to give the
certainty investors
need<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:38:58"></hs_TimeCode>. We need to
see action, not just targets, but unfortunately, without a target, it
seems clear that action will not be

is a modest and very moderate amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh,
could, had he wished, have put in place an amendment that dictated a
target in the Bill. He has not done that; he has merely asked that the
target be set by April next year. One might say, “Well, of
course that’s sensible”, but in other parts of the Bill
there are numerate and precise numbers which, when the Government see
fit to try to encourage gas investment, they seem perfectly happy to
put on the face of the Bill. I am alluding to the energy performance
standard, which is incredibly prescriptive and detailed. The noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has not followed that; he has made a moderate and
necessary amendment and I hope that the Members of this House will find
support for
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000018" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000018">If we want
to get to the real reason why this amendment is potentially going to be
blocked by the Minister, it is not because we do not have a fifth
carbon budget. It is absolutely clear to me that if the noble Lord,
Lord Deben, as the chair of the CCC, can advocate the setting of this
target, then there is clearly no link between the need for a carbon
budget and the need for a carbon intensity target. The two things do
very different jobs, and it is merely a ruse to state that we must wait
for it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000019" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000019">It is
also wrong to say that we cannot move without Europe. The situation in
Europe is that we are being asked to consider a renewables target, as
many noble Lords, including the noble Lords, Lord Jenkin and Lord Deben
have alluded to. We may not want a renewables target in 2030, but we
may be dictated to by Germany to have one, which seems absolutely
certain that that is what it wants. If we had a 
<?notus-xml column=1364?>decarbonisation target set early, we could then influence that debate
and prevent the setting of a technology-specific target in favour of a
decarbonisation
target.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000020" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000020">It
seems clear that these reasons for opposing these moderate amendments
are not the real ones. The real reason is that there is a complete lack
of cohesion within the Government on whether we want to seriously
pursue our climate change targets. One need look no further than Prime
Minister’s Question Time just a week ago when a panicked Prime
Minister was making up policy on the hoof. Without a real response to
Labour’s challenge on how to bring prices down, he has now
started blaming green electricity, or indeed social, environmental and
energy-efficiency policies for those price
rises.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000021">I
reassure the noble Lord, Lord Donoughue, that it is
absolutely consistent for us to call for a decarbonisation
target while wanting to see changes to the way that our electricity
market is run. We have a regulator that is not fit for purpose, and an
oligopolistic energy market that needs to be broken open so that we can
have true competition and transparency and see that we are not
overpaying for the electricity that is
generated.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000022" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000022">The
real nub of this debate is: why can we not set the target now? Why are
the Government insisting that it be set after the next election? It is
purely political expediency because they have been unable to arrive at
a sensible position in government. I really hope that Liberal
Democrats—who have this as part of their party
policy—will stand up and vote for this amendment because it is
absolutely clear that, although many things are being attempted with
this Bill, the bargain that has been struck is not yet balanced.
The levy control framework that has been wrested from the
Treasury is only a promissory note. That £7.6 billion
that may be spent on clean energy will be spent only if strike prices
are agreed at the right level. If all of the control that is being
given to government means that the strike prices are continually set at
the wrong level, we will see no investment and we will have sacrificed
clarity of purpose for a bargain which will not ultimately deliver what
I think the Liberal Democrats believe it
will.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000023" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000023">As I
said, I am not going to get involved in the debate on climate science.
However, I will say that if we are thinking that this amendment will
somehow damage our competitiveness, that somehow Europe and the UK are
out on their own tackling climate change, then that is absolutely
incorrect. The most dynamic economies—China, Germany,
California, South America—all now accept that the only future
for energy is clean energy, and that we must act together to globally
decarbonise. I am sure that we will see in Paris in 2015 the passing of
an international framework that will demonstrate that we are not alone
and that the big economic powerhouses of the US and China are behind
this too. We will therefore move forward in tandem and it will not be a
race to the bottom as some would
prefer.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000024" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000024">In the
other place, this amendment was lost very narrowly; had 12 votes gone
the other way, it would have been put into the Bill. That, of course,
is in a situation where there is a large government majority. 
<?notus-xml column=1365?>Here, in this House, the balance of power is such that on issues of
great importance we can send a strong signal to the Government that

important responsibilities. It is not something that should be rushed

Amendment 2, I fully agree with noble Lords that there
should be a role for the Committee on Climate Change. In line with its
responsibilities under the Climate Change Act, it is due to provide
advice on the level of the fifth carbon budget. This covers the 2030
period. This analysis is perfectly sufficient to advise on a
decarbonisation target range and it is therefore unnecessary to include
further provisions in the
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000034" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000034">Amendment
2A, tabled by the noble Lord, Lord O’Neill, proposes setting
annual carbon intensity limits on electricity suppliers. I do not
support this amendment for three key reasons. First, the government
reforms in the Bill support market-based mechanisms to incentivise a
cost-effective transition to low-carbon power. Introducing an annual
carbon limit on suppliers would be contrary to this approach. Secondly,
the proposal would introduce confusion around accountability. The
Government’s provisions clearly place legal responsibility for
meeting the target range on the Secretary of State. This position
should be maintained since it is he or she who is responsible for
setting UK energy policy and is ultimately accountable to Parliament.
Lastly, this is a blunt instrument which could have unintended
consequences. We are not convinced that the proposal would not
undermine our security of supply objectives. We are also concerned that
the amendment may lead to an increase in consumer bills if the costs of
compliance are passed on from energy suppliers to consumers.</hs_para>

willing to accept these amendments today. However, we considered the
amendment tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, in Grand
Committee. This proposed that the Secretary of State explain the
actions to be taken to stay on track to meet the target over time. The
Government support the aim of transparent reporting and I therefore
commit to the House that, where carbon intensity is reported to have
increased year on year for three consecutive years, the Government will
explain the reasons why, and, where appropriate, report additional
actions to address it within the annual statement of grid carbon
intensity.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102823000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000036">In
conclusion, I hope that noble Lords can see the drawbacks of rushing to
set a target next year. We want a much more measured approach. We all
want to see decarbonisation continue—and this Bill enables
that—but we must all be mindful that any targets set now will
impact on consumer bills. Without having the more detailed information
that is needed across all sectors, and without looking at our position
against our European partners and more widely globally, setting a
target would put us in isolation and make us uncompetitive against our

Oxburgh:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank all those who have participated
in this very interesting discussion. I apologise for the fact that what
I had intended to be a rather narrow, technical discussion has turned
into a debate that has been much more like a Second Reading.
Nevertheless, I think it has done a great deal to clear the air. I am
extremely sensitive to the question of consumer prices and there is a
real debate to be had about to what extent some of the measures that we
have been talking about should go on to energy bills and to what extent
they should be borne by general taxation. I am not taking a position on
that but it is well worth
discussing.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000040" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0001.htm#13102823000040">I

speeches that have been made, from whichever side of the

things about this Bill that I do not like but we have to have a Bill
and we have to have it urgently. However, I think his cover is blown:
on the basis of his comments today, we can be pretty sure that he is
moonlighting as a leader writer for the <I>FT</I>. I also agree with
those noble Lords who have questioned the overly prescriptive nature of
the EU targets. We could well do without them and I would like to see
the Government do what they can to renegotiate or indeed disregard
them. On the other hand, to believe that what I and my co-proposers
have suggested today will have any additional
impact on consumer bills beyond that to which we
are already committed through existing agreements is a

today. We know what the committee expects and what its forward look

Whitty (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I do not think that this issue
will take us quite as long as the previous debate. Indeed, it could be
disposed of relatively straightforwardly as the Government could quite
easily adopt this amendment. Frankly, they would be very wise to do so.
If the Minister cannot do that, she can at least indicate that she will
bring forward an equivalent but better drafted amendment at Third
Reading.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000047">This
amendment concerns the issue of fuel poverty and its relativity to
electricity market reform. Noble Lords will recall that when the Bill
went through the House of Commons and first reached this House there
was hardly any direct reference to fuel poverty in it—a glaring
omission. The organisations concerned with fuel poverty and the people
who suffer from it thought that was a serious omission and quite
shocking in many ways. But we have moved on from that: in Clause 136,
much later in the Bill, the Government have come up with a provision
requiring them to provide a strategy on fuel poverty that will apply to
the whole range of energy
policies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000048">There
are those who have doubts about the coalition Government’s
commitment on this front. There has not been a great track record on
fuel poverty so far. The hesitation and delay in bringing fuel poverty
into this Bill has been worrying, as has the recent furore within the
Government. As far as one can make out from the various statements by
the Prime Minister and Secretary of State, there is still an argument
going on in the Government. Many in the Conservative Party appear to
have in their sights not only green levies in the strict sense of the
word but also those levies that provide for resources to improve the
energy efficiency of the homes of the fuel poor. I will be generous
today and accept that the Government have agreed that a new strategy is
to be provided, one which this Bill will give legislative requirement
for. We can have a substantive discussion on fuel poverty at that point
in the procedure of the Bill, sometime next
week.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000049">The
point today is that the Government have inserted in the clause that we
have just dealt with that fuel poverty is one of the matters that
Ministers must have in mind when setting decarbonisation targets. In
relation to the electricity market reform, there is no such reference.
I suggest that reference could be made most appropriately here in
Clause 5. Clause 5 stipulates the issues that have to be taken into
account in electricity market reform: decarbonisation, referencing the
Climate Change Act, prices for consumers both domestic and industrial,
and energy security. The environmental 
<?notus-xml column=1372?>and economic dimensions of electricity market reform are there but the
social dimension—that of fuel poverty—is
omitted<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:15:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102823000117" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000117">6.15

that Clause 136 is part of the Bill—whether or not we improve it
when we get to that point—surely we should now make sure that
the Bill’s major intervention in the market, the complete reform
of the electricity part of the market, is stipulated. We can obviously
have the substantive arguments on Clause 136 later but that
clause’s very existence and the Government’s acceptance
of the need for it must mean that the social dimension of electricity
market reform should be recognised and reflected at this
point.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000051">It
would be sensible for the Government just to accept this amendment,
although they could argue that it should be in both parts of Clause 5
rather than just one. It would be equally sensible if the Minister told
me that she would come forward with a much better amendment at Third
Reading. But, given the logic of what is now the Government’s
point of view and for the House to recognise the importance of tackling
fuel poverty as an equal part with the other strategic objective of the
energy policy, we should adopt something like this amendment. I beg to

Maddock (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have great sympathy for the
words spoken by the noble Lord. He and I and one or two others in this
House have campaigned on fuel poverty for a number of years, although
he will remember that, when as a Minister he wrote his draft fuel
poverty strategy, he hoped to eradicate it by 2010. That indicates what
a difficult issue this is. I am grateful to the Government for, after
cross-party lobbying, putting into the Bill a strategy for fuel
poverty. I am very pleased about
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000053" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000053">This is
very pertinent at the moment. I do not know if noble Lords noticed that
as the storm went through the temperature dropped. I only just made it
in on my train today. As I walked across, I could feel the temperature
dropping. Elderly people particularly are getting very worried about
how they will pay their fuel bills this winter. We know but many do not
understand that if you are older and have heart problems, problems with
blood circulation and so on, you do not need to get very cold for it to
have a serious
effect.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000054" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000054">I have
campaigned on this issue for as many years as I care to think about. In
my 20s, I lived in Stockholm in Sweden where pensioners did not die in
wintertime because they were too cold. They did not have arthritis.
They lived in properly heated houses. Here we are in 2013 and we have
still not managed to achieve that. I recognise that it is a very
difficult problem but I hope that my noble friend can at least give us
some warm words in response to the noble Lord, Lord Whitty. Many noble
Lords care passionately about this issue. It is time, as one of the
richest nations in the world, that we dealt with

O'Neill of Clackmannan:</Member></B> My Lords, I start by declaring an
interest: I am a vice-president of National Energy Action and the
president of Energy Action Scotland. The Government have made some
moves on 
<?notus-xml column=1373?>this issue in the course of the Bill’s passage, but it would help
if they would add to the list of objectives they have set themselves
the one concerning fuel poverty mentioned in this amendment tonight.
That would be a signal that this is not an issue of party conflict, and
indeed that the Government have recognised that one of the deficiencies
in the Bill was that insufficient attention was initially given to fuel
poverty.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000056" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000056">Now
that we have had recognition, we can probably argue about the niceties
when the appropriate time comes. We are all in favour of the earliest
possible elimination of fuel poverty. It is not just about prices. It
is about handling our grossly inadequate housing stock. Before too long
we may well have to look afresh at the Green Deal that at the moment
has, as far as I know, attracted something like 57
successful completions—one for every one of Heinz’s
varieties; that is perhaps all that one could say about the proposal.
People may find the money and find it attractive to accept the Green
Deal at the 7.5% interest that is being charged, but I very much doubt
it.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000057" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000057">More has
to be done on this. It would be helpful to have a clear indication that
an opportunity is available with this amendment to put in the Bill, as
one of the overarching targets of the Government’s energy
policy, that we should as a high priority be able to eliminate fuel
poverty. If we all agree on it, why is it not there? It is not a
particularly controversial amendment. It is one that would enhance the
credibility of the Bill and make easier the passage of future elements
in it, which I am sure that the Minister is looking forward to bringing
before this

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, for
his amendment and all noble Lords who have taken part in this short but
important debate. It gives me an opportunity to lay out the
Government’s objectives for reform throughout the development of
the EMR proposals. These objectives have been set out in the published
documents, from our White Paper in July 2011 and within Clause 5, to
reflect our aims of reform. This does not mean that other aims, such as
minimising fuel poverty, are not important. I agree with noble Lords
that this area is incredibly important to us all. As outlined in Clause
5(2)(d), the Secretary of State will have regard to the likely cost of
electricity to consumers. This means all consumers, including the fuel
poor.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000059" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000059">Our
analysis suggests that, as a result of EMR, household electricity bills
will be on average around 9%, or £63, lower per year over the
period 2016 to 2030, relative to what they would have been if
decarbonisation were achieved through existing policy instruments. The
impact of EMR will be to reduce fuel poverty compared to what it would
have been without those policies in
place.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000060" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000060">However,
we should not be complacent. With or without EMR, electricity prices
are likely to increase over time due to rising fossil fuel prices and
the rising cost of carbon. This is why we have in place a strong
package of measures to support low-income and vulnerable households
with their energy costs. The energy company obligation ensures that
help goes to low-income and vulnerable households to enable them 
<?notus-xml column=1374?>to heat their homes more affordably on a long-term basis. Through the
affordable warmth and carbon-saving communities obligations, we
anticipate that support should reach around 230,000 low-income
households each year. In addition, this winter around 2 million
households will get help under the warm home discount scheme, including
over 1 million of the poorest pensioners, who will receive £135
off their electricity
bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000061" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000061">In
the last financial year, winter fuel payments helped over 12.5 million
older people in over 9 million households with their fuel bills,
providing between £100 and £300 tax-free to help pay for
heating bills. During the same period, 5.8 million cold weather
payments were made, targeted at those households that are most
vulnerable to the cold. This Government are committed to helping the
fuel poor, now and in the future. That is why earlier this year I
proposed amendments to the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act, to
put in place a new, rigorous and flexible framework for measuring the
Government’s progress in tackling fuel poverty in England. As we
move forward with ensuring a safe low-carbon future we must be
absolutely sure that we do not leave the fuel poor
behind.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000062" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000062">The
noble Lord, Lord Whitty, mentioned the Prime Minister’s
announcements last week on green taxes and the review of their impact
on the fuel poor. The Government are looking at how to get
people’s energy bills as low as possible to help the very
families to which the noble Lord refers. We are already increasing
competition by bringing new players into the market to offer consumers
real choice. The most vulnerable are getting direct help with their
bills this winter. We will continue this work to make sure that
consumers get a better deal. No one is talking about changing support
for large-scale renewables or feed-in tariffs. We want to make sure
that those who need help get help. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord
Whitty, finds my explanation reassuring and on that basis will withdraw

taxpayer-funded. For the first time in 30 years we are without a
taxpayer-funded scheme to deal with fuel poverty. In so far as the
objection to the ECO and other green tariffs is valid, it is partly
because they are made on a poll-tax and not a progressive-taxation
basis.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000066" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000066">While
the Government’s strategy has some commendable features that I

the failure of

noble Baroness, Lady Maddock, said—back in 2000 to eliminate
fuel poverty in general. It was actually by 2016 rather than 2010 so we
still have two years to do it, but we definitely need a new strategy,
which Clause 136 recognises. In view of how the Minister has portrayed
the current schemes dealing with fuel poverty as being adequate, I

making: electricity is the main form of energy that the fuel poor use.
They rely on it disproportionately for their heating. Any electricity
market reform part of this Bill should reflect that interest. The way
that we deliver electricity, the choices that we make in terms of the
source of that electricity and the kind of tariffs and levies that we
impose on that electricity make an enormous difference to the way that
they impact differentially on the fuel poor. It is correct that we are
concerned about the cost to consumers in general—that is already
in the Bill—but there is a differential effect depending on the
nature and the mix of the policies that fall on the fuel poor. Before
we leave electricity market reform, that should be reflected
there.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000068" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000068">I shall

House will realise that this is an exceedingly complicated Bill. Anyone
coming to it for the first time would recognise that. At the heart of
it are the Government’s proposals for electricity market reform.
The objectives were mentioned in the previous major debate. They are
security of supply—the lights must not go out—support for
low-carbon generation and affordable prices for consumers. From the
outset, Ministers have been determined to say that to achieve these
objectives, tougher competition is going to have to come. It is true
that the regulator, Ofgem, has had some responsibility for this, but
the general perception has been that it has not been as effective as it
might have been.</hs_para>

friend the Secretary of State, Ed Davey, mentioned a problem on
“Newsnight” the other day. He said, “We need more
competition … We think the big six have been a real
problem”. I have the figures. The big six have no less than 92%
of the supply to consumers. The remaining small companies have a mere
8%. Generation is nearly as bad. It is an oligopoly. That is what we
are faced with. I do not believe that existing arrangements for dealing
with competition are strong enough, so there was a very positive

take some time and involve not only Ofgem, the regulator, but the
Office of Fair Trading and the Competition and Markets Authority. I

amendments in this group are tabled in the names of my noble friend

with which I am chiefly concerned is Chapter 3 of Part 2 which
introduces the capacity market. I briefly describe that as a
managed-auction system to give clear incentives to generators to invest
in new capacity. This can mean keeping open plant that might otherwise
have been closed, bringing into production plants that have been
mothballed—there is a good deal of that at the moment—or
building new plant. It can also include measures to reduce
demand.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102823000074" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000074">The
capacity market offers a real opportunity for Parliament to give the
industry the opportunity to get more competition. That is what the
Prime Minister was talking about when he said he wanted new
companies—he was absolutely right—new entrants and
smaller independent generators. They struggle to compete with the big
six. Unlike the big six, which have strong balance sheets, smaller
companies have to raise funds from the market for their investment.
Unless they can see a reasonable prospect of a decent profit, they will
not be able to do so. Investors will not come forward. That is the
purpose of the capacity market; it is to give them the incentive to do
that.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000075" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000075">One
would have thought that if everyone really wants more competition, it
would be in the Bill. Yes, it is; there is quite a lot in the Bill.
When you look at other clauses in the Bill—in particular Clause
47, dealing with power purchase schemes, Clause 127, dealing with the
strategy and policy statement and Clause 132 on the modification of
supply licences—they are specifically for the Secretary of
State, and in all 
<?notus-xml column=1377?>that, he has to promote competition. But when the Bill comes to the
capacity mechanism, for some reason—and I have to confess that I
had some difficulty understanding what it is—the competition
duty does not apply to his role as the official with responsibility for
the capacity market. That is the only instance in the Bill where there
is no obligation on a Minister to be responsible for promoting
competition. Yet the Secretary of State is in overall charge of the
capacity market. Why? What is the difference?</hs_para>

done very well trying to spell out to the industry the complex details
of the structure of electricity market reform: the contracts for
difference, the capacity market and all the other features. They are
not all quite there yet, but they are nearly there. The object of the
exercise is quite clearly to create conditions where investors,
particularly smaller and independent investors, can raise money in
order to invest in the additional capacity which we certainly need and
which will help consumers because it will bring more competition. It is
not quite true that they have yet succeeded in doing that. The terms
set out for the operation of the community charge—I perhaps do
not need to go into detail—have been described to the Minister,
who has been very good and met the people concerned, but they are not
yet sufficient to enable them to do that. They will have the objective
of doing it, but nothing will be achieved. Therefore, there have to be
changes.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102823000077" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000077">I
have heard it said that the changes will have to be for the
regulations, but as the House well knows, if regulations come before
the House, they cannot be amended. They can be either rejected or
accepted. That is not very satisfactory. Therefore, we must have clear
authority imposed upon the Secretary of State to run the regulations in
such a way that they generate the competition they want. That will
require some changes in what has already been distributed and made
clear to the industry. Ministers must be under a clear statutory duty
when exercising their responsibilities for the capacity market to do so
positively to promote competition. That is the simple purpose of
Amendment 4, which adds to Clause 5 a sixth duty to promote
effective competition in the several activities set out in the
amendment. The other two amendments we have tabled, Amendments 42 and
43, specifically make this duty effective for the purposes of the
capacity market set out in Chapter 3 to make it explicit that the duty
for promoting competition covers Ministers as well as the regulator,
Ofgem. Taken together, these amendments would enable potential
investors to insist that the regulations and rules are drafted so they
really will enable independent generators and new entrants to raise the
funds they will need to invest in the new capacity in competition with
the big six. Last week, the Prime Minister said he wanted new
companies. This is the way to get them.</hs_para>

to the proposed high-level review. The first auction for the capacity
market happens next year. For that to go ahead, the regulations have to

be too late. I hope that when my noble friend replies to this debate,

Broers (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I wish to speak in support of this
amendment. I recognise that the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, is applying it
mainly to the capacity issue. I wish to address a very specific, simple
point with respect to the operation of contracts for difference. In
order to attract investment, this Bill allows—almost
encourages—electricity suppliers to pass on to consumers the
difference between the strike price and the reference price should the
strike price exceed the reference price. However, there is nothing in
the Bill to ensure
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:49:27"></hs_TimeCode> the
suppliers return money to consumers should the reference price exceed
the strike price. This might well be the case should the price of gas
continue to rise, as several noble Lords, including my noble friend
Lord Oxburgh, have suggested it may.</hs_para>

discussed this with me and said it was the Government’s position
that intervention was unnecessary as the market should ensure that
suppliers reduce their charges in order to remain competitive. I am not
fully convinced of this and favour a specific requirement that
suppliers should return what might be
described<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:42:56"></hs_TimeCode> as a
windfall profit to consumers if the reference price exceeds the strike
price. The noble Lord’s amendment at least requires the
Secretary of State to have regard to the desirability of promoting
effective competition wherever appropriate. In this case, it would
surely be appropriate. How else can we protect the
consumer<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:43:24"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102823000082" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000082"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lord Deben" PimsId="5754" UID="13102823000560" xid="2031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102823000560">Lord

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:43:15"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I very
much like the thrust of this amendment and I hope the Government will
take it seriously. I would like it to have included the issue of how
one generates more competition. Interestingly, at least half of
Germany’s renewable energy is generated by municipalities,
co-operatives and individuals. That means that there is very widespread
support for renewables, leading to some real competition. That is why
the big boys are increasingly angry about renewables—they are
bringing the price down and they are serious competition.</hs_para>

is difficult to see, as the Government have admitted, the sort of
competition among the six that we would expect. I notice that the
Opposition are now seeking to make significant changes on this, but one
must admit some of the things that have gone wrong are the very changes
they made last time. I think there is a certain cross-party
understanding that things are not as they ought to be. The Prime
Minister, I understand, has said he wants the six to become 60, and I
notice that the Minister for Energy wants 600. That is certainly much
closer to what I would like because this is a way in which the public
as a whole could have a greater say in the way electricity is produced
and would be more supportive of a much more competitive
market.</hs_para>

they accept this amendment or not, I hope that the Government will
recognise that if we could only achieve a more competitive system, it
would help explain to people the real costs of electricity. One of the
difficulties is that we are forgetting that the biggest cost is
actually for gas, so we are all talking here about what are in that
sense marginalities. Therefore, achieving competition so that people
feel there is a good reason to reduce their bills would be very
helpful.</hs_para>

is that not one of the six has suggested that this is the moment to get
new customers by not putting their prices up. They have all merely
said, “everyone else is putting their prices up, so we’ll
put them up as well”. That suggests we do not have quite the
competitiveness that we want. The Prime Minister has made that point
and the Opposition feel it too, so we should consider this as a very
real issue in a way that does not just encourage another few big or
even medium-sized companies. I want to see a world in which it is much
more likely that people come into the industry because it is at that

be said in favour of these amendments concerning competition has
already been said and as a co-signatory I very much to support them.
However, I want to underline the fundamental point involved. It has
become obvious to anyone reading newspapers in recent months that the
electricity industry 
<?notus-xml column=1380?>needs a huge amount of investment. In Europe it amounts to trillions of
euros, and in the UK it is hundreds of billions of pounds. This
investment is needed for generation, transmission, distribution and
supply. If we do not have that investment, to believe some of our
journalistic forecasters, we are likely to get power cuts with all the
economic and social tragedies which that might involve. This investment
cannot be provided by the government. It has to be provided by the
private sector; that is, you and me or, rather, our pension funds in
most
cases<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:50:12"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

which anyone reading our newspapers in recent days and weeks will have
come to a conclusion is that the oligopoly of the big six is not the
political flavour of the month. While being aware that the root of the
problem is the rise in the price of gas—I was going to say
feedstock—there is something to be said for the fact, which I
read in a newspaper, that this oligopoly has some sort of stranglehold.
We have a vertically integrated oligopolistic situation within our
electricity industry, as the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, has pointed out.
If you wish to deal with this stranglehold, it is crucial that you
stick to the golden rule of in no way deterring investment in the
panoply of the electricity industry. Investment is crucial. Either
freezing electricity prices or putting a windfall tax on the big six

figures addressing the price rises which we have all seen in the press,
showing that the wholesale costs contribute only about an additional
£10 to household charges. This means that that element of the

Earl of Caithness:</Member></B> My Lords, my noble friend Lord Jenkin
has yet again put his finger on a hugely important issue, but it is a
little bit of motherhood and apple pie. We all want competition and
there is no disagreement about that. Indeed, the Bill is all about
competition, and the Government’s policy that has already led to
more competition. It is worth remembering that in 2000 there were 14
major energy suppliers, but by 2010, within 10 years, they had shrunk
to six. In the past two years, seven more energy suppliers have joined
the market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:00:24"></hs_TimeCode>. The
mere fact of what the Government are doing has already started to
improve the position with regard to competition. Therefore, the
question is: how do we expand that without in any way damaging the
Bill<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:00:42"></hs_TimeCode>?</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000003" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000003">This
part of the Bill covers the trilemma which I mentioned on the first
amendment that we debated. It covers the core matters of
decarbonisation, security of supply and least cost. It is a very
difficult balance to get right. As such, I think that this part of the
Bill was quite well framed. It seems to be the wrong place to bring in
something about competition when the whole Bill is about competition.
It could also open up opportunities for other amendments such as
securing the efficiency of the rural economy by having cheap energy.
There are many other things you could add to this list once you start

leads me back to the question of how we get more competition without
damaging the Bill. I would ask my noble friend Lord Jenkin: what is the
situation where there is little competition? I am particularly keen on
tidal energy. Living beside the Pentland Firth for the part of my life
when I am allowed out of this place, I think there is huge potential
for energy generation there. However, if I set up an energy company to
try to exploit that, and the noble Lord down in Sussex set up a
company, would he be able to say that he did not get a fair crack of
the whip because there was not enough competition? If that is the case,
what happens if he goes to judicial review on the wording of this
amendment? That will only delay matters. My real concern is that we
might be introducing something here that could delay the much-needed
investment about which the noble Lord, Lord Cameron, and I were given a
lot of evidence when we sat on the sub-committee together and which he
has expanded on tonight. I agree with him totally.</hs_para>

concern is that this opens up the potential for a legal challenge. What
about nuclear? As I said on Amendment 1, we were the world leaders, but
now we have to go overseas. Can that be a possibility for a legal
challenge? I would say to my noble friends Lord Jenkin and the Minister
on the Front Bench that, since we all agree on this, can we somehow get
it into the Bill? This is the wrong amendment in the wrong place, but
the principle is absolutely right. Can we have a form of wording that
gives effect to competition but which does not open loopholes that
those who dislike a particular form of energy or want to delay a scheme

favour of the spirit of the amendment proposed by the noble Lord, Lord
Berkeley, about the vertical integration of this industry. It has
seemed to me over the past 12 months in particular that there has been,
if I may say, a growing corporate arrogance in the energy industry.
Power seems to have gone to the heads of many of those six
organisations. They feel that they can do what they like to their own
customer base and that they do not have to pay much regard to

was particularly struck by this one evening when I visited my 94
year-old mother. She had just had a letter from British Gas which said
that she would have to pay an increase of 10% on her bills for the

not easy for a 94 year-old—all the reasons for the rise. It gave
as the top reason, the first on the list of bullet points explaining
why energy prices had gone up, not one of the reasons that we know are
actually the reasons for the price increase; instead, it blamed the
Government. It is a dual fuel tariff, so the charges are affected by
the various bits of government legislation. I think that reflects a
real arrogance. It is very difficult indeed to fix this competitive
area, as noble Lords are trying to do. It is time to think what has
previously been the unthinkable and say, although perhaps not tonight,

dilemma for any Government. Nevertheless, we should start thinking what
has previously been the unthinkable: that this arrogance is not

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords for
tabling this amendment. It enables us to have a debate about what I
believe is an obvious missing element in the entire Bill, which is the
need and the desire to promote competition. It is clear that there has
been a quickening of pace in the thinking 
<?notus-xml column=1384?>about energy policy since the conference season. That is largely because
the Labour Party has called time on the existing system which is
operating in our electricity market. We stated clearly that if we win
the next election we would make dramatic reforms to introduce greater
competition. It is evident that we have an oligopolistic system and
that there is an insufficient downward pressure on prices. Otherwise,
why would British Gas and other members of the big six opt to spend
half a billion pounds on share buy-backs when they could have used that
money to keep prices down for their consumers or to stop the price
rises they have recently announced? It is absolutely clear that

Bill, the contract awarded to EDF to build Hinkley Point C. Indeed, the
noble Lord, Lord Deighton, was responsible for negotiating it. I have
no doubt that he would have found it much easier to negotiate a price
and length of contract that was better value for consumers if we had

very quickly pass to a competitive process. It cannot continue as this

very large companies that already play a dominant role in the market.

that. The argument in favour of the big six and vertical integration
has always been that they need the balance sheet of the supply industry
to be able to raise the finance required to invest upstream in

from the man on the street fitting solar panels to communities coming
together to find PV for their schools or building wind farms. Real
change is happening and we must endeavour to make it happen more
quickly and substantially. Only then will the big six or their
equivalents be challenged. This is happening already in Germany, where
after a relatively short period RWE, the giant of the German
electricity industry, is claiming that its business model is broken.
The support for decarbonised, community-owned power has broken that
industry, which is a good thing, as it has been responsible for a huge

balancing different objectives: balancing the need to decarbonise

seeks to abolish the vertically integrated business model. While I
certainly recognise that vertical integration plays a part in
perpetuating barriers to market entry, it also delivers some benefits
for consumers through lower costs of capital, efficient risk management
and economies of scale. These benefits cannot be discounted without a
clear sense of what the effects of a prohibition on vertical
integration might be. There is no clear evidence that the divestment of
retail businesses will increase competition or lower consumer prices.
Instead, we should focus on delivering reforms that we know will
increase competition. For instance, it is crucial to ensuring a
reliable electricity supply that independent gas-fired generation and
other forms of reliable capacity can compete in the electricity market.
That is precisely what the capacity market is intended to
achieve<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:16:25"></hs_TimeCode>. It will
do this, for example, by offering longer-term contracts to each plant,
which will enable them to spread their cost of capital over a longer
period. This is particularly important to independent players as they
rely on securing project finance rather than financing from their
balance sheet, as many of the big players
do<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:16:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000021" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000021">We
have sought to factor competition into EMR, designed by running
competitive auctions in the capacity market and signalling a clear
intention to move to competitive allocation of contracts for difference

low-carbon generation to compete in the market. More widely, Ofgem is
taking forward an ambitious package of reforms to improve market

these reforms major energy companies will be required to quote and
trade at prices across a range of products up to two years ahead of
delivery. This will allow independent generators and suppliers to lock
in prices well ahead of delivery and will therefore enable new entrants
to the market. Furthermore, I amended the Energy Bill in Committee to
allow for the establishment of a power purchase agreement scheme. This
will make it easier for independent renewable generators with CFDs to
access the electricity market by guaranteeing access to an off-taker of
last resort at a specified discount to the market

me briefly say a word about each. First, on cutting red tape,
Britain’s Business Task Force produced an excellent report which
was endorsed by a hundred European businesses. I chaired a meeting
bringing members of the Business Task Force together with President
Barroso and the leaders of Germany, Sweden, Italy, Poland, Finland,
Estonia and the Netherlands. These countries representing all parts of
Europe and all political traditions agreed on the need to make more
progress in cutting regulation and helping businesses across Europe to
create jobs, and the strong language adopted in the communiqué
by all EU member states reflects this. It calls for rapid
implementation of REFIT, the Commission’s own
bureaucracy-cutting initiative, and a proper scorecard to measure
exactly how much regulation is being cut. Deregulation is now part of
the EU agenda in a way that it simply has not been
before.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000044" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000044">Second<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:30:57"></hs_TimeCode>ly,
on trade, we welcomed the conclusion of the EU-Canada trade deal. This
new deal could be worth £1.3 billion to the British economy,
with estimates suggesting British exports to Canada could go up by as
much as a fifth. Last week’s agreement also means we can now
move the focus on to the EU-US talks which we began at the G8 in Lough
Erne. There were some attempts to link this potential US trade deal

to the digital single market, once again the commitment was made to
complete this by 2015, potentially boosting growth by as much as 4% of
the EU’s total GDP. As Britain is a world leader in e-commerce,
this is very much in our interests. We made good progress at the
Council on issues like portability of data, e-identification,
e-invoicing and payment services and an EU-wide copyright regime for
the digital age, but we also agreed not to rush ahead with the data
protection directive on an artificial timetable because the current
draft has disproportionate burdens on small business and they need to
be removed. In terms of the services directive, we agreed that it was
time to look at a new sector-by-sector approach rather than just trying
to remove all the outstanding barriers to free trade in services in one
go—a process that has stalled in recent
years.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000046" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000046">Thirdly,
on defending Britain’s interests, as I have argued repeatedly,
the European Union is changing and the eurozone needs more integration
and co-ordination. But Britain is not in the single currency, and we
are not going to be, so we should not have to take part in these
additional bits of co-ordination, 
<?notus-xml column=1391?>whether they cover economic or social policy. So while members of the
eurozone agreed to even more intrusive policy co-ordination, including
on social policy, I was clear that Britain will not take part. This is
reflected in the communiqué which says that all changes are
voluntary for those countries not in the single
currency.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000047" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000047">On
the tragedy at Lampedusa, we agreed the next stages of the work of
Frontex, which is responsible for trying to stop people coming to the
EU in the first place, but we rejected the idea that there should be
additional burden-sharing for so called ‘front-line
states’, not least because, if you look at the figures, Britain,
France, Germany, Belgium and Sweden between us received almost 70% of
asylum applications recorded in the EU in the past 12 months. What is
most important of all is helping to stop the problems at their source.
The UK will continue to play a leading role in this: for example,
through support for border security in Libya and the focus of our
development assistance on helping countries that are at risk of
instability. On the Eastern Partnership we agreed that countries which
look towards Europe for support, such as Ukraine, should be free to
enter into agreement with us while, of course, continuing to insist on
proper standards of governance and justice that such a relationship
should
entail.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000048">Finally,
because of the recent controversies there was much discussion about the
role of intelligence agencies. We agreed a statement signed as Heads of
Government—because there is no EU competence in this area and
nor should there be—that said European countries and America
should have a relationship based on trust and that damage had been done
by recent revelations. The UK has a very strong, long-standing
trust-based relationship with the US, not least as part of the Five
Eyes partnership together with Canada, Australia and New Zealand. In
terms of our own intelligence services, we have a long-standing
tradition that we do not comment on intelligence matters. We have
parliamentary scrutiny of our intelligence agencies through the
Intelligence and Security Committee and we have strengthened that
oversight. Our agencies operate under the law and their work is
overseen by Intelligence Commissioners. Of course, as technology
develops and the threats we face evolve, so we need to make sure that
the scrutiny and frameworks in place remain strong and effective. But
we have every reason to be proud of our intelligences services and the
way in which they are properly constituted in our
country.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000049">Since

related to plots, including plans for a 7/7-style attack with rucksack

English Defence League march using an array of lethal weapons. There

the European Statement, I join the Leader of the House in his support
for the work of our intelligence services. It is vital, it keeps us

turn to the formal agenda of the summit. First, on trade, we welcome
and support the conclusion of the Canada-EU trade deal and agree with
the focus on the US-EU trade agreement. At the start of this year, a
timetable for December 2014 was set to complete negotiations. Can the
Leader set out any further developments on this challenging timetable
and its feasibility? Does he agree that the possibility of this
agreement is an important reminder, including to his Cabinet colleagues
and much of his party, that a prosperous future for Britain lies
inside, not outside, the European

we all agree that completion of the digital single market could have a
significant impact on our prosperity. On numerous occasions the
Government have stated their commitment to expand the single market in
digital services. Will the Leader please tell us what has been achieved

regulation, we will, naturally, look at the proposals of the task

welcome any progress on this, but we need to distinguish between good
and bad 
<?notus-xml column=1393?>regulation. Cutting bureaucracy and red tape can be welcome, where
appropriate, but the Government’s emphasis on cutting red tape
for business is in stark contrast to the red tape which they seek to

broader economic policy, I note what the Prime Minister said at the end
of his European summit press conference: that his priority was now to
make sure it is a recovery for all. Does this represent an
acknowledgment that, despite the welcome news on growth, millions of
people still feel worse off because of the cost of living crisis? The
Prime Minister also said after the summit that he wanted to help people
“excluded from our economy”. That includes
youth unemployment, mentioned in the communiqué. The shameful
truth is that nearly one in five unemployed young people in Europe
lives in Britain and those who are employed are often vastly
overqualified. I am currently seeking a nine-month maternity cover for
my PA/office manager and, of the tens of applications I have received,
most are from people with a master’s degree and some have
doctorates: many of them are working as unpaid interns. Something is

to the effects of the storm. I am not able to give her precise figures,

in relation to trade and Canada, the significant decisions on the deal
have been taken so we are not expecting it to take long to resolve the
remaining issues. I cannot give a precise timetable for the EU-US
talks. The potential benefits of such a deal are, obviously, far
greater than the EU-Canada deal. There was some possibility of an
attempt to slow down the timetable for the EU-US talks at the European

detail in the communiqué about what was achieved on digital
services. The real impetus of the council was in terms of the digital
single market, on which a number of conclusions were reached. It is
very much in our interests that we make progress on that. We have a
very active e-commerce sector which we need to capitalise on. There was

directive, as the noble Baroness said, it is clearly the case that
proper concerns about data protection must be addressed. There was no
agreement to the earlier timetable which we sought because of concern
about the cost which might be inflicted, particularly on small
businesses—estimated at up to £300 million—by the
over-early implementation of such a directive before the details were
thrashed out. The position reached was to work on that—not to
resile from it but to try and make sure that, when it is introduced, we

progress made on regulation, not just here but reflecting a continuing
process whereby the UK, working with its allies, is trying to shift the
emphasis in a more deregulatory direction. This relates, in a way, to
the noble Baroness’s final question about what difference this
summit has made. The work of our own business task force contributes to
that, as does the work the Commission itself is doing through the REFIT
initiative, working in tandem with it.</hs_para>

says, there is good regulation which can increase competition, and
there is regulation which harms prospects for employment or growth. We
all agree that the urgent priority at the moment is to make sure we
have economic growth across Europe so that more people can benefit from
it, particularly the young. I know that the noble Baroness is concerned
about youth unemployment. We all want to see much faster progress but,
since the general election, the total number of young unemployed people
has fallen by nearly 80,000. Our level is below the EU average and
below that of France and of Italy. We have been creating more training
opportunities, which are part of the solution. The noble Baroness will
know that the number of apprenticeships has grown enormously: we have
doubled the number and this is also part of the solution. The 1.4
million private sector jobs created since the general election are also
helping. Altogether, the number of NEETs is now the lowest it has been
for a decade. There is obviously an awful lot more work to do and
ultimately the process starts with what goes on in schools, where we
must try and make sure our young people have the skills they need to
equip themselves for the growing number of available

friend the Prime Minister is right about that but in one country within
the EU, Hungary, those standards of governance and justice simply do
not apply any more, and it has been getting worse for a number of
years. Sadly, this has been happening under the prime ministership of
Viktor Orban. I knew him many years ago when he was, as he still is,
the leader of Fidesz—in those days the young liberals. He was,
like me, a vice-president of Liberal International and we served
together on the officers’ board. I well remember the first thing
that he did. Fidesz, because it consisted of young liberals, had a rule
whereby when you were over 30 you had to resign and join the Alliance
of Free Democrats. What did Viktor do? When he reached 30 he changed
the rules, which has been and still represents one of his
characteristics. When the rules tend to take away some of his power, he
simply changes the rules. I remember 
<?notus-xml column=1396?>well a meeting of the committee of Liberal International when he walked
out and said that he was going to join a more conservative group. That
is what he did and he has produced a more authoritarian country. My
concern is that the Prime Minister entertained him in Downing Street
this month before the European Council and friendly photographs are
being used by Mr Orban in Hungary to show that this country is
supportive of him. I seek a reassurance from my noble friend that the
Prime Minister is pressing Mr Orban to address the real problems of
authoritarianism, anti-immigration and the destruction of European

has engaged with the Commission on that review and is making changes to
its constitution that have addressed many of the concerns. We welcome

United Kingdom which has made a public statement that on a permanent

he aware of the substantial evidence presented to your

there has been progress. The fact that seven countries joined the UK in

working hard in that respect, particularly with Chancellor Merkel. I am
also grateful to the noble Lord for what he said about how vital the

achieve. One is that the Commission has its own process under the REFIT
programme that my noble friend will know about, which is coming up with
a series of regulations, measures and so on that it thinks could be
repealed, not introduced or otherwise revised. That is a Commission-led
process. Alongside that, the Prime Minister has been working with
British business, and the British Business Task Force has been working
with European businesses, to come up with suggestions from a business
perspective regarding further changes that could be made. A twin-track
process is going on. One track is led by the Commission and, in the
other, Britain with its allies is trying to take forward this issue of
how one can have the right amount of regulation that will not hold back
economic growth, which is our priority, and get that balance

Britain to be a full member of the European Union? None of these things

perhaps I might occasionally—accuse the noble Baroness, Lady

what has been achieved in terms of generating jobs generally and the
improving trend of economic figures that we are beginning to see. There
is much more to do but there has definitely been progress. He is also
right about what has been done to tackle youth unemployment. On his
broader point, the Prime Minister has demonstrated that it is possible
both to argue strongly for Britain’s national interests and to
build alliances with other similar-minded countries in Europe to bring
about change for the common good. The issue is sometimes presented as a
false dichotomy, whereby if you argue for Britain’s 
<?notus-xml column=1398?>national interests you jeopardise your influence within Europe and you
either have to go with the consensus or become an outist. The Prime
Minister has set out that one can argue very strongly from within the

points in response. First, my noble friend is right to point to a
growing disaffection across Europe with the institutions and processes
of the European Union. One of the things that many people are trying to
work for is to bring the work of the Union more into contact with the
everyday concerns of the citizens of Europe and overcome this growing
what people call democratic deficit. That is something that my right

by arguing against measures that would affect British businesses, choke
off growth and all the rest of it.</hs_para>

accountable has a voting structure and if virtually all EU members did
end up joining the banking union, theoretically it would then be
possible for it to tell the UK what to do. In the negotiations over the

I be right in thinking that part of the reason for France’s
absence is that it does not share our approach on this matter at all.
The biggest single bit of business regulation—and I would argue
the most unjustified—that the French go in for is the 35-hour

which must be very bad for the business sector in France. Perhaps, in

or EPPO. Our report outlines, in detail, the structures and powers of
the proposed public prosecutor’s office. I will identify some of
the features that concern us most. The European Public
Prosecutor’s Office will have a very wide jurisdiction as to
what it investigates and prosecutes. Although the definition of
European fraud has yet to be firmly fixed, it will be very likely to
encompass any act or omission which has the effect of wrongly acquiring
or retaining EU funds or assets or which results in the diminution of
European Union revenue. It would include, for example, incitement,
aiding and abetting such offences, and corporate criminal
liability.</hs_para>

prosecutor’s office to gain exclusive jurisdiction over any
other offence which is inextricably linked to a European fraud offence.
That has the considerable capacity to further expand and involve the
office in national jurisdictions and expand its own jurisdiction. We
should all be concerned at the nature and potential character of that
proposal.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000100" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000100">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:11:21"></hs_TimeCode>

investigative powers such as the right to search premises and intercept
telecommunications, to be exercised in accordance with national law and
subject to obtaining a judicial warrant where national investigators
would be obliged to obtain one. It can require information and
assistance from national authorities. The proposals also suggest that

committee, in considering these proposals, concluded that the proposal
fails the subsidiarity test. The report lists nine bullet points at
paragraph 14 to justify that opinion. I will briefly underline or
summarise a few of them. First, we suggest that
there are better alternatives, based on the current framework, which is
built on criminal enforcement by member states. More can be done to
prevent fraud happening in the first place through good-quality
legislation and careful administration of resources by the
Commission and member states. We should remember that 80% of all
European Union funds are administered by member states themselves. That
is a vital factor, which should be taken into account. Co-ordinated
action needs to be improved, but we do not believe that this particular
proposal for this particular kind of office is
justifiable.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000102" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000102">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:16:21"></hs_TimeCode>
EPPO would undermine the effectiveness of existing EU fraud-fighting
organisations such as Eurojust and OLAF. Giving the EPPO exclusive
competence would create an unnecessary faultline between national and
European Union efforts to counter fraud, introduce complication, and
risk the moral hazard that member states will feel that they can leave
EU fraud to the European Public Prosecutor’s Office. By
contrast, it must be a shared responsibility, particularly given that,
as I emphasise again, 80% of all European Union funds are administered
by the member states
themselves<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:13:43"></hs_TimeCode>. Our
committee was concerned that the proposal would interfere
disproportionately in the sensitive area of member states’
criminal law systems, by conferring exclusive powers on the public
prosecutor’s office and giving it power to dictate how finite
national criminal law enforcement resources are deployed and by
allowing it to operate according to its own rules on the admissibility

that the Commission has not made its case adequately. It underestimates
the costs and overestimates the benefits of such an office,

not be participating. The Government have made it clear that the UK is
not going to opt into this proposal and, indeed, that a referendum
would be required for it to do so. It is nevertheless, in our view,
appropriate for this House to issue a reasoned opinion, 
<?notus-xml column=1402?>and it does not absolve the House from coming to a position on the issue
of subsidiarity. All national parliaments have a special role to play

Article 86 of the Lisbon treaty specifically envisaged the creation of

consistent with the treaty—we do not challenge the right of the

proposals is far-reaching, intrusive and infringes the principle of
subsidiarity. Under the subsidiarity procedures, national parliaments
can force European institutions to review a proposal—it
requires, as I understand it, 14 parliamentary votes across the union.
Fascinatingly, there has been, in the past few weeks, a growing

Hodgson of Astley Abbotts (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to
support the noble Lord, Lord Rowlands. He has laid out the case as to
why this proposal to establish a European public prosecutor’s
office does not comply with the principle of subsidiarity with forensic
skill, and I will try to avoid repeating what he has
said.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000107" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000107">I was a
member of Sub-Committee E, both at the time of issuing this subsidiary
assessment and of the publication of the report, <I>The Fight Against
Fraud on the EU’s Finances</I>. That report found that there
appeared to be a significant level of fraud within the EU budget, and
that official figures appeared, at least to us, to significantly
underestimate the volume and value of that fraud. Therefore, at first
blush one has some sympathy with a proposal that appears to have as its
objective, the sharpening up of the organisational response to these
defects. Further to that, our report found significant weaknesses in
the work of the European anti-fraud office, known as OLAF, which
included tensions between the supervisory committee and the executive
arm of the agency; frequent turnover of representation so that
consistent policies were not followed through; an absence of
classification of fraud offences, as the noble Lord referred to; a
reluctance to name and shame countries where it appeared that fraud was
taking place; and last but not least, a lack of will among member
states to report and follow up suspected cases of
fraud.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000108" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000108">To be
fair to the commission, it has put in place a number of measures to
improve OLAF’s operational efficiency, notably the regulations
adopted just six weeks ago on 11 September. However, one of the more
depressing features of the Brussels bureaucracy—at least to a
Euro-agnostic like me—is the tendency, where an organisation is
not operating up to par, not to undertake a serious attempt to improve
the efficiency, but instead to pile on top of, or in this case
alongside, 
<?notus-xml column=1403?>that organisation yet another body to look after it. It is almost
certain that an EPPO operating alongside OLAF and Eurojust will surely
only serve to undermine OLAF’s work at this time, when the
recent changes just introduced, as I mentioned, should give it a new
sense of purpose and
direction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000109" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000109">I
particularly share the view expressed in the report that the
anticipated costs of running the EPPO are woefully understated; a net
annual cost of just €6.1 million is surely not
credible. The reason for the subsidiarity judgment is that the fight
against EU fraud needs to be developed from first principles, and they
can be done without the introduction of the EPPO. The commission needs
to improve the clarity of its budgeting system; improve its own systems
for overseeing that budget; and work more closely, where appropriate,
through OLAF and Eurojust with member states so that they investigate
and prosecute fraudulent activity with vigour and
purpose.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000110" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000110">The
noble Lord, Lord Rowlands, quite rightly focused on the impact of this
proposal on the national criminal law systems of individual member
states. He was right to do so and I support him. However, I believe
that even if it were possible to overcome these principle
objections—and I, for the record, do not believe this would be
possible—establishing the EPPO would, on purely practical
grounds, likely offend the principle of subsidiarity and undermine the
existing organisations of OLAF and Eurojust at the same

European Union is evolving after the Lisbon treaty in what I hope will
be a gradually accelerated fashion. It is inevitably slowed down by the
realities of economic austerity and slowed down in the national
economies of all the member states, not just the leading ones. That is
a reality that we see, as well as the constant difficulty of blending
different national cultures in all sorts of areas. Perhaps one of the
most difficult areas is the law and the legal sector, because of the
noticeable difference of the Anglo-Saxon legal system, mainly in the UK
and Ireland, the Roman legal systems of the other member states and
mixed with some of the new member states since 2004.</hs_para>

reality; it is not to be hostile to the evolution of Europe by
annunciating those realities that we are facing in all sorts of
complicated sectors. This one is particularly complicated, and I think
that this is an occasion where the member states expressed a general
support for the notion and the concept, but maybe for the future, as
the noble Lords, Lord Rowlands and Lord Hodgson, mentioned without
going into the details. Subsdiarity must be a real element of
the Lisbon treaty in order to provide reassurance to the
national publics of each member states, particularly the one in this
country, which is particularly fragile in its Euro-hesitation; this
disturbs me greatly because I think it is unnecessary, but it is
because of the fight between the political parties and the rise of
UKIP. It is necessary to balance all those things and not to rule out
this concept for the
future.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000115" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000115">There
is every prospect that the EPPO concept itself will gain confidence if
it goes slowly forward but the national legal systems demand that the
national prosecutorial authorities have the upper hand in the initial
stages of that timeframe, which may be quite long, over a number of
years, to gain reassurance. We have the co-operative tradition anyway
between the forces of law and order in the European cockpit. Europol is
proving to be a great success—under a UK executive head, I am
glad to say—and is developing apace, and so are the other
instruments that were mentioned by the two previous speakers in this
debate.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000116" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000116">If
that is the way to do it, it may be that in future the EPPO will have a
pragmatic construct, a special piece of instrumentation by way of a
regulation agreed between the Council and the European Parliament that
would include the national prosecutorial authorities inside the EPPO
system to reassure the public, who will feel that subsdiarity will have
therefore been satisfied. Our need for subsidiarity in a
number of areas needs to be expressed. People should not be nervous
about doing that. This is a classic example. I am very glad to be on

example: the combination of prosecution and investigative functions;
the power of the EPPO to commit a person for trial and determine the
location of the trial; the creation of differing standards of criminal

fraud on the community’s financial interests; the lack of
democratic accountability for the prosecution function; and, of course,
the breach of the subsidiary principle and dilution of member state
responsibility for prosecution of

then, the creation of a specialist EU prosecution authority has been

there needs to be greater protection of the EU’s financial
interests and we need to see further improvements in how the EU deals
with fraud. The level of suspected fraud against the EU budget is
obviously and rightly a source of concern. The report refers to
Commission’s estimate that it stands at around €500

we concur with them, particularly the point that the proposal would
transfer responsibility for tackling fraud against the EU budget away
from national-level decision-making to a supranational authority. The
European delegated prosecutors would be required to prioritise EU fraud
above other crime at a national level. It has always been a red line
for us that member states determine their own national priorities, and
the consequent use of resources for those priorities, in tackling
crime<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:30:38"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000128">Also,
an EPPO system would result in a duplication of established
national-level efforts to protect member-state and EU financial
interests, including organised crime. It is somewhat
surprising—and I read the reports again in case I missed
something—that, although the Commission has reported two
consecutive years of decrease in fraudulent and other irregularities
affecting the EU budget and their estimated financial impact, it has
not waited to evaluate the impact of the proposed new directives on
tackling this issue. There is a danger that the establishment of an

best way to tackle fraud is through prevention; that is reflected in
the UK's own policy of zero tolerance towards all fraud, using robust
management controls and payment systems, and requiring all agencies
with responsibility for distributing EU funds to have
processes in place to monitor and report fraud. There are
genuine and—we consider—justified concerns that an EPPO
would cause a shift from prevention to reaction after crimes have been

Commission should not only say that the principle of subsidiarity has
been met but also clearly demonstrate how it has been met and provide
well researched and accurate evidence. To assess this, there is a
two-limbed subsidiarity test. The Commission should clearly demonstrate
in its rationale and impact assessments that the objectives of a
proposal cannot be sufficiently achieved at member state
level—the first limb of the test—and then that the
objectives of a proposal can be better achieved at EU level by reason
of their scale and effect, which is the second limb and the so-called
EU added-value test.</hs_parafo>

this House and Parliament the right to decide whether the proposal
meets both limbs of the subsidiarity test. If noble Lords believe that
the Commission has failed clearly to demonstrate that EU-level action
is necessary and is of added value, it is their right to say so by
issuing a reasoned opinion. This is therefore a matter for Parliament
and not for the Government. In the case of the European Public
Prosecutor’s Office proposal published in July this year, as we
know, the European Union Committee considered the two-limbed test and
found that the proposal does not comply with the principle of
subsidiarity. The reasoned opinion clearly lays out the reasoning. The
Government agree with the European Union Committee’s
assessment.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000139" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000139">In
the Government’s Explanatory Memorandum on the proposal, we made
it clear that we do not believe that the principle of subsidiarity has
been met in this case. We share the view that the Commission has not
presented a convincing case. The figures used by the Commission to
justify the EPPO are flawed and inflated, while other evidence draws on
inappropriate, partial and unsubstantiated information. There are many
gaps and blanks, especially in the costs of change and future funding
needs. While of course the issue of fraud must be tackled at all
levels—including when it involves funds that form part of the EU
budget—we do not agree that the establishment of an EPPO is the
right approach. The relevant legal base in the treaties—Article
86 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union—says
that a European Prosecutor’s Office “may” be
established. The treaties do not say that it “shall” be
created, yet the Commission presents that as the only
solution.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000140" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000140">The
Commission has not allowed time for current reforms at national level
to take effect and make a difference. For example, reforms to the
European Anti-Fraud Office—OLAF—are currently being
introduced to improve information exchange between OLAF and national
authorities and to improve OLAF’s internal quality control.
Indeed, a new regulation governing the work of OLAF entered into force
only on 1 October. We hope that the improved quality of
evidence provided by OLAF to national courts will address many of the
conviction issues that the Commission raises in its assessment of the
EU fraud problem. These changes need time to be implemented before any
action is contemplated. The Commission has not considered adequately
other options to strengthen the current system further. For example, it
has not considered enhanced incentives or other options for reform at
regional or national level in any detail or in a rigorous
manner.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000141" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000141">In the
Government’s view, the best way to tackle EU fraud is through
prevention. The UK has a zero-tolerance approach to all fraud, with
robust management controls and payment systems in place that seek to
prevent incidents of EU fraud. Additionally, we should continue efforts
that are already being made to strengthen the current system. The House
is also aware of our long-standing position in the coalition agreement
not to participate in the establishment of any European
Prosecutor’s Office. The details of the proposal serve only to
reinforce that position. This proposal is unnecessary, unsubstantiated

ensure value for money along with the smooth functioning of the

be considered hybrid and subject to investigation by the Hybrid

Roper (LD):</Member></B> My Lords, I have tabled Amendment
41 in this group to give the Minister an opportunity, to which she has
already referred, to respond to the 11th<Sup> </Sup>report of the
Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee. The committee felt
that the proposal in Amendment 40 was not satisfactory as it would
still give the authority power to confer functions on itself without
the consent of the Secretary of State, even though the proposed new
subsection would allow for such consent to be given generally in
relation to the capacity market rules of a particular kind. In its
report, the committee did not find that a totally satisfactory
response. I ask my noble friend whether she will be able to give some
consideration to this point and perhaps bring back at Third Reading an
amendment to Amendment 40, which will go some way to respond to the
committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:53:13"></hs_TimeCode>’s

Worthington (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister
for introducing this group of amendments. This goes to show that the
Government are listening—at least to the Delegated Powers and
Regulatory Reform Committee if not, perhaps, to all sides of the House.
It has obviously had more success in amending the Bill than some of us
in our many days in Committee over the summer. There are a number of
amendments here, many of which implement the recommendations.</hs_para>

note, it is important that the Government have listened and accepted
the advice of the Delegated Powers Committee. This is quite an
extraordinary Bill. It is quite an extraordinary intervention into the
market and it carries with it quite considerable enabling powers that
give the Secretary of State a huge amount of discretion in how he or
she will intervene in the electricity market. It is only right and
proper that those powers are subject to the affirmative resolution
procedure in as many places as possible, so there can be a degree of
parliamentary oversight in what is going to be a hugely significant
intervention into the market.</hs_para>

spoke to some of the amendments which relate to the allocation of
contracts for difference under the levy control framework. I seek some
form of comfort, and confirmation from the Minister that we will not
descend into a system of micromanagement, trying to split up the pot of
money into ever smaller, more precise groupings of technologies. We
have seen this happen with other DECC policies; with the renewable heat
incentive, for example, and the banding of FITs. This temptation to
micromanage, to carve up the market and pick winners to make sure that
we have control over what comes forward can make for a regrettable
situation. It is regressive because it does not allow the market to
demonstrate where there is a success. It does not allow the market to
find solutions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:55:44"></hs_TimeCode>.

quite odd that I am here on the Labour Benches chastising the
Conservative Government for not allowing the market to deliver.
However, it is clear that this is the current thinking: that we should
not allow the market and competition to dictate but somehow try to use
the powers in the Bill to organise and plan everything from the top
down. That is a recipe for disaster. I am sure that others will agree
with me that where we have already seen that in operation, with FITs
and RHI, it has been shown to be really sub-optimal. I only say that as
an illustration of why it is so important that the many regulations
which will flow from the Bill are subject to full and proper
parliamentary scrutiny, so that we can try to prevent some of those
worst examples being repeated on a much larger

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, briefly, we had a good and thorough
discussion about the need for greater competition in the Bill; I do not
intend to fully rehearse all the earlier comments. The amendment is
intended to ask the Government when we will move away from an
administrated, bilateral negotiation of 
<?notus-xml column=1414?>CFDs to a more competitive tendering process. It seems that the entire
Bill is subject to state aid approvals from the EU. I am sure that one
of the main tenets of the argument being put to the EU will be that we
are treating all technologies equally—that there is element of
competition and a proper tendering process. That is not currently the
case as the Bill is drafted at the moment. There is no indication in
the legislation of a timeline to which the Government are working.
There is no hint at when we will be moving to this competitive process.
We hear that that is the intention but there is nothing in the Bill
that compels it to be the
case<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T20:59:53"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

amendment is to ask, if this amendment were accepted, that within five
years of enactment the process of bilateral negotiation would cease and
we would move to a competitive tendering process. Five years is perhaps
too long or too short; I am not saying that it is a precise number. The
point is that we cannot carry on for very long in this bilaterally
negotiated world, where there is really no transparency at the moment
and we do not see technologies being treated
equally<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:00:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady
Worthington, for this amendment. It offers us another opportunity to
debate the important matter of competition within EMR. Amendment 7
relates to the competitive allocation of CFDs. I begin by reassuring
the noble Baroness and noble Lords that we have carefully considered
competition throughout the design of EMR. Of course, CFDs themselves
will enable new low-carbon generation to compete in the
market<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:01:24"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000171" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000171">We

we view the competitive allocation of CFDs as a means to ensure low
costs to the electricity consumer rather than as an end in itself.
Competitive allocation can help drive value for money only when market
conditions
allow<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:02:03"></hs_TimeCode>. Key tests
of the market conditions include the supply of new low-carbon
generation exceeding the amount we need to meet our decarbonisation
commitments, and there being enough potential players to ensure
sufficient competitive

allocation before these conditions are met may increase risks to
developers and costs to the consumer, without necessarily bringing the
benefits of a competitive allocation. Of course, it is possible that
the conditions for competitive allocation may be met relatively soon.
In respect of most renewable technologies, we have said that we will
consider moving immediately to allocation rounds and introducing
constraints for certain technologies or groups of technologies, which
might have the effect of triggering 
<?notus-xml column=1415?>auctions for those technologies. In respect of nuclear and carbon
capture and storage technologies, our officials are already working
with stakeholders to explore how competitive tenders could work for
those
technologies<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:03:05"></hs_TimeCode>.
Where competitive allocation processes are not feasible or effective, I
can reassure noble Lords that any final allocation decision will still
be subject to strict value-for-money considerations and an assessment
of an overall budget

I say to the noble Baroness and to noble Lords who have expressed the
concerns behind this amendment that we do care about value for money,
but I do not think that a requirement to run competitive allocation
processes within five years of enactment of the Bill is the right way
to ensure value for money. Instead, we should focus on the action that
we are taking to improve underlying conditions for new low-carbon
generation and reduce barriers to entry, which may enable a faster move
to competitive allocation processes. As I set out in an earlier debate,
these include Ofgem’s ambitious package of reforms to improve
market liquidity and meet the needs of independent generators, and our
amendment to the Energy Bill to allow for the establishment of a power
purchase agreement scheme, which will bring greater competition to the
PPA and generation
market.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000174" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0002.htm#13102836000174">The

not fully reassured by her comments, but I am grateful for them. There
is a bit of a problem here. The basic premise is to try to get to a
point where all technologies can be treated equally. However, as the
noble Baroness points out, not all technologies are at the same stage
of development, so we find ourselves in quite an odd situation. We
cannot allow this to persist. We must apply a discipline and a
timetable to ourselves to ensure that when we move to the next decade,
we will arrive at a point where we are able to compare apples and pears
more adequately. We want to get to a position where, for the sake of
the consumer, we fund only technologies that can deliver

amendment raises a very important issue that should be at the heart of
the Energy Bill, and which the legislation is not sufficiently clear on
at the moment—the nature of the contracts for difference. Noble
Lords may remember that in a very early draft of the Energy
Bill—the one that went into pre-legislative
scrutiny—there was a hint that it might be possible to sign a
one-way contract for difference. That underscores any potential profit
for a contract holder, but completely removes the downside risk. That
means that if the contract holder was due to pay money back because the
wholesale price was higher than the strike price, they could keep that
money. The wording has now been changed sufficiently for that not to be
in the current Bill, but there is still a question mark over the degree
of latitude that the Secretary of State has over these contracts for
difference.</hs_para>

seek a strong reassurance on behalf of consumers and bill payers that
we will not sign contracts in cases where, if the strike price is below
the wholesale price, that money will simply end up in the profits of
the company that holds the contract. It must flow back to the consumer.
For this to be a fair system, we want to see contracts for difference
that provide a stable price for the holders, but they should not be
completely guaranteed profits over and above that. That is an important
concept. I look forward to hearing the noble Baroness reassure me that
one-way contracts will not be signed, and that all contracts for
difference will be
two-way.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_28_PT_1/4FD2066588EF6C20F55A07EA384D09DB92E22C85" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 October 2013">Monday,

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness for her
amendments and for prompting the debate on the matter of payments to
suppliers. I am pleased to reassure her that the intention of her
amendment is already delivered in the Bill. The purpose of Clause 11 is
to allow the Secretary of State to make regulations to ensure that the
counter party can pass payments from generators under the CFD on to
suppliers and, furthermore, that the regulations we are consulting on
specify that this must
happen<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:10:06"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

that the regulations must set out the amounts to be paid to suppliers.
I want to be clear why some flexibility is needed here and therefore
why there is not already such a duty within the Bill. It is indeed the
Government’s intention that surpluses will be returned to
suppliers. A duty would, however, fix that this happened by way of a
repayment of sums. The Bill as drafted allows us instead to use
payments from CFD generators to offset future supplier payments.
Offsetting such payments could be more efficient than making payments
out to suppliers and then asking for payments back in
again<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:10:53"></hs_TimeCode>. This
could provide more value for money for consumers and greater
transparency of costs and savings.</hs_para>

23 states that sums passing to suppliers must be rated at zero. I want
to reassure noble Lords that if it is appropriate for sums to be paid
back to suppliers, for instance when, as the noble Baroness has said,
under a CFD the reference price is above the strike price—then
the counter party is required to do 
<?notus-xml column=1421?>so through draft regulations. However, sometimes the reference price
will not be above the strike price and the sums to pay back would be
zero. This amendment could lead to unintended consequences where the
counter party has to pay suppliers money it does not have. This would
then need to be recovered from suppliers, and this uncertainty is
likely to be passed through to consumers and ultimately lead to
increased consumer
bills<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:11:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

24. Clause 11(2) allows for regulations to include provision for the
counter party to calculate any amounts it might owe to suppliers
against specific criteria. It also enables regulations to allow for
such calculations to be carried out on behalf of the counter party.
Although we expect a settlement agent to carry out such calculations on
behalf of the counter party, this amendment would impose a duty which
would remove the long-term flexibility to consider how to carry out the
calculations, whether in-house or otherwise, in the most cost-effective
way<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:12:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope that

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, as I said earlier, I think there needs to
be some flexibility. Where money is returned to suppliers they have a
choice between paying it out as dividends and salaries or using it to
reduce costs to consumers. We believe that, as we have a competitive
market, benefits should be passed on to consumers. It would be in the
interests of suppliers to pass the money on to consumers. I suspect
that as the market becomes far more competitive it will be in their
interest to try to vie for as many consumers as they possibly can. I
think we need to be able to allow that flexibility and not constrain
it. On that basis, I hope that the noble Baroness will withdraw her

rehearse the arguments we had earlier about the lack of competition,
but we have seen previous examples of this in which, if there had been
a truly competitive market and proper downward pressure on prices,
would we have seen the large big six companies using their capital to
buy back shares? I do not think so. Also, we have seen it with the
introduction of the EU emissions trading scheme in which generators all
opted to take a massive windfall by passing on the full costs of the

which my noble friend Lord Roper moved in my absence in Committee. We
have tabled it again to see whether the Minister has had any further
thoughts about how she can best protect those wood manufacturers who
depend on the same source of wood as that used for biomass by
generators. That is what they are frightened of. Indeed, they go so far
as to say that if there is no certainty that they will be able to
source their raw material in this country, or from the same sources
from which they have had it in the past, we will lose the industry. It
will no longer invest here because it cannot be sure of getting its raw

have reread the reply which the Minister gave on that occasion. It is
not too strong to say that she dismissed the fear as unreasonable and
the measure as one which would cause unnecessary bureaucracy. However,
the Scottish authorities have decided that there should be a
requirement on those intending to burn biomass as a fuel to make a
statement of their sources, quantities and sustainability. I know that
there is a voluntary scheme. Indeed, my noble friend made that point in
Grand Committee. However, the fact of the matter is that this does not
give the wood panel and other wood-using industries the confidence that
they need. In those circumstances, have the Government had further
thoughts as to whether there might be an advantage in preserving an
important industry in this country in terms of the number of people it
employs and the fact that it is a UK-based manufacturing industry? Will
they give it the confidence to enable it to continue in business? I

I moved a similar amendment in Grand Committee. As he has also said, we
felt that the Minister’s reply on that occasion was not as

has a significant annual turnover and employs both directly and
indirectly a significant number of people. If it is possible for
appropriate guidelines to be issued in Scotland, it is not totally
clear to me why it is not possible to have them here. Obviously, it is
a good thing that a voluntary disclosure agreement now exists, but I

to the amendment because I am not against it and I sympathise with the
intentions of the noble Lords who are proposing it, particularly if it
affected the price of construction timber and made housing more
expensive, which would not be good. However, I advocate a bit of
caution. I have recently come across a company which is trying to build
four medium-sized biomass-powered electricity generating stations using
brash, tops, coppice, sawmill offcuts and other non-value timber. They
are putting them at different ends of the United Kingdom so they have
good local sources for the timber. Each power station will be producing
between 12 and 25 megawatts and will cost about £60 million. The
material is sustainably sourced and will encourage the use of
thinnings. For those noble Lords who do not know, thinnings are quite
often not taken out because it costs more to do so than to leave them.
If you could take more thinnings out it would create more high-value

from the ports. I declare an interest as chair of the Rail Freight
Group. A lot of investment is going into new wagons or converting coal
wagons to keep this stuff dry, because if it gets wet it is not very
nice. The message in the industry is that they have got 10 years and
then the nuclear power station at Hinkley point, and perhaps others,

could displace a lot of the wood panel industry, which it estimates
would increase carbon emissions by about 6 million tonnes, because if

this opportunity to ask the Minister for clarification on my Written
Question earlier this year about carbon dioxide emissions from burning

highest carbon dioxide-emitting fuel there is. If you recapture that
over a period of 35 or 40 years for softwood, and rather longer for
hardwood, one can in the long run perhaps make the case that biomass is
carbon neutral. However, all the calculations that I have seen show
that because of the need to drive off water, and due to its chemical
composition—there is a difference between cellulose which has
hydrated hydrogen in it as opposed to coal which does not—the
use of biomass will increase our carbon emissions over several decades.

give the Government powers to set limits on the amount of UK-sourced
wood used by each biomass power plant. As I outlined in Committee, one
of the aims of the Government’s bioenergy strategy is that any
support should consider the consequences of policy interventions on the
wider energy system and economy, including non-energy industries. It is
the Government’s view that where this and the other aims listed
in the UK Bioenergy Strategy are met, bioenergy can make a significant
contribution to meeting our renewable energy, energy security and
emissions-reduction needs at low cost.</hs_para>

of measures that we believe are sufficient to ensure that the biomass
policy meets this aim. The department made an assessment of the amount
of woody biomass that may be available to the UK without significant
impacts on other sectors. 
<?notus-xml column=1425?>We then made an assessment of the amount of UK woody biomass that is
likely to be used by electricity companies, which was well within the
forecast availability. We have since then put in place measures to
monitor these forecasts and their level of accuracy. We asked
large-scale electricity generators using woody biomass to disclose to
us on a voluntary basis the amount of UK wood that they estimate they
will procure and use over the next five years, and we require this
information to be signed off by the company’s board. We are
pleased to say that all the operators responded to our request for
information on their wood procurement. The department has now
aggregated and published this data, and we will undertake to do this
annually. The data provided by the operators supports the original
forecast of wood use for electricity. Domestic wood supplies will not
be their target.</hs_para>

aggregated the results of the sustainability reports that generators
are required to provide to Ofgem. We have also now published on the
website this aggregated data for the years 2009 to 2012. They also
support the original departmental estimates of wood use for electricity
and show that wood demand has remained within, rather than risen above,
the 1.3 to 1.6 million oven-dried tonnes per annum. As well as these
specific measures covering UK wood, the Government have made a number
of proposals to limit the amount of biomass power that will be brought
forward. We have limited the government support that can be claimed by
former coal plants until 2027 under the contracts for
difference.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_28_PT_1/339831139850B9308BD12E006DB17DB46894484A" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 October 2013">Monday,

friend Lord Ridley’s question about air pollution from biomass
worsening, the large-scale combustion biomass is regulated under the
large combustion plant directive. This sets minimum emission limits for
a range of polluters for both fossil fuel and biomass plants. This will
soon be replaced with tighter emissions controls under the industrial
emissions directive. At a smaller scale the combustion of biomass is
regulated under a variety of regulations from the Clean Air Act to
local planning laws.</hs_para>

have taken and the data we are seeing on demand for UK wood for

assessing the development of the entire industry, rather than setting
limits for individual plants, which could cause unintended consequences
and needlessly disrupt this useful technology. I hope my noble friends

Jenkin of Roding:</Member></hs_speaker> My Lords, I am very grateful to
all the noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. Clearly
this is a subject of some interest 
<?notus-xml column=1426?>around the House. I can cap the story of the noble Lord, Lord Cameron,
because I saw some people who build very small generators entirely
fired by what is left over in a forest after the useable timber is all
taken away. They are apparently making quite a good living out of that.
Individual factories and distilleries may be fired in that way so there
must be an enormous amount of that sort of thing going
on.</hs_para>

is a competition between the biomass burners and those who hope to have
wood for their furniture making and panelling and so on. The noble
Baroness has answered my question. There is no change from what she
told the Committee in the summer. In these circumstances, there is not
much point in pressing the case. I therefore beg leave to withdraw the

detail on the pilot: when it will happen, how long it will last and
when the results will be reported. A demand-side
response—short-term load shifting—is already part of our
plans for a capacity market. The Government’s preference is that
electricity demand reduction—permanent reductions in demand
through the efficient use of electricity—can also join the
capacity market in the future. However, given the uncertainties around
a financial incentive for efficiency and its operation in the capacity
market, we intend to pilot this approach before drawing conclusions.
This work is a priority and, since Committee, the Secretary of State
has announced the availability of at least £20
million for the pilot, which is expected to start in summer 2014 and
run for around two years.</hs_para>

the draft Energy Bill was published in May 2012, a number of people
were concerned that there was not sufficient indication of measures to
reduce electricity demand, which is obviously the most satisfactory way
of avoiding having to build further power stations. Both in the
pre-legislative scrutiny in another place and in the informal committee
chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, the question of demand-side
measures was discussed. As a result of that, the Government launched a
consultation in November last year and suggested a number of options
for electricity demand
reduction<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:36:40"></hs_TimeCode>.
Interestingly enough, out of the 
<?notus-xml column=1429?>options on offer, a majority of the respondents favoured a system of
electricity efficiency premium payments, which would provide
electricity users with a payment on top of the savings that result from
reduced use of
electricity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000213" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000213">However<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:37:05"></hs_TimeCode>,
when DECC published its consultation response in May this year, it
suggested that its preferred route to delivering permanent reductions
in electricity demand was via a capacity market. That was of course
contrary to the majority of the views expressed in the consultation.
Similarly, the response dismissed the idea of introducing a premium
payment without adequate explanation. None the less, on Report in
another place, the Government introduced Clause 37, allowing the
Government to run a pilot scheme for electricity demand reduction. The
clause does not explicitly limit the Government to a single pilot or
specify the mechanism that they might use. However, given what the
Government said in their response to the consultation, there is a
pretty clear indication that they wish to look at the capacity market
only.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000214" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000214">There
are a number of uncertainties about the appropriateness of the capacity
market, particularly for small and even medium-sized consumers. I am
not sure what the right reverend Prelate might say about churches which
are considering reducing their electricity demand and whether they
would be large enough consumers to go into such a capacity market. None
the less, there was a discussion in Grand Committee on an amendment
that I tabled suggesting that there should be more than one pilot so
that various methods could be explored as ways of dealing with this
question of electricity demand reduction. Amendment 48, which I and the
noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, have tabled, requires the Government to bring
forward multiple pilot schemes so that not just the capacity market but
premium payments and perhaps some other form of incentive could be
considered. That would demonstrate which scheme or schemes might be
most effective in delivering permanent demand reductions and
scale.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000215" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000215">I very

Grantchester (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, I rise to speak to Amendment
50 in this group. In our Committee proceedings, we looked at the demand
side response clauses introduced at the late stage of Report in the
other place. We noticed that they were late additions to the Bill, yet
they cannot be underestimated as there can be no simpler way to reduce
the pressures on the capacity market, increase resilience, improve
decarbonisation, and enhance efficiency and security of supply.
Reducing energy demand is much cheaper than building new generating
capacity. It is also the cheapest way to protect households from rising
bills and cut carbon emissions.</hs_para>

spending power to authorise the spending of money to fund a pilot or

<?notus-xml column=1430?>concern was expressed about whether sufficient funds were being made

forward.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000218" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000218">Difficulties
were expressed that the capacity market is designed primarily to ensure
capacity during potential shortages or troughs in supply. In these
circumstances, it will only reward demand reduction projects that
reduce the amount of generating capacity needed at such times, and not
reward projects that reduce demand more generally. The capacity market,
therefore, only rewards energy efficiency for its security benefits and
not its much larger benefits such as emissions reductions and
affordability, as well as behavioural change
policies.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000219" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000219">Many
submissions that we received wished to see multiple pilot schemes to
include premium payments as well as capacity markets and other
innovative incentive schemes. This was proposed to enable small
businesses and generators to be able to access payments and to press
the Government that demand reduction is not simply an afterthought to
bolt onto the capacity market, designed around the provision of supply
by large-scale plant prioritised through the workings of the capacity
auction.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000220" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000220">There
is also the question of determining what capacity is required once
demand has been reduced. These thoughts led us to consider that the
Government need to set a coherent strategy about delivering permanent
demand reduction and is the purpose of Amendment 50. The
amendment adds to the Government’s own Amendment 47 and the
amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin. These only refer
to pilot schemes and the Government’s Amendment 47 is eminently
sensible. However, my amendment proposes that the Government must think
further and more deeply and place demand reduction in a wider strategic
context.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000221" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000221">I
also tabled it as an alternative to Amendment 51, proposed by the right
reverend Prelate the Bishop of London, that seeks to place a numerical
target for demand reduction. The difficulty here is that I have seen
three different figures from three different methodologies. First, in
November 2012, the McKinsey final report identified 92 terawatt hours
of potential savings not covered by existing policy by 2030.
Alternatively, the energy efficiency strategy, also in November 2012,
used a different method and identified 69 terawatt hours of savings by
2020, based on existing and future policy. Yet in May this year, the
Government used yet another method in response to the electricity

identified.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000222" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000222">Will

Deal Finance Company, Mark Bayley, has admitted that complexity is one
reason why the take-up has been so disappointing. Many of those in fuel
poverty, a substantial percentage of whom live in London, pay inflated
prices through meters in their homes, and the current position whereby
the more energy you use, the more likely it is that the tariff will be
reduced, is surely unsustainable as well as unfair. This Bill, which I
heartily support in the main, provides an opportunity to reflect on the
wider costs of our energy habits and how to make the best use of our
resources without penalising the poorest in our society. In the UK 6.5%

these two amendments is that they target a specific reduction in
electricity. Coming back to the decarbonisation
debate that we had earlier on today, better decarbonisation can, of
course, actually be achieved by having an increase in electricity. One
of the big challenges of decarbonisation is moving the transport sector
from fossil fuels either into biofuels or, particularly, into
electricity, using electric vehicles. We also eventually want to move
home heating from gas into electric—non-carbon-generated
electricity. It therefore makes it very difficult in these areas to
have targets on terawatt-hours or proportions or whatever; you have to
take it back to exactly what the right revered Prelate said, which is
energy efficiency. I am a great advocate of the green deal, and it
certainly has its issues at the moment and I hope it succeeds, though
perhaps it needs a number of changes to do that. At the end of the day,
however, the real thing we have to do is just to go out there and,
perhaps rather brutally—whether it is street by street or
village by village—ensure that we upgrade domestic and
industrial premises so that they are energy efficient. Going down the
route of specific electricity- target reductions could actually work
against decarbonisation and the way in which we are trying to reduce
carbon emissions in this country. I am absolutely with the intent, but

some very good points there. If, as I do quite often, you go around
properties in different parts of the continent, you find that the
energy usage and consumption and insulation are generally a lot better
than many of our buildings here. I have a feeling, having talked to a
few people in the building trade, that it is because the standards to
which we build our properties actually require less insulation and
draught-proofing than those of many other countries. It may be because
we think that the temperature is always the same here, so it does not

I am still not convinced that the energy suppliers have any incentive
to sell less electricity or gas. It is a bit like the water companies:
they love having leakages and no meters, because they sell more water

Verma:</Member></B> My Lords, I welcome the continuing interest shown
in electricity-demand reduction. My noble friend Lord Roper’s
Amendment 48 raises an issue that came up a number of times at both
Second Reading and Committee—namely, that multiple pilots are
necessary in order to test a variety of
approaches<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T21:54:18"></hs_TimeCode>. One
of the pilot’s key aims is to test the Government’s
preferred approach of delivering electricity demand reduction through
the capacity market. That said, from a legal viewpoint the amendment is
unnecessary as the Secretary of State is already able to design and run
a pilot, or pilots, to test different approaches if this is
necessary.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000236" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000236">Before
I move on, I, too, add my congratulations to the right reverend Prelate
the Bishop of London on the great energy reductions he has achieved,
which just shows that behaviour change towards energy usage can make a
huge amount of difference. I commend what the right reverend Prelate
has done. He also mentioned the very important Green Deal and smart
meters. These measures will help to revolutionise the way we approach
energy usage. It is about being able to ensure that consumers
understand the usage of energy, which is why I listened very keenly to
what the right reverend Prelate said. Where the Green Deal is
concerned, 80,000 assessments have been carried out. Under ECO, many
tens of thousands of homes have already benefited from the Green Deal.
Like my noble friend Lord Teverson, I think the Green Deal is an
excellent vehicle for being able to bring greater efficiency towards

multiple approaches simultaneously. If we have too many, it will be
difficult to evaluate. We want to be sensible and see a range, if that
is what is needed, but we have a preferred approach. It would be better
for us as a Government to see that preferred approach dealt with first.

Worthington:</Member></B> My Lords, I support Amendment 49 of the noble
Lord, Lord Oxburgh. Throughout the evening and the passage of this Bill
we have discussed the need for competition and for keeping downward
pressure on price a great deal. It is clear, as the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, has pointed out, that the majority of the increases in
consumer and business bills in recent years have been down to the
increase in gas
prices.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000245" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000245">It is
regrettable that we heard recently from British Gas that it had decided
to withdraw a project to enhance and expand its gas storage
capabilities. This is another sign that there is insufficient downward
pressure on prices. It probably suits British Gas quite well to have
prices rising, because that leads to higher profits. It is probably the
wrong body to make any kind of economic assessment on whether it makes
sense for them to invest in gas storage. There has to be some form of
intervention from government to ensure that there is timely investment
in gas
capacity.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000246" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000246">Gas
prices fluctuate between the summer, when demand is low, and winter,
when it is high. If we can smooth that out and provide a more stable
price throughout the year, it makes sense to have a tool in the
armoury, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, has said, to facilitate this.
I am sure that the Minister will come back with some thoughts on this.
It is quite a new element to introduce to the Bill at this late stage
and perhaps an amendment of this kind is not the way to deliver it, but
I strongly support the sentiment behind it. As the noble Lord, Lord
Oxburgh, has pointed out, we are seeing our North Sea gas reserves
diminish and we are moving into a more international situation in which
we rely on gas from many different parts of the world. Much of it is
being delivered by ship. Ships can change course in the middle of the
ocean if they see fit, if offered a better price. Our reliance on gas
needs to be underpinned and secured through greater capacity and gas
storage.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000247" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000247">I

intend to bring more of this to ensure that we are not facing a
situation where it is in everyone’s interest apart from the
consumer to have gas prices rising continually, and that there is some
way in which they can intervene to bring investment to this important
aspect of energy security and
affordability.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_28_PT_1/1A74CA4DD26797C3DB263831C2B8D9DBCAAD0627" __version__="1.4"><Header><House>1</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 October 2013">Monday,

the face of it, this amendment aims to facilitate a simple and
attractive concept: cheaper and more secure gas for consumers. While
the Government recognise that rising energy bills are a worry for many
households and businesses, this amendment is not the solution. It is
difficult to imagine that any supplier of gas would sign a contract to
sell gas at a future date at a discount to the prevailing market price.
The capacity payment is required to offset the risk to the supplier of
being out of pocket and it would need to top up any shortfall to the
point where there would be no net benefit to consumers.</hs_para>

been argued that capacity payments may facilitate the construction of
additional gas storage capacity, which offers the potential to buy
cheaply in summer and store the gas until it can be sold when prices
are higher in winter, as the noble Baroness, Lady Worthington, pointed
out. This is a service that the market currently provides. Storage
capacity is currently increasing, with two facilities having been
completed in the past 18 months and two more facilities under
construction. There are 10 more projects with major planning consents
in place, which are awaiting the right commercial signals to invest.
Where the market is not already providing this signal, supporting a
storage project through subsidy, whether by a capacity payment or other
means, would just transfer the risk currently faced by the market to
the Government. In other words, it would be passed on to consumers and
taxpayers.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102836000252" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#13102836000252">DECC

shows that, although there are interventions that could enhance our gas

we are introducing a capacity market to provide for capacity payments
to ensure security of our electricity supplies. This is because the
electricity market faces new challenges. These include the planned
closure of a large proportion of our existing generating capacity and
an increased amount of low-carbon generation. That means that there is
an increased need for additional reliable capacity. The capacity market

translate to the gas market. The security of gas supply outlook is
robust. There is spare supply capacity: the available capacity of

even the highest recorded daily demand of 465 million cubic metres. The
gas system also has greater flexibility to rectify 
<?notus-xml column=1437?>demand/supply imbalances within the balancing period and, for
gas, unlike electricity, there are readily available means for storage
which the market is currently expanding. The Government therefore do
not consider this amendment to be necessary. I hope that the noble

the Minister’s reply at all reassuring. The fact that existing
capacity meets the maximum plausible demand is not quite the point. The
Minister might be aware—or perhaps would remember if she had
been in her post a year or two back—that all we need is a major
fire at one of our terminals or a catastrophe of some kind and we would
be in very severe difficulties. In drafting this amendment, I
deliberately did not specify the means—I did not specify gas
storage. All I specified was the end. Whether someone is willing to
provide gas at a fixed price for a fixed period and how they do it were
deliberately not specified. For that reason, some of these arguments
are a little wide of the mark.</hs_para>

as the Minister that the existing gas market works at all well. It is
in the interests of the major gas suppliers to hold supply back and
then to dribble it in at times of high demand. That is when they make a
lot of money. There is no one in the loop at present who protects the
interests of the consumer. It is certainly not in the interests of the
gas supply companies to do so. I am disappointed that the Government
are not taking a more active position on this matter. However, if they
are determined to turn their back on this, there is nothing more to be

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T22:12:38"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, this
is the same amendment I moved in Committee, where I spoke of the
benefits of greater interconnection across Europe. Given the lateness
of the hour and the unanimity around the Committee at that time, I do
not intend to repeat those arguments, but it is important to remember
that if we are to deliver that greater level of interconnection we are
going to need more investment in infrastructure. That means that the
Government need to make quite clear their commitment to prioritising
interconnection in the same way that they have with the capacity market
and demand side reduction measures in this
Bill.</hs_para><hs_para UID="1310294000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-0003.htm#1310294000002">I was

My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T22:12:35"></hs_TimeCode> Lords, I want
to reinforce the comments of my noble friend Lady Parminter. One of the
great challenges of the electricity supply industry is to de-peak its
supply. One of those is demand side, but the other is very much around
alternative sources of supply. Energy storage is not really where it
needs to be at the minute, but interconnection is a technology that has
been around for decades. It works and we should multiply it. I know
that the Government have a number of schemes that they are looking at
currently. 
<?notus-xml column=1439?>I welcome those and congratulate them on being so proactive in this
area. I hope that the Government and the Minister will be able to
propel this even faster and further by taking notice of my noble

Parminter will recall the evidence we heard when we were on

pan-European grid—or even an intercontinental grid, because the
geothermal springs of Iceland could bring electricity down to the
industrial heartlands of the UK—and interconnection would be to
allow intermittent renewables to complement each other. When it is not
windy in Germany, for instance, it might be sunny in Italy; when it is
windy in Portugal in the middle of the night, that power can go to
Poland where they are just waking up, and so on. Such interconnection
could bring a whole new justification to the renewables yet to be

interconnection were to grow, it would not only help to keep the lights

There are many regulatory and political obstacles to be overcome, not
least the public acceptance of more pylons. However, as with everything

now—that is where I am at odds with the noble Earl, Lord

points. First, as long as there is a sniffy attitude towards
interconnectors in any of the European energy markets, we are all going
to be operating at higher cost than we need, with greater misery for
consumers and, eventually, higher cost to the taxpayer. Secondly, this
matter is not separate from the rest of the Bill. When asked earlier in
the proceedings where their CFDs could apply in relation to supply from
French nuclear power stations or Irish wind farms, the Minister said
that in certain circumstances they probably could. That is important.
It is not tomorrow’s solution, but it could be quite important
as long as they were connected with projects here. The same question
arises with the capacity market. This is potentially a hugely important
way in which we maximise our capacity, and therefore the report to
which the noble Baroness, Lady Parminter, refers is important. Whether
the Government want to put it in the Bill or not, they really ought to
be looking at the strategy for interconnectors as an integral part of
overall energy

considered the amendment in Committee. The Government considered the
arguments made and, earlier this month, committed to publishing a
policy statement on electricity interconnection by the end of 2013,
well in advance of the date which my noble friend’s amendment
would require. This will set out our support for increased
interconnection that is appropriate and economic. My noble friend will
be aware that the Government also recently supported a number of
interconnection projects to become projects of common interest under
the EU regulation on guidelines for trans-European energy
infrastructure. The UK Government support that regulation and its
intention to accelerate completion of the internal energy market by
facilitating cross-border energy infrastructure. Five GB electricity
interconnection projects have been selected as projects of common
interest under the regulation, including with France, Belgium and
Norway. They will enjoy streamlined planning procedures and, where
appropriate, a mechanism to agree cross-border cost allocation. They
will also be eligible to access financial instruments such as loan
finance, grants for feasibility studies and, potentially, grants for
work under the Connecting Europe Facility, which has a pot of
€5.1 billion over seven
years<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T22:20:29"></hs_TimeCode>. Four
renewable generation projects located in Ireland, with potential to
develop into interconnection, were also selected as projects of common
interest. This brings the combined capacity of all potential
interconnection projects currently in the pipeline to more than 12
gigawatts<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T22:20:47"></hs_TimeCode>. My

Belgium<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T22:21:25"></hs_TimeCode>. The
Government are confident that this approach, if extended, will promote
investment in interconnection. However, as the cap and floor approach
looks to consumers potentially to take on some risk, it is important
that careful consideration is given to its application. We are working
closely with Ofgem as it takes forward its wider Integrated
Transmission Planning and Regulation project, considering the need for
enhanced planning or strategic evaluation of future
interconnection<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T22:21:58"></hs_TimeCode>.
Ofgem is also working to ensure that GB electricity prices reflect
scarcity to a greater extent. As interconnection developers invest on

Ramsbotham (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendment 72,
the wording of which, as the Committee will note, is similar to that
used by my noble friend Lady Greengross in her Amendment 71. I
apologise to the Committee if it, quite rightly, thinks that I am being
a bit military in my approach to Part 3 of the Bill. I am doing so
because, in my experience, things work much better if they are
corralled into an overall strategy.</hs_para>

development, the heart of that being Clause 19(d), which refers to,
“the need to support” every child or young
person,</hs_para>

key word in this is “development”. The current absence of
a Minister for child development was the reason for my earlier question
to the Minister about who was responsible, and therefore accountable,
for overseeing the development of every child in the country. This
concern arises from my view that the only raw material that every
nation has in common is its people, so woe betide it if it does not do
everything that it can to identify, nurture and develop the talents of
all its people. If it does not, it has only itself to blame if it
fails.</hs_parafo> <hs_para UID="13102814000007" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000007">The
absence of any apparent child development strategy is doubly
disappointing. A number of recent initiatives seemed to suggest that
the development of 
<?notus-xml column=490?>every child was becoming the Government’s default aim. For
example, the introduction of an early years foundation stage in every
child’s life, concluding with an assessment, appears to be a
sensible way to enable entry to a 0 to 25 pathway. During our work on
the link between social disadvantage and speech, language and
communication needs, the All-Party Group on Speech and Language
Difficulties, which I chair, was shown four other sub-pathways that
were being worked on by the Department for Education, the Department of
Health and others. One covered pre-birth and the first few months of
life, the second up to and including primary school, the third roughly
secondary school and transition into adulthood, and the fourth was for
those at risk of becoming involved with the criminal justice system.
Those seemed entirely sensible and appropriate because they pulled in
all the players in those processes. I should therefore be very grateful
if the Minister would let me know what the current status of these four
pathways is and their relationship to the 0 to 25 pathway proposed for
those with special educational
needs.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000008" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000008">Logic
suggests that the early years foundation stage assessments should be
turned into individual health, education and care plans and 0 to 25
pathways for everyone. Default education, health and care plans for the
81.2% of children who do not need help along the way, unlike the 2.8%
on statements and the 16% on school action or school action plus plans,
could merely be progression through the educational system, but it
would be a plan. However, the Bill as presented, instead of seizing a
priceless opportunity to bring order and logic into a system that
requires the co-operation and joint working of so many different
ministries and agencies, by laying down a default position and then
highlighting how individual necessary alternatives are to be
identified and delivered, does not contain the necessary
strategy and leaves a number of key requirements unresolved. These
include further assessments at various stages along a pathway to
identify changes of need and oversight of the whole
process.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000009">Amendment
72, about which I am extremely grateful for the detailed legal advice
of David Wolfe QC, focuses on one important part of special educational
provision, as well as trying to seal a potential crack in the presumed
strategy. The importance of speech and language therapy was highlighted
for me when, as Chief Inspector of Prisons, I was wondering what could
be done with and for the more than 60% of young offenders who were
found to have speech, language and communication needs. If only those
needs had been identified and challenged earlier in their lives, they
might never have truanted or been evicted from school, or ended up in
young offender institutions. Luckily, Lady Helen Hamlyn funded a
two-year trial of putting a speech and language therapist into each of
two young offender institutions. The two governors of these
institutions were saying, within a week of the therapists’
arrival, that they did not how they had managed before they came
along.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000010">To cut
a long story short, everyone agreed how invaluable their contribution
was, because at last all young offenders could communicate with
education, healthcare and disciplinary staffs, which enabled individual

<?notus-xml column=491?>plans to be made. Despite this, I could not persuade either the Home
Secretary or the Secretary of State for Education to pay for them,
because speech and language therapists belonged to the Department of
Health, whose Secretary of State in turn refused to pay, on the grounds
that all such funding was delegated to what were then called primary
care trusts. The development of thousands of children has gone by
default, and the same could happen to millions more if speech and
language therapy is not enshrined in government child development
plans.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000011">Therefore,

raises two problems. First, parents could lose their right of appeal to
the Special Educational Needs and Disability Tribunal. Secondly,
healthcare provision does not have to be included in an educational
health and care plan unless it is, to quote the Bill,
“reasonably” required, which implies that it could be
left out on cost grounds. Although Clause 21(5) mitigates the risk of
reclassification, it does not remove it, and the rewording that I am
proposing in Amendment 72 is designed to ensure unambiguously that the
existing classification of speech and language therapy as educational
provision is maintained. I beg to

Jones of Whitchurch (Lab):</Member></B> My Lords, our Amendment 73 is
in this group, and it has the same intent as that of the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, and the amendment from the noble Baroness, Lady
Greengross. We have just gone about it in a slightly different way. The
issue is one of what should be classified as special educational
provision. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, quite rightly pointed
out, this is important because, by its nature, this determines what
issues parents can take to appeal, and we should make that
classification as broad as we possibly can.</hs_para>

in Grand Committee how broad a definition we are going to apply to
special educational needs, and that we believe that a whole tranche of
disabled children are not classified and included in that. This issue
touches on that somewhat as well. As we said at the time, it is
important to get a standard classification of special educational needs
and disability included throughout the Bill. We have not tabled
amendments to this clause to take that on board; however, earlier
clauses ought to clarify it more clearly.</hs_para>

many in the sector, backed up by the legal advice that we have
received, there is a concern that the new definition of the phrase
“wholly or mainly” sets a higher threshold than that

initial draft of the Bill did not include a requirement for educational
provision to be wholly or mainly for educational purposes. It stated
that anything provided by the health authority was health provision and
that anything provided by social care was, similarly, social care
provision and therefore not enforceable or appealable to the tribunal.
The new wording was introduced as a result of opposition to the initial
draft but we still do not feel that it deals with this problem. I think
the Minister will be aware that there is considerable concern about
this issue, particularly around therapies such as those for speech and
language, which may be classed simply as health service provision under
this clause and therefore, apart from anything else, not
appealable.</hs_para>

case law dating back to 1989 the general position has been that any
provision which is directly related to an educational need can be
classified as educational or medical and it is for the tribunal to
decide. Guidance has been given that speech and language therapy will
normally be considered educational because of its importance in
communication, whereas other therapies such as occupational therapy
vary according to the type of difficulty the child has and how far the
therapy relates to an educational objective. Tribunals have
consistently held that where a provision has a beneficial educational
aspect, and is directly related to the child’s educational
needs, it can be described as educational provision and specified in
the statement. This aspect needs to be set out in the current bill if
parents’ rights are not to be eroded. The current wording set a
higher bar and reduces the rights of the child and

we have two colleges for young people aged 16-plus where their social
and educational needs are met together. Sometimes it is quite difficult
to differentiate between the two, as we found during Ofsted
inspections. If young people have extremely serious difficulties that
need perpetual health provision and you are trying to help those young
people to learn skills—the sort of skills whereby they can sit
and pick up a cup instead of screaming all day, which is how they are
when they arrive—it can sometimes be difficult to differentiate
between education, social care and health provision. I am simply asking
that nothing in the Bill should make that even more difficult. Usually
we have difficulty

to him today on this point about initial teacher training and other
professional development for teachers, which is founded on the teacher
standards that were introduced in September 2012. Child development is
an important part of those
standards.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000027" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000027">I
turn to the amendments. During the pre-legislative scrutiny of the SEN
provisions of the Bill, the Minister for Children and Families gave an
undertaking to maintain the existing protections for parents in the new
system. Clause 21(5) was added to the Bill before introduction in the
other place as part of that undertaking. It seeks to replicate as far
as possible the case law established under the present SEN legislation,
which, in our view, makes clear that health provision such as therapies
can be educational, non-educational or both, depending on the
individual child and the nature of the provision. Case law has
established in particular that since communication is so fundamental in
education 
<?notus-xml column=495?>and in addressing speech and language impairment, it should normally be
treated as educational provision unless there are exceptional reasons
for doing otherwise. We have reflected this in section 7.9 on page 109
of the draft SEN code of practice.</hs_para>

think we all share the aim of carrying the current established position
through into the new system. I understand the concerns that have been
expressed in this debate that the current drafting does not get this
quite right. This is complicated legal territory and it has not been
straightforward to find the right formulation, as evidenced by the
different approaches taken by each of these three amendments. I know
that various parts of the sector have sought legal advice on this
issue; I understand that the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord
Ramsbotham, follows the advice that the Royal College of Speech and
Language Therapists received, and we are currently looking at that
advice. The noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said that she also had received
advice, and we would be delighted to look at that as well. I would
welcome the opportunity to discuss this further and see what progress
can be made with noble Lords outside the Committee. With that
reassurance, therefore, I hope that noble Lords will feel able to
withdraw their
amendments<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:53:11"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000029" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000029"><B><Member ContinuationText="The Earl of Listowel" PimsId="1518" UID="13102814000117" xid="1317" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000117">The
Earl of Listowel (CB):</Member></B> My Lords, before my noble friend
does that, as I imagine that he may well do, I very much hesitate to
speak in this debate. I have just been chairing a discussion on child
development in schools. Attending it were head teachers, the former
head of the TDA and a number of other experienced practitioners in the
area that we have just been discussing. Unfortunately, I was four or
five minutes late to this discussion so I hesitate to make any
contribution to it. However, since the Minister referred to what is
being done about the standards to ensure a better understanding of
child development, which is very welcome, I should like to make two
points<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:53:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000030" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000030">First,
in welcoming the effort by both the previous Government and this one in
raising the status of teaching, and particularly in welcoming the
advent of Teach First, we heard from the man responsible for Teach
First in London. He said how successful the scheme is and that 30% of
graduates were getting into the schools that needed their help most, so
that really tough inner-city schools were getting these excellent
graduates, particularly in science and maths. However, although he
could speak only anecdotally, he said that he had met many of these
teachers and they said they felt hopeless. They did not know how to
manage the challenges presented by the young people they were working
with. We need to get this right because otherwise we might lose the
wonderful new crop of young teachers we are recruiting into the
profession, who will make a huge difference to outcomes for young
people<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:54:58"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000031" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000031">The
other point to arise from this meeting is that a generation of teachers
has not learnt anything significant about child development. That means
that head teachers and lead teachers today will not have learnt much
about child development in their training. So, while I welcome what the
Minister has said about the changes in the standards, the challenge
presented by this issue should not be underestimated. I hope there will
be 
<?notus-xml column=496?>ongoing discussions about what we can do in this area, which is vital
for the educational outcomes that we want to see for our young people.
We need to retain our new, young, enthusiastic teachers on the front
line, help them to understand why children sometimes behave so
challengingly and enable them to engage with them effectively. I
apologise to the Grand Committee for intervening but I hope that it has

positive response and all those who have contributed to the debate. The
fact that there is a strategy for schools proves my point because it is
the strategy for the early years being hooked on to the
strategy for schools which seems to be missing. The strategy for
after-school transition up to the age of 25 is also missing. You have
local government, healthcare, business initiatives and skills and
others all joining in on this; it is not only schools. There is more to
it and education is not only about what happens in

Children severely affected by it miss school for long periods, often
self-excluding due to the trauma caused by the bullying. Research shows
that around 16,000 a year are now out of school because they have been
so severely bullied. However, provision for them out of school is
woeful<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:59:03"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000036" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000036">To
understand, we need to go back a step and look at bullying generally
and provision to stop it in schools. Any child can be bullied for their
race or their special abilities and, shockingly, Scope reports that
disabled children have a high level of being bullied, as do children
with special educational needs and even children with medical
conditions. I met a young person with asthma a couple of weeks ago who
reported being bullied during an asthma attack and a young lady who, on
her return to school having had a year out for chemotherapy on a brain
tumour, was bullied because she was bald. This was despite the school
having a whole-school assembly to explain both her cancer and her
treatment.</hs_para><hs_time UID="13102814000105" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000105"><I><hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T15:59:45"></hs_TimeCode></I>4

many schools believe that they have covered themselves adequately; they
have taken a model policy. Hertfordshire, my local authority, has an
exceptionally good 38-page document on preventing and responding to
bullying, which uses the department’s code of practice and
guidelines as a starting point. The one page on which I can find any
reference to supporting pupils in need of most support is all about the
children remaining in school. There is nothing here that accepts that a
child may be traumatised, clinically depressed, or seeking help through
the child and adolescent mental health services, or that refers to what
a school would do in those circumstances. That is very depressing. We
do not seem to have moved on much from the excellent 2003 report by
Christine Oliver and Mano Candappa at the Thomas Coram Research Unit,

many schools also believe that because their provision matches the
draft code of practice and the guidelines issued by the local
authority, they are covered. They certainly believe themselves to be
covered because they are told what they have to do to cope with an
Ofsted inspection, but these children and their absence from school are
often not visible. The Government are to be applauded for reissuing
guidance and for funding the Anti-Bullying Alliance projects—I
think that the value is about £4 million. In particular, the
anti-bullying scheme under the Diana Awards, which is creating 
<?notus-xml column=498?>champions in schools, is an excellent example of how cultures in schools
can be changed by the children themselves. However, it is slow work;
there are champions in only a few hundred schools, but there are
thousands in the

these children are out of school, they need a temporary statement. That
is why Amendment 217 refers specifically to that. When I first tabled
the amendment I was under the impression, having talked to schools and
to Ed Sykes that no such thing existed. However, DfE officials have
informed me that there can be a temporary statement. Unfortunately, the
majority of schools do not seem to understand that or even believe it,
as I found when I went back to them to ask, “What are you doing,
if you are enabled to do so?”. That is the other problem. We
have lots of different bits of guidance in different places, and we now
need one document that covers everything from the very positive aspects
of how schools tackle what I may call, for today’s amendments,
minor bullying, as opposed to those children who are so severely
bullied that their learning is severely affected. When that happens,
they fall under the definition of special educational needs because
their condition means that they require

I have already mentioned, their health is also affected. They need a
safe learning environment, which is in paragraph 14 of the new schedule
proposed by Amendment 217. It is extraordinary that it is clearer under
employment law how to keep employees of a school safe than it is to
keep children safe. It is common sense when we look down the list of
policies that schools should have one relating to harassment and
bullying, but the main one relates to employees. Anti-bullying does not
go as far as harassment; it is all about how to get children to talk to
each other, and how everything should be resolved by
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:04:07"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

the woeful lack of alternative provision. Unfortunately, some children
who are excluded from school get sent to pupil referral units. As I
mentioned in a debate in the Chamber earlier this year, less than 1% of
those gain five A*s to Cs. That is understandable: they are the
children who are the most disruptive. They are also often the children
who bully. It is ridiculous to put bullied children into exactly that
environment<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:04:41"></hs_TimeCode> and,
frankly, we should expect a catastrophic disaster. I understand some
schemes for alternative provision are being considered by the DfE at
the moment. The problem is that most of them do not fit the neat
funding model that you get in a pupil referral unit or elsewhere, where
you expect to keep a child for at least a year in that alternative
provision. The real strength of good alternative provision is that
sometimes you need it for as little as two or three months before the
children have recovered and can move on—usually to another
school; it is rare for them able to go
back<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:05:25"></hs_TimeCode>. Red
Balloon centres have an outstanding academic rate. Compare the less
than 1% of pupils who gain five A*s to Cs in PRUs with Red Balloon,
where the rate is 75% of children, most of whom have been there for
less than a term.</hs_para>

not be possible to cover the country with alternative provision for
severely bullied children, but the DfE absolutely will not countenance 
<?notus-xml column=499?>virtual school environments, which can provide a lifeline to isolated
children—whether because they live in very rural areas or
because there is no alternative provision in their more urban area.
Schools of the air work exceptionally well in Australia, and electronic
blended learning works well in FE and HE, so why not in schools? DfE,
please reconsider. That is actually quite a cost-effective way of
getting isolated children to work

is time that schools were required to make their environment safer for
those severely bullied children and to acknowledge when a child is so
badly bullied that they need to go elsewhere. It is time that Ofsted
asked specific questions about children on the roll who are out of
school: no more secret deals, please, between schools and parents about
keeping them on the books but not present. It is time that the
Government issued a new code of tactics and guidance, all in one place,
that not only helps to tackle the bullies—which is equally
important—but helps the children who are so badly bullied that

can have such severe consequences on children that they cannot attend
school. As we have heard, there are 16,000 self-excluding children in
England between the ages of 11 and 15. They are very ordinary children.
Many develop temporary mental health issues, resulting in self-harm,
depression, anxiety, panic attacks and even suicidal tendencies. Those
children want to be able to go to school and to have friends, and may
well have aspirations to go to sixth-form colleges and then on to
university.</hs_para>

some schools, children who are being badly bullied and do not want to
go to school are offered places in the schools’ own exclusion
units, but those units are largely for disruptive and difficult
children or children with learning difficulties, and the children we

there, if they go, they are further bullied or find the work too
easy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:09:12"></hs_TimeCode>. If
children self-exclude from schools for reasons of bullying, there is no
alternative provision other than the pupil referral unit, which is for
challenging, aggressive children—the bullies themselves, as we
have heard. Those children are eminently recoverable with a short
stay—I think that, for the majority, it is approximately one
year—in an intensive care unit for such bullied
children.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000048" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000048">These

Some parents are threatened with prosecution for their child’s
absence. The school then advises the parents to remove their children
from the school roll to avoid prosecution. Once the child 
<?notus-xml column=500?>has been taken off the roll by the parent, of course, the local
authority and the school have no responsibility for that child’s
education.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102814000049" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000049">We
have heard that it is the experience of Red Balloon Learner Centres
over 17 years that more than 85% of the children who have been to one
have a learning difficulty when they first arrive. This manifests
itself in behaviour such as an inability to think, concentrate, think
logically, conduct lucid conversation, play, work with others or be a
team player—all these sorts of things are reflected in their
behaviour. Many children who are severely bullied do not have special
educational needs prior to this; there is no doubt about that. Most of
the children who fall into this category are intelligent, well behaved,
co-operative and looking for self-improvement, and most are eminently
recoverable, given that appropriate environment. Thus the SEN
provisions should be regarded as being temporary and short-lived but
intensive. If it were accepted that severely bullied self-excluded
children who were out of school were children with SEN, then they could
be statemented swiftly and efficiently within less than a school term
and referred to a specialist intensive care unit for a short-term
placement on a combined academic and therapeutic programme. The vast
majority of these children would recover and be able to return to
mainstream
education<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:12:05"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000050" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000050">It
is particularly interesting to look at some of the case studies that
have been supplied by Red Balloon. In case one, according to the child
and adolescent mental health service, a girl now in year 11 had, at the
end of year 9, requested a referral into Red Balloon because of the
severe bullying and subsequent trauma that she had experienced. The
local authority argued that the student was on roll at an academy and
so the decision whether or not to refer remained with that academy. The
academy was perfectly clear that it would not consider any referral
into alternative provision, for cost reasons. The academy has its own
provision for vulnerable students, and argued that the student’s
needs could be met by its on-site unit. The student is now approaching
the end of year 11. She has not attended at all since February. There
were multiple issues prior to that date, and she has no chance of
attaining any qualification this year. In a recent review, the
representatives of CAMHS argued that without a therapeutic element to
the programme, it was doomed to failure from the
outset<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:13:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102814000051" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102814000051">Case
two concerns a year 9 student who was form captain, captain of hockey
and netball, predicted straight As at GCSE and extremely popular with
her year. She shared indiscreet photos of herself with her boyfriend,
and when they broke up he posted those photos over the internet.
Subsequently she was so severely bullied by other students in the
school that she tried to take her own life three times in one night. In
desperation, her mother drove her to the A&amp;E department of the
local hospital, and a paediatric specialist on duty recommended that
this girl be educated for a temporary period in a small centre such as
Red Balloon. The parent contacted the centre, which in turn contacted
the school and the local authority, but the school refused to
contemplate this referral and suggested that the girl could go to its
inclusion unit. This required her walking through the school where the
bullies jeered 
<?notus-xml column=501?>and humiliated her and made crude comments. Inside the unit were
children who knew of the cyberbullying and continually bullied her.
Other children had special learning needs. There was no one like her in
this unit. She refused to go and, unsurprisingly, was out of school for
seven months<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode>.
Eventually, despite all efforts to get her referred to Red Balloon and
to find funding, her health deteriorated to such an extent that her
mother sent her to live in Israel with her
grandparents<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:15:50"></hs_TimeCode>.
Four<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:15:24"></hs_TimeCode> years on,
this girl, now 19, has completed no external exam, has not gone to
sixth form and has no prospect of a university career, even though that
was clearly predicted at 14. We are likely to face that kind of
situation more and more frequently given the position we are in and all
the possibilities that the internet provides us with, many of them,
sadly, not desirable.</hs_para>

Jones of Whitchurch:</Member></B> My Lords, before I speak to Amendment
127, I should say that I support the amendments tabled by the noble
Baroness, Lady Brinton. I pay tribute to the considerable amount of
work that she has done in campaigning on the needs of severely bullied
children<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:16:35"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102822000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102822000002">As
the noble Baroness said, this is a growing and worrying issue. This is
backed up by a recent DfE report which identified that 47% of children
reported being bullied at age 14, 41% at 15 and 29% at 16. This is a
significant proportion of young people. Many report that the bullying
is ongoing and for some of them it is an everyday event. There is also
growing evidence that this problem particularly affects children with
disabilities and special educational needs, who are, apparently, three
times as likely to be bullied, with verbal, emotional and physical
bullying prevalent. Again this is relevant to the debates that we have
had in
Committee<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:17:26"></hs_TimeCode>.
As<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:15:00"></hs_TimeCode> the noble
Baroness said, many of these children do not come to the attention of
the authorities but some are so traumatised that their behaviour,
school attendance and mental health begin to be affected. Figures have
been cited of more than 16,000 young people at any one time refusing to
attend school.</hs_para>

temporary SEN statement to access help and
support<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:18:08"></hs_TimeCode>. These
amendments, combined with ours, would go a considerable way towards

introduce a new clause to widen out the concerns to cover children who,
because they are bullied, suffer from a mental health problem or a
medical condition and are unable to attend mainstream school for a

incidence of bullying, the Teenage Cancer Trust and CLIC Sargent have
highlighted the fact that there are 3,600 new cancer diagnoses in
children and young people every year, which can also have a significant

victim of violence or abuse at

children and young people should not have to suffer because of their

thousands of children fall into the category of “severely
bullied” but are invisible, for two reasons. One is that often
the bullying takes place outside school, on the internet. The school
does not see it happening. Unless school staff look carefully at the
attendance record, or the parent is sufficiently distraught to bring it
to the school’s attention, the school may not notice what is
going on. The other unfortunate aspect is that often these children are
quite shy; they take themselves off, rather than put up with it. They
become 
<?notus-xml column=503?>visible to the rest of us only when they attempt suicide, or actually
succeed. Then they land on the front page of the local or national
newspaper. That is a
tragedy<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:22:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102822000011" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102822000011">When
the school becomes aware of this problem, it often suggests to the
parent that they educate the child at home. This is not the answer.
Many parents are not capable, either professionally or economically,
and cannot take the time off work to educate the child at home. They
need specialist, professional help. Nor is it an answer to send the
children to PRUs, for the reason my noble friend Lady Brinton has
mentioned. Indeed, I would say it is cruel to expect these children to
attend a PRU with a group of children of whom they are often
frightened. They are square pegs in round holes in PRUs, because they
are often children of great ability, and the provision offered in PRUs
will not address their problem and allow them to achieve their academic
potential<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:23:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102822000012" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102822000012">Virtual
schools can be an answer, but not the whole answer. These children need
therapeutic and restorative help from well trained people. That is why
my noble friend has suggested that what is needed is temporary special
educational needs provision. As to the cost, yes, the sort of provision
these children need is expensive, but it lasts for only a short period.
If it is done well, many of these children go back into a mainstream
school—perhaps a different one—after a relatively short
time, during which their confidence has been built up and their mental
health problems have been
addressed.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102822000013" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102822000013">If
this does not happen, it is not the school that pays but the state that
pays later. These children’s potential has not been realised;
they do not have the qualifications that they could have; they do not
have the well paid jobs that they could have, so do not pay so much
tax; and there may be ongoing mental health problems that have to be
addressed later in life by the health service. Although the school
saves money by not paying for this provision in the short term, the
public purse does pay—and, of course, the person who pays most
is the child themselves. We have a duty to give these children back
their education and indeed their lives. Provision is available, and it
could be expanded if only a more sensible approach were taken to
ensuring that the funding became available for these children. It is
not a lot to ask and, compared to many children who need special needs
provision for the whole of their school life—which of course
very often they deserve—these children require it for only a
very short period. What they need is very special provision from people
who really understand what they have gone through and what needs to be
put into place to enable them to face an ordinary education

Whitaker</B><B>:</B></Member> My Lords, the amendments in this group
are particularly important, with respect to one group of children in
particular. I declare an interest as chair of the Department for
Education’s stakeholder group on the education of Gypsy,
Traveller and Roma children. These are the children, particularly Irish
Traveller and Gypsy children, who between primary and secondary school
experience a 20% drop in attendance; one-fifth of children drop out.
From the material that I have seen, a very large part of this is 
<?notus-xml column=504?>due to bullying, although there are also cases when the parents are so
mistrustful of education and unwilling to expose their children to the
violence that they experience that they are complicit. Whatever the
reason, there is a gap in these children’s education. They are a
small number of children so they do not always appear in the
aggregates, but if you compare them to the population of Gypsy and
Traveller children, the numbers are huger than for any other ethnic
group in our country. That is why these amendments are of vital
importance<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:27:42"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102822000015" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102822000015">The

bring to the Committee’s attention the latest research from
Professor Jackson, the academic who had a very important role in
highlighting the deficits in educational outcomes for looked-after
children. The latest research has been into children with complex needs
across Europe and in this country. She has found that in other
countries these children find that their school is a refuge for them;
it is a place where they feel safe so that, no matter how disturbed
their family is, at least their school is a refuge. She looks
particularly at Denmark but also at several other continental
countries, and she draws a stark contrast with the experience of
children in England, who do not find a refuge in their school. That is
very concerning. It is also relevant to this particular group of
vulnerable young people whom we are discussing now. Finally, I thank

vulnerable children in our society. We are all on side on this, but for
this group of children who are temporarily unable to attend school,
there is no underpinning in legislation to help them. That is a
problem. Even if the essence of the content of the amendments is
unsuitable, the Minister needs to put something forward. If we do not

spend an awful lot of time trying to get children who do not want to go

welfare officers who chase them. We bring them in and have mentoring,

school but cannot go for reasons of their mental health, bullying or
whatever. We should think about that. If we were to put as much effort
into children who want to go to school, but cannot do so temporarily,
as we do with those who do not want to go to school, we would probably
have a stronger education system. It is that sort of area that is
missing. Anyone who has ever done any teaching will know that if a
child has been away, it is almost impossible to help them catch up when
they come back. The impact is not just on their learning but on the
learning of the rest of the class. If address this issue, we will be

Red Balloon argument. I, too, had the privilege of visiting a Red
Balloon school in Cambridge. I went not as an enthusiast of online
learning as I, too, thought that education was about mixing with
children socially. An obvious point that I missed was raised. For some
children who are temporarily out of school, it is the way to get back.
If we can get children learning online, where they do not have to face
other young people and adults, it is a stepping stone to getting
back<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:32:58"></hs_TimeCode>. Finally,
whether we like it or not, there is an incentive in the system for
schools not to purchase provision outside their own school. A statement
for children who have special educational needs mitigates that
incentive in the system for the school not to look to resources outside
itself. For this group of children, the incentive is still there for
the schools to handle it themselves. We need a bit of help on behalf of
these children so that we incentivise, make possible or demand that
resources outside the school can assist for what may be no more than a
week or a month. If it is only for a week or a month, and the children
continue to learn, it could do their future education a power of

Nash:</Member></B> My Lords, I shall speak to Amendments 74,
127 and 217 regarding severely bullied children and the education of
children unable to attend a mainstream school. I thank my noble friend
Lady Brinton for 
<?notus-xml column=506?>raising the important issue of bullying and the needs of young people
who are bullied. As the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, said, my noble
friend has been a great advocate for children and young people whose
lives have been blighted by bullying. Bullying in any form and for any
reason is totally unacceptable and should never be tolerated in
schools. Bullying can instil fear, damage self-esteem and reduce
academic attainment. We have a considerable campaign in place to combat
cyberbullying, which, as my noble friend Lady Walmsley mentioned, can
be particularly unpleasant. As our reforms work their way through the
school system, and behaviour management strategies improve—as I
believe that they are substantially in schools across the
country—that should help in this
regard<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:35:27"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000002" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000002">The
amendments broadly cover three areas: a call for bullying to be defined
in law; measures to prevent bullying happening in the first place and
to tackle it when it does; and provision for those who are the victims
of bullying, particularly those who are severely bullied.</hs_para>

bullying outlined in Amendment 74 suggests that bullying
will involve an “imbalance of power” and is repeated
behaviour that causes physical or mental harm. These elements are
likely to be involved in many instances of bullying, but not all of
them. The definition of severe bullying outlined in the amendment
refers to behaviour that affects children so severely that they suffer
trauma and psychological damage. There is a risk that that could cause
confusion for schools, because the same bullying activity could be
treated differently according to the effect that it has on the victims,
rather than the act itself. Although we acknowledge that the support
should take account of the effect, it is important that there is
consistency in how schools manage the behaviour of pupils.</hs_para>

exceptions to whatever definition is put in place, which is why we
consider that these matters are best placed at the discretion of head
teachers and teachers. We outline what constitutes bullying in our
advice to schools and we consider that that is the best place to do so,
rather than through a strict definition in law. A legal definition
could, among other things, rule out behaviour that common sense might
suggest is bullying but may not be captured by a law.</hs_para>

friend Lady Brinton’s point about guidance being in one place,
it is of course important that guidance is practical and manageable for
those using it. We are very happy to look at how the different pieces
of guidance fit together and cross-refer, in particular, in the current
consultation on the code.</hs_para>

bullying in the first place and tackling it when it does, as different
schools face different issues, we do not want to prescribe specific
anti-bullying strategies. Instead, we want to allow schools and local
authorities to address bullying in the light of the needs and

current position provides the right balance between requirements in
law, flexibility for schools and strict accountability.</hs_para>

behaviour policy with measures to prevent bullying. It is up to them to
develop their own strategies, but they are now clearly 
<?notus-xml column=507?>held to account for their effectiveness in doing so by Ofsted. Since
2012, it has been a requirement for school inspectors to take into
account issues relating to bullying, harassment and discrimination. In
addition, we provide schools with advice, with links to several
anti-bullying organisations for specific advice.</hs_para>

for children who are bullied, the starting point should be the needs
and welfare of children and young people and the state of their mental
and emotional health. Schools and local authorities should provide
support in a proportionate and tailored way to meet their needs. The
new draft SEN code of practice considers that developing a graduated
response to the varying levels of SEN among children and young people
is the best way to offer support, and this can include the needs of
bullied children. There is no separate legal status of a temporary
statement. However, local authorities and schools are free to use key
elements of the statementing process to make local
arrangements.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000009" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000009">The<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:35:22"></hs_TimeCode>
causes that affect the well-being of children and young people will be
relevant to how those needs are best addressed, but are not the best
guide to the level of need. A child’s well-being could be
severely affected by a variety of things, including bereavement, family
upheaval or severe bullying. It could result from a range of factors
that taken in isolation a child could cope with, but taken together
have a severe impact. It is important, therefore, to avoid creating a
hierarchy of causes and prescribe what the response should
be.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102835000010" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000010">Schools
know their pupils. They are alive to changes in behaviour, character
and attendance. They should offer support quickly, based on the need
they identify, and there is a wide range of options that they should
consider, from asking the pastoral team to keep an eye out to providing
formal counselling, engaging with parents, referring to local authority
children’s services, completing a common assessment framework
and referring to child and adolescent mental health services, including
whether to assess for SEN. The circumstances that my noble friend
describes will often need swift support. An EHC plan is intended for
those with the most challenging, complex and long-term needs. This is
reflected in the amount of time that it will take to deliver an EHC
plan—a maximum of 20 weeks under the reforms. In many cases,
offering a child or young person SEN support in the first instance will
be much more appropriate, and faster. Giving a child or young person an
EHC plan is a significant step and may not be necessary.</hs_para>

his civil servants about the definition of bullying because it seems to
me, and I am sure to others, that the key is the imbalance of power.
Most schools would accept that, although there may be some other issues
around the edges, the imbalance of power is absolutely at the core
between the aggressors and the victims. I am also grateful to the

concern. I am pleased that there are 33 alternative provision centres

also seemed to echo the response that the DfE has given elsewhere about
there being a lack of understanding of the importance of virtual or
cyberlearning access. That can often be the transition into education,
for exactly the reasons that the noble Baroness, Lady Morris, outlined.

new clause, which very much picks up on the point that the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, made in the debate about the importance of early
identification. We believe that identifying and supporting children
with SEN as early as possible is the most important factor in improving
their outcomes, so our new clause would put early years area SENCOs on
a statutory basis, like school SENCOs. It would require local
authorities to employ enough of them to support all the identified
needs locally. Clause 22 requires local authorities to seek to identify
children and young people in their area who may have SEN. Our amendment

professionals who work with children have a crucial role to play as the
first educators with whom those children come into contact. A number of
issues such as speech and communication problems, developmental delay,
behavioural issues and literacy problems can be better addressed by
having a good quality early years provider, meaning that children start
school in a much better position than they otherwise would have. Fewer
resources would then be required in later years, so the case is well

Wednesday, at a meeting with the Minister, when he confirmed that only
just over 10 years ago, 80% of communication between young people was
verbal and 20% electronic. That is now reversed, with 80% being
electronic and only 20% verbal. We need verbal communication above all
to enable us to engage not just with teachers but healthcare workers,
family, friends and ultimately with employers and customers. If we are
to enable our children to live in today’s world, it is crucial

79 requires schools and registered early years settings to identify
special educational needs while offering guidance on how to do so. This
is very important because, as we discovered when doing the report,
which I have mentioned several times, the health visitors who were
doing the early assessment in Northern Ireland were extremely glad that
they had been trained to do so by speech and language
therapists—not that they could offer therapy, but at least they
knew what signs to look for to alert them that somebody had a problem.

108 extends local offers to include access to services for children who
are educated in non-maintained early years settings. It should not be
restricted only to those with EHC plans, which, for the vast majority
of people who have children with speech, language and communication
needs, do not make them eligible for any additional support. That is
wrong. The people with speech, language and communication needs do need
support to enable them to engage. It is not just for those on EHC

116 requires local authorities to inform parents of what special
educational needs and local office support is available to children
educated in non-maintained early years settings. This is again
something that should not be left to chance because, as we know, there
is a vast variety of provision and a vast amount that parents do not

co-ordinate the giving out of that advice, which suggests that local

local authorities responsible for special educational needs provision
to those who have them identified in private, voluntary and independent

238 highlights something that else that is lacking and is not clear
from the Bill. Schedule 4 to the Bill amends the Childcare Act 2006 to
require the registration of childminder agencies and certain childcare
providers on childcare registers. However, the Bill is currently
unclear about the position regarding private, voluntary and independent
providers. As nearly 80% of the early years providers come from the
private, voluntary or independent sector, this seems to be a gap that
needs to be filled. We must ensure that everyone is covered. I am not
simply saying that there is a gap; I am trying to suggest that there
may be a way out of this. I suggest that all childminder agencies
should be required to employ a SENCO, and that all non-maintained
providers—that is, all the PVI providers—should be
required to register with one of these childminder agencies. In that
way, the SENCO can relieve the PVI of what the Government have said
that they do not want to do, which is to belabour it with too much
bureaucratic work that it has to do. A SENCO with the same status as
the others would be able to act as a bridge between these 80% of
providers and the local authorities to ensure that every child is
covered<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T16:57:40"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000037" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000037">Again,

Perry of Southwark (Con):</Member></B> My Lords, my concern in this
whole topic is that I make a fair estimate that a lot of childminders
are not trained or equipped to identify children with special needs.
Surely the agency that ought to pick up special educational needs very
early is the district nurse, who visits in the very early stages of a
child’s life. One of the things that they are trained to do is
to test for special needs. Is this not an opportunity, in this Bill
that is trying so hard and so admirably to bring together all the
different services, such as health services and educational services,
to tie up the measurement, the testing and the observations that a good
district nurse will make of a baby—and that I guess a midwife
would make—to ensure that this is passed on to the childminders?
Here we are very much occupied, rightly, in pointing out the things
that need to be done when a child has been identified, but there is
very little about how the identification takes place. I would be
grateful if the Minister could make 
<?notus-xml column=513?>some reference to how this could be brought about. It is not asking for
anything new; it is asking for exactly what the Bill tries to do, which

it is hugely important that there is early identification and early

ensure a more codified standard. However, there are some cracking,
fantastic individual childminders. There is a danger that we will lose
that whole body of people who do not want to be part of an agency but
who have real talent and expertise, as we go headlong to have agencies
which have to do all the following things. I am quite nervous about

granddaughter came to visit us, we found it very difficult to
understand what she was saying. When she got to the age of three and a
half my husband, who was a schoolteacher, was saying, “Huh, huh,
huh” or “Ber, ber, ber” to her to try to get her
to pronounce things. My daughter got into a furious rage and took her
home, but then realised that the child could not communicate and was
getting very frustrated because we could not understand what she was
saying. She took her to a speech therapist. On the health service, it
would have been 14 or 15 months before she could get help, so she took
her privately. My granddaughter was diagnosed as being quite severely
dyspraxic. She struggled through school but got her A-levels and is now
deliriously happy at university doing a course in fine arts,
restoration and conservation, which is right up her street. She was
caught early, which is so important. She will have a career; everyone

Government want to reassure noble Lords that local authorities must
ensure that all providers that they fund in the maintained, private,
voluntary and independent sectors effectively meet the needs of
children with SEN and disabilities. Local authorities should remove
barriers in access to early education and work with parents to give
each child support to fulfil its potential. All early years providers,
regardless of how they are funded, must follow the welfare requirements
set out in the EYFS framework to have and to implement a policy and
procedures for children with SEN and disabilities. This should include
how the needs of these children will be met and how reasonable
adjustments will be made. Providers are also required to assess
children regularly and to keep parents informed. They must consider
whether a child has a special educational need or disability which
requires specialist support. They should link with families and help
them to access relevant services from other agencies as appropriate.
These requirements are reflected in the draft SEN code of practice,
which also gives practical guidance to early years providers on
responding to special educational needs. I hope that the noble Lord,

support children with SEN. I heard the reason he gave for taking that
route, and I hope that to some extent what I have already said has
reassured him that there is not quite the gap he is seeking to plug
here. I also note what my noble friend Lord Storey said about this. The
provision to create childminder agencies in Part 4 is an enabling one.

the role of the SENCO in early years. It makes clear that the SENCO

the SENCO is not required to have a particular qualification.
Currently, and in the draft code, only SENCOs in schools and maintained

75, tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, seeks to require local

have spoken in this debate. I think that we all share the common

to make sure that special educational needs are identified at the

contributions it was asked who should be responsible for some of that
identification. We feel that early years area SENCOs in the model 
<?notus-xml column=517?>that we have proposed could be the people to take on that
responsibility, although I understand that everybody else whom noble
Lords have mentioned could also play a role in that. That model has
already been developed by local authorities as a way of taking on some
of that responsibility, and it is important that the people in those
posts are properly trained and supported. I was slightly disappointed
by what the Minister said about not requiring them to be trained and
qualified, because it seems to me that we have already identified a
skills lack among some of these people. This is an opportunity to
address that lack, and it will be a shame if we do not embrace it when
we have the opportunity to do so.</hs_para>

not in employment, education or training—more than nine in 10
young people with experience of being a NEET are motivated to learn,

opportunities felt that there were barriers associated with access to

her maths teacher. That was extremely helpful, but unfortunately other
teachers did not seem to have time to give her work to do before she
went into hospital. She was provided with some home tuition by the
local authority, but it was not co-ordinated with the school and the
local authority had virtually no level of understanding of her
assessment in school. Then, when she was in hospital for an extended
stay, the hospital school—again—had no links back to her
school to get any idea about where she was. Given that this young lady
was in year 8 at the time, it was very important, as she was coming up
to choosing her options for GCSE, that the work was appropriate for how
much she could manage but also at an appropriate level for when she
could manage it.</hs_para>

amendments from the noble Lord, Lord Patel, and the noble Countess,
Lady Mar, on blended learning and virtual education go some way to
addressing the holes that these children often fall through.
Alternative provision, simply by its nature, has to be bespoke for
these children, and often they work in very small groups. There has to
be better communication between the alternative providers, these
children’s schools and local authorities. Small teaching groups
require proper funding for children that recognises their special
problems and incentivises their schools to release the funding as
appropriate, linked with the school communicating with the alternative
provider and, hopefully, levels being reported back to the school when
the child re-enters. That is why I particularly support the idea of
online distance learning combined with face-to-face support, which can
provide outstanding methods of blended learning engagement for young
people, but particularly those who are out of school.</hs_para>

particularly acute needs, a special educational institution may be
appropriate. These institutions provide face-to-face teaching and are
subject to rigorous accountability arrangements. They also support
social, emotional and physical development in a way that more isolated
approaches to learning struggle to replicate. Wherever possible, the

particularly the last ones that he made about working with the
charitable organisations that work with children with cancers and other
health conditions. My concern was not that he was not personally
sincere about making sure that all these children got a good education,
nor that the guidance already issued and the amendments that the
Government have brought in do not go a long way towards making sure of
that. My concern was that, while the intention is to ensure that all
children get their education in mainstream education, which I agree is
the best for them, there are times when these children cannot be in
mainstream education because of their conditions. It is the gap that
occurs—the provision that is not there to continue their
education—that makes them fall behind when they re-enter
mainstream education. It was in filling that gap that I was hoping to
see whether I could be some help through the amendments. However, I am
reassured by what the Minister has said, and I hope that he and his
team can work with those who are concerned to ensure that the guidance
produces the required emphasis to make sure that this education for
children continues in alternative provision. I beg leave to withdraw
the amendment.</hs_para>

point that we support the amendments tabled by the noble Baroness, Lady

before I go on to the substance of our amendments, I should like to ask
the Minister about the wording of the entire clause. I should be
grateful if she could put on record exactly what the clause means and
what it would require local authorities and health bodies to do. I say
this because the clause does not seem to be about requiring local
authorities to secure services through commissioning; rather, it
appears to require them to set up the apparatus through which decisions
about commissioning will be taken. Obviously, that is a very great
difference. It says that a local authority and partner bodies must make
arrangements; it does not say that they must jointly secure provision.
It does not even say that they must secure the provision that they have
agreed is needed. This is especially important with regard to health,
where other legislation can be used to absolve them from improving
legislation on the grounds of, for example, cost. So far as I can see,
there is no mechanism for anyone to challenge such
decisions<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:55:47"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

is that Clause 26 as it stands simply builds a procedural structure
that really does not have any teeth. Furthermore, I cannot see any
leverage by which the partner bodies will be accountable for what they
decide to commission. We have not tabled any amendments on these points
as it would have meant a substantial rewriting of the whole clause, but
I would be very grateful if the Minister could address the point about
what is intended by the wording and how partner bodies will be held

turn to our Amendments 88 and 90B. Our concern is that the needs of
families, including those where the child does not have an EHC plan,
are met as completely as possible. It is important that the kind of
provision subject to joint commissioning is not just the kind that goes
directly to the child or young person relating to either special
educational provision, healthcare provision or social care provision,
but includes support for families to enable them better to support the
child and their siblings. Supporting a child with SEN or disabilities
can be incredibly stressful for families, and it is important that we
assist and support parents and families with the tools to understand
and support their child’s special educational needs or
disability.</hs_para>

support that was given to the families of children with special
educational needs. I have referred to the fact that the Minister in the
Commons referred people to the Children Act 2004. In summary, our point
is that if we are going to have a Bill like this that aims to be
transformative, it really should put all the responsibilities in one
place. Just saying, “Well, this is already covered in bits of
other Bills and guidance here and there”, is not the point at
issue. If we think that support for families is important, and I know
from other meetings with the Minister that he believes that, they
should all be covered in the Bill. That is why we tabled these
amendments, because we would like to see all these provisions brought

work together to commission services for children and young people with
low-incidence needs. For very low-incidence conditions, such as sensory
impairment, it may not be appropriate to expect that specialist
provision is made available in every local authority area. For that
reason, there should be regional support services co-funded by a number

Bill creates new duties on health and education services to work

of joint working across local authority boundaries, despite the obvious
potential benefits to services to children with special educational
needs. Children with sensory impairments have a low-incidence special
educational need and disability, or LISEND. The National Sensory

with a LISEND are a diverse group in terms of their needs and the
nature of the support they require. There is often a lack of expertise
in those needs in local authorities and/or insufficient capacity.
Indeed, although local authorities are required by section 7 of the
2006 Department of Health deafblind guidance to identify and provide
specialist assessments for deafblind children, the identification rate
is only three MSI children per 100,000, but Sense figures suggest that
the rate should be 31 per 100,000.
These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T17:36:13"></hs_TimeCode> figures
indicate that local authorities do not have sufficiently qualified
assessors, and that deafblind children and young people are receiving
generic assessments that fail to address their specific needs.
Deafblind children are also not receiving adequate specialist support
in many areas. The Consortium for Research into Deaf
Education—CRIDE—found that 18% of services employed two
or fewer teachers of the deaf, and 8% employed one or fewer teachers of
the deaf. Fifteen per cent of services reported that each visiting
teacher of the deaf was supporting, on average, 80 or more deaf
children, and 7% had a ratio in excess of one to a

other amendments are to do with something I find odd about Clause 26.
Although on the face of it local authorities and partner health bodies
are required to make, have regard to and keep under review joint
commissioning arrangements, there is no obligation on them to operate
any of those arrangements, let alone to reach agreement. That seems
very peculiar. Even when they operate the arrangements and reach
agreement, the resulting provision is limited to what they agree to be
reasonably
required<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:17:49"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000123" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000123">I
go back to my amendment to Clause 21(5), because, as I mentioned then,
health bodies may well argue that their position is constrained by what
they consider necessary. Given how many such bodies apparently give
very low priority to speech, language and communication needs and the
provision of speech and 
<?notus-xml column=531?>language therapists, that might mean that little or no speech language
therapy would be provided for children or young people other than those
who are on EHC plans. This brings us back to the problem of the vast

26 does not allow the assumption that children without plans will get
what they require; nor does it mention any requirement to publicise
what arrangements and agreements are available for parents or the
people affected; and it does nothing to ensure that there is

designed to strengthen Clause 26 by making its tone
“must” rather than
“discuss”.</hs_para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-10-28?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOL/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_10_28_PT_1/AA8CA7AA4BF6B5322E5A7F10E8D57A487926EDAE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>1</House><System>5</System><Sitting short-date=" 28 October 2013">Monday,

Northover:</Member></B> My Lords, this group of amendments relates to
Clauses 25 and 26, which deal with promoting integration and joint
commissioning. These provisions are at the centre of our reforms and I
am grateful to noble Lords for their careful consideration of these
issues. Children and young people with special educational needs need
integrated services. Too often they have to tell their story over and
again, and too often they or their parents struggle to navigate a
system that makes no sense either to them or to the professionals who
are supposed to be helping them. In this mini-debate we have had an
echo of the discussions we had on both the Health Bill and the Care
Bill, where noble Lords were very keen, as were the Government, to take
forward better integration and working together across these areas.
Noble Lords who have just come from the Care Bill will be extremely
well aware of how the Government have sought to take this forward,
addressing how people have so often fallen between the cracks. This,
too, is part of the attempt to ensure that those with special
educational needs are better supported and that the authorities
responsible for them work more closely together.</hs_para>
<hs_para UID="13102835000126" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000126">These<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:20:58"></hs_TimeCode>
clauses seek to tackle those issues head on. The integration duty sits
alongside duties for a local authority and its local partners to
co-operate with each other. I remember extremely clearly, as other
noble Lords no doubt will, how integration, as debated in the Health
Bill, had to be part of the new arrangements for the health service.
This echoes much of that. It links closely to the joint commissioning
clause that provides the statutory framework to enable partners to work
together effectively to deliver a better experience for the child or
young person and their families, and support improved outcomes. Joint
commissioning sets out the framework for key elements, such as the
local offer, education, health and care plan assessments, and personal
budgets. It seeks to improve both the working relationships between
local authorities and health bodies, and the provision to children and
young people with special educational needs. It requires the local
authority and health bodies to establish clear procedures for making
decisions and, in particular, to agree what support is needed locally
and which agency will deliver it. Crucially, they must agree how they
will resolve disputes between partners, as well as how they will deal
collectively with complaints concerning education, health and care
provision.</hs_para> 
<?notus-xml column=532?><hs_para UID="13102835000127" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000127">The new draft SEN code
of practice’s chapter on joint commissioning has developed a
great deal, and I hope it may help to reassure noble Lords to know that
it puts great store on the importance of making decisions in joint
commissioning arrangements—an issue to which the noble Lord,
Lord Ramsbotham, has just referred. It specifies that the arrangements
should be robust enough to ensure that all partners are clear about who
is responsible for what, who the decision-makers are across education,
health and care and how partners will hold each other to account where
there is a dispute. It recognises the importance of getting elected
members and chief executives across education, health and social care
on board, and recommends that the arrangements for children and young
people with SEN should be specifically accountable to councillors and
senior commissioners. It recognises that local accountability can take
the form of a programme board, acting as a bridge between the local
authority’s education and social care leadership and
health
partners.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000128" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000128">It
also reflects that health bodies must work with the local authority in
commissioning integrated, personalised services and designing the local
offer, including ensuring that relevant contracts with providers
reflect the needs of the local population. Local authorities, clinical
commissioning groups and NHS England should develop effective ways of
harnessing the views of their local communities so that commissioning
decisions on services for those with SEN are shaped by people’s
experiences and aspirations. The dovetailing of the SEN reform clauses
with the NHS reforms is central. The NHS mandate requires clinical
commissioning groups to consider the needs of children and young people
with SEN and disabilities, so we see immediately the crossover. The
Health and Social Care Act reforms require local authorities and
clinical commissioning groups to participate in the health and
well-being board and to produce a joint strategic needs assessment and
a joint health and well-being strategy that sets out how local needs
will be met. So the needs are to be identified, and plans have to be
put in place as to how they are met.</hs_para>

well-being board has a duty—and I well remember it—to
encourage integrated working. For the purpose of advancing the health
and well-being of the people in its area, it must encourage people who
arrange for the provision of health or social care services in the area
to work in an integrated manner. As I said, the Care Bill has been
taking that further forward and making it a
reality<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:25:22"></hs_TimeCode>. I hope
that that context helps when looking at how we are trying to tackle the
needs of these particularly vulnerable children.</hs_para>

friend Lady Sharp said about the probing nature of her amendment. As
ever, she probes extremely effectively. She is seeking to explore how

wondered whether SENCOs would have too much on their plate. Since 2009,
the Government have funded more than 10,000 new SENCOs to study for the
National Award for SEN Coordination. We will support a further 800
places in 2013-14 and this 
<?notus-xml column=533?>will help them in their important role in linking with other agencies,
such as health and social care. I hope that that helps to take this
matter forward.</hs_para>

of the amendments in this group reflect an apparent desire to puts lots
of detail in the Bill. This is an argument with which everyone here
will be very familiar—whether it is necessary to specify certain
things in the Bill in order to make sure that certain things happen. I
am sure that we are all seeking to go in the same direction, which is
to achieve what the Bill sets out to do. From noble Lords’
probing as to whether it is going to be delivered by the Bill as it is,
I certainly sense that there is agreement on
that<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:27:23"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para>

will also be familiar with the fact that if you specify in great detail
in a Bill, you can inadvertently exclude things that you have not
included. That is why there is always discussion about what happens in
guidance and secondary legislation and so on, and that is why I am so
pleased that we have the SEN guidance. It is comprehensive and, I hope,
addresses a number of issues that noble Lords are concerned about. From
that guidance, your Lordships can see how the Bill translates into what

appreciate, we feel that there is a danger that if too much is
specified in the Bill, that will then hinder the kind of flexibility
that may also be required at a local level. Noble Lords who heard the
pathfinder organisations, which came to address us the other day,
probably share my feeling that the often very imaginative and creative
ways in which they were going about their work and the way they were
working with other organisations in their local areas to address the
needs of the children were very impressive. One would not wish to do
anything that stifled that. One would wish to support them in taking
that forward. The aims of what one is seeking to achieve and the

Howarth of Breckland:</Member></B> I have not spoken in this debate but
I should like to ask the noble Baroness a question. The thing that
concerns me greatly as a practitioner is the variableness of how
co-operation takes place across the country. In some places, certainly
where there are special projects such as pathfinders, it works well,
but in my experience some authorities do not make timely decisions,
which can mean that placements are not agreed, and again I refer to my
experience in adult colleges for severely disabled young people. If a
local authority cannot agree between its own social services provision
and its education provision, how does it then hope to get co-ordination
across the piece?</hs_para>

it is not always good to have too much detail in a Bill, but how
through the guidance will we ensure consistency across the country so

Northover:</Member></B> I hear what the noble Baroness says, and she
speaks from a great deal of experience. That is the kind of challenge
that has led to us trying 
<?notus-xml column=534?>to move forward across the board on SEN to ensure that what is provided
for children is more uniform and more joined up. If need be, I will
write with more detail in response to her but, as I said, what the
pathfinders were saying was encouraging. They said that they would link
up with those who came after to try to spread best practice. As noble

that may be
wanting.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000138" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000138">That
links up with an issue raised by the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, about
how families might hold their local authority and CCGs to account for
having arrangements for joint commissioning in place. Ultimately,
families could take out a judicial review, but we believe that there
are other, more effective ways to hold local bodies to account through
local complaints procedures and through NHS England, which will review
how CCGs are fulfilling their duties under the NHS mandate. I remind
noble Lords that the NHS mandate refers specifically to children and

note that service providers must take responsibility themselves for how
they best use their resources to provide services for children and

final paragraph in Amendment 86 highlights the importance of key
workers, which is something that we support and have specifically

treatments and to work out what was effective. An NHS that was free at
point of need, universal and comprehensive had to make sure that what
it was providing to the population made sense and that clinicians would
agree as to what was an effective treatment and so on. All of

the bodies that are in touch with all people from nought to 25, I hope

that we do not want lots of detail in the Bill and I think that we all

thought our amendments on this issue were rather neat and not full of
detail. Our proposals, about providing any other provision deemed
necessary to meet the special educational needs of the child or young
person, were intended to include the family context and so on. That was
not about too much detail—obviously the detail can be spelt out

feel that they were included in the Bill. I take the Minister’s

noble Baroness, Lady Howe, spoke about local authorities working across
boundaries. I assure her that we agree that, working together, local
authorities can secure more cost-effective, high quality provision for
children and young people with the most complex needs. Many authorities
already have such arrangements in place and we encourage it through the
new draft SEN code of practice, which includes, in section 4.4, a
specific section on regional collaboration. As the noble Baroness
spells out, it is in local authorities’ interest to do so. The
provision stipulated in education, health and care plans will reflect
individual need and local authorities will have to ensure that it is
provided<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T18:42:48"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_para><hs_para UID="13102835000153" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0001.htm#13102835000153">The
noble Baroness highlighted effectively how there may be just one or two
children with particular needs in one area, and it makes a lot of sense
to collaborate with those in other areas. That is why Clause 30 sets
out that local offers must cover provision outside the local authority
area for children and young people for whom the authority is
responsible. Making this an explicit part of the local offer will mean
that authorities have to take steps to make these arrangements up
front, and allow parents to challenge whether the best arrangements are
being made. For specific cases, Clause 31 goes further and
requires other local authorities to comply with requests for
co-operation, as long as doing so does not compromise their own duties.
That provides a further spur for local authorities to consider in
advance suitable joint arrangements for providing for children and
young people with specific

look across the Room. I believe that the Minister has spent most of his
life working in business. I am sure, therefore, that he would see the
merits of this amendment; if he ran a business that was in danger of
losing a major customer, he would want to find out why and then to put
in place an action plan to deliver what the customer wanted, thereby
keeping the business. Amendment 98A does just that. The provider of the
service is required to engage with the user to ensure that what is
provided is what is needed. That seems sensible to

turn to Amendment 99. Clause 27 requires local authorities to keep
education and care provision under review. While that is welcome, in
the view of the Opposition it is insufficient. Amendment 99 would
require local authorities to assess whether there was sufficient
funding in place to be able to secure these services for all the
children and young people who needed them. If they found that they
lacked the wherewithal, they should consider jointly commissioning
services with neighbouring local authorities where

these reforms. Parents, children and young people should be able to

and our amendment requires local authorities to consider working
together and sharing services with neighbouring authorities. I believe

Amendment 99 would not constrain local authorities to work with others

improving services for children and young people. The amendment was
dismissed in the other place, where the Minister said that the decision

needs must remain one for the local authority. We would certainly agree
with that, but nevertheless Amendment 99 highlights a problem and seeks
to find a solution. If the Government recognise that there is a problem
but do not want to accept this amendment as a solution, will the
Minister explain how they will ensure that local authorities deliver
the services that young people and children need and that they are
accountable for providing those services? In other words, if the

funding check before proceeding with implementing the reforms. At
Second Reading, I highlighted the fact that many local authorities are
already cutting support services for children with SEN. The National

will be cutting specialist support services for deaf children this
year, and RNIB and Sense are concerned that similar cuts are being made
to other services for children with SEN

SEN reform has the potential to do more harm than good unless it is
adequately funded and implemented properly. Earlier this month, the
Department for Education published its impact evaluation of the SEN
pathfinder programme. It found that in the first 18 months of the
programme the median cost to pathfinders of implementing the reforms
was £330,000. If that was applied across all local
authorities, we would be looking at a total cost of more
than £50 million. Earlier this summer, the Department
for Education announced that non-pathfinder areas would receive
start-up funding to support the implementation of the SEN reform. That
came to a total of £9 million, or about £75,000 per
authority. There is a huge funding gap between those two

far too many families the process of accessing support for their

navigating their way around a complex, inflexible system which is still
steeped in bureaucracy. All too often parents feel that they have to be
persistent and tireless if they are to get the services they need, with
only articulate families or those who shout the loudest—in
essence, probably, more middle-class families—being listened to.
Therefore, accountability around the local offer for services, on which
almost 1.4 million children will be reliant, must be as robust as
possible so that families can ensure that the services they need are

where they need more expensive support further down the line as a

working. Too often parents feel powerless and that their needs are not
being listened to. As a consequence they are forced to fight for a
statement of special educational needs or to go to a tribunal to get
the right support for their child. This is, and remains an unacceptable
situation. It wastes time, money, resources and can be emotionally
draining for parents who already face immense challenges on a
day-to-day basis. Indeed, I echo the chair of the Education Select

seek the publication of an action plan if the education and social care
is deemed insufficient. I assure them that there is already scope in
our provisions for children and young people with SEN and their
parents, and local providers, to be involved in improving provision
where it is insufficient. Clause 19 clearly sets out the guiding
principle of the SEN provisions, which is all about putting children,
their parents and young people at the heart of what the local authority
does. It sets out the importance of involving children, their parents,
and young people as fully as possible, and includes the need to support
them to achieve the best possible

parents, and young people, are also central to the local offer. Local
authorities will be under a duty to review their local offer in Clause
30(5) —noble Lords have made reference to that—and
regulation 4 of the draft local offer regulations sets out who they
must consult in such a review. Local authorities will also be under a
duty to publish comments on the local offer under Clause 30(6). Noble
Lords, again, made reference to

Low, was probing on accountability and how the review would then, as it
were, have teeth. We understand the noble Lord’s points about
accountability, and we will be discussing this in a later group.
Perhaps we can return then to how that will be done. However, I would
say that the local offer in Clause 30(6) will require local authorities
to publish their response to comments that they get from children,
their parents and young people, so there is a major incentive there to
act.</hs_para> <hs_para UID="13102835000194" url="/pa/ld201314/ldhansrd/text/131028-gc0002.htm#13102835000194">That is
also made clear in Chapter 5 of the code of practice, which says that
local authorities should publish an explanation of the action they are
taking to respond to the comments. It is not simply a case of
publishing what that response is. This brings transparency—a
point that the noble Baroness, Lady Jones, made previously—and
potential publicity. We must bear in 
<?notus-xml column=545?>mind that local authorities are themselves accountable to their
electorate. In the debate on the previous group, I mentioned other ways
in which people could hold local authorities to account. However, I do
not think that it is going to be very comfortable for local authorities

are doing what they are doing. That is certainly worth bearing in
mind<hs_TimeCode time="2013-10-28T19:15:28"></hs_TimeCode>. As I

that local authorities need to consider resources. Subsection (2)

period of review of government spending. We have also ensured that we
will not be reclaiming SEN funding from the local authorities as part

a little more the question of financing in response to the noble

required level in reading, in particular through our support for
systematic, synthetic phonics, and our reform of the national
curriculum. The phonics check identifies six-year-olds who are below
the expected level in reading and gives them extra reading support from
their teachers. From September 2011 to October 2013, the Department has
offered match-funding of up to £3000 to all state-funded primary
schools with Key Stage 1 pupils, so that they can purchase effective
systematic synthetic phonics materials and teacher training. Over the
last two years 
<?notus-xml column=222?>13,400 schools have claimed around £21 million of Government
money to buy high-quality phonics products or training so they can
improve their teaching. The new national curriculum, which will come

all children leave primary school fully literate and ready to progress
