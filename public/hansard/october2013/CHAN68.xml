in the House celebrates the value of apprenticeships in providing
opportunities and developing skills, and my private Member’s
Bill would help to promote more of that. It is vital that we have more
quality apprenticeship opportunities, particularly for young people,
especially at a time when nearly 1 million of them are still out of
work. Surely it is common sense that the Government and public
authorities are uniquely placed to use the leverage of the money they
already spend on procurement to help promote skills training and
provide new apprenticeship opportunities. This should be part of the
procurement process, where appropriate.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T09:35:53"></hs_TimeCode>The Bill is a
relatively simple idea: every supplier winning public contracts worth
more than £1 million may be asked to offer
apprenticeship opportunities in those public contracts, if that is what
the public body seeks to promote.</hs_Para>

I should set out the problems in constituencies such as mine and how my
Bill could help. Given  the stubborn long-term unemployment and
youth unemployment in my constituency and many others like it, there is
much more that local and national Government could and should do,
including through their agencies and other public bodies. In Denton and
Reddish, youth unemployment in September was still at 7.6%, compared
with 5.9% nationally, in the 18 to 24 age group. Representing a
constituency with such levels of long-term unemployment and youth
unemployment, I think it is clear that more has to be done to
help<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T09:37:06"></hs_TimeCode>. The blunt
truth is that many of the jobs in my area are low skilled and low wage,

the work force, and to raise ambition, opportunities and life chances

provide us with inspirational ways of realising our ambitions and
enabling us to break the current cycle. One good example is the 50/50
scheme set up by my own Labour-controlled Tameside council, which
awards up to 50 apprenticeship grants of £1,000 to employers who
take on a 16, 17 or 18-year-old Tameside resident. Over the past few
years Tameside council, working closely with the Connexions service,
has gradually reduced the number of young people in my constituency who
are not engaged in employment, education or training. Some of those
young people want to learn while they are in work, and the initiative
is intended to ensure that they have the opportunity to do so.

Notwithstanding all that good work, however, it is a sad state of
affairs when fewer than one in 10 employers offer apprenticeships. Far
too many young people are being told that they have an apprenticeship
after a course lasting 12 weeks or less, and one in five apprentices
receive no actual training of any kind. I believe that, between them,
Government procurement and my Bill could enable us to change that
position<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T09:42:00"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

my party’s record in this regard. Under the last Labour
Government, the number of apprenticeships more than quadrupled. We
launched the official Office of Government Commerce guidance to
encourage the growth of apprenticeships, whose principles are also
evident in the Bill. I have been informed by both the Public Bill
Office and the House of Commons Library that it is still the most
relevant guidance for apprentices. The last Labour Government proceeded
with major projects such as the kick-start housing scheme and Building
Schools for the Future, and their work with the contractors on the
Olympic park resulted in the creation of thousands of new
apprenticeship opportunities as part of public procurement. That is a
legacy of which I think we can be rightly proud.</hs_Para>

boroughs. That was crucial to ensuring that young people in some of the

apprenticeships as part of their bid if the public body wants that. My
Bill would ensure that all apprenticeships offered as part of a public
procurement contract would have to be advertised to all local workers,
ensuring that those looking for a job would have a chance to apply and

there was some good practice in the national health service, this is
one area where we have witnessed in recent months the rolling back of
skills training. I do not know whether that is because the new NHS
bodies have been so fixated on reorganisation that they rather
neglected skills training, or whether it is purely because some of the
new bodies do not realise that they have the power when commissioning
services—as clinical commissioning groups have, as providers of
public services—to ask some of the people bidding for those
contracts to provide apprenticeships. My Bill would make it quite clear
that public bodies—my definition would encompass clinical

work on the projects come from far away? I think of a project locally,
on Merseyside, not naming any names, where there is a lot of ill
feeling that people are travelling long distances—from as far
away as Bristol—to work on it. Does he agree that a scheme such

reason why my Bill makes it clear that those opportunities for

local young people in constituencies such as Liverpool, Wavertree will
have access to those skills training positions that are being made
available in the city of Liverpool. At any one time, umpteen posts will
be being made available in Liverpool, but if we do not tell young
people in Liverpool—as is in my constituency, there is
structural, long-term unemployment and long-term youth unemployment
there—we shall never break that cycle. This very simple measure

is worth placing on the record that the cross-party Business,

similar approach in respect of public procurement. The House of Commons
Committee argued that the Government should aim for the benchmark used

Willmott Dixon 
<?notus-xml column=1209?>and Laing, whereby for every £1 million spent
by Government Departments and their agencies on public procurement, at
least one new apprenticeship place
should be created. Some estimates suggest that that could create tens
of thousands of apprenticeships, although my Bill is much less

might help if I started with those parts of the Bill and the hon.
Gentleman’s speech with which  I agree the most, and
they relate to his desire, which I share passionately, that
apprenticeships must be of a certain quality, which has not always been
the case. That is not a party-political point because it has probably
been the case under successive Governments. Everyone knows the value
that people place upon apprenticeships, and political parties of all
persuasions have realised that the public have a great deal of faith in
what might be called old-fashioned apprenticeships and have jumped 
<?notus-xml column=1212?>on the apprenticeship bandwagon and tried to suggest that they are
bringing them back. What the public have thought of as apprenticeships
has not necessarily matched what they delivered. Some apprenticeships
became nothing more than the sort of on-the-job training that would
take place when someone was recruited to a new job,  to which
people attached the name “apprenticeship” to make them
look good, make them sound good, and make the Government look good with
the numbers, when really it was no such thing. What I most welcome in
what the hon. Gentleman has said today is his desire to ensure that the
quality of apprenticeships remains

misguided and would lead to some unintended consequences. If it is not
compulsory, it is completely unnecessary, because any public body can
do these things anyway. The hon. Gentleman made an interesting point
about EU procurement and the role that that plays in this, but I will

reason why the hon. Gentleman is right about the quality of
apprenticeships is that that is how they started in the reign of
Elizabeth I. They were very limited and they lasted between seven and
14 years, which was far in excess of the time needed to obtain skills
in a particular sector, but it showed that the person who
had passed their apprenticeship was an expert in their field. That is
what I would like us to return to; not necessarily that they would take
up to 14 years to complete, but that a completed apprenticeship would
allow someone to be perceived as an expert in their field. The hon.

consider a system of carrots and sticks to ensure that employers and
employees get the most out of apprenticeships, because they are a
massive investment for both and it is essential that both keep their

to where apprenticeships first started and probably help the
apprentices.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000114" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0001.htm#13110151000114">I
support what the Government are doing to improve the quality of
apprenticeships, because it seems to me—the Minister will
correct me if I am wrong, although I hope that I am not—that
they are trying to make them much more employer-led. That bottom-up
approach means that employers are provided with the skills they need
and can train people to do things that are of value in the workplace,
rather than something that is academic and does not achieve anything
practical.</hs_Para>

Government have also been trying to make apprenticeships more robust
and to ensure that they mean something, and that is exactly the way to
go. They must not just be a name tacked on to the back of any kind of
training. Given the success of the Government’s apprenticeship
scheme—I have heard many figures for the number of apprentices,
but it seems to be around a few hundred thousand—it seems to me
that we should be encouraging the Government to pursue their current
strategy, rather than reinventing the wheel, because it seems to be
working well. We have heard examples of people turning down
opportunities to do degrees in order to do apprenticeships because they
see them as a better route to success. I think that is to be commended.
The Government are doing such a good job, so it seems bizarre to
consider interfering with something that is working particularly
well.</hs_Para>

am pleased that apprenticeships, as a result of the Government’s
desire to make them more rigorous and credible, are finally getting the
status they deserve. I have long believed that far too many people go
to university. The education system had become a kind of conveyor belt
that people could not get off until they finished university, and not
going to university was frowned on. That was greatly damaging, because
too many people were leaving university but could not get graduate
jobs, and now they will have lots of debt, which I regret. I never
agreed with tuition fees, either their introduction by the Labour party
or their increase 
<?notus-xml column=1215?>by this Government, all of which I opposed. Those people became
disillusioned. I think that it has helped foster an
attitude of wanting to start at the top, because the concept of
starting at the bottom and working their way up has become alien to too
many people. I think that the status apprenticeships now have, with
people learning something worthwhile on the job and seeing a path to a
future career, is something we should all celebrate.</hs_Para>

not to focus on these industries, but the Government seem to be saying
that the focus should be on the really highly skilled industries,
including aerospace, digital, energy and utilities, electro, technical,
financial services, food and drink manufacturing, life sciences and
industrial sciences. They are the future of the British economy. We
have to target those high-tech, highly skilled industries if we are to

in all areas? There are many schemes, including on Merseyside, focused
on those highly skilled areas, such as ICT, engineering and aerospace,
and indeed we have Daresbury on Merseyside, but we also have a local
scheme in Liverpool that creates apprenticeships in our landscaping
services. There are lots of different sectors where young people can
play a vital role, develop skills and have employment right through
their lives. I was confused by the hon. Gentleman’s

apprenticeships at any price or at any standard. It is
no good just saying that we want more
apprenticeships; we want more proper apprenticeships that lead to
proper jobs and train people in a proper skill so that they can become
an expert. One of my concerns about the Bill is that some local
authorities might go through the motion and go back to where we were
before, with apprenticeships that are not of the level we would all
like to see just in order to tick some boxes. I know that that is not

hon. Gentleman is saying, but in many respects he has
“may” and “must” the wrong way around. If
the Bill stated that local authorities “may” do this if
they want to—rather than that they “must” and that
it is a requirement—but if they do the apprenticeships
“must” be of a very high standard, I would have a lot
more sympathy with it. It seems to me that he is saying that public
bodies must—I know that he disagrees, but this is how I read the
Bill—do this, but that the quality is an option rather than a
requirement. I therefore think that the bits that public bodies could
choose to do are the wrong way around, and there is no guarantee that
the apprenticeships would be of a high quality. He might like to
encourage them to be of a high quality, but his Bill does not require
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000126" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0001.htm#13110151000126"><B><Member ContinuationText="Andrew Gwynne" PimsId="4785" UID="13110151000663" xid="827" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0001.htm#13110151000663">Andrew

but the Government reneged on their promise when it went to the other

previous private Member’s Bill in the 2009-10 Session—the
Debt Relief (Developing Countries) Bill, which became the Debt Relief
(Developing Countries) Act 2010—had a 12-month sunset clause
inserted in Committee. In fact, it was his Government who, after 12
months of enactment of that very laudable Act, decided that it had

am big supporter of small businesses, not just in my constituency but
across the country. They generate much of the wealth in this country
and will generate much of the future growth in the UK economy. One of
my concerns regarding small businesses is that there is already an
awful lot of red tape and rules surrounding public procurement
contracts. I genuinely worry that the Bill would not help small
businesses to get some of these public procurement contracts but might
in fact hinder their chances of doing so. Let me give the House a
flavour of this. In preparation for the debate, I had a look at the
procurement rules and standard conditions of contracts and supply of
services of my local authority, which is Bradford
council—unfortunately, but there it is. The first thing I came
across was a 30-page document about how somebody goes about applying
for a contract at Bradford council and what is expected of them. It is
a combination of the blindingly obvious and other things I cannot
really see the point of, but it is all set out in great detail for
everybody to go through exactly what they have to do.</hs_Para>

businesses have navigated their way through the 30-page document and
got their lawyers and solicitors to pore over exactly what some of the
conditions mean, they then have to go through the obligatory equality
and diversity document, which runs to another 13 pages, whereby they
have to set out all sorts of information about any complaints they have
had, any findings against 
<?notus-xml column=1220?>them in the past three years, and whether they have been the subject of
formal investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission. That
seems a bizarre requirement, because it does not ask whether it has
been found in breach of anything by the Equality and Human Rights
Commission but whether it has been investigated by it. If it has been
investigated and found to have a clean bill of health, it seems a bit
rough that it still has to declare something that may rule it out of
getting a contract. There are also forms to fill in and nine parts of a
thing that people have to answer.</hs_Para>

hon. Gentleman probably thinks that that is great and we should be
encouraging local authorities to go through it all. In fact, he clearly
thinks it is so great that he wants to add further things to the public
procurement rules and regulations. No doubt when all these businesses
are bidding for their contracts they will have to say how many
apprentices they are going to take on and what the standard is going to
be. All this is just to bid for a contract; there is no guarantee that
they are going to get it. Any small business would have to take on the
costs of going through all this preparation. The more we pile on to
these contracts in the application process, the more we ensure that no
small business will ever get any of them.</hs_Para>

I am on a roll, he might think about increasing the size of contract to
which the Bill would apply. Many small businesses would very much like
to get their hands on £1 million contracts from public bodies.

concerned about this because of what happened in Bradford council. A
report was produced that showed a major lack of skills and expertise

its suppliers. Bradford council spends about £350 million a year
with outside suppliers and holds more than 1,500 contracts. The
council’s corporate overview and scrutiny committee revealed a
major skills shortage not among the people who were doing the contracts
but among the staff who buy the goods and services and commission the
works from the suppliers. It seems to me that, occasionally, the staff,
who are already trying to juggle all these documents in order to get
the best deal, are just not up to the job. I do not see how asking them
to consider something else as part of the public procurement process

agree with that. If we want to ensure that as many people as possible
take up apprenticeships, we must focus on making them of a high quality
so that people can see that they mean something, that they deliver
something worth while and that people who have done them go on to
fulfil their potential. If that is delivered, the numbers will follow,
because businesses and young people will see the benefit. We do not

wonder how the apprenticeship requirements would be enforced by local
authorities. If a local authority requires a business to take on a
certain number of apprentices, that could lead to unintended
consequences. The contractor might be unable to fulfil the commitment
because of unforeseen circumstances. The local area might not have the
calibre of people they are looking for or there might not be enough
people who want to go down the right avenue. Somebody might start an
apprenticeship and then drop out. Where would we go from there? Would
the contract be scrapped mid-flow because the person was no longer
taking the apprenticeship? Would other companies sue the council
because they lost the contract not on the basis of cost, but on the
basis of apprenticeships and the apprentices have dropped out midway
through the contract? There could be all sorts of legal ramifications
if local authorities make this something that companies must
consider<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T11:27:13"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

danger is that if apprenticeships become an important focus for a
public body in its procurement, it will become the focus of the bids. A
company will increase the price that it is charging in order to take on
x number of apprentices and will get the contract on that basis. The
price that is charged to the taxpayer will therefore be higher than it
otherwise would have been. The problem of overpaying for contracts in

who take on an apprentice report benefits to their business, which is
absolutely fantastic. One reason why that figure is so high is that
employers take on apprentices for all the right reasons. They get the
right person and can see what the benefit to their business will be. My
fear is that if the Bill were passed, they would take on apprentices
for the wrong reason—simply to win a contract rather than to
bring genuine benefit to their

statistic on the website is that 72% of businesses report improved
productivity as a result of employing an apprentice. Again, that is

stimulate people to think about taking on an apprentice and seeing the
benefits that will flow to their organisation. However, there has to be
a bottom-up approach, and the top-down approach encouraged by the Bill
would not help those fantastic statistics. It is surely better that
employers take on an apprentice because they want one rather than take
one on grudgingly because they feel they have
to.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000219" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0001.htm#13110151000219">You

want to reflect on. How does he intend to ensure that the quality of
apprenticeships being offered is maintained? Who in a public body that
was giving a contract would be responsible for ensuring that the
company concerned had taken apprentices on, that they were doing
something worth while and that the apprentices had not dropped out
halfway through? It cannot be down to the national apprenticeship
scheme alone. Presumably, the public body that is giving the contract

Gentleman envisage a situation in which the number of apprenticeships
that need to be taken on is pro rata to the size of the contract? For
example, if there is a £1 million contract, the expectation
might be that the contractor takes on at least one apprentice; if there
is a £2 million contract, the expectation is of two
apprenticeships; and if it is £5 million, there will be five
apprentices; and so on. Perhaps the contract will be worth £10
billion—it could be the contract for high-speed rail. Is he
saying that it is fine if that contractor takes on only one apprentice
because it ticks the box, or does he believe that the value of the
contract should be reflected in the number of
apprentices taken on? I would be interested to know his views on
that.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000221" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0001.htm#13110151000221">How
big a factor should apprentices be when deciding whether to give
somebody a contract? How much should other value to the taxpayer, such
as the price, be taken into account? Somebody might bid £1

somebody else who offers no apprentices bids £500,000 for the
contract. What weight is given to the apprentices in that situation?
Who does the public body give the contract to in that situation? How
important is taking on the apprenticeships the hon. Gentleman wants to
deliver in the overall contract? I would rather the public body gave
the contract to the £500,000 bidder, because that gives the best
value to the taxpayer, but he might have a different solution. I wonder

protection does the hon. Gentleman envisage in contracts for existing

many apprentices, and pays for it by getting rid of existing staff?
Surely we do not want a situation in which somebody gets rid of
existing staff to ensure that they hit the target. I am sure that that
would not go down well with the trade unions, which he mentioned. What
protection does he envisage for existing staff to ensure that they are

result of a contract? Suppose a massive company bids for a contract
that is only a small bit of its pie—it might take on 100
apprentices in the course of its business, irrespective of the
contract. When it bids for the contract, it might say,
“We’ll bid £1 million for the contract
and, by the way, take on 100 apprentices.” Who is to say whether
the taking on of those apprentices is linked to the contract? How would
the hon. Gentleman ensure that the apprentice who is taken on is linked
to the contract? I do not see how that is possible. That is another way

want to say to my hon. Friend and those who are interested in
supporting the Bill that apprenticeships are important for my
constituents, who appreciate how much difference a completed
apprenticeship can make to their employment chances. We need a strong
skills infrastructure and a high proportion of our young people
participating in higher education, or gaining an advanced
apprenticeship or equivalent technician-level qualification. That is
one point of agreement among hon. Members this morning—we all
support the more advanced apprenticeships that can take people to a
higher level of training.</hs_Para>

at the benefits to those who take on apprenticeships. The Richard
review of apprenticeships found that apprenticeships deliver
substantial wage and employment benefits over the learner’s
lifetime. It found that, in fact, an advanced apprenticeship delivers
wage returns of 22% and employment returns of 14%. The person who
achieves an apprenticeship can therefore earn 22% more than similar
individuals who have not completed one. In addition, completed
apprenticeships continue to deliver those strong earnings and
employment returns for seven years post-completion. On the point from
the hon. Member for Shipley (Philip Davies),
completing<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T11:48:18"></hs_TimeCode> an

agreed with the point my hon. Friend made earlier about long-term
unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, being high in Salford
and my constituency, as it is in his. In my constituency—only a
part of Salford—we have almost 3,000 jobseekers, of whom 900 are
unemployed young people and 390 are over-25s who have been unemployed
for two years or more. In fact, the number of people who have been
unemployed for two years or more has risen this summer by 34%. I hear
from young people, week in, week out—as I am sure do other hon.
Members—about how over one or two years of unemployment they can
start to lose hope. I get some really desperate appeals for help and
support from them.</hs_Para>

previous Labour Government’s offer was that by 2015 there would
be an apprenticeship for every 16 or 17-year-old who wanted one and was
suitably qualified. We should keep that in our minds, because
obviously, with the economic difficulties in recent years, we do not
want 16 and 17-year-olds who are not in education, employment or
training to lose hope, and I think they could do so. Worryingly, the
number of apprenticeship starts for under-19s has fallen by 20,000 from
132,000, in 2010-11, to 112,000 last year. That is a dismal record.
Youth unemployment remains stubbornly high, yet the number of
apprenticeship starts for that age group have fallen. That is
pathetic.</hs_Para>

Members, in particular, have spoken about the difficulties of small
employers taking on apprentices. You might be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker,
that I took on an apprentice in my constituency some years ago. She was
a 17-year-old who had started her business administration
apprenticeship in a bakery, but was interested in working in an
MP’s office. She was an excellent staff member and completed her
apprenticeship, becoming one of the highest-achieving apprentices the
college had ever worked with. In her early 20s, she is now a county
councillor serving part of your constituency, Mr Deputy Speaker. We
can, therefore, support apprenticeships. It is an interesting

part. Like all employers, we must offer training. What is more, having
a 17-year-old working with us really revitalised my office. I was

worried that only 37 apprenticeships in Salford were available on the

Salford city council is doing an excellent job providing support for
apprentices and apprenticeships through Salford Futures, an employment
initiative that has been running since April 2012. It, like the earlier
example from Tameside, provides support to unemployed Salford residents
through the provision of work experience placements and pre-employment
training and support. It also encourages local employers to create and
develop employment opportunities through the provision of grants,
funding and wider business support. I have managed to link up employers

and public authorities to use the leverage of the money that they
already spend on public procurement—this is not additional
funding—to promote skills training and provide new
apprenticeship opportunities. We need those in Salford. According to
the latest monthly 
<?notus-xml column=1234?>figures, we have a core of 3,000 unemployed people, including nearly
1,000 young people, and that preys on my mind.</hs_Para>

hope that my hon. Friend is heartened by the example that I gave from
Salford, but it is clear that many more apprenticeships could be
created if the Government backed his Bill. Recently, we have had
contracts let by public authorities without any local advertising of
job vacancies or any commitment to provide apprenticeships and skills
training, and that is a real missed opportunity. My hon. Friend talked
about the new schools completed through Building Schools for the
Future, but I had contractors complaining to me as our new schools were
being built that they did not feel it offered them opportunities
locally. We have had new buildings at Salford Royal hospital, and the
BBC and ITV have moved to Salford Quays. The BBC has done quite an
amount, as a publicly funded body—it is not a public authority
and so the Bill would not strictly apply to it—to take on more
apprentices. The BBC has said that, being the name it is, people apply
from all over the country, whereas I know that what it wants to do, now
that it is based at Salford Quays, is try to take on local young
people. Having the vacancies advertised in the local jobcentres would
help with that.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T12:00:35"></hs_TimeCode>So a number of
opportunities have been happening in Salford, but we still have fewer
than 50 apprenticeship vacancies advertised on the national
apprenticeships website. I should say that four of those are with the
BBC in Salford, whereas 20 are with the BBC in London, so we are still
not forging ahead as much as we should.</hs_Para>

go back to the fact that we have 3,000 jobseekers in my constituency,
with 900 young people unemployed and 390 over-25s who have been
unemployed for two years or more. I think about that group of
unemployed young people. I want them to have the opportunities of an
apprenticeship and the benefits that can bring: higher wages straight
away; higher wages over the period of seven years; and more chances of
employment. We need the extra apprenticeships that could come through
the measures in the Bill and I very much commend it to the Minister and
to all hon. Members here
today.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_01_PT_1/BDDA7E4B83F18AB1D6F8B5A6ED892A79FBCC4F21" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="1 November 2013">Friday

some of the excellent practices going on around the country.

hon. Member for Denton and Reddish (Andrew Gwynne), my near neighbour
in Greater Manchester, made an interesting opening speech. When there
are no explanatory notes to a Bill, as is the case with this
one—I certainly was not given any by the Vote Office—I
always rely on the opening speech to clarify some of the issues. It
probably says more about me than it does 
<?notus-xml column=1235?>about the hon. Gentleman, but I was a little more concerned and
mystified by some of the Bill’s provisions after I had heard his
speech, and the explanations he gave in response to some of the
interventions, than when I read it in my office over the past couple of
days.</hs_Para>

Gentleman <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T12:04:18"></hs_TimeCode>has a
touching, perhaps naive belief in the Government’s ability to
create jobs and to do so through direction and the inclusion of certain
provisions in contract clauses. He mentioned the 50:50 scheme, and I
understand, if I heard correctly, that that scheme was run by his local
authority, which paid £1,000 for each apprentice. I am not sure
whether the number of apprenticeships was limited or unlimited, but of
course there is already a Government scheme, the apprenticeship grant
for employers—AGE—scheme. I am sure he will be familiar
with the scheme, which provides £1,500 to small
businesses.</hs_Para>

AGE scheme, which applies specifically to young people aged 16 to 24,
was announced in November 2011 and launched in February 2012, and was
designed to encourage more small businesses to take on apprentices and
to encourage young apprentices to raise their skill
levels<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T12:05:40"></hs_TimeCode>. It pays
£1,500 to every small business that takes on a young apprentice
if the firm has never hired an apprentice before and if it has 1,000 or
fewer employees when it takes the apprentice on. It is very much geared
towards small and medium-sized enterprises, and the employer cannot
claim more than 10 grants. Perhaps the hon. Gentleman’s local
authority got the idea of giving a cash sweetener to local employers

point has emerged which goes to the heart of the Bill: is it mandatory,
compulsory or merely permissive? That question is at the core of my

that the Bill is purely permissive but, frankly, that is not the
purpose of legislation. Local authorities and public bodies already
have the freedom to do what the Bill proposes. Indeed, we have heard
many examples already of good practice. Where appropriate, public
bodies have encouraged—I would not want it to go any further
than that—contractors to take on

against

The phrase “beyond all reasonable doubt” is commonly used

prosecution must prove their case beyond all reasonable doubt. As has
been made clear, there may be some instances where local authorities,
for whatever reason, are not doing what some other

has been suggested that the Bill’s definition of

cover a period of not a month or six months but three or five years. A
micro-company, which is defined as one with fewer than 10 employees,
could easily bid for such a contract, so it is simply not the case that
the £1 million threshold means that the Bill will cover only the

at that website, which is really user-friendly. A few days ago, the
Government finished consulting on how to make it even more
user-friendly, and I hope we will hear about that from the Minister.
The website is excellent, and users can filter contracts by type and
financial value. As a matter of interest, because of the £1
million threshold specified in the Bill, I typed in
“construction” and filtered the results to contracts of
more than £1 million, and 304 contracts were

so over the rest of their working lives. I have met many companies that

out, the point is that not everyone is doing something that is
particularly important for our nation at this juncture. I cannot stress
that enough. It breaks my heart every time I meet an unemployed young
person—indeed, anyone who is unemployed—or a person who
needs to re-skill because opportunities no longer exist in the area
where that person used to work. We need to do everything we can,
proactively, to ensure that examples of good practice such as Liverpool
city council—  
<?notus-xml column=1248?>and I celebrate everything that that council is doing—are not
just one-offs, but can be seen across the board. That is not happening

mentioned Liverpool’s investment plan for schools. It has also
launched a pre-apprenticeship programme, because it acknowledges that
it is hard for a young person who is not in employment, education or
training even to get on to the first rung of the ladder. In partnership
with City of Liverpool college, it is offering a 24-week programme to
16 and 17-year-olds who wish to gain valuable skills and enhance their
employability so that they can join the full apprenticeship programme.

skills in the office, and is a valuable member of our team. He is a

today—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T13:09:44"></hs_TimeCode>
Minister of State, Cabinet Office, the hon. Member for Ruislip,
Northwood and Pinner (Mr Hurd)—as he is a decent and good man.
He and I sat here for many Friday mornings putting the Sustainable
Communities Bill through the House. I hesitate to suggest, because I
realise that I might be damning his career badly by this, that he truly
does understand this kind of soft regeneration issue. If one took the
Sustainable Communities Bill down to its last detail, one could have
argued that it was not necessary 
<?notus-xml column=1249?>because we could have done all the things in it without having to pass
legislation. However, it was an empowering Bill and it meant a lot to
the third sector. So my argument is that not only is this Bill a good
one in its own right, but it follows the trajectory taken by the
Minister in his own private Member’s Bill that was passed under
the previous Government. I therefore have a lot of faith that his
response will be hopeful and positive, and will allow this Bill to
progress to the next stages, to allow my hon. Friend the Member for

moved out, taking with them their skills and spending power. That,

that it was outrageous that some of the other, bigger businesses in the

apprentices, and yet when a young person finished their apprenticeship,

thinking of the short term or cutting employment rights and training
opportunities in a race to the bottom, but on well-paid, secure and
skilled jobs. That is how Britain can pay its way in the world in the
21st century—with an emphasis on a high-skilled, well trained
work force. To help achieve that objective, we need a skills system
that meets the needs of our country, our society, the economy,
employers and young people. My hon. Friend’s Bill would provide
that and be central to having a good, resilient, productive and

hon. Friend rightly said that in many ways, the previous Government
helped to revalue apprenticeships. There were something like 65,000
apprenticeships when the Government came into office in 1997, and when
we 
<?notus-xml column=1261?>left office in 2010—I was the Minister responsible  for
apprenticeships at that time—there were 240,000.  The
current Government have carried on that good work
to some extent, and I want one characteristic of apprenticeships to be
that they transcend party politics and Parliaments and work in the
long-term interests of what this country needs. It is clear that we
need good, strong
apprenticeships<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:02:32"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000461" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000461">As
my hon. Friend said, even in these financially straitened times, it
makes common sense, economic sense and social sense, when both central
and local government spend money—often billions of
pounds—for skills and training opportunities to be provided when
contracts are granted. He mentioned the 50:50 scheme in his
constituency, which particularly interested me, and other hon. Members
have mentioned similar schemes.

apprenticeships had been put in place through Liverpool city council,
and we heard about other initiatives. In an excellent speech,
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:03:18"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for West Ham (Lyn Brown) talked about what is going on in
London<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:03:23"></hs_TimeCode>. Of
course, in programmes such as Crossrail, Building Schools for the
Future and so on, Labour established the idea of procurement as a lever

remains a huge issue to consider. Although the number of
apprenticeships has gone up, I am particularly concerned about the
statistics on under-19-year-olds. In 2011-12, there were 129,900
apprenticeship starts by those aged under 19, but that represented a
1.4% decrease year on year. There were 95,400 intermediate-level
apprenticeship starts, which was a 2% decrease. We fail our young
people if we do not get them a good first step on the career ladder,
and we all know about the crisis of youth unemployment that this
country still has. In the quarter June to August 2013, 958,000 young
people aged 16 to 24 were unemployed, making an unemployment rate of
20%—up by 0.1% on the previous quarter and 0.5% on the same
period last year. The unemployment rate for 18 to 24-year-olds is
19.1%, but what really concerns me—it is linked with the decline
in apprenticeship starts for under-19s—is that the unemployment
rate for 16 to 17-year-olds is 36.3%. That should be a national
scandal.</hs_Para>

memories of going to Salford as Minister with responsibility for
apprenticeships. We had launched the apprenticeships grant for
employers. I met a tree surgeons firm in her constituency—I do
not know whether she remembers. It could not afford to take on a young
person, but we provided a £2,500 grant. I thought it was to help
to pay the wages of that young apprentice, but it provided the
equipment to allow them to scale up the tree and do the work required.
That small firm wanted to help to bring on young people and to ensure
that it gave young people a chance, making a difference—as I

hon. Friend the Member for Denton and Reddish was right to highlight
the importance of driving up quality. However, he also mentioned the
need to expand opportunity. Often, we do not tell young people of the
difference apprenticeships can make. People will be paid more over the
lifetime of their career if they become apprentices. I am therefore
baffled by the debate on clause 2, which is on the advertisement of
work force vacancies. When there are opportunities, we should
communicate them as much as possible. That is a no-brainer. Where
better to do so than in the jobcentre? Clause 2 is essential. I want
the Bill to pass on Second Reading, but, in Committee, we need to widen

Gentleman <hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:18:47"></hs_TimeCode>spoke

the Bill is extremely well-intentioned.
My<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:17:57"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Harlow (Robert Halfon) spoke to me personally about his
support 
<?notus-xml column=1265?>for it. We have taken it very seriously, and the context could not be
more important. It is shocking that we as a country are wasting the
potential of a million young people.

and anger.</hs_Para>

country faces a huge challenge. I am not making a party-political point
when I say that the fact that youth unemployment rose by 40% under the
last Administration during good times is a source of real concern, and
raises serious doubts about the skills and work-readiness of our young
people. That has been reflected in survey after survey of employers.
The fundamental question is this: how can we ensure that our young
people benefit from the gradual recovery in the jobs market? That is a
national challenge, and should be seen as such. It is a challenge not
just for my party, the Labour party or any other party in the House,
but for the private sector, the education system and civil society. So
many people care about it that it is a challenge for funders such as
the Big Lottery Fund and its Talent Match. So much good will needs to
be harnessed to move the needle.
That<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:19:32"></hs_TimeCode> is why the
whole debate about academic standards, access to informal learning
opportunities for young people—I speak as the Minister for
youth<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:19:23"></hs_TimeCode>—the
quality of career guidance and the success of new traineeships, which I
greatly welcome, is so important. But the fundamental point of this
debate—our level of ambition on the status and  priority
attached to apprenticeships—is important. It is fundamental,
because there has been a missed opportunity; the status of
apprenticeships has been too low over time, particularly as they are a
win-win—the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:19:53"></hs_TimeCode>
hon. Member for Worsley and Eccles South (Barbara Keeley) spoke well
about that. The evidence is clear that apprenticeships are good for
employers, as well as for employees. The evidence shows that those on
advanced apprenticeships earn, on average, between £77,000 and
£117,000 more over their lifetime, and 72% of employers reported
that apprenticeships improved the productivity of their
organisation<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:20:22"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para>

bodies to say to contractors, “We expect there to be a

hon. Member for West Ham. I wish to give
the<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:21:10"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Member
for Denton and Reddish some reassurance, not least because of the
reservations we have about the need for this particular law, that the
ambition he seeks on apprenticeships already exists. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:21:24"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Bury North mentioned, this very week the Prime Minister
was in Oxford talking about our ambition to be the best in the world.
The hon. Gentleman will know that given the fiscal constraints we are
under, what we choose to spend our money on does reflect our
priorities. The fact of the matter is that we have spent £5.7
billion on apprenticeships 
<?notus-xml column=1266?>since 2010; we have grown them by 1.5 million; and in 2012-13 the
current provisional estimate is for about 500,000 apprenticeships. That
is building on work that has gone before, but let us be clear: that is
double what was available in 2008-09. As
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:22:06"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Shipley said, it is not just about numbers and growth;
robust quality is also

Gwynne:</Member></B> The Minister is right to say that this is about
how we spend the money. That is true of not only central Government,
but other public bodies, so does it not empower local government, which
does not provide many services directly itself but buys in services
from contractors, if it is able to say, “This is what we expect
because these are our budgets that we are handing over to you as
contractors, and this is what we want in

wish to finish making my point about quality. It is important, and we
have put statutory standards in place to ensure that apprenticeships
are real jobs and lead to recognised qualifications. I hope that that
enjoys the support of the House. We want this to be employer-led. We
want to encourage employers because it is absolutely in their
interests, and that is how we sustain the momentum behind this as
Governments come and go. That is why we have introduced incentive
payments of £1,500 for smaller employers, because the attitude
of small and medium-sized enterprises is important, to take on up to 10
new apprentices aged 16 to 24. As we have announced this week in the
implementation plan, there will be trailblazer projects in the
aerospace, automotive, digital industries, energy and utilities,
electrotechnical, financial services, food and drink, manufacturing and
life sciences and industrial sciences sectors. I hope I have convinced

the Public Services (Social Value) Act 2012, extended that permission.
The Act, which came into force in January with cross-party support,
places a requirement on commissioners to consider the economic,
environmental and social benefits of their approaches to procurement
before the process starts. They must also consider whether they should
consult on these
issues<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:27:36"></hs_TimeCode>. I put it
to the hon. Gentleman that that process, with which contracting
authorities around the country, particularly Liverpool and Birmingham,
are very engaged, could include consideration of the benefits of any
potential apprenticeships to be created under the contract. That is
another tool in the box for those who are seeking to develop
intelligent models of procurement and trying to squeeze as much value
as possible out of every public pound that they are spending. That is
exactly what we are trying to
encourage<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:27:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000497" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000497"><B><Member ContinuationText="Lyn Brown" PimsId="4752" UID="13110151000851" xid="905" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000851">Lyn

one-person companies, the sole traders, the freelancers. We also tend
to debate more often those issues that affect existing businesses,
rather than those that are yet to exist. Today, I want to focus on how
we can get more people to see running their own business as a viable

am not particularly talking about business people with a family history
of self-employment or entrepreneurialism, nor am I talking about those
who have friends to call on for free advice. The debate today is to
give voice to people who have set up a business against all the odds,
from scratch. Is there more we can do to help them grow their business?
Vitally, are we confident that the target audience for any help is
actually aware of the assistance that is available? A
little-appreciated fact is that the vast majority of UK businesses
currently employ no one at
all.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000509" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000509">For<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:32:59"></hs_TimeCode>
some, that makes sense. Not everyone needs an employee for their
business model to work, but for others there are barriers in the way to
taking on a first employee who could help a business to grow. I would
like to look at what those barriers are now, acknowledge the progress
that is being made in tackling them and then suggest possible areas for
further action—most notably in improving how we get the message
across that support is out there for everyone, not just for those with
family and friends with business experience. I am keen for children in
schools in Macclesfield—and across the country—to believe
that one day they can run a business and employ people if they want to,
and that a Government will be there to help them, advise them and
support them—not stifle their ambition and get in their
way.</hs_Para>

us<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:33:48"></hs_TimeCode> start with
the facts. The latest figures from the Office for National Statistics
confirm that we are experiencing record self-employment: 4.2 million
people work for themselves—some 14% of all those in employment.
At the moment, self-employment is more common for men and for older
people, but the dynamics are changing. The number of women in
self-employment is rising fast. 
<?notus-xml column=1270?>In Macclesfield, the percentage of women in self-employment is the
highest in the north-west, and the number of young people across the
country who want to set up their own business is high. One survey
suggests that up to 70% have at least the ambition to set up their own
enterprise, while the Prince’s Trust has found that up to 30% of
young people actively expect to be self-employed.</hs_Para>

news. We need more first-time entrepreneurs, but we should be enabling
those entrepreneurs, wherever possible, to take a step into what is
often the unknown and become first-time employers too. Despite
enthusiasm for being in business—we are currently enjoying a
record number of businesses in the UK—relatively few take on an
employee. The longer a sole trader is in business, the less likely they
are to want to take someone on. The British Chambers of Commerce found
that sole traders who have been operating for less than six months have
far greater ambitions to take on staff than those who have been
operating for more than two years. Why are these early hopes dashed?
Why are their initial aspirations being
dampened?</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000512" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000512">There
was a time when it was unusual for people to have their own home or to
own shares, until right to buy and public utility share offers made
those steps into the unknown massively easier to take. The aim of those
initiatives was not merely to shift ownership from public sector to
private sector, but to shift ownership to a wider part of the
population than had previously enjoyed it. Many of the people who
bought their council house or took part in the utility share
subscriptions had no family history of holding such property. They did
not have friends who could tell them how to go about it. The success of
the sales, though, showed that the ambition was there, but something
had held people back, be it the tangible issue of cash or the
intangible psychological and perhaps cultural issues that can act as a
barrier to realising
aspirations.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000513" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000513">Some
75% of businesses currently employ no one beyond their owner. That is
not to say that none of them hires freelance or agency services, such
as an accountant or marketing campaigners, but 75% do not have a
payroll of their own. It is not a step that their owners have taken,
but if they did, it would lead to yet lower unemployment. In the light
of this, David Frost of the British Chambers of Commerce has said that
the key questions are: how many of these companies are interested in
employing people, how do we identify them, and how we can encourage
them to take the huge leap needed to become an
employer?</hs_Para><hs_brev UID="13110151000594" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000594">“The

is indeed a leap, as I discovered recently when, with the help of the
Federation of Small Businesses, I conducted a straw poll on social
media asking what prevents entrepreneurs from taking on that vital
first member of staff. Respondents suggested a number of barriers that
can loosely be grouped, as I suggested a moment ago, as psychological
or tangible. I had respondents who specifically used the word
“fear”—“Fear of getting some minor issue
wrong and being taken to the cleaners by the employee, fear I will get
sued, fear I have to pay maternity leave when I can hardly afford to
stay afloat, fear of all the legislation that is pro-employee and 
<?notus-xml column=1271?>against employers” and so on. There is also frequent use of
negative terms: “overwhelmed”, “crippling”,
“uncertain”, “totally
confusing”.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000516" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000516">The
sources of fear, among many, were being sued for breaches of employment
law and, for some, the prospect of dealing with Her Majesty’s
Revenue and Customs. It turns out that the British Chambers of Commerce
found similar real and perceived barriers in a far more detailed survey
of sole traders in 2011. It seems that more needs to be done to show
potential employers what HMRC and other public bodies can do to help
new businesses, or signpost other sources of help, such as Citizens
Advice, not least the East Cheshire citizens advice bureau, which
tweeted to me on this very subject. There are also excellent courses
available from local chambers, such as the Macclesfield chamber of
commerce, which I have been fortunate enough to attend. Support is
available from websites such as

Lord Green has pointed out about UK Trade &amp; Investment, and Lord
Young has highlighted about Government business services in general,
the problem is not that the support is not there but that the target
businesses often do not know about it or do not feel it worthwhile
trying to find it. I have been told that there are over 100 public
sector websites providing bits and pieces that will help in setting up
a business. Surely a more focused message would be a better approach
and improve the prospects of
success<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:38:54"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000518" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000518">Respondents,
both to me and to the BCC survey, raised the cost of regulations, red
tape and restrictions. There is a feeling that time is money, and that
the opportunity cost of the time required for performing an
employer’s duties could actually cause a business to shrink, not
grow. Respondents mentioned a raft of issues that concern them, and the
BCC has called for exemptions for the smallest businesses from such
requirements. I recognise that complete exemption is probably asking
too much but, as with workplace pensions, perhaps there is scope to
allow the smallest businesses significant lead times in complying with
regulations through phased implementation. Some commentators have also
pointed to the possibility of extending the current three-year
micro-business moratorium on new regulation and making it a three-year
rolling moratorium with potential opt-ins. This would be important for
new businesses and particularly for potential new employers going
forward.</hs_Para>

employment allowance of £2,000 will clearly be a big boost,
slashing or eliminating the national insurance liability of a business
taking on a first employee. Similarly helpful is the Government's
deregulatory commitment to "one in, two out". We need to be clear:
regulations designed to protect people in employment should not be so
onerous that they cause potential employers to shut off the option of
providing employment. Deregulation at the EU level is the next step
forward, and I welcome the Prime Minister's commitment to that through
his business
taskforce<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:39:59"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000520" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000520">There
is more work to do, but it is worth reminding ourselves that real
enthusiasm exists about the prospect of being able to hire an employee
if—I emphasise “if”—barriers are removed.
The will is there, if not always the ability—perceived or real.
So, what else could be done? One option is exploring "de-risking"
measures more fully. The Institute for Public Policy Research and the
FSB are examining several ideas to 
<?notus-xml column=1272?>de-risk the hiring process for small firms, including the idea of
appointing intermediary bodies to support employment. Instead of the
small business bearing the whole risk, these bodies would directly
employ the individual and place them with a host business, effectively
leaving small businesses to provide work and pay wages. As the Minister
will know, this model is already being used by apprenticeship training
academies, and it could be extended to other categories of employee,
such as the long-term unemployed, for defined time
periods<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:41:20"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000521" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000521">Apprenticeships

respondents suggested that small businesses can, and of course do,
utilise freelancers instead of employees. This may well be a solution
for a number of businesses, but the fact that a business says it has
taken on a freelancer understandably does not always mean that Her
Majesty’s Revenue and Customs will agree. If HMRC believes a
business has actually taken on an employee, it will clearly want to
take action. Some businesses feel that there could be greater certainty

Minister will know that Lord Young has urged the Government to bang
more of their own drums. Where there is help available, it should be
communicated as effectively as possible to potential employers. The
signposts for those who are thinking of taking on staff need clearly to
say "straight ahead", rather than "diversion ahead" or "no entry". An
engaging communications campaign could help. It should signpost the
help and how-to guides on offer. It could be as simple as a leaflet in
the next HMRC mailing; it could be a higher-profile campaign, such as
"I'm in" for workplace pensions. It is good to see that HMRC has been
moving in this direction recently. There is a new video on YouTube
detailing what needs to be done to become a first-time employer. It is
a useful video, but it has been watched fewer than 300 times. We now
need to help more businesses know that it and other advice is
available<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:43:57"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000526" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000526">But
this not just about public bodies. We should recognise the importance
of business-to-business communications too. The work of websites such
as that of smarta or the banks that provide small business advice needs
to be encouraged. We should more fully engage with business about how
best to communicate to 
<?notus-xml column=1273?>business and create one-stop shops for would-be employers. There is some
very good practice: the FSB, for example, provides a 24-hour helpline
to business, with guaranteed advice, from just £120 a
year<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:44:29"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000527" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000527">Enthusiasm
clearly does exist about the prospect of being able to hire an employee
in many micro-businesses. The FSB recently found that small-business
confidence is at a record high, and there are clear ambitions to take
on staff—if barriers are removed. The will to set up is there,
the will to employ is there. There are, as I have highlighted, options
for further action. We now owe it to the tradition of progressive
Conservatives to redouble our efforts to ensure that the will finds a
way. The Minister, I know, is a great torchbearer for this tradition,
and I look forward to hearing his
response.</hs_Para></Body></Fragment><?date 2013-11-01?><Fragment __lock__="0" __shareable__="false" __uri__="/files/documents/default/HOC/2013_2014/DailyParts/2013_11_01_PT_1/FC122F8FE5B471EDA9D830AF933438AD5360D0DE" __version__="1.3"><Header><House>0</House><System>0</System><Sitting short-date="1 November 2013">Friday

I congratulate
my<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:45:11"></hs_TimeCode> hon. Friend
the Member for Macclesfield (David Rutley) on bringing this important
subject to the House’s attention. May I also say how much I
appreciate the opportunity to work with him on the challenges facing
AstraZeneca in his constituency? He has worked incredibly hard to
secure a strong and vigorous future for the Alderley Park site, and he
knows that the Government will work with him on that to ensure that his
constituency remains a successful and vibrant centre of
enterprise<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:45:51"></hs_TimeCode>.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000529" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000529">That
leads me to small businesses, which are indeed vital to our economy. We
want more people to start a business and more businesses to grow, and
taking on the first employee is a vital step in growing a business. Let
me explain some of the ways we are supporting small businesses. We are
improving their access to finance, lowering their tax burden and
ensuring that business support is simpler, more joined-up and easier to
access. Those are the challenges my hon. Friend has just set us, and
they are absolutely the right ones for us to
tackle.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000530" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000530">We
can see the progress that has been made already
in<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:46:29"></hs_TimeCode> my hon.
Friend’s constituency. From May 2010 to September 2013 there
were over 1,200 business start-ups in Macclesfield, and 330 in the 12
months to September 2013. In fact, the start-up rate for the Cheshire
East local authority area in the 12 months to September 2013 was higher
than that for both the north-west and Great Britain as a
whole.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000531" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000531">As
my hon. Friend said,
one<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:47:01"></hs_TimeCode> of the big
challenges facing start-ups is employing staff for the first time. Let
me set out what we are doing to help businesses meet that challenge.
Often what people worry about in business is the complexity of what
they have to do and the fear of getting it wrong. There are all the
words we are familiar with: the “burden” of red tape, the
“minefield” of regulation and the
“barriers” they face as they try to grow and, in
particular, take on their first employee. That is why we are committed
to making the regulatory experience for business a better one. We are
reducing the number of new regulations being introduced through the
one-in, two-out rule. We are tackling the existing stock of regulations
through the red tape challenge, which has identified over 3,500
regulations for reform, with almost 2,000 to be scrapped or reduced. We
have introduced a small and micro-business assessment, which 
<?notus-xml column=1274?>builds on the micro-business moratorium, to which my hon. Friend
referred, providing exemption from new regulation for businesses with
up to 50 staff if there is any evidence that they will result in
disproportionate burdens that could impede growth.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110151000532" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000532">I think that
business<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:48:26"></hs_TimeCode> is
starting to feel the benefit of those initiatives. The FSB’s
“Voice of Small Business” survey has reported a reduction
in the burden of regulation felt by its members. Some 20% reported that
regulation was a barrier to growth in 2012, but this year the figure
had reduced to 17%. Its members also felt that regulatory costs are
reducing, with 21% stating that regulatory costs were a burden in 2012,
down to 18% this year. Although we are moving in the right direction,
the perception of the burden of regulation remains high, and my hon.
Friend made some important points about communicating what we are
doing.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110151000533" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000533">Let me turn
briefly to employment law. We know that bad regulation can harm
businesses and that the fear of regulation, even though it is often
misplaced, can damage growth. That is why we launched the employment
law review at the start of this Parliament. It has taken a systematic
approach to testing our employment laws, addressing misconceptions and
tackling real barriers to ensure that our labour market is flexible,
effective and fair.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110151000534" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000534">Our
employment law reforms are starting to make a difference for employers.
A 2012 CBI-Harvey Nash employment trends survey stated that there had
been  a 10 percentage-point improvement in perceptions of
employment law since 2011. Our reforms cover the whole
lifecycle—from taking on a person, to managing a work force, to
letting people go.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110151000535" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000535">We have
increased the qualifying period of unfair dismissal from one to two
years, as employers told us that they needed more time to make sure
that they had made the right hiring decision. We also recognised
business concerns about employment tribunals, so we sought to dispel
myths about them. We have introduced fees to employment tribunals and
streamlined the process, including judges sitting alone in unfair
dismissal cases.</hs_Para>

however, that getting the rules right is not enough on its own;
employers need to understand them. Last year, we launched a simple
online tool to help first-time employers understand minimum legal
requirements when they take someone on. In referring to the online
tool, I am aware of my hon. Friend’s remark that there were 100
Government or Government-related sites where such information was
available. Through the Government’s excellent gov.uk initiative,
we are trying to make the process far simpler, with a big reduction in
the number of dispersed sites with separate access and different types
of
data.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000537" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000537">The
“Employing staff for the first time” tool sets out the
six things employers need to do when employing staff for the first
time: how much to pay someone; how to check whether someone has the
legal right to work in the UK; how to carry out a criminal records
check; insuring oneself as an employer; advising employees on their
terms and conditions; and registering with Her Majesty’s Revenue
and Customs. Each should be a straightforward and simple process. The
tool currently gets about 11,000 visits a month. It is highly rated in
terms of user engagement and we will continue to promote it.</hs_Para>

measures to support businesses taking on staff. They are important to
reduce cost and make tax simpler. Again, we have put measures in place.
We have increased the employer national insurance contributions
threshold by £21 a week above indexation. That returns more than
£3 billion a year to employers, including the micro-businesses
to which my hon. Friend referred. As a result, all employers are now
£150 a year better off for each employee earning above the
threshold.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000539" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000539">From
April 2014, every business will be entitled to a £2,000
employment allowance to reduce their employer national insurance
contributions bill each year. That will support businesses that aspire
to grow by hiring their first employee or by expanding their work
force. I am confident that my hon. Friend, like many Government
Members—and, I hope, Opposition Members—will be actively
promoting that important measure when it comes into force in April next
year.</hs_Para>
<hs_Para UID="13110151000540" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000540">The allowance
will be very simple for businesses, which will only need to confirm
their eligibility through the usual payroll process. Up to 1.25 million
employers—one third of all employers—will benefit, with
around 450,000 taken out of paying employer NICs altogether. More than
90% of the benefit of the allowance goes to small businesses with fewer
than 50
employees.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000541" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000541">We
have continued to simplify the tax system overall and made a commitment
in the autumn statement 2012 to a target to reduce the annual cost to
business of tax administration by £250 million by the end of the
spending review period. Since April 2013, all unincorporated businesses
have had the option to use cash basis accounting to calculate their tax
liability. They will also be able to use the flat rates to calculate
some types of expenses if they wish, rather than having to calculate
actual amounts.
<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:55:00"></hs_TimeCode>It is estimated
that up to 3 million businesses will be able to benefit from this
simplification.</hs_Para><hs_Para UID="13110151000542" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/debtext/131101-0002.htm#13110151000542">HMRC<hs_TimeCode time="2013-11-01T14:54:30"></hs_TimeCode>
has taken steps to support small and medium-sized enterprises that need
help in getting their tax affairs right. SME error and failure to take
reasonable care contributes just under £6 billion a year to the
tax gap. HMRC is increasing its educational support by tailoring and
targeting its initiatives at key business lifecycle points, and SMEs
can now manage their contact details and view tax liabilities and
payments all in one place.</hs_Para>

brought to the House. I am pleased to say that the
Government are already doing what he proposes on
apprenticeship-sharing, although he would like to go even further. We
have introduced apprenticeship training agencies so that small
employers who are unable to commit to the full term of an
apprenticeship are still able to take part in the apprenticeship
programme. ATAs act as the employer and place the apprentices with host
small and micro-businesses. This approach of group trading associations

on in opposition. I well recall the work with

ownership. These were the reasons for conducting the bad bank review,
which I commissioned in June. The publication of RBS’s new
direction and the announcement of an internal bad bank today follows
the conclusion of that review.</hs_Para>

has advised the Government that tackling RBS’s wider
issues—the coherence of its strategy and the profitability of
its “core” businesses—is as important for meeting
the Government’s objectives as tackling its poor-performing
legacy assets. It also advised that the new strategy announced by RBS
should over time address many of the bank’s challenges and areas
of investor concern, which in the longer term should be reflected in an
improved valuation and improve the prospects for an earlier return of
RBS ownership to the private

I am publishing the outcome of a consultation on subject content for
new GCSEs in English literature, English language and mathematics,
which will be taught in schools from September 2015. I have prioritised
English and mathematics because they are both fundamental to
facilitating learning in other subjects, and yet the programme for
international student assessment (PISA) evidence demonstrates that
15-year-olds in nine other countries are, on average, at least half a
year 
<?notus-xml column=63?>ahead of students in England in both reading and mathematics. Reform of
these key subjects is, therefore, a matter of pressing
urgency.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110149000025" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/wmstext/131101m0001.htm#13110149000025">The
new mathematics GCSE will demand deeper and broader mathematical
understanding. It will provide all students with greater coverage of
key areas such as ratio, proportion and rates of change and require
them to apply their knowledge and reasoning to provide clear
mathematical arguments. It will focus on ensuring that every student
masters the fundamental mathematics that is required for further
education and future careers. It will provide greater challenge for the
most able students by thoroughly testing their understanding of the
mathematical knowledge needed for higher-level study and careers in
mathematics, the sciences and
computing.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110149000026" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/wmstext/131101m0001.htm#13110149000026">The
new mathematics GCSE will be more demanding and we anticipate that
schools will want to increase the time spent teaching mathematics. On
average secondary schools in England spend only 116 hours per year
teaching mathematics, which international studies show is far less time
than that spent on this vital subject by our competitors. Just one
extra lesson each week would put England closer to countries like
Australia or Singapore who teach 143 and 138 hours a year of
mathematics respectively. We announced on 14 October that mathematics,
alongside English, will be double weighted in secondary school
performance measures from 2016. This will also provide a strong
incentive for schools to ensure that they are strengthening their
mathematics
provision.</hs_Para><hs_Para Justify="left" UID="13110149000027" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/wmstext/131101m0001.htm#13110149000027">My
ambition is that the great majority of students should continue to
study mathematics, post-16, by 2020. All students without a grade C or
above will continue to study mathematics post-16. New high quality
“Core maths” qualifications will be introduced from 2015
for students who have passed GCSE, and want to continue to improve the
mathematics skills they need for further education and work, but do not
wish to take a full AS or A level. The new GCSEs will provide a firm

will ensure that students can read fluently and write effectively, and

draught-proofing; increased use of automated meters on gas and

deployments we have worked with a number of governments, including in
Bosnia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Mali and Kosovo to help

Baker:</Member></B> Licensing hours are determined by
licensing authorities under the Licensing Act 2003. Pubs which already
have a licence to open late will be able to open as they currently do.
Premises which wish to open longer during the World Cup can apply for
an extension using a Temporary Event Notice (TEN) on 
<?notus-xml column=633?>which local police and environmental health authorities also have a say.
This Government has already legislated to reform the TENs system
including extending their flexibility. The Home Secretary has the power
to make a national provision to extend licensing hours to mark
occasions of exceptional international, national or local significance,
as happened for the Diamond Jubilee
celebrations.</hs_Para><hs_8Question UID="13110152000065" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/text/131101w0001.htm#13110152000065">Passports:

to applicants born on or before 2 September 1929. That date recognises
those who were 16 or over at the time the second world war ended. The

3½% but also to nearly 20%. As the International Atomic Energy
Agency's most recent report on the Iranian nuclear programme makes
clear, Iran has a growing stockpile of uranium enriched to nearly 20%,
which it is enriching in defiance of United Nations Security Council
Resolutions. This brings Iran closer to the day when it will have
sufficient stocks to further enrich this material to weapons-grade and
produce a nuclear device, should it so choose. The next round of talks
on Iran's nuclear programme will take place 7-8 November 2013 in
Geneva. We hope negotiations will lead soon to concrete steps to
address international concerns regarding Iran's nuclear
programme.</hs_Para>

The index is used to compare how many more deaths occur in winter
months than non-winter months, expressed as a percentage. It allows for
analysis of trends over a period of time and for comparison of areas
where there is a large variation in population. For example, as seen in
Table 1, in 2010/11,15.6% more deaths occurred in the winter months in
Barrow and Furness than in the non-winter months, this is a decrease
from 19.7% in 2009/10.</hs_TableFooter><hs_TableFooter>2. The number of
excess winter deaths for local areas is relatively small (generally
less than 400 deaths). Calculations based on small numbers of events
are often subject to random fluctuations, and excess winter deaths for
local areas tend to be quite variable from one year to the

Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), carried out in April each
year, is the most comprehensive source of information on hours and
earnings in the United Kingdom. The ASHE is used to produce estimates
in respect of employees on adult rates of pay, whose earnings for the
survey pay period were not affected by absence. For methodological
reasons ASHE cannot be used to estimate the number of workers who work
less than 24 hours per week, but can be used to estimate the
corresponding proportion of employee jobs (jobs held by employees and
not including the
self-employed).</hs_brev><hs_brev UID="13110153000132" tab="yes" url="/pa/cm201314/cmhansrd/cm131101/text/131101w0002.htm#13110153000132">In
April 2012, the latest period for which results are available, ASHE
shows that the proportion of all employee jobs in the UK in which the
employee worked less than 24 hours in total was 20.8 per

Jobs’ include a UK level estimate that there were 27.82m
employee jobs at March 2012, we estimate that there were 5.79m
employee jobs in which the employee worked less than 24
